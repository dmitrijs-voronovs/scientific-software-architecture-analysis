Below there's a list of some dependencies, but your project could; have more, or this document could be outdated. You'll see the errors; while linking as an indication of that. Debian based distros have a way to add ``multiarch``, which adds; a new architecture and allows you to install packages for those; systems. See https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO for more info. But not all distros will have that, and possibly not an easy way to; install them in any anyway, so you'll have to build/download; them separately. A quick way of getting the libraries is to download them from; a distribution repository, like Debian (http://packages.debian.org/jessie/),; and download the missing libraries. Note that the ``libXXX``; will have the shared objects (``.so``) and the ``libXXX-dev`` will; give you the headers and the static (``.a``) library. Just in; case, download both. The ones you need for ARM are: ``libtinfo``, ``zlib1g``,; ``libxml2`` and ``liblzma``. In the Debian repository you'll; find downloads for all architectures. After you download and unpack all ``.deb`` packages, copy all; ``.so`` and ``.a`` to a directory, make the appropriate; symbolic links (if necessary), and add the relevant ``-L``; and ``-I`` paths to ``-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` above.

Retained out parameters,; identified using LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). In such cases a retained object is written into an out parameter, which the caller has then to release in order to avoid a leak. These two cases are simple - but in practice a functions returning an out-parameter usually also return a return code, and then an out parameter may or may not be written, which conditionally depends on the exit code, e.g.:. bool maybeCreateObject(LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED OSObject **obj);. For such functions, the usual semantics is that an object is written into on ""success"", and not written into on ""failure"".; For LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED we assume the following definition of; success:; For functions returning OSReturn or IOReturn; (any typedef to kern_return_t) success is defined as having an output of zero (kIOReturnSuccess is zero).; For all others, success is non-zero (e.g. non-nullptr for pointers); 3.

C++ does a static dispatch at compile time based on the argument types.; The dispatch is a selection among overloads (incl. templates) visible at the; current parse location in the *translation unit*.; Bound C++ in Python does a dynamic dispatch: it considers all overloads; visible *globally* at the time of execution.; These two approaches, even if completely in line with the expectations of the; respective languages, are fundamentally different and there can thus be; discrepancies in overload selection.; For example, if overloads live in different header files and are only an; implicit conversion apart; or if types that have no direct equivalent in; Python, such as e.g. ``unsigned short``, are used. It is implicitly assumed that the Python code is correct as-written and there; are no warnings or errors for overloads that C++ would consider ambiguous,; but only if every possible overload fails.; For example, the following overload would be ambiguous in C++ (the value; provided is an integer, but can not be passed through a 4-byte ``int`` type),; but instead ``cppyy`` silently accepts promotion to ``double``:. .. code-block:: python. >>> cppyy.cppdef(r""""""\; ... void process_data(double) { std::cerr << ""processing double\n""; }; ... void process_data(int32_t) { std::cerr << ""processing int\n""; }""""""); True; >>> cppyy.gbl.process_data(2**32) # too large for int32_t type; processing double; >>>. There are two rounds to run-time overload resolution.; The first round considers all overloads in sorted order, with promotion but; no implicit conversion allowed.; The sorting is based on priority scores of each overload.; Higher priority is given to overloads with argument types that can be; promoted or align better with Python types.; E.g. ``int`` is preferred over ``double`` and ``double`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/functions.rst:6219,error,errors,6219,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/functions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/functions.rst,1,['error'],['errors']

It is also; encouraged to report issues if users find false positive ODR violations or false negative ODR; violations with the flag enabled. ABI Impacts; -----------. The declarations in a module unit which are not in the global module fragment have new linkage names. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. export module M;; namespace NS {; export int foo();; }. The linkage name of ``NS::foo()`` would be ``_ZN2NSW1M3fooEv``.; This couldn't be demangled by previous versions of the debugger or demangler.; As of LLVM 15.x, users can utilize ``llvm-cxxfilt`` to demangle this:. .. code-block:: console. $ llvm-cxxfilt _ZN2NSW1M3fooEv. The result would be ``NS::foo@M()``, which reads as ``NS::foo()`` in module ``M``. The ABI implies that we can't declare something in a module unit and define it in a non-module unit (or vice-versa),; as this would result in linking errors. If we still want to implement declarations within the compatible ABI in module unit,; we can use the language-linkage specifier. Since the declarations in the language-linkage specifier; is attached to the global module fragments. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. export module M;; namespace NS {; export extern ""C++"" int foo();; }. Now the linkage name of ``NS::foo()`` will be ``_ZN2NS3fooEv``. Performance Tips; ----------------. Reduce duplications; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. While it is legal to have duplicated declarations in the global module fragments; of different module units, it is not free for clang to deal with the duplicated; declarations. In other word, for a translation unit, it will compile slower if the; translation unit itself and its importing module units contains a lot duplicated; declarations.

The resource manager is responsible for selecting resource; units that are consumed by instructions. For example, if an instruction; consumes 1cy of a resource group, the resource manager selects one of the; available units from the group; by default, the resource manager uses a; round-robin selector to guarantee that resource usage is uniformly distributed; between all units of a group. :program:`llvm-mca`'s scheduler internally groups instructions into three sets:. * WaitSet: a set of instructions whose operands are not ready.; * ReadySet: a set of instructions ready to execute.; * IssuedSet: a set of instructions executing.

The AST reader then maps these ""local"" ID numbers into a ""global""; ID number space for the current translation unit, providing a 1-1 mapping; between entities (in whatever AST file they inhabit) and global ID numbers.; If that translation unit is then serialized into an AST file, this mapping; will be stored for use when the AST file is imported. Declaration merging; It is possible for a given entity (from the language's perspective) to be; declared multiple times in different places. For example, two different; headers can have the declaration of ``printf`` or could forward-declare; ``struct stat``. If each of those headers is included in a module, and some; third party imports both of those modules, there is a potentially serious; problem: name lookup for ``printf`` or ``struct stat`` will find both; declarations, but the AST nodes are unrelated. This would result in a; compilation error, due to an ambiguity in name lookup. Therefore, the AST; reader performs declaration merging according to the appropriate language; semantics, ensuring that the two disjoint declarations are merged into a; single redeclaration chain (with a common canonical declaration), so that it; is as if one of the headers had been included before the other. Name Visibility; Modules allow certain names that occur during module creation to be ""hidden"",; so that they are not part of the public interface of the module and are not; visible to its clients.

The 3D Viewer Architecture provides a common mechanism for viewer; clients to publish 3D objects to it. It enables:. - Decoupling of producers (geometry packages etc) who model collection; of 3D objects from consumers (viewers) which display them. - Producer code free of explicit drawing commands & viewer specific; branching. - Support differing viewers and clients capabilities, e.g. - Mix of native (in viewer) shapes and generic client side; tessellation. - Local/global frame object description. - Bounding boxes. - Placing copies sharing common geometry (logical/physical shapes). The architecture consists of:. - **`TVirtualViewer3D`** interface: An abstract handle to the viewer,; allowing client to add objects, test preferences etc. - **`TBuffer3D`** class hierarchy: Used to describe 3D objects; (""shapes"") - filled /added by negotiation with viewer via; **`TVirtualViewer3D`**.

In C++11, the explicit declaration of a move constructor or a move; assignment operator within a class deletes the implicit declaration; of the copy constructor and copy assignment operator. This change came; fairly late in the C++11 standardization process, so early; implementations of C++11 (including Clang before 3.0, GCC before 4.7,; and Visual Studio 2010) do not implement this rule, leading them to; accept this ill-formed code:. struct X {; X(X&&); // deletes implicit copy constructor:; // X(const X&) = delete;; };. void f(X x);; void g(X x) {; f(x); // error: X has a deleted copy constructor; }. This affects some early C++11 code, including Boost's popular shared_ptr; up to version 1.47.0. The fix for Boost's shared_ptr is; available here. Objective-C++ compatibility. Implicit downcasts. Due to a bug in its implementation, GCC allows implicit downcasts; of Objective-C pointers (from a base class to a derived class) when; calling functions. Such code is inherently unsafe, since the object; might not actually be an instance of the derived class, and is; rejected by Clang. For example, given this code:. @interface Base @end; @interface Derived : Base @end. void f(Derived *p);; void g(Base *p) {; f(p);; }.

To prevent this unsafety,; ``-fbounds-safety`` provides the annotation ``__single`` that causes pointer; arithmetic on annotated pointers to be a compile time error. * ``__single`` : indicates that the pointer is either pointing to a single; object or null. Hence, pointers with ``__single`` do not permit pointer; arithmetic nor being subscripted with a non-zero index. Dereferencing a; ``__single`` pointer is allowed but it requires a null check. Upper and lower; bounds checks are not required because the ``__single`` pointer should point; to a valid object unless it's null. ``__single`` is the default annotation for ABI-visible pointers. This; gives strong security guarantees in that these pointers cannot be incremented or; decremented unless they have an explicit, overriding bounds annotation that can; be used to verify the safety of the operation. The compiler issues an error when; a ``__single`` pointer is utilized for pointer arithmetic or array access, as; these operations would immediately cause the pointer to exceed its bounds.; Consequently, this prompts programmers to provide sufficient bounds information; to pointers. In the following example, the pointer on parameter p is; single-by-default, and is employed for array access. As a result, the compiler; generates an error suggesting to add ``__counted_by`` to the pointer. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *p, unsigned count) {; for (unsigned i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; p[i] = i; // error; }; }.

In chapters 1 through 8, we've built a; decent little programming language with functions and variables.; What happens if something goes wrong though, how do you debug your; program?. Source level debugging uses formatted data that helps a debugger; translate from binary and the state of the machine back to the; source that the programmer wrote. In LLVM we generally use a format; called `DWARF <http://dwarfstd.org>`_. DWARF is a compact encoding; that represents types, source locations, and variable locations. The short summary of this chapter is that we'll go through the; various things you have to add to a programming language to; support debug info, and how you translate that into DWARF. Caveat: For now we can't debug via the JIT, so we'll need to compile; our program down to something small and standalone. As part of this; we'll make a few modifications to the running of the language and; how programs are compiled. This means that we'll have a source file; with a simple program written in Kaleidoscope rather than the; interactive JIT. It does involve a limitation that we can only; have one ""top level"" command at a time to reduce the number of; changes necessary. Here's the sample program we'll be compiling:. .. code-block:: python. def fib(x); if x < 3 then; 1; else; fib(x-1)+fib(x-2);. fib(10). Why is this a hard problem?; ===========================.

Developers often disagree, and erring on the side of the; developer asking for more review prevents any lingering disagreement over; code in the tree. This does not indicate any fault from the patch author,; this is inherent to our post-commit review practices.; Reverting a patch ensures that design discussions can happen without blocking; other development; it's entirely possible the patch will end up being reapplied; essentially as-is once concerns have been resolved. Before being recommitted, the patch generally should undergo further review.; The community member who identified the problem is expected to engage; actively in the review.

Availability,"elative errors of different parameters with respect to each other may; be meaningful.). If the $\sigma_i$ are all overestimated by a factor $\beta$, then the; resulting parameter errors from the fit will be overestimated by the; same factor $\beta$. ### The error matrix ###. The M processors $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (MnMigrad, see [api:migrad]) and; HESSE (MnHesse, see [api:hesse]) (normally) produce an error matrix.; This matrix is twice the inverse of the matrix of second derivatives of; the $\mbox{FCN}$, transformed if necessary into external coordinate; space[^2], and multiplied by FCNBase::up(). Therefore, errors based on; the M error matrix take account of all the parameter correlations, but; not the non-linearities. That is, from the error matrix alone,; two-standard-deviation errors are always exactly twice as big as; one-standard-deviation errors. When the error matrix has been calculated (for example by the successful; execution of $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (MnMigrad::operator(), see; [api:migradop]) or HESSE (MnHesse::operator())) then the parameter; errors printed by M are the square roots of the diagonal elements of; this matrix. The covariance or the correlations can be printed and shown; via std::cout as the ostream operator operator$<<$ is overloaded. The; eigenvalues of the error matrix can be calculated using MnEigen, which; should all be positive if the matrix is positive-definite (see below on; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ and positive-definiteness). The effect of correlations on the individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result. The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed.

The octopus merge is suboptimal for many cases, because walking back; through the history of one component leaves the other components fixed; at a history that likely makes things unbuildable. Some downstream users track the order commits were made to subprojects; with some kind of ""umbrella"" project that imports the project git; mirrors as submodules, similar to the multirepo umbrella proposed; above. Such an umbrella repository looks something like this::. UM1 ---- UM2 -- UM3 -- UM4 ---- UM5 ---- UM6 ---- UM7 ---- UM8 <- main; | | | | | | |; Lllvm1 Llld1 Lclang1 Lclang2 Lllvm2 Llld2 Lmyproj1. The vertical bars represent submodule updates to a particular local; commit in the project mirror. ``UM3`` in this case is a commit of; some local umbrella repository state that is not a submodule update,; perhaps a ``README`` or project build script update. Commit ``UM8``; updates a submodule of local project ``myproj``. The tool ``zip-downstream-fork.py`` at; https://github.com/greened/llvm-git-migration/tree/zip can be used to; convert the umbrella history into a monorepo-based history with; commits in the order implied by submodule updates::. U1 - U2 - U3 <- upstream/main; \ \ \; \ -----\--------------- local/zip--.; \ \ \ |; - Lllvm1 - Llld1 - UM3 - Lclang1 - Lclang2 - Lllvm2 - Llld2 - Lmyproj1 <-'. The ``U*`` commits represent upstream commits to the monorepo main; branch. Each submodule update in the local ``UM*`` commits brought in; a subproject tree at some local commit. The trees in the ``L*1``; commits represent merges from upstream. These result in edges from; the ``U*`` commits to their corresponding rewritten ``L*1`` commits.; The ``L*2`` commits did not do any merges from upstream. Note that the merge from ``U2`` to ``Lclang1`` appears redundant, but; if, say, ``U3`` changed some files in upstream clang, the ``Lclang1``; commit appearing after the ``Llld1`` commit would actually represent a; clang tree ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst:24875,down,downstream-fork,24875,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Proposals/GitHubMove.rst,1,['down'],['downstream-fork']

The frames are; deleted automatically when the editor is closed. Note: A deep cleanup is assumed for all frames put into the editor. This; implies:. - do not share the layout-hints among GUI components;. - do not delete child widgets in the destructor as this is done; automatically. #### Using Several Tabs. Sometimes you might need to use several tabs to organize properly your; class-editor. Each editor tab is a resource shared among all the; class-editors. Tabs must be created from the constructor of your; editor-class by using the method:. ``` {.cpp}; TGVerticalFrame* TGedFrame::CreateEditorTabSubFrame(const Text_t *name),; ```. It returns a pointer to a new tab container frame ready for use in your; class. If you need to hide/show this frame depending on the object's; status, you should store it in a data member. See for examples:; **`TH1Editor`**, **`TH2Editor`**. #### Base-Class Editors Control. Full control over base-class editors can be achieved by re-implementing; virtual method void `TGedFrame::ActivateBaseClassEditors(TClass` `*cl)`.; It is called during each compound editor rebuild and the default; implementation simply offers all base-classes to the publishing; mechanism. To prevent inclusion of a base-class into the compound editor, call:. ``` {.cpp}; void TGedEditor::ExcludeClassEditor(TClass* class, Bool_t recurse); ```. Pointer to the compound GED-editor is available in **`TGedFrame`**‘s; data-member:. ``` {.cpp}; TGedEditor *fGedEditor; ```. Ordering of base-class editor frames follows the order of the classes in; the class hierarchy. This order can be changed by modifying the value of; **`TGedFrame`**'s data member `Int_t fPriority`. The default value is; 50; smaller values move the frame towards to the top.

These values describe the initiation; requirements that have to be satisfied by the refactoring engine before the; provided action rule can be constructed and invoked. The next section; describes how these requirements are evaluated and lists all the possible; requirements that can be used to construct a refactoring action rule. Refactoring Action Rule Requirements; ------------------------------------. A refactoring action rule requirement is a value whose type derives from the; ``RefactoringActionRuleRequirement`` class. The type must define an; ``evaluate`` member function that returns a value of type ``Expected<...>``.; When a requirement value is used as an argument to; ``createRefactoringActionRule``, that value is evaluated during the initiation; of the action rule. The evaluated result is then passed to the rule's; constructor unless the evaluation produced an error. For example, the; ``DeleteSelectedRange`` sample rule that's defined in the previous section; will be evaluated using the following steps:. #. ``SourceRangeSelectionRequirement``'s ``evaluate`` member function will be; called first. It will return an ``Expected<SourceRange>``. #. If the return value is an error the initiation will fail and the error; will be reported to the client. Note that the client may not report the; error to the user. #. Otherwise the source range return value will be used to construct the; ``DeleteSelectedRange`` rule. The rule will then be invoked as the initiation; succeeded (all requirements were evaluated successfully). The same series of steps applies to any refactoring rule. Firstly, the engine; will evaluate all of the requirements. Then it will check if these requirements; are satisfied (they should not produce an error). Then it will construct the; rule and invoke it.

LLVM's API changes with each release, so users are likely to want, for example,; both LLVM-2.6 and LLVM-2.7 installed at the same time to support apps developed; against each. Compile Flags; =============. LLVM runs much more quickly when it's optimized and assertions are removed.; However, such a build is currently incompatible with users who build without; defining ``NDEBUG``, and the lack of assertions makes it hard to debug problems; in user code. We recommend allowing users to install both optimized and debug; versions of LLVM in parallel. The following configure flags are relevant:. ``--disable-assertions``; Builds LLVM with ``NDEBUG`` defined. Changes the LLVM ABI. Also available; by setting ``DISABLE_ASSERTIONS=0|1`` in ``make``'s environment. This; defaults to enabled regardless of the optimization setting, but it slows; things down. ``--enable-debug-symbols``; Builds LLVM with ``-g``. Also available by setting ``DEBUG_SYMBOLS=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to disabled when optimizing, so you; should turn it back on to let users debug their programs. ``--enable-optimized``; (For git checkouts) Builds LLVM with ``-O2`` and, by default, turns off; debug symbols. Also available by setting ``ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to enabled when not in a; checkout. C++ Features; ============. RTTI; LLVM disables RTTI by default. Add ``REQUIRES_RTTI=1`` to your environment; while running ``make`` to re-enable it. This will allow users to build with; RTTI enabled and still inherit from LLVM classes. Shared Library; ==============. Configure with ``--enable-shared`` to build; ``libLLVM-<major>.<minor>.(so|dylib)`` and link the tools against it.

Availability,"ement; -------------------------------------. Expressions and statements are one of the most fundamental constructs within a; compiler, because they interact with many different parts of the AST, semantic; analysis, and IR generation. Therefore, adding a new expression or statement; kind into Clang requires some care. The following list details the various; places in Clang where an expression or statement needs to be introduced, along; with patterns to follow to ensure that the new expression or statement works; well across all of the C languages. We focus on expressions, but statements; are similar. #. Introduce parsing actions into the parser. Recursive-descent parsing is; mostly self-explanatory, but there are a few things that are worth keeping; in mind:. * Keep as much source location information as possible! You'll want it later; to produce great diagnostics and support Clang's various features that map; between source code and the AST.; * Write tests for all of the ""bad"" parsing cases, to make sure your recovery; is good. If you have matched delimiters (e.g., parentheses, square; brackets, etc.), use ``Parser::BalancedDelimiterTracker`` to give nice; diagnostics when things go wrong. #. Introduce semantic analysis actions into ``Sema``. Semantic analysis should; always involve two functions: an ``ActOnXXX`` function that will be called; directly from the parser, and a ``BuildXXX`` function that performs the; actual semantic analysis and will (eventually!) build the AST node. It's; fairly common for the ``ActOnCXX`` function to do very little (often just; some minor translation from the parser's representation to ``Sema``'s; representation of the same thing), but the separation is still important:; C++ template instantiation, for example, should always call the ``BuildXXX``; variant.

Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.store``' intrinsics is designed for conditional writing of selected vector elements in a single IR operation. It is useful for targets that support vector masked store and allows vectorizing predicated basic blocks on these targets. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of branches that guard scalar store operations.; The result of this operation is equivalent to a load-modify-store sequence.

Masked Vector Gather and Scatter Intrinsics; -------------------------------------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for vector gather and scatter operations. They are similar to :ref:`Masked Vector Load and Store <int_mload_mstore>`, except they are designed for arbitrary memory accesses, rather than sequential memory accesses. Gather and scatter also employ a mask operand, which holds one bit per vector element, switching the associated vector lane on or off.

Such libraries are usually implemented in the ``llvm`` namespace and; follow the expected standard interface, when there is one.

For example, ``llvm::DenseMap`` should; almost always be used instead of ``std::map`` or ``std::unordered_map``, and; ``llvm::SmallVector`` should usually be used instead of ``std::vector``.

Possible other mathematical problems are the; following:. - Excessive numerical round off - be especially careful of; exponential and factorial functions which get big very quickly and; lose accuracy. - Starting too far from the solution - the function may have; unphysical local minima, especially at infinity in some variables. ## Minuit2 Package. `Minuit2` is a new object-oriented implementation, written in C++, of; the popular `MINUIT` minimization package. Compared with the; **`TMinuit`** class, which is a direct conversion from FORTRAN to C++,; `Minuit2` is a complete redesign and re-implementation of the package.; This new version provides all the functionality present in the old; FORTRAN version, with almost equivalent numerical accuracy and; computational performances.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:64080,error,error,64080,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['error'],['error']

The aim of all learning methods is to minimize the total error on a; set of weighted examples. The error is defined as the sum in quadrate,; divided by two, of the error on each individual output neuron. In all; methods implemented in this library, one needs to compute the first; derivative of that error with respect to the weights. Exploiting the; well-known properties of the derivative, one can express this; derivative as the product of the local partial derivative by the; weighted sum of the outputs derivatives (for a neuron) or as the; product of the input value with the local partial derivative of the; output neuron (for a synapse). This computation is called; ""back-propagation of the errors"". Six learning methods are; implemented. #### Stochastic Minimization. This is the most trivial learning method. The Robbins-Monro stochastic; approximation is applied to multilayer perceptrons. The weights are; updated after each example according to the formula:. $$; w_{ij}(t+1) = w_{ij}(t) + \Delta w_{ij}(t); $$. with:. $$; \Delta w_{ij}(t) = - \eta \left(; \frac{\partial e_p}{\partial w_{ij}} + \delta \right) +; \epsilon \Delta w_{ij}(t-1); $$. The parameters for this method are `Eta`, `EtaDecay`, `Delta` and; `Epsilon`. #### Steepest Descent With Fixed Step Size (Batch Learning). It is the same as the stochastic minimization, but the weights are; updated after considering all the examples, with the total derivative; `dEdw`. The parameters for this method are `Eta`, `EtaDecay`, `Delta`; and `Epsilon`. #### Steepest Descent Algorithm. Weights are set to the minimum along the line defined by the gradient.; The only parameter for this method is `Tau`.

Availability,"enabled re-use of LLVM as an; in-memory compiler by adding an in-memory link step to the end of the usual; compiler pipeline. Rather than dumping relocatable objects to disk as a compiler; usually would, MCJIT passed them to RuntimeDyld to be linked into a target; process. This approach to linking differs from standard *static* or *dynamic* linking:. A *static linker* takes one or more relocatable object files as input and links; them into an executable or dynamic library on disk. A *dynamic linker* applies relocations to executables and dynamic libraries that; have been loaded into memory. A *JIT linker* takes a single relocatable object file at a time and links it; into a target process, usually using a context object to allow the linked code; to resolve symbols in the target. RuntimeDyld; -----------. In order to keep RuntimeDyld's implementation simple MCJIT imposed some; restrictions on compiled code:. #. It had to use the Large code model, and often restricted available relocation; models in order to limit the kinds of relocations that had to be supported. #. It required strong linkage and default visibility on all symbols -- behavior; for other linkages/visibilities was not well defined. #. It constrained and/or prohibited the use of features requiring runtime; support, e.g. static initializers or thread local storage. As a result of these restrictions not all language features supported by LLVM; worked under MCJIT, and objects to be loaded under the JIT had to be compiled to; target it (precluding the use of precompiled code from other sources under the; JIT). RuntimeDyld also provided very limited visibility into the linking process; itself: Clients could access conservative estimates of section size; (RuntimeDyld bundled stub size and padding estimates into the section size; value) and the final relocated bytes, but could not access RuntimeDyld's; internal object representations.

In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute.

Quantile-quantile plots are used to determine if the dataset comes; from the specified theoretical distribution, such as normal. A qq-plot; draws quantiles of the dataset against quantiles of the specified; theoretical distribution. Note, that density, not CDF should be; specified a straight line, going through 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles could; also be plotted for reference. It represents a robust linear fit, not; sensitive to the extremes of the dataset. As in the two datasets case,; departures from straight line indicate departures from the specified; distribution.

Availability,"ent that functions have a unique address. The flag does not apply to explicit class template instantiation definitions or; declarations, as those are typically used to explicitly provide a single; definition in a DLL, (dllexported instantiation definition) or to signal that; the definition is available elsewhere (dllimport instantiation declaration). It; also doesn't apply to inline members with static local variables, to ensure; that the same instance of the variable is used inside and outside the DLL. Using this flag can cause problems when inline functions that would otherwise; be dllexported refer to internal symbols of a DLL. For example:. .. code-block:: c. void internal();. struct __declspec(dllimport) S {; void foo() { internal(); }; }. Normally, references to `S::foo()` would use the definition in the DLL from; which it was exported, and which presumably also has the definition of; `internal()`. However, when using ``/Zc:dllexportInlines-``, the inline; definition of `S::foo()` is used directly, resulting in a link error since; `internal()` is not available. Even worse, if there is an inline definition of; `internal()` containing a static local variable, we will now refer to a; different instance of that variable than in the DLL:. .. code-block:: c. inline int internal() { static int x; return x++; }. struct __declspec(dllimport) S {; int foo() { return internal(); }; }. This could lead to very subtle bugs. Using ``-fvisibility-inlines-hidden`` can; lead to the same issue. To avoid it in this case, make `S::foo()` or; `internal()` non-inline, or mark them `dllimport/dllexport` explicitly.

There are 10 options (all of; the names are inside the ``DeclarationName`` class). ``Identifier``. The name is a simple identifier. Use ``N.getAsIdentifierInfo()`` to retrieve; the corresponding ``IdentifierInfo*`` pointing to the actual identifier. ``ObjCZeroArgSelector``, ``ObjCOneArgSelector``, ``ObjCMultiArgSelector``.

Most users coming from a GUI will find these shortcuts convenient.; A list of the available key bindings is printed by; ```; root [] .help edit; ```. ## I/O Libraries. ### Faster reading from EOS. A new cross-protocol redirection has been added to allow files on EOS mounts to be opened; by `TFile::Open` via XRootD protocol rather than via FUSE when that is possible. The; redirection uses the `eos.url.xroot` extended file attribute that is present on files in EOS.; The attribute can be viewed with `getfattr -n eos.url.xroot [file]` on the command line.; When the URL passed into `TFile::Open` is a for a file on an EOS mount, the extended; attribute is used to attempt the redirection to XRootD protocol. If the redirection fails,; the file is opened using the plain file path as before. This feature is controlled by the; pre-existing configuration option `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` and is enabled by default.; It can be disabled by setting `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` to `0` in `rootrc`. ## TTree Libraries. ## RNTuple; ROOT's experimental successor of TTree has seen many updates durin",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md:7559,avail,available,7559,README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v628/index.md,1,['avail'],['available']

This process must be repeated for; every translation unit in the application, which involves a huge; amount of redundant work. In a project with *N* translation units; and *M* headers included in each translation unit, the compiler is; performing *M x N* work even though most of the *M* headers are; shared among multiple translation units. C++ is particularly bad,; because the compilation model for templates forces a huge amount of; code into headers. * **Fragility**: ``#include`` directives are treated as textual; inclusion by the preprocessor, and are therefore subject to any; active macro definitions at the time of inclusion. If any of the; active macro definitions happens to collide with a name in the; library, it can break the library API or cause compilation failures; in the library header itself. For an extreme example,; ``#define std ""The C++ Standard""`` and then include a standard; library header: the result is a horrific cascade of failures in the; C++ Standard Library's implementation. More subtle real-world; problems occur when the headers for two different libraries interact; due to macro collisions, and users are forced to reorder; ``#include`` directives or introduce ``#undef`` directives to break; the (unintended) dependency. * **Conventional workarounds**: C programmers have; adopted a number of conventions to work around the fragility of the; C preprocessor model. Include guards, for example, are required for; the vast majority of headers to ensure that multiple inclusion; doesn't break the compile.

This uses two fixed ranges of virtual addresses (the private and; local apertures), that are outside the range of addressible global memory, to; map from a flat address to a private or local address. FLAT instructions can take a flat address and access global, private (scratch); and group (LDS) memory depending on if the address is within one of the; aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and; setup in the kernel prologue (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`). Flat access to LDS requires; hardware aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register setup (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`). To convert between a segment address and a flat address the base address of the; apertures address can be used. For GFX7-GFX8 these are available in the; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-hsa-aql-queue` the address of which can be obtained with; Queue Ptr SGPR (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). For; GFX9-GFX11 the aperture base addresses are directly available as inline constant; registers ``SRC_SHARED_BASE/LIMIT`` and ``SRC_PRIVATE_BASE/LIMIT``.

External bounds annotations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ""External"" bounds annotations provide a way to express a relationship between a; pointer variable and another variable (or expression) containing the bounds; information of the pointer. In the following example, ``__counted_by(count)``; annotation expresses the bounds of parameter p using another parameter count.; This model works naturally with many C interfaces and structs because the bounds; of a pointer is often available adjacent to the pointer itself, e.g., at another; parameter of the same function prototype, or at another field of the same struct; declaration. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; // off-by-one error; for (size_t i = 0; i <= count; ++i); p[i] = i;; }. External bounds annotations include ``__counted_by``, ``__sized_by``, and; ``__ended_by``. These annotations do not change the pointer representation,; meaning they do not have ABI implications. * ``__counted_by(N)`` : The pointer points to memory that contains ``N``; elements of pointee type. ``N`` is an expression of integer type which can be; a simple reference to declaration, a constant including calls to constant; functions, or an arithmetic expression that does not have side effect.

Again the; EXEC register is used to select between active and inactive PC values. In order; to represent a vector of PC values, a way to create a composite location; description that is a vector of a single location is used. It may be possible to use existing DWARF to incrementally build the composite; location description, possibly using the DWARF operations for control flow to; create a loop. However, for the AMDGPU that would require loop iteration of 64.; A concern is that the resulting DWARF would have a significant size and would be; reasonably common as it is needed for every vector register that is spilled in a; function. AMDGPU can have up to 512 vector registers. Another concern is the; time taken to evaluate such non-trivial expressions repeatedly. To avoid these issues, a composite location description that can be created as a; masked select is proposed. In addition, an operation that creates a composite; location description that is a vector on another location description is needed.; These operations generate the composite location description using a single; DWARF operation that combines all lanes of the vector in one step. The DWARF; expression is more compact, and can be evaluated by a consumer far more; efficiently. An example that uses these operations is referenced in the; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-further-examples` appendix.

This allows the diagnostic to appear as many times as specified. For; example:. .. code-block:: c++. void f(); // expected-note 2 {{previous declaration is here}}.

In; the second example, the diagnostic must occur at least once. As a short-hand,; ""one or more"" can be specified simply by ``+``.

Availability,"er function support, HLSL also has a ``this`` keyword. The; ``this`` keyword is an example of one of the places where HLSL relies on; references in the AST, because ``this`` is a reference. Bitshifts; ---------. In deviation from C, HLSL bitshifts are defined to mask the shift count by the; size of the type. In DXC, the semantics of LLVM IR were altered to accommodate; this, in Clang we intend to generate the mask explicitly in the IR. In cases; where the shift value is constant, this will be constant folded appropriately,; in other cases we can clean it up in the DXIL target. Non-short Circuiting Logical Operators; --------------------------------------. In HLSL 2018 and earlier, HLSL supported logical operators (and the ternary; operator) on vector types. This behavior required that operators not short; circuit. The non-short circuiting behavior applies to all data types until HLSL; 2021. In HLSL 2021, logical and ternary operators do not support vector types; instead builtin functions ``and``, ``or`` and ``select`` are available, and; operators short circuit matching C behavior. Precise Qualifier; -----------------. HLSL has a ``precise`` qualifier that behaves unlike anything else in the C; language. The support for this qualifier in DXC is buggy, so our bar for; compatibility is low. The ``precise`` qualifier applies in the inverse direction from normal; qualifiers. Rather than signifying that the declaration containing ``precise``; qualifier be precise, it signifies that the operations contributing to the; declaration's value be ``precise``. Additionally, ``precise`` is a misnomer:; values attributed as ``precise`` comply with IEEE-754 floating point semantics,; and are prevented from optimizations which could decrease *or increase*; precision. Differences in Templates; ------------------------. HLSL uses templates to define builtin types and methods, but disallowed; user-defined templates until HLSL 2021. HLSL also allows omitting empty template; parameter lis",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:7937,avail,available,7937,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Any; parameter interaction of the user between two minimization steps will; make use of the result of the preceeding minimization in an optimal way.; The interface for parameters (see [api:parameters], [api:covariance] and; [api:state]) is forwardedin MnMigrad. ### Subsequent minimizations ###. M takes care that all information is treated in an optimal and correct; way if the user interacts with the parameters between two minimizations.; MnMigrad retains the result of the last minimization and uses this as; input for the next step. Between two minimization requests to MnMigrad; the user can fix or release parameters, put limits on them or remove; limits from them. Each instance of a MnMigrad object maintains its own; state and one can have multiple instances of MnMigrad objects. ### M fails to find a minimum ###. If M fails to find a minimum, the user is notified by a warning message; issued by M when running into troubles. Problems can be:. - a bug in M. - an error in the $\mbox{FCN}$. - a highly difficult problem (usually strong correlations among; parameters). - floating–point precision. ## The output from minimization ##. ### The FunctionMinimum ###.

In C++, type preservation includes retaining any qualification written into type names. For example, if we take a small snippet of code such as:. namespace services {; struct WebService { };; }; namespace myapp {; namespace servers {; struct Server { };; }; }. using namespace myapp;; void addHTTPService(servers::Server const &server, ::services::WebService const *http) {; server += http;; }. and then compile it, we see that Clang is both providing accurate information and is retaining the types as written by the user (e.g., ""servers::Server"", ""::services::WebService""):. $ clang -fsyntax-only t.cpp; t.cpp:9:10: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('servers::Server const' and '::services::WebService const *'); server += http;; ~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~.

Availability,"er), please feel free to provide that; feedback at any time. That having been said, if a substantial period of time has passed since the; original change was committed, it may be better to create a new patch to; address the issues than comment on the original commit. The original patch; author, for example, might no longer be an active contributor to the project. What Tools Are Used for Code Review?; ------------------------------------. Pre-commit code reviews are conducted on GitHub with Pull Requests. See; :ref:`GitHub <github-reviews>` documentation. When Is an RFC Required?; ------------------------. Some changes are too significant for just a code review. Changes that should; change the LLVM Language Reference (e.g., adding new target-independent; intrinsics), adding language extensions in Clang, and so on, require an RFC; (Request for Comment) email on the project's ``*-dev`` mailing list first. For; changes that promise significant impact on users and/or downstream code bases,; reviewers can request an RFC achieving consensus before proceeding with code; review. That having been said, posting initial patches can help with; discussions on an RFC. Code-Review Workflow; ====================. Code review can be an iterative process, which continues until the patch is; ready to be committed. Specifically, once a patch is sent out for review, it; needs an explicit approval before it is committed. Do not assume silent; approval, or solicit objections to a patch with a deadline.

That means that it is; possible to use push and pop around GCC compatible diagnostics and Clang; will push and pop them appropriately, while GCC will ignore the pushes; and pops as unknown pragmas. It should be noted that while Clang; supports the GCC pragma, Clang and GCC do not support the exact same set; of warnings, so even when using GCC compatible #pragmas there is no; guarantee that they will have identical behaviour on both compilers. In addition to controlling warnings and errors generated by the compiler, it is; possible to generate custom warning and error messages through the following; pragmas:. .. code-block:: c. // The following will produce warning messages; #pragma message ""some diagnostic message""; #pragma GCC warning ""TODO: replace deprecated feature"". // The following will produce an error message; #pragma GCC error ""Not supported"". These pragmas operate similarly to the ``#warning`` and ``#error`` preprocessor; directives, except that they may also be embedded into preprocessor macros via; the C99 ``_Pragma`` operator, for example:. .. code-block:: c. #define STR(X) #X; #define DEFER(M,...)

Here ``%x`` encodes an ELF Build ID. The Build ID should refer to a single; linked binary. The Build ID string is the sole way to identify the binary from; which this module was loaded. Example::. {{{module:1:libc.so:elf:83238ab56ba10497}}}. ``{{{mmap:%p:%i:...}}}``. This contextual element is used to give information about a particular region; in memory. ``%p`` is the starting address and ``%i`` gives the size in hex of the; region of memory. The ``...`` part can take different forms to give different; information about the specified region of memory. The allowed forms are the; following:. * ``load:%i:%s:%p``. This subelement informs the filter that a segment was loaded from a module.; The module is identified by its module ID ``%i``. The ``%s`` is one or more of; the letters 'r', 'w', and 'x' (in that order and in either upper or lower; case) to indicate this segment of memory is readable, writable, and/or; executable. The symbolizing filter can use this information to guess whether; an address is a likely code address or a likely data address in the given; module. The remaining ``%p`` gives the module relative address. For ELF files; the module relative address will be the ``p_vaddr`` of the associated program; header. For example if your module's executable segment has; ``p_vaddr=0x1000``, ``p_memsz=0x1234``, and was loaded at ``0x7acba69d5000``; then you need to subtract ``0x7acba69d4000`` from any address between; ``0x7acba69d5000`` and ``0x7acba69d6234`` to get the module relative address.; The starting address will usually have been rounded down to the active page; size, and the size rounded up.

In the LLVM project, we do all significant changes as a series of incremental; patches. We have a strong dislike for huge changes or long-term development; branches. Long-term development branches have a number of drawbacks:. #. Branches must have mainline merged into them periodically. If the branch; development and mainline development occur in the same pieces of code,; resolving merge conflicts can take a lot of time. #. Other people in the community tend to ignore work on branches. #. Huge changes (produced when a branch is merged back onto mainline) are; extremely difficult to `code review`_. #. Branches are not routinely tested by our nightly tester infrastructure. #. Changes developed as monolithic large changes often don't work until the; entire set of changes is done. Breaking it down into a set of smaller; changes increases the odds that any of the work will be committed to the main; repository. To address these problems, LLVM uses an incremental development style and we; require contributors to follow this practice when making a large/invasive; change. Some tips:. * Large/invasive changes usually have a number of secondary changes that are; required before the big change can be made (e.g. API cleanup, etc). These; sorts of changes can often be done before the major change is done,; independently of that work. * The remaining inter-related work should be decomposed into unrelated sets of; changes if possible. Once this is done, define the first increment and get; consensus on what the end goal of the change is. * Each change in the set can be stand alone (e.g. to fix a bug), or part of a; planned series of changes that works towards the development goal. * Each change should be kept as small as possible.

See section [answer:right-errors], *Getting the right; parameter errors with limits*.

Similarly, if there are only two; free parameters, use $\mbox{CONTOURS}$.

Usually materializers are just wrappers for compilers,; but they may also wrap a jit-linker directly (if the program representation; backing the definitions is an object file), or may even be a class that writes; bits directly into memory (for example, if the definitions are; stubs). Materialization is the blanket term for any actions (compiling, linking,; splatting bits, registering with runtimes, etc.) that are required to generate a; symbol definition that is safe to call or access. As each materializer completes its work it notifies the JITDylib, which in turn; notifies any query objects that are waiting on the newly materialized; definitions. Each query object maintains a count of the number of symbols that; it is still waiting on, and once this count reaches zero the query object calls; the query handler with a *SymbolMap* (a map of symbol names to addresses); describing the result.

Since it is an extension module, the usage of `PyROOT` probably comes; naturally if you're used to Python. In general, `PyROOT` attempts to; allow working in both Python and ROOT style, and although it is; succeeding, it isn't perfect: there are edges. The following sections; explain in some detail what you can expect, and what you need to watch; out for. #### Access to ROOT Classes. Before a ROOT class can be used from Python, its dictionary needs to be; loaded into the current process. Starting with ROOT version 4.00/06,; this happens automatically for all classes that are declared to the; auto-loading mechanism through so-called `rootmap` files. Effectively,; this means that all classes in the ROOT distributions are directly; available for import. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TCanvas # available at startup; c = TCanvas(). from ROOT import TLorentzVector # triggers auto-load of libPhysics; l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Although it is not recommended, a simple way of working with `PyROOT` is; doing a global import:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import *. c = TCanvas(); l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Keeping the ROOT namespace (""`import ROOT`""), or only importing from; ROOT those classes that you will actually use (see above), however, will; always be cleaner and clearer:. ``` {.cpp}; import ROOT. c = ROOT.TCanvas(); l = ROOT.TLorentzVector(); ```. Since it is foreseen that most people will use the simple approach; anyway, the request to copy all from module ROOT will not actually; result in copying all ROOT classes into the current namespace. Instead,; classes will still be bound (and possibly loaded) on an as-needed basis.; Note carefully how this is different from other Python",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:9743,avail,available,9743,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['avail'],['available']

The ``debugify`` testing utility is just a pair of passes: ``debugify`` and; ``check-debugify``. The first applies synthetic debug information to every instruction of the; module, and the second checks that this DI is still available after an; optimization has occurred, reporting any errors/warnings while doing so.

The test mask has the same format as the; second argument to the :ref:`llvm.is.fpclass <llvm.is.fpclass>`,; and indicates which classes of floating-point values are not; permitted for the value.

Availability,"es that Clang has; historically rejected. In order to parse widely distributed headers for; libraries such as the Active Template Library (ATL) and Windows Runtime Library; (WRL), some template rules have been relaxed or extended in Clang on Windows. The first major semantic difference is that MSVC appears to defer all parsing; an analysis of inline method bodies in class templates until instantiation; time. By default on Windows, Clang attempts to follow suit. This behavior is; controlled by the ``-fdelayed-template-parsing`` flag. While Clang delays; parsing of method bodies, it still parses the bodies *before* template argument; substitution, which is not what MSVC does. The following compatibility tweaks; are necessary to parse the template in those cases. MSVC allows some name lookup into dependent base classes. Even on other; platforms, this has been a `frequently asked question`_ for Clang users. A; dependent base class is a base class that depends on the value of a template; parameter. Clang cannot see any of the names inside dependent bases while it; is parsing your template, so the user is sometimes required to use the; ``typename`` keyword to assist the parser. On Windows, Clang attempts to; follow the normal lookup rules, but if lookup fails, it will assume that the; user intended to find the name in a dependent base. While parsing the; following program, Clang will recover as if the user had written the; commented-out code:. .. _frequently asked question:; https://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html#dep_lookup. .. code-block:: c++. template <typename T>; struct Foo : T {; void f() {; /*typename*/ T::UnknownType x = /*this->*/unknownMember;; }; };. After recovery, Clang warns the user that this code is non-standard and issues; a hint suggesting how to fix the problem. As of this writing, Clang is able to compile a simple ATL hello world; application. There are still issues parsing WRL headers for modern Windows 8; apps, but they should be addressed soon.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/MSVCCompatibility.rst:6374,recover,recover,6374,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/MSVCCompatibility.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/MSVCCompatibility.rst,2,['recover'],"['recover', 'recovery']"

We have seen that to specify a colour, some identifiers like kWhite,; kRed or kBlue can be specified for markers, lines, arrows etc. The; complete summary of colours is represented by the ROOT ""[colour; wheel](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTColor.html#C02)"".

Select; the most suited symbols for your plot among dots, triangles, crosses or; stars. An alternative set of names for the markers is available. ### Arrows and Lines. The macro line *55* shows how to define an arrow and draw it. The class; representing arrows is `TArrow`, which inherits from `TLine`. The; constructors of lines and arrows always contain the coordinates of the; endpoints. Arrows also foresee parameters to [specify; their](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTArrow.html) shapes.

Availability,"es. For example, when fitting a `k`-dimensional histogram,; the independent variables **`X`** are the bin center coordinates and `Y` is the bin weight. The model function needs to be expressed as function of some unknown parameters. The fitting will find the best parameter value to describe; the observed data. We can use the ROOT **`TF1`** class, the parametric function class, to describe the model function. However the `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` class, to be independent of the ROOT *`Hist`* library,; takes as input a more general parametric function object, the interface (abstract) class `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`, which describe a generic one or multi-dimensional function; with parameters. This interface extends the abstract class `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`, with methods to set/retrieve parameter values and to evaluate the function given the; independent vector of values **`X`** and vector of parameters `P`.; More information about the different `ROOT::Math` function interfaces is available in the Mathematical Library chapter. An end-user can convert a **`TF1`** object in a `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`, using the wrapper class `ROOT::Math::WrapperMultiTF1`:. ``` {.cpp}; TF1 * f1 = new TF1(""f1"",""gaus"");; ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1 fitFunction(f1, f1->GetNdim() );; ROOT::Fit::Fitter fitter;; fitter.SetFunction( fitFunction, false);; ```. When creating the wrapper, the parameter values stored in **`TF1`** will be copied in the `ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1` object.; The function object representing the model function is given to the `ROOT::Fitter` class using the `Fitter::SetFunction` method. The user has also the possibility to provide a function object, which implements the derivatives of the function with respect; to the parameters.; This information might be useful for some types of fits. In this case he needs to provide the function object as a class deriving from the; `ROOT::Math::IParametricGradFunctionMultiDim` interface.; Note th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:36566,avail,available,36566,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['avail'],['available']

In the ROOT distribution a library,; `libSmatrix` is produced with the C++ dictionary information for squared; and symmetric matrices and vectors up to dimension 7 and based on; **`Double_t`**, **`Float_t`** and **`Double32_t`**. The following; paragraphs describe the main characteristics of the matrix and vector; classes. More detailed information about the `SMatrix` classes API is; available in the; [online reference documentation](online reference documentation). ### Example: Vector Class (SVector). The template class **`ROOT::Math::SVector`** represents `n`-dimensional; vectors for objects of arbitrary type. This class has 2 template; parameters, which define at compile time, its properties: 1) type of the; contained elements (for example *float* or *double*); 2) size of the; vector. The use of this dictionary is mandatory if one want to use; `Smatrix` in Cling and with I/O. #### Creating a Vector. The following constructors are available to create a vector:. - Default constructor for a zero vector (all elements equal to zero). - Constructor (and assignment) from a vector expression, like; `v=p*q+w`. Due to the expression template technique, no temporary; objects are created in this operation. - Constructor by passing directly the elements. This is possible only; for vectors up to size 10. - Constructor from an iterator copying the data referred by the; iterator. It is possible to specify the *begin* and *end* of the; iterator or the *begin* and the *size*. Note that for the Vector the; iterator is not generic and must be of type `T*`, where `T` is the; type of the contained elements. In the following example we assume that we are using the namespace; **`ROOT::Math`**. ``` {.cpp}; //create an empty vector of size 3 ( v[0]=v[1]=v[2]=0); SVector<double,3> v;; double d[3] = {1,2,3};; SVector<double,3> v(d,3); //create a vector from a C array; ```. #### Accessing and Setting Methods.

The; driving force is the fact that we use C and C++ daily, and have to suffer due to; a lack of good tools available for it. We believe that the C and C++ tools; ecosystem has been significantly limited by how difficult it is to parse and; represent the source code for these languages, and we aim to rectify this; problem in clang.; The problem with this goal is that different clients have very different; requirements. Consider code generation, for example: a simple front-end that; parses for code generation must analyze the code for validity and emit code; in some intermediate form to pass off to a optimizer or backend. Because; validity analysis and code generation can largely be done on the fly, there is; not hard requirement that the front-end actually build up a full AST for all; the expressions and statements in the code. TCC and GCC are examples of; compilers that either build no real AST (in the former case) or build a stripped; down and simplified AST (in the later case) because they focus primarily on; codegen.; On the opposite side of the spectrum, some clients (like refactoring) want; highly detailed information about the original source code and want a complete; AST to describe it with. Refactoring wants to have information about macro; expansions, the location of every paren expression '(((x)))' vs 'x', full; position information, and much more. Further, refactoring wants to look; across the whole program to ensure that it is making transformations; that are safe. Making this efficient and getting this right requires a; significant amount of engineering and algorithmic work that simply are; unnecessary for a simple static compiler.; The beauty of the clang approach is that it does not restrict how you use it.; In particular, it is possible to use the clang preprocessor and parser to build; an extremely quick and light-weight on-the-fly code generator (similar to TCC); that does not build an ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html:7454,down,down,7454,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,1,['down'],['down']

That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------.

In the first case, the call to; ``V.size()`` is only useful for the assert, and we don't want it executed when; assertions are disabled. Code like this should move the call into the assert; itself. In the second case, the side effects of the call must happen whether; the assert is enabled or not. In this case, the value should be cast to void to; disable the warning. To be specific, it is preferred to write the code like; this:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(V.size() > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value); (void)NewToSet;; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. Do Not Use ``using namespace std``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In LLVM, we prefer to explicitly prefix all identifiers from the standard; namespace with an ""``std::``"" prefix, rather than rely on ""``using namespace; std;``"". In header files, adding a ``'using namespace XXX'`` directive pollutes the; namespace of any source file that ``#include``\s the header, creating; maintenance issues. In implementation files (e.g. ``.cpp`` files), the rule is more of a stylistic; rule, but is still important. Basically, using explicit namespace prefixes; makes the code **clearer**, because it is immediately obvious what facilities; are being used and where they are coming from. And **more portable**, because; namespace clashes cannot occur between LLVM code and other namespaces. The; portability rule is important because different standard library implementations; expose different symbols (potentially ones they shouldn't), and future revisions; to the C++ standard will add more symbols to the ``std`` namespace. As such, we; never use ``'using namespace std;'`` in LLVM. The exception to the general rule (i.e. it's not an exception for the ``std``; namespace) is for implementation files. For example, all of the code in the; LLVM project implements code that lives in the 'llvm' namespace.

Direct output can be used if the backend already prints a table in C format; or if the output is just a list of strings (for error and warning messages).; Pre-processed output should be used if the same information needs to be used; in different contexts (like Instruction names), so your backend should print; a meta-information list that can be shaped into different compile-time formats.

For a large, ATLAS-style Higgs-->bb workspace with > 100 systematic uncertainties and more than 10 channels, the run time for converting histograms to a fit model decreases by a factor 11 to 12. ### Faster, STL-like Collections in RooFit; RooFit's collections `RooArgSet` and `RooArgList` have been made more STL-like. The underlying implementation used to be the `RooLinkedList`, but now both collections work with `std::vector`. The collections have an STL-like interface concerning iterators such that iterations over the two collections that looked like; ```; TIterator* depIter = intDepList.createIterator() ;; RooAbsArg* arg;; while((arg=(RooAbsArg*)depIter->Next())) {; ...; }; delete depIter;; ```; now look like:; ```; for (auto arg : intDepList) {; ...; }; ```; Depending on how many elements are iterated, RooFit will be between 10 and 20% faster if the new iterators are used. Heavily using old iterators might slow it down by 5 to 10%. Iterators in key classes have been updated, such that many workflows in RooFit are 10 - 20% faster. #### Legacy iterators; The (three kinds) of legacy iterators in RooFit are still supported, such that old code will not break, but they are slower than `begin(), end()` and range-based for loops. **Important caveat**:; The old RooFit collections could be modified while iterating. The STL-like iterators do not support this (as for a *e.g.* std::vector)! Using the legacy iterators with the new collections (*i.e.* in existing code), mutating the collection is still possible in the following cases:; - Inserting/deleting elements **after** the current iterator.; - Changing an element at a position **other than** the current iterator; - **But not** inserting/deleting before/at the current iterator position. With a debug build (with assertions), the legacy iterators will check that the collection is not mutated.

Then the internal parameter list would be as follows:. - Internal parameter 0 = external parameter 1. - Internal parameter 1 = external parameter 2, transformed; appropriately. - Internal parameter 2 = external parameter 4. In the above example, M considers that the number of external parameters; is 5, and the number of internal parameters is 3. This is the number; which determines, for example, the size of the error matrix of the; parameters, since only variable parameters have errors. An important feature of M is that parameters are allowed to change types; during the M minimization and analysis of a $\mbox{FCN}$ function.; Several applications in M have methods available to make variable; parameters fixed and vice-versa; to impose, change, or remove limits; from variable parameters; and even to define completely new parameters; at any time during a run. In addition, some M applications (notably the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ error analysis) cause one or more variable parameters; to be temporarily fixed during the calculation. Therefore, the; correspondence between external and internal parameter lists is in; general a dynamic one, and the number of internal parameters is not; necessarily constant. For more details about parameter interaction see [api:parameters]. ### The transformation for parameters with limits ###. [intro:limits]. For variable parameters with double sided limits $a$ (lower) and $b$; (upper), M uses the following transformation:. $$\begin{aligned}; P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \arcsin; \left( 2\: \frac{ P_{\mathrm{ext}}-a}{ b-a} - 1 \right) \\; P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& a + \frac{ b - a}{ 2}; \left( \sin P_{\mathrm{int}} + 1 \right) \end{aligned}$$. so that the internal value $P_{\mathrm{int}}$ can take on any value,; while the external value $P_{\mathrm{ext}}$ can take on values only; between the lower limit $a$ and the upper limit $b$.

Using the fit option `S` one can access the full result of the fit including the covariance and correlation matrix.; See later the paragraph `TFitResult`. ### Associated Errors. By default, for each bin, the sum of weights is computed at fill time.; One can also call `TH1::Sumw2` to force the storage and computation of; the sum of the square of weights per bin.

Availability,"ether a method's return type should be _Nullable or _Nonnull?; Depending on the implementation of the method, this puts you in one of five situations:. You actually never return nil.; You do return nil sometimes, and callers are supposed to handle that. This; includes cases where your method is documented to return nil given certain; inputs.; You return nil based on some external condition (such as an out-of-memory; error), but the client can't do anything about it either.; You return nil only when the caller passes input documented to be invalid.; That means it's the client's fault.; You return nil in some totally undocumented case. In (1) you should annotate the method as returning a _Nonnull; object.; In (2) the method should be marked _Nullable.; In (3) you should probably annotate the method _Nonnull. Why?; Because no callers will actually check for nil, given that they can't do; anything about the situation and don't know what went wrong. At this point; things have gone so poorly that there's basically no way to recover.; The least happy case is (4) because the resulting program will almost; certainly either crash or just silently do the wrong thing.; If this is a new method or you control the callers, you can use; NSParameterAssert() (or the equivalent) to check the precondition and; remove the nil return. But if you don't control the callers and they rely on; this behavior, you should return mark the method _Nonnull and return; nil cast to _Nonnull anyway.; (Note that (4) doesn't apply in cases where the caller can't know they passed; bad parameters.

During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we recognize an error.

Ideally, those nodes should not had been created, but; that time we did not know about the error, the error happened later.

Ask on the `LLVM; forums <https://discourse.llvm.org>`_ if you are interested in more details. Language-Specific Optimizations; -------------------------------. One thing about LLVM that turns off many people is that it does not; solve all the world's problems in one system. One specific; complaint is that people perceive LLVM as being incapable of performing; high-level language-specific optimization: LLVM ""loses too much; information"". Here are a few observations about this:. First, you're right that LLVM does lose information. For example, as of; this writing, there is no way to distinguish in the LLVM IR whether an; SSA-value came from a C ""int"" or a C ""long"" on an ILP32 machine (other; than debug info). Both get compiled down to an 'i32' value and the; information about what it came from is lost. The more general issue; here, is that the LLVM type system uses ""structural equivalence"" instead; of ""name equivalence"". Another place this surprises people is if you; have two types in a high-level language that have the same structure; (e.g. two different structs that have a single int field): these types; will compile down into a single LLVM type and it will be impossible to; tell what it came from. Second, while LLVM does lose information, LLVM is not a fixed target: we; continue to enhance and improve it in many different ways. In addition; to adding new features (LLVM did not always support exceptions or debug; info), we also extend the IR to capture important information for; optimization (e.g. whether an argument is sign or zero extended,; information about pointers aliasing, etc). Many of the enhancements are; user-driven: people want LLVM to include some specific feature, so they; go ahead and extend it.

Availability,"evelopers even use ``__underscored`` names; in headers to avoid collisions with ""normal"" names that (by; convention) shouldn't even be macros. These conventions are a; barrier to entry for developers coming from non-C languages, are; boilerplate for more experienced developers, and make our headers; far uglier than they should be. * **Tool confusion**: In a C-based language, it is hard to build tools; that work well with software libraries, because the boundaries of; the libraries are not clear. Which headers belong to a particular; library, and in what order should those headers be included to; guarantee that they compile correctly? Are the headers C, C++,; Objective-C++, or one of the variants of these languages? What; declarations in those headers are actually meant to be part of the; API, and what declarations are present only because they had to be; written as part of the header file?. Semantic import; ---------------; Modules improve access to the API of software libraries by replacing the textual preprocessor inclusion model with a more robust, more efficient semantic model. From the user's perspective, the code looks only slightly different, because one uses an ``import`` declaration rather than a ``#include`` preprocessor directive:. .. code-block:: c. import std.io; // pseudo-code; see below for syntax discussion. However, this module import behaves quite differently from the corresponding ``#include <stdio.h>``: when the compiler sees the module import above, it loads a binary representation of the ``std.io`` module and makes its API available to the application directly. Preprocessor definitions that precede the import declaration have no impact on the API provided by ``std.io``, because the module itself was compiled as a separate, standalone module. Additionally, any linker flags required to use the ``std.io`` module will automatically be provided when the module is imported [#]_; This semantic import model addresses many of the problems of the preproce",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:3991,robust,robust,3991,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['robust'],['robust']

The ``handleErrors`` function takes an error as its first argument, followed by; a variadic list of ""handlers"", each of which must be a callable type (a; function, lambda, or class with a call operator) with one argument. The; ``handleErrors`` function will visit each handler in the sequence and check its; argument type against the dynamic type of the error, running the first handler; that matches. This is the same decision process that is used decide which catch; clause to run for a C++ exception.

Availability,"ey to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"". That is, they have no (known) observable behavior; differences due to the particular input data. These instructions are often used; when implementing cryptographic primitives dealing with private key data; because they are not believed to provide any side-channels. Similarly, we can; defer hardening until after them as they will not in-and-of-themselves; introduce a speculative execution side-channel. This results in code sequences; that look like:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; orl %eax, %edi; ```. While an addition happens to the loaded (potentially secret) value, that; doesn't leak any data and we then immediately harden it. ###### Hardening of loaded values deferred down the data-invariant expression graph. We can generalize the previous idea and sink the hardening down the expression; graph across as many data-invariant operations as desirable. This can use very; conservative rules for whether something is data-invariant. The primary goal; should be to handle multiple loads with a single hardening instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; addl 4(%rsi), %edi # Continue without leaking.; addl 8(%rsi), %edi; orl %eax, %edi # Mask out bits from all three loads.; ```. ###### Preserving the flags while hardening loaded values on Haswell, Zen, and newer processors. Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:26156,down,down,26156,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"f dependencies. A; translation unit will then include the precompiled header that starts the chain; (i.e., nothing depends on it). This linearity of dependencies is important for; the semantic model of chained precompiled headers, because the most-recent; precompiled header can provide information that overrides the information; provided by the precompiled headers it depends on, just like a header file; ``B.h`` that includes another header ``A.h`` can modify the state produced by; parsing ``A.h``, e.g., by ``#undef``'ing a macro defined in ``A.h``. There are several ways in which chained precompiled headers generalize the AST; file model:. Numbering of IDs; Many different kinds of entities --- identifiers, declarations, types, etc.; --- have ID numbers that start at 1 or some other predefined constant and; grow upward. Each precompiled header records the maximum ID number it has; assigned in each category. Then, when a new precompiled header is generated; that depends on (chains to) another precompiled header, it will start; counting at the next available ID number. This way, one can determine, given; an ID number, which AST file actually contains the entity. Name lookup; When writing a chained precompiled header, Clang attempts to write only; information that has changed from the precompiled header on which it is; based. This changes the lookup algorithm for the various tables, such as the; :ref:`identifier table <pchinternals-ident-table>`: the search starts at the; most-recent precompiled header. If no entry is found, lookup then proceeds; to the identifier table in the precompiled header it depends on, and so one.; Once a lookup succeeds, that result is considered definitive, overriding any; results from earlier precompiled headers. Update records; There are various ways in which a later precompiled header can modify the; entities described in an earlier precompiled header. For example, later; precompiled headers can add entries into the various name-lookup table",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:25876,avail,available,25876,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

The algorithm is controlled by the given absolute and relative tolerance. The iterations are continued until the following condition is satisfied; $$; absErr <= max ( epsAbs, epsRel * Integral); $$; Where *absErr* is an estimate of the absolute error (it can be retrieved with `GSLIntegrator::Error()`) and *Integral* is the estimate of the function integral; (it can be obtained with `GSLIntegrator::Result()`). The possible integration algorithm types to use with the GSLIntegrator are the following. More information is provided in the `GSL` users documentation.; * `ROOT::Math::Integration::kNONADAPTIVE` : based on `gsl_integration_qng`. It is a non-adaptive procedure which uses fixed Gauss-Kronrod-Patterson abscissae; to sample the integrand at a maximum of 87 points.

Because ACLiC calls `rootcling` to build a dictionary, the declaration; of `gArray` will not be included in the dictionary, and consequently,; `gArray` will not be available at the command line even if ACLiC is; used. Cling and `rootcling` will ignore all statements between the; `""#if !defined` `(__CLING__)""` and ""`#endif""`. If you want to use; `gArray` in the same script as its declaration, you can do so.; However, if you want use the script in the interpreter you have to; bracket the usage of `gArray` between `#if's,` since the definition is; not visible. If you add the following preprocessor statements:. ``` {.cpp}; #if !defined(__CLING__); int gArray[] = { 2, 3, 4};; #elif defined(__ROOTCLING__); int gArray[];; #endif; ```. `gArray` will be visible to `rootcling` but still not visible to Cling.; If you use ACLiC, `gArray` will be available at the command line and; be initialized properly by the compiled code. We recommend you always write scripts with the needed include; statements. In most cases, the script will still run with the; interpreter. However, a few header files are not handled very well by; Cling. These types of headers can be included in interpreted and compiled; mode:. - The subset of standard C/C++ headers defined in; `$ROOTSYS/Cling/include.`. - Headers of classes defined in a previously loaded library; (including ROOT own). The defined class must have a name known to; ROOT (i.e. a class with a `ClassDef`). Hiding header files from `rootcling` that are necessary for the; compiler but optional for the interpreter can lead to a subtle but; fatal error. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; #ifndef __CLING__; #include ""TTree.h""; #else; class TTree;; #endif. class subTree : public TTree {; };; ```.

This will create a special volume that will not be directly used in the; geometry, but whenever positioned will require a list of actual; parameters for the current shape that will be created in this process.; Such volumes having shape parameters known only when used have to be; positioned only with **`TGeoManager::Node()` method (see ‘Creating and; Positioning Volumes').**. Other case when shape parameterizations are quite useful is scaling; geometry structures. Imagine that we would like to enlarge/shrink a; detector structure on one or more axes. This happens quite often in real; life and is handled by ""fitting mother"" parameters. This is accomplished; by defining shapes with one or more invalid (negative) parameters. For; instance, defining a box having `dx=10.`, `dy=10.`, and `dz=-1` will not; generate an error but will be interpreted in a different way: A special; volume **`TGeoVolumeMulti`** will be created. Whenever positioned inside; a mother volume, this will create a normal **`TGeoVolume`** object; having as shape a box with `dz` fitting the corresponding `dz `of the; mother shape. Generally, this type of parameterization is used when; positioning volumes in containers having a matching shape, but it works; also for most reasonable combinations. ## Geometry Creation. A given geometry can be built in various ways, but one has to follow; some mandatory steps. Even if we might use some terms that will be; explained later, here are few general rules:. - Volumes need media and shapes in order to be created.; - Both containers and contained volumes must be created before linking; them together, and the relative transformation matrix must be; provided.; - Any volume have to be positioned somewhere otherwise it will not be; considered as part of the geometry.; - Visibility or tracking properties of volumes can be provided ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:56257,error,error,56257,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,1,['error'],['error']

To address such use cases, lit configuration files support; ``config.recursiveExpansionLimit``, which can be set to a non-negative integer; to specify the maximum number of passes through the substitution list.

Care must be taken to update ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsics when optimization; passes alter or move instructions and blocks -- the developer could observe such; changes reflected in the value of variables when debugging the program. For any; execution of the optimized program, the set of variable values presented to the; developer by the debugger should not show a state that would never have existed; in the execution of the unoptimized program, given the same input. Doing so; risks misleading the developer by reporting a state that does not exist,; damaging their understanding of the optimized program and undermining their; trust in the debugger. Sometimes perfectly preserving variable locations is not possible, often when a; redundant calculation is optimized out. In such cases, a ``llvm.dbg.value``; with operand ``poison`` should be used, to terminate earlier variable locations; and let the debugger present ``optimized out`` to the developer. Withholding; these potentially stale variable values from the developer diminishes the; amount of available debug information, but increases the reliability of the; remaining information.

This section presents the visualization technique available in ROOT; to represent multiple variables (>4) data sets. #### Spider (Radar) Plots. Spider plots (sometimes called “web-plots” or “radar plots”) are used; to compare series of data points (events). They use the human ability; to spot un-symmetry. ![Example of spider plot.](pictures/spider1.png). Variables are represented on individual axes displayed along a circle.; For each variable the minimum value sits on the circle’s center, and; the maximum on the circle’s radius. Spider plots are not suitable for; an accurate graph reading since, by their nature, it can be difficult; to read out very detailed values, but they give quickly a global view; of an event in order to compare it with the others. In ROOT the spider; plot facility is accessed from the tree viewer GUI.

Availability,"ferences to ``__bidi_indexable``, all array accesses are; bounds checked in ``-fbounds-safety``, just as ``__bidi_indexable`` pointers; are. Maintaining correctness of bounds annotations; ---------------------------------------------. ``-fbounds-safety`` maintains correctness of bounds annotations by performing; additional checks when a pointer object and/or its related value containing the; bounds information is updated. For example, ``__single`` expresses an invariant that the pointer must either; point to a single valid object or be a null pointer. To maintain this invariant,; the compiler inserts checks when initializing a ``__single`` pointer, as shown; in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void *__sized_by(size) vp, size_t size) {; // Inserted check:; // if ((int*)upper_bound(vp) - (int*)vp < sizeof(int) && !!vp) trap();; int *__single ip = (int *)vp;; }. Additionally, an explicit bounds annotation such as ``int *__counted_by(count); buf`` defines a relationship between two variables, ``buf`` and ``count``:; namely, that ``buf`` has ``count`` number of elements available. This; relationship must hold even after any of these related variables are updated. To; this end, the model requires that assignments to ``buf`` and ``count`` must be; side by side, with no side effects between them. This prevents ``buf`` and; ``count`` from temporarily falling out of sync due to updates happening at a; distance. The example below shows a function ``alloc_buf`` that initializes a struct that; members that use the ``__counted_by`` annotation. The compiler allows these; assignments because ``sbuf->buf`` and ``sbuf->count`` are updated side by side; without any side effects in between the assignments. Furthermore, the compiler inserts additional run-time checks to ensure the new; ``buf`` has at least as many elements as the new ``count`` indicates as shown in; the transformed pseudo code of function ``alloc_buf()`` in the example below. .. code-block:: c. typedef",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:36065,avail,available,36065,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"fety attributes contain ordinary C++ expressions, and thus follow; ordinary C++ scoping rules. In particular, this means that mutexes and other; capabilities must be declared before they can be used in an attribute.; Use-before-declaration is okay within a single class, because attributes are; parsed at the same time as method bodies. (C++ delays parsing of method bodies; until the end of the class.) However, use-before-declaration is not allowed; between classes, as illustrated below. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo;. class Bar {; void bar(Foo* f) REQUIRES(f->mu); // Error: mu undeclared.; };. class Foo {; Mutex mu;; };. Private Mutexes; ---------------. Good software engineering practice dictates that mutexes should be private; members, because the locking mechanism used by a thread-safe class is part of; its internal implementation. However, private mutexes can sometimes leak into; the public interface of a class.; Thread safety attributes follow normal C++ access restrictions, so if ``mu``; is a private member of ``c``, then it is an error to write ``c.mu`` in an; attribute. One workaround is to (ab)use the ``RETURN_CAPABILITY`` attribute to provide a; public *name* for a private mutex, without actually exposing the underlying; mutex. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. class MyClass {; private:; Mutex mu;. public:; // For thread safety analysis only. Does not need to be defined.; Mutex* getMu() RETURN_CAPABILITY(mu);. void doSomething() REQUIRES(mu);; };. void doSomethingTwice(MyClass& c) REQUIRES(c.getMu()) {; // The analysis thinks that c.getMu() == c.mu; c.doSomething();; c.doSomething();; }. In the above example, ``doSomethingTwice()`` is an external routine that; requires ``c.mu`` to be locked, which cannot be declared directly because ``mu``; is private. This pattern is discouraged because it; violates encapsulation, but it is sometimes necessary, especially when adding; annotations to an existing code base.

Clang currently supports C++ for OpenCL 1.0 and 2021.; For detailed information about this language refer to the C++ for OpenCL; Programming Language Documentation available; in `the latest build; <https://www.khronos.org/opencl/assets/CXX_for_OpenCL.html>`_; or in `the official release; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Docs/releases/tag/cxxforopencl-docrev2021.12>`_. To enable the C++ for OpenCL mode, pass one of following command line options when; compiling ``.clcpp`` file:. - C++ for OpenCL 1.0: ``-cl-std=clc++``, ``-cl-std=CLC++``, ``-cl-std=clc++1.0``,; ``-cl-std=CLC++1.0``, ``-std=clc++``, ``-std=CLC++``, ``-std=clc++1.0`` or; ``-std=CLC++1.0``. - C++ for OpenCL 2021: ``-cl-std=clc++2021``, ``-cl-std=CLC++2021``,; ``-std=clc++2021``, ``-std=CLC++2021``.

Each function can only call '``llvm.localescape``'; once, and it can only do so from the entry block. The ``func`` argument to '``llvm.localrecover``' must be a constant; bitcasted pointer to a function defined in the current module. The code; generator cannot determine the frame allocation offset of functions defined in; other modules. The ``fp`` argument to '``llvm.localrecover``' must be a frame pointer of a; call frame that is currently live. The return value of '``llvm.localaddress``'; is one way to produce such a value, but various runtimes also expose a suitable; pointer in platform-specific ways.

The ``Pass::getAnalysis<>`` method is automatically inherited by your class,; providing you with access to the passes that you declared that you required; with the :ref:`getAnalysisUsage <writing-an-llvm-pass-getAnalysisUsage>`; method. It takes a single template argument that specifies which pass class; you want, and returns a reference to that pass. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. bool LICM::runOnFunction(Function &F) {; LoopInfo &LI = getAnalysis<LoopInfoWrapperPass>().getLoopInfo();; //...; }. This method call returns a reference to the pass desired. You may get a; runtime assertion failure if you attempt to get an analysis that you did not; declare as required in your :ref:`getAnalysisUsage; <writing-an-llvm-pass-getAnalysisUsage>` implementation. This method can be; called by your ``run*`` method implementation, or by any other local method; invoked by your ``run*`` method.

In above example, ``runOnFunction`` for ``DominatorTree`` is called by pass; manager before returning a reference to the desired pass. If your pass is capable of updating analyses if they exist (e.g.,; ``BreakCriticalEdges``, as described above), you can use the; ``getAnalysisIfAvailable`` method, which returns a pointer to the analysis if; it is active.

Error foo() {; if (auto Err = mayFail()); return Err;; // Success! We can proceed.; ... For functions that can fail but need to return a value the ``Expected<T>``; utility can be used. Values of this type can be constructed with either a; ``T``, or an ``Error``. Expected<T> values are also implicitly convertible to; boolean, but with the opposite convention to ``Error``: true for success, false; for error. If success, the ``T`` value can be accessed via the dereference; operator. If failure, the ``Error`` value can be extracted using the; ``takeError()`` method. Idiomatic usage looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. Expected<FormattedFile> openFormattedFile(StringRef Path) {; // If badly formatted, return an error.; if (auto Err = checkFormat(Path)); return std::move(Err);; // Otherwise return a FormattedFile instance.; return FormattedFile(Path);; }.

Availability,"fine different macros during; host compilation and during device compilation for each GPU architecture.). clang's approach allows it to be highly robust to C++ edge cases, as it doesn't; need to decide at an early stage which declarations to keep and which to throw; away. But it has some consequences you should be aware of. Overloading Based on ``__host__`` and ``__device__`` Attributes; ---------------------------------------------------------------. Let ""H"", ""D"", and ""HD"" stand for ""``__host__`` functions"", ""``__device__``; functions"", and ""``__host__ __device__`` functions"", respectively. Functions; with no attributes behave the same as H. nvcc does not allow you to create H and D functions with the same signature:. .. code-block:: c++. // nvcc: error - function ""foo"" has already been defined; __host__ void foo() {}; __device__ void foo() {}. However, nvcc allows you to ""overload"" H and D functions with different; signatures:. .. code-block:: c++. // nvcc: no error; __host__ void foo(int) {}; __device__ void foo() {}. In clang, the ``__host__`` and ``__device__`` attributes are part of a; function's signature, and so it's legal to have H and D functions with; (otherwise) the same signature:. .. code-block:: c++. // clang: no error; __host__ void foo() {}; __device__ void foo() {}. HD functions cannot be overloaded by H or D functions with the same signature:. .. code-block:: c++. // nvcc: error - function ""foo"" has already been defined; // clang: error - redefinition of 'foo'; __host__ __device__ void foo() {}; __device__ void foo() {}. // nvcc: no error; // clang: no error; __host__ __device__ void bar(int) {}; __device__ void bar() {}. When resolving an overloaded function, clang considers the host/device; attributes of the caller and callee. These are used as a tiebreaker during; overload resolution.

However, using this intrinsic prevents exceptions and data races on memory access to masked-off lanes. ::. call void @llvm.masked.store.v16f32.p0(<16 x float> %value, ptr %ptr, i32 4, <16 x i1> %mask). ;; The result of the following instructions is identical aside from potential data races and memory access exceptions; %oldval = load <16 x float>, ptr %ptr, align 4; %res = select <16 x i1> %mask, <16 x float> %value, <16 x float> %oldval; store <16 x float> %res, ptr %ptr, align 4. Masked Vector Gather and Scatter Intrinsics; -------------------------------------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for vector gather and scatter operations. They are similar to :ref:`Masked Vector Load and Store <int_mload_mstore>`, except they are designed for arbitrary memory accesses, rather than sequential memory accesses. Gather and scatter also employ a mask operand, which holds one bit per vector element, switching the associated vector lane on or off. The memory addresses corresponding to the ""off"" lanes are not accessed. When all bits are off, no memory is accessed. .. _int_mgather:.

Availability,"formed in a loop and all necessary steps are manually invoked. This; example also demonstrates another very important point concerning memory; management! Note that the vector, matrix and decomposition class are; constructed outside the loop since the dimensions of vector/matrix are; constant. If we would have replaced `lu.SetMatrix(a)` by **`TDecompLU`**; `lu(a)`, we would construct/deconstruct the array elements of `lu` on; the stack*.*. ``` {.cpp}; TVectorD b(n);; TMatrixD a(n,n);; TDecompLU lu(n);; Bool_t ok;; for (....) {; b = ..;; a = ..;; lu.SetMatrix(a);; lu.Decompose();; lu.Solve(b,ok);; }; ```. ### Tolerances and Scaling. The tolerance parameter `fTol` (a member of the base class; **`TDecompBase`**) plays a crucial role in all operations of the; decomposition classes. It gives the user a tool to monitor and steer the; operations its default value is $\varepsilon$ where $1+\varepsilon=1$. If you do not want to be bothered by the following considerations, like; in most other linear algebra packages, just set the tolerance with; `SetTol` to an arbitrary small number. The tolerance number is used by; each decomposition method to decide whether the matrix is near singular,; except of course SVD that can handle singular matrices. This will be; checked in a different way for any decomposition. For instance in LU, a; matrix is considered singular in the solving stage when a diagonal; element of the decomposed matrix is smaller than `fTol`. Here an; important point is raised. The `Decompose()` method is successful as; long no zero diagonal element is encountered. Therefore, the user could; perform decomposition and only after this step worry about the tolerance; number. If the matrix is flagged as being singular, operations with the; decomposition will fail and will return matrices or vectors that are; invalid. If one would like to monitor the tolerance parameter but not; have the code stop in case of a number smaller than `fTol`, one could; proceed as follows:. ``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/LinearAlgebra.md:39991,toler,tolerance,39991,documentation/users-guide/LinearAlgebra.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/LinearAlgebra.md,1,['toler'],['tolerance']
Availability,"found it necessary to associate a label; with each byte or bit of data, as some other tools do. Instead, labels are; associated directly with registers. Loads will result in a union of; all shadow labels corresponding to bytes loaded, and stores will; result in a copy of the label of the stored value to the shadow of all; bytes stored to. Propagating labels through arguments; ------------------------------------. In order to propagate labels through function arguments and return values,; DataFlowSanitizer changes the ABI of each function in the translation unit.; There are currently two supported ABIs:. * Args -- Argument and return value labels are passed through additional; arguments and by modifying the return type. * TLS -- Argument and return value labels are passed through TLS variables; ``__dfsan_arg_tls`` and ``__dfsan_retval_tls``. The main advantage of the TLS ABI is that it is more tolerant of ABI mismatches; (TLS storage is not shared with any other form of storage, whereas extra; arguments may be stored in registers which under the native ABI are not used; for parameter passing and thus could contain arbitrary values). On the other; hand the args ABI is more efficient and allows ABI mismatches to be more easily; identified by checking for nonzero labels in nominally unlabelled programs. Implementing the ABI list; -------------------------. The `ABI list <DataFlowSanitizer.html#abi-list>`_ provides a list of functions; which conform to the native ABI, each of which is callable from an instrumented; program. This is implemented by replacing each reference to a native ABI; function with a reference to a function which uses the instrumented ABI.; Such functions are automatically-generated wrappers for the native functions.; For example, given the ABI list example provided in the user manual, the; following wrappers will be generated under the args ABI:. .. code-block:: llvm. define linkonce_odr { i8*, i16 } @""dfsw$malloc""(i64 %0, i16 %1) {; entry:; %2 = call",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizerDesign.rst:10407,toler,tolerant,10407,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizerDesign.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowSanitizerDesign.rst,1,['toler'],['tolerant']

The ``associated`` metadata may be attached to a global variable definition with; a single argument that references a global object (optionally through an alias). This metadata lowers to the ELF section flag ``SHF_LINK_ORDER`` which prevents; discarding of the global variable in linker GC unless the referenced object is; also discarded. The linker support for this feature is spotty. For best; compatibility, globals carrying this metadata should:. - Be in ``@llvm.compiler.used``.; - If the referenced global variable is in a comdat, be in the same comdat. ``!associated`` can not express many-to-one relationship. A global variable with; the metadata should generally not be referenced by a function: the function may; be inlined into other functions, leading to more references to the metadata.; Ideally we would want to keep metadata alive as long as any inline location is; alive, but this many-to-one relationship is not representable. Moreover, if the; metadata is retained while the function is discarded, the linker will report an; error of a relocation referencing a discarded section. The metadata is often used with an explicit section consisting of valid C; identifiers so that the runtime can find the metadata section with; linker-defined encapsulation symbols ``__start_<section_name>`` and; ``__stop_<section_name>``. It does not have any effect on non-ELF targets.

For example:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint -run-llc [... optzn passes ...] file-to-test.bc --args -- [program arguments]. bugpoint will try to narrow down your list of passes to the one pass that; causes an error, and simplify the bitcode file as much as it can to assist; you.

Incorrect code generation; =========================. Similarly to debugging incorrect compilation by mis-behaving passes, you; can debug incorrect code generation by either LLC or the JIT, using; ``bugpoint``. The process ``bugpoint`` follows in this case is to try to; narrow the code down to a function that is miscompiled by one or the other; method, but since for correctness, the entire program must be run,; ``bugpoint`` will compile the code it deems to not be affected with the C; Backend, and then link in the shared object it generates. To debug the JIT:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint -run-jit -output=[correct output file] [bitcode file] \; --tool-args -- [arguments to pass to lli] \; --args -- [program arguments]. Similarly, to debug the LLC, one would run:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint -run-llc -output=[correct output file] [bitcode file] \; --tool-args -- [arguments to pass to llc] \; --args -- [program arguments]. **Special note:** if you are debugging MultiSource or SPEC tests that; already exist in the ``llvm/test`` hierarchy, there is an easier way to; debug the JIT, LLC, and CBE, using the pre-written Makefile targets, which; will pass the program options specified in the Makefiles:. .. code-block:: bash. cd llvm/test/../../program; make bugpoint-jit.

Availability,"gh LLVM's struct types and reason about the; underlying memory offsets. The community realized that pointee types hinder LLVM; development, rather than helping it. Some of the initially proposed high-level; optimizations have evolved into `TBAA; <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_ due to limitations with; representing higher-level language information directly via SSA values. Pointee types provide some value to frontends because the IR verifier uses types; to detect straightforward type confusion bugs. However, frontends also have to; deal with the complexity of inserting bitcasts everywhere that they might be; required. The community consensus is that the costs of pointee types; outweight the benefits, and that they should be removed. Many operations do not actually care about the underlying type. These; operations, typically intrinsics, usually end up taking an arbitrary pointer; type ``i8*`` and sometimes a size. This causes lots of redundant no-op bitcasts; in the IR to and from a pointer with a different pointee type. No-op bitcasts take up memory/disk space and also take up compile time to look; through. However, perhaps the biggest issue is the code complexity required to; deal with bitcasts. When looking up through def-use chains for pointers it's; easy to forget to call `Value::stripPointerCasts()` to find the true underlying; pointer obfuscated by bitcasts. And when looking down through def-use chains; passes need to iterate through bitcasts to handle uses. Removing no-op pointer; bitcasts prevents a category of missed optimizations and makes writing LLVM; passes a little bit easier. Fewer no-op pointer bitcasts also reduces the chances of incorrect bitcasts in; regards to address spaces. People maintaining backends that care a lot about; address spaces have complained that frontends like Clang often incorrectly; bitcast pointers, losing address space information. An analogous transition that happened earlier in LLVM is integer signedness.;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:3675,redundant,redundant,3675,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,1,['redundant'],['redundant']

The ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane`` attribute on a subprogram debugger information; entry is used to specify the lanes that are conceptually active for a SIMT; thread. The execution mask may be modified to implement whole or quad wavefront mode; operations. For example, all lanes may need to temporarily be made active to; execute a whole wavefront operation. Such regions would save the ``EXEC`` mask,; update it to enable the necessary lanes, perform the operations, and then; restore the ``EXEC`` mask from the saved value. While executing the whole; wavefront region, the conceptual execution mask is the saved value, not the; ``EXEC`` value. This is handled by defining an artificial variable for the active lane mask. The; active lane mask artificial variable would be the actual ``EXEC`` mask for; normal regions, and the saved execution mask for regions where the mask is; temporarily updated. The location list expression created for this artificial; variable is used to define the value of the ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane``; attribute. ``DW_AT_LLVM_augmentation``; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

Chi-squared fits to X-Y datasets now possible; In addition to the ability to perform chi-squared fits to histograms it is now also possible; to perform chi-squared fits to unbinned datasets containing a series of X and Y values; with associated errors on Y and optionally on X. These 'X-Y' chi-squared fits are interfaced through newly added method; RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataSet&,...). By default the event weight is; interpreted as the 'Y' value, but an YVar() argument can designate any other; dataset column as Y value.

If you call the ``Function::viewCFG()`` method, for example, the; current LLVM tool will pop up a window containing the CFG for the function where; each basic block is a node in the graph, and each node contains the instructions; in the block. Similarly, there also exists ``Function::viewCFGOnly()`` (does; not include the instructions), the ``MachineFunction::viewCFG()`` and; ``MachineFunction::viewCFGOnly()``, and the ``SelectionDAG::viewGraph()``; methods. Within GDB, for example, you can usually use something like ``call; DAG.viewGraph()`` to pop up a window. Alternatively, you can sprinkle calls to; these functions in your code in places you want to debug. Getting this to work requires a small amount of setup.

The C and C++ standards allow floating-point expressions to be computed as if; intermediate results had more precision (and/or a wider range) than the type; of the expression strictly allows. This is called excess precision; arithmetic.; Excess precision arithmetic can improve the accuracy of results (although not; always), and it can make computation significantly faster if the target lacks; direct hardware support for arithmetic in a particular type. However, it can; also undermine strict floating-point reproducibility. Under the standards, assignments and explicit casts force the operand to be; converted to its formal type, discarding any excess precision. Because data; can only flow between statements via an assignment, this means that the use; of excess precision arithmetic is a reliable local property of a single; statement, and results do not change based on optimization. However, when; excess precision arithmetic is in use, Clang does not guarantee strict; reproducibility, and future compiler releases may recognize more; opportunities to use excess precision arithmetic, e.g. with floating-point; builtins. Clang does not use excess precision arithmetic for most types or on most; targets. For example, even on pre-SSE X86 targets where ``float`` and; ``double`` computations must be performed in the 80-bit X87 format, Clang; rounds all intermediate results correctly for their type.

It is useful for targets that support vector masked loads and allows vectorizing predicated basic blocks on these targets. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of branches that guard scalar load operations.; The result of this operation is equivalent to a regular vector load instruction followed by a 'select' between the loaded and the passthru values, predicated on the same mask. However, using this intrinsic prevents exceptions on memory access to masked-off lanes. ::. %res = call <16 x float> @llvm.masked.load.v16f32.p0(ptr %ptr, i32 4, <16 x i1>%mask, <16 x float> %passthru). ;; The result of the two following instructions is identical aside from potential memory access exception; %loadlal = load <16 x float>, ptr %ptr, align 4; %res = select <16 x i1> %mask, <16 x float> %loadlal, <16 x float> %passthru. .. _int_mstore:.

So far, the Crystal Ball distribution has been represented in RooFit only by the `RooCBShape` class, which has a Gaussian core and a single power-law tail on one side.; This release introduces [`RooCrystalBall`](https://root.cern/doc/v624/classRooCrystalBall.html), which implements some common generalizations of the Crystal Ball shape:. - symmetric or asymmetric power-law tails on both sides; - different width parameters for the left and right sides of the Gaussian core.

Now, combined; with options E1 and E2, it avoids error bars clipping. ## 3D Graphics Libraries. ## Geometry Libraries. ## Database Libraries. ## Networking Libraries. ### Multithreaded support for FastCGI.

If the source language is mapped onto the AMDGPU wavefronts in a SIMT manner the; compiler can use the AMDGPU execution mask register to control which lanes are; active. To describe the conceptual location of non-active lanes requires an; attribute that has an expression that computes the source location PC for each; lane.

This can be done using the ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` (see; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-to-create-vector-composite-location-descriptions`); operation. The AMDGPU may update the execution mask to perform whole wavefront operations.; Therefore, there is a need for an attribute that computes the current active; lane mask. This can have an expression that may evaluate to the SIMT active lane; mask register or to a saved mask when in whole wavefront execution mode. An example that uses these attributes is referenced in the; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-further-examples` appendix.

However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:162580,error,error-re,162580,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['error'],['error-re']

Alternatively, if your application targets iPhoneOS 3.0:. $ scan-build xcodebuild -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator3.0. Gotcha: using the right compiler; Recall that scan-build analyzes your project by using a compiler to; compile the project and clang to analyze your project. The script uses; simple heuristics to determine which compiler should be used (it defaults to; clang on Darwin and gcc on other platforms). When analyzing; iPhone projects, scan-build may pick the wrong compiler than the one; Xcode would use to build your project. For example, this could be because; multiple versions of a compiler may be installed on your system, especially if; you are developing for the iPhone.; When compiling your application to run on the simulator, it is important that scan-build; finds the correct version of gcc/clang. Otherwise, you may see strange build; errors that only happen when you run scan-build. scan-build provides the --use-cc and --use-c++; options to hardwire which compiler scan-build should use for building your code.; Note that although you are chiefly interested in analyzing your project, keep in; mind that running the analyzer is intimately tied to the build, and not being; able to compile your code means it won't get fully analyzed (if at all).; If you aren't certain which compiler Xcode uses to build your project, try; just running xcodebuild (without scan-build).

Here $\vec{d}$; represents the current direction. The next crossing point represents the; point where a ray shot from the current point along the current; direction crosses the surface. ``` {.cpp}; Double_t *TGeoManager::FindNormal(Bool_t forward=kTRUE);; ```. The method above computes the normal to the next crossed surface in; forward or backward direction (i.e. the current one), assuming the state; corresponding to a current arbitrary point is initialized. An example of; usage of normal computation is ray tracing. The two most important features of the geometrical modeller concerning; tracking are scalability and performance as function of the total number; of physical nodes. The first refers to the possibility to make use of; the available memory resources and at the same time be able to resolve; any geometrical query, while the second defines the capability of the; modeller to respond quickly even for huge geometries. These parameters; can become critical when simulating big experiments like those at LHC. ### Creating and Visualizing Tracks. In case the modeller is interfaced with a tracking engine, one might; consider quite useful being able to store and visualize at least a part; of the tracks in the context of the geometry. The base class; **`TVirtualGeoTrack`** provides this functionality. It currently has one; implementation inside the drawing package (**`TGeoTrack`** class).

Availability,"he fundamental topic of parameter; estimation by fitting functions to data. For graphs and histograms, ROOT; offers an easy-to-use interface to perform fits - either the fit panel; of the graphical interface, or the `Fit` method. The class `TFitResult`; allows access to the detailed results. Very often it is necessary to study the statistical properties of; analysis procedures. This is most easily achieved by applying the; analysis to many sets of simulated data (or ""pseudo data""), each; representing one possible version of the true experiment. If the; simulation only deals with the final distributions observed in data, and; does not perform a full simulation of the underlying physics and the; experimental apparatus, the name ""Toy Monte Carlo"" is frequently used; [^5]. Since the true values of all parameters are known in the; pseudo-data, the differences between the parameter estimates from the; analysis procedure w.r.t. the true values can be determined, and it is; also possible to check that the analysis procedure provides correct; error estimates. ## Fitting Functions to Pseudo Data ##. In the example below, a pseudo-data set is produced and a model fitted; to it. ROOT offers various minimisation algorithms to minimise a chi2 or a; negative log-likelihood function. The default minimiser is MINUIT, a; package originally implemented in the FORTRAN programming language.

Bounds check optimizations; ==========================. In ``-fbounds-safety``, the Clang frontend emits run-time checks for every; memory dereference if the type system or analyses in the frontend couldn’t; verify its bounds safety. The implementation relies on LLVM optimizations to; remove redundant run-time checks. Using this optimization strategy, if the; original source code already has bounds checks, the fewer additional checks; ``-fbounds-safety`` will introduce. The LLVM ``ConstraintElimination`` pass is; design to remove provable redundant checks (please check Florian Hahn’s; presentation in 2021 LLVM Dev Meeting and the implementation to learn more). In; the following example, ``-fbounds-safety`` implicitly adds the redundant bounds; checks that the optimizer can remove:. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; for (size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; // implicit bounds checks:; // if (p + i < p || p + i + 1 > p + count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. ``ConstraintElimination`` collects the following facts and determines if the; bounds checks can be safely removed:. * Inside the for-loop, ``0 <= i < count``, hence ``1 <= i + 1 <= count``.; * Pointer arithmetic ``p + count`` in the if-condition doesn’t wrap.; * ``-fbounds-safety`` treats pointer arithmetic overflow as deterministically; two’s complement computation, not an undefined behavior. Therefore,; getelementptr does not typically have inbounds keyword. However, the compiler; does emit inbounds for ``p + count`` in this case because; ``__counted_by(count)`` has the invariant that p has at least as many as; elements as count.

Although there are a **lot** of command line argument parsing libraries out; there in many different languages, none of them fit well with what I needed. By; looking at the features and problems of other libraries, I designed the; CommandLine library to have the following features:. #. Speed: The CommandLine library is very quick and uses little resources. The; parsing time of the library is directly proportional to the number of; arguments parsed, not the number of options recognized. Additionally,; command line argument values are captured transparently into user defined; global variables, which can be accessed like any other variable (and with the; same performance). #. Type Safe: As a user of CommandLine, you don't have to worry about; remembering the type of arguments that you want (is it an int? a string? a; bool? an enum?) and keep casting it around. Not only does this help prevent; error prone constructs, it also leads to dramatically cleaner source code. #. No subclasses required: To use CommandLine, you instantiate variables that; correspond to the arguments that you would like to capture, you don't; subclass a parser. This means that you don't have to write **any**; boilerplate code. #. Globally accessible: Libraries can specify command line arguments that are; automatically enabled in any tool that links to the library. This is; possible because the application doesn't have to keep a list of arguments to; pass to the parser. This also makes supporting `dynamically loaded options`_; trivial. #. Cleaner: CommandLine supports enum and other types directly, meaning that; there is less error and more security built into the library. You don't have; to worry about whether your integral command line argument accidentally got; assigned a value that is not valid for your enum type. #.

For example, at; initialization, these estimates are just the starting step sizes as; specified by the user. After a `HESSE` step, the errors are usually; quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. `Minuit`, when it; prints out error values, also gives some indication of how reliable it; thinks they are. For example, those marked `CURRENT GUESS ERROR` are; only working values not to be believed, and `APPROXIMATE ERROR` means; that they have been calculated but there is reason to believe that; they may not be accurate. If no mitigating adjective is given, then at least `Minuit` believes; the errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that; `Minuit` has been fooled. Some visible signs that `Minuit` may have; been fooled:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error; analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of EDM too big (estimated Distance to Minimum). - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parameterized so that individual errors are; not very meaningful becaus",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:60934,error,error,60934,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,2,"['error', 'reliab']","['error', 'reliable']"

Fuzz Target; -----------. The first step in using libFuzzer on a library is to implement a; *fuzz target* -- a function that accepts an array of bytes and; does something interesting with these bytes using the API under test.; Like this:. .. code-block:: c++. // fuzz_target.cc; extern ""C"" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {; DoSomethingInterestingWithMyAPI(Data, Size);; return 0; // Values other than 0 and -1 are reserved for future use.; }. Note that this fuzz target does not depend on libFuzzer in any way; and so it is possible and even desirable to use it with other fuzzing engines; e.g. AFL_ and/or Radamsa_. Some important things to remember about fuzz targets:. * The fuzzing engine will execute the fuzz target many times with different inputs in the same process.; * It must tolerate any kind of input (empty, huge, malformed, etc).; * It must not `exit()` on any input.; * It may use threads but ideally all threads should be joined at the end of the function.; * It must be as deterministic as possible. Non-determinism (e.g. random decisions not based on the input bytes) will make fuzzing inefficient.; * It must be fast. Try avoiding cubic or greater complexity, logging, or excessive memory consumption.; * Ideally, it should not modify any global state (although that's not strict).; * Usually, the narrower the target the better. E.g. if your target can parse several data formats, split it into several targets, one per format. Fuzzer Usage; ------------. Recent versions of Clang (starting from 6.0) include libFuzzer, and no extra installation is necessary.

To do this, use the ``-fimplicit-module-maps`` option instead of the ``-fmodules`` option, or use ``-fmodule-map-file=`` option to explicitly specify the module map files to load. Compilation model; -----------------; The binary representation of modules is automatically generated by the compiler on an as-needed basis. When a module is imported (e.g., by an ``#include`` of one of the module's headers), the compiler will spawn a second instance of itself [#]_, with a fresh preprocessing context [#]_, to parse just the headers in that module. The resulting Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is then persisted into the binary representation of the module that is then loaded into translation unit where the module import was encountered. The binary representation of modules is persisted in the *module cache*. Imports of a module will first query the module cache and, if a binary representation of the required module is already available, will load that representation directly. Thus, a module's headers will only be parsed once per language configuration, rather than once per translation unit that uses the module. Modules maintain references to each of the headers that were part of the module build. If any of those headers changes, or if any of the modules on which a module depends change, then the module will be (automatically) recompiled. The process should never require any user intervention.

In that case the order that that happens in matches the order you write the class names after the `:`. ```tablegen; class C {; int a = 1;; }; class D {; int a = 2;; }; class E : C, D {}; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class C {; int a = 1;; }; class D {; int a = 2;; }; class E {	// C D; int a = 2;; }; ------------- Defs -----------------. Class `E` first inherits from class `C`. This gives `E` a member `a` with value `1`. Then it inherits from class `D` which also has a member `a` but with a value of `2`. Meaning the final value of `E`'s `a` is `2`. When a member has the same name this is handled on a ""last one in wins"" basis. Assuming the types match. ```tablegen; class C {; string a = """";; }; class D {; int a = 2;; }; class E : C, D {}; ```. <stdin>:7:14: error: New definition of 'a' of type 'int' is incompatible with previous definition of type 'string'; class E : C, D {}; ^. When they don't match, we get an error. Luckily for us, we're about to learn all about types. ## Types. TableGen is statically typed with error checking to prevent you from assigning things with mismatched types. ```tablegen; class C {; int a;; bit b = 0;; string s = ""Hello"";; }; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class C {; int a = ?;; bit b = 0;; string s = ""Hello"";; }; ------------- Defs -----------------. Here we've created a class C with integer, bit (1 or 0) and string members. See [here](https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.html#types) for a full list of types. Note that you do not have to give a member a default value, it can be left uninitialised. ```tablegen; %noreset. def X: C {}; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class C {; int a = ?;; bit b = 0;; string s = ""Hello"";; }; ------------- Defs -----------------; def X {	// C; int a = ?;; bit b = 0;; string s = ""Hello"";; }.

Availability,"his allows dynamic types of nodes. But the YAML I/O model uses; static typing, so there are limits to how you can use tags with the YAML I/O; model. Recently, we added support to YAML I/O for checking/setting the optional; tag on a map. Using this functionality it is even possible to support different; mappings, as long as they are convertible. To check a tag, inside your mapping() method you can use io.mapTag() to specify; what the tag should be. This will also add that tag when writing yaml. Validation; ----------. Sometimes in a YAML map, each key/value pair is valid, but the combination is; not. This is similar to something having no syntax errors, but still having; semantic errors. To support semantic level checking, YAML I/O allows; an optional ``validate()`` method in a MappingTraits template specialization. When parsing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is call *after* all key/values in; the map have been processed. Any error message returned by the ``validate()``; method during input will be printed just a like a syntax error would be printed.; When writing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is called *before* the YAML; key/values are written. Any error during output will trigger an ``assert()``; because it is a programming error to have invalid struct values. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llvm::yaml::IO;. struct Stuff {; ...; };. template <>; struct MappingTraits<Stuff> {; static void mapping(IO &io, Stuff &stuff) {; ...; }; static std::string validate(IO &io, Stuff &stuff) {; // Look at all fields in 'stuff' and if there; // are any bad values return a string describing; // the error. Otherwise return an empty string.; return std::string{};; }; };. Flow Mapping; ------------; A YAML ""flow mapping"" is a mapping that uses the inline notation; (e.g { x: 1, y: 0 } ) when written to YAML. To specify that a type should be; written in YAML using flow mapping, your MappingTraits specialization should; add ""static const bool flow = true;"".",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst:23457,error,error,23457,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/YamlIO.rst,2,['error'],['error']

CFG Modifications; =================. Branch Weight Metatada is not proof against CFG changes. If terminator operands'; are changed some action should be taken. In other case some misoptimizations may; occur due to incorrect branch prediction information. Function Entry Counts; =====================. To allow comparing different functions during inter-procedural analysis and; optimization, ``MD_prof`` nodes can also be assigned to a function definition.; The first operand is a string indicating the name of the associated counter. Currently, one counter is supported: ""function_entry_count"". The second operand; is a 64-bit counter that indicates the number of times that this function was; invoked (in the case of instrumentation-based profiles). In the case of; sampling-based profiles, this operand is an approximation of how many times; the function was invoked. For example, in the code below, the instrumentation for function foo(); indicates that it was called 2,590 times at runtime. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @foo() !prof !1 {; ret i32 0; }; !1 = !{!""function_entry_count"", i64 2590}. If ""function_entry_count"" has more than 2 operands, the later operands are; the GUID of the functions that needs to be imported by ThinLTO. This is only; set by sampling based profile. It is needed because the sampling based profile; was collected on a binary that had already imported and inlined these functions,; and we need to ensure the IR matches in the ThinLTO backends for profile; annotation. The reason why we cannot annotate this on the callsite is that it; can only goes down 1 level in the call chain. For the cases where; foo_in_a_cc()->bar_in_b_cc()->baz_in_c_cc(), we will need to go down 2 levels; in the call chain to import both bar_in_b_cc and baz_in_c_cc.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BranchWeightMetadata.rst:6941,down,down,6941,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BranchWeightMetadata.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BranchWeightMetadata.rst,2,['down'],['down']

Currently the [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) backend is supported and support for [Dask](https://dask.org/) is coming soon. The backend submodules of this package expose their own `RDataFrame` objects. The only needed change in user code is to substitute `ROOT.RDataFrame` calls with such backend-specific `RDataFrame`s. For example:. ```python; import ROOT. # Point RDataFrame calls to the Spark specific RDataFrame; RDataFrame = ROOT.RDF.Experimental.Distributed.Spark.RDataFrame. # It still accepts the same constructor arguments as traditional RDataFrame; df = RDataFrame(""mytree"",""myfile.root""). # Continue the application with the traditional RDataFrame API; ```. The main goal of this package is to support running any RDataFrame application distributedly. Nonetheless, not all RDataFrame operations currently work with this package. The subset that is currently available is:. - AsNumpy; - Count; - Define; - Fill; - Filter; - Graph; - Histo[1,2,3]D; - Max; - Mean; - Min; - Profile[1,2,3]D; - Snapshot; - Sum. with support for more operations coming in the future. Any distributed RDataFrame backend inherits the dependencies of the underlying software needed to distribute the applications. The Spark backend for example has the following runtime dependencies (ROOT will build just fine without, but the feature will be unavailable without these packages):. - [pyspark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html), that in turn has its own set of dependencies:; - [Java](https://www.java.com/en/); - [py4j](https://www.py4j.org/).

Beyond the template dependence bits, we add a new “ContainsErrors” bit to; express “Does this expression or anything within it contain errors” semantic,; this bit is always set for RecoveryExpr, and propagated to other related nodes.; This provides a fast way to query whether any (recursive) child of an expression; had an error, which is often used to improve diagnostics. .. code-block:: C++. // C++; void recoveryExpr(int abc) {; unknownFunction(); // type-dependent, value-dependent, contains-errors. std::string(42).size(); // value-dependent, contains-errors,; // not type-dependent, as we know the type is std::string; }. .. code-block:: C. // C; void recoveryExpr(int abc) {; unknownVar + abc; // type-dependent, value-dependent, contains-errors; }.

Our aim is to document invariants, and; to abort quickly at the point of failure (providing some basic diagnostic) when; invariants are broken at runtime. The fundamental tools for handling programmatic errors are assertions and the; llvm_unreachable function. Assertions are used to express invariant conditions,; and should include a message describing the invariant:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(isPhysReg(R) && ""All virt regs should have been allocated already."");. The llvm_unreachable function can be used to document areas of control flow; that should never be entered if the program invariants hold:. .. code-block:: c++. enum { Foo, Bar, Baz } X = foo();. switch (X) {; case Foo: /* Handle Foo */; break;; case Bar: /* Handle Bar */; break;; default:; llvm_unreachable(""X should be Foo or Bar here"");; }. Recoverable Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``.

They are allocated either; statically in the code generator (globals, static members, dummy parameter; values etc.) or dynamically in the interpreter, when creating the frame; containing the local variables of a function. Blocks are associated with a; descriptor that characterises the entire allocation, along with a few; additional attributes:. * ``IsStatic`` indicates whether the block has static duration in the; interpreter, i.e. it is not a local in a frame. * ``DeclID`` identifies each global declaration (it is set to an invalid; and irrelevant value for locals) in order to prevent illegal writes and; reads involving globals and temporaries with static storage duration. Static blocks are never deallocated, but local ones might be deallocated; even when there are live pointers to them. Pointers are only valid as; long as the blocks they point to are valid, so a block with pointers to; it whose lifetime ends is kept alive until all pointers to it go out of; scope. Since the frame is destroyed on function exit, such blocks are; turned into a ``DeadBlock`` and copied to storage managed by the; interpreter itself, not the frame. Reads and writes to these blocks are; illegal and cause an appropriate diagnostic to be emitted. When the last; pointer goes out of scope, dead blocks are also deallocated. The lifetime of blocks is managed through 3 methods stored in the; descriptor of the block:. * **CtorFn**: initializes the metadata which is store in the block,; alongside actual data. Invokes the default constructors of objects; which are not trivial (``Pointer``, ``RealFP``, etc.). * **DtorFn**: invokes the destructors of non-trivial objects. * **MoveFn**: moves a block to dead storage.

Ideally, those nodes should not had been created, but; that time we did not know about the error, the error happened later. Since the; AST is immutable (most of the cases we can't remove existing nodes) we choose; to mark these nodes as erroneous.

If you are interested in doing physics, a good HEP framework will save; you much work. Next is a list of the more commonly used components of; ROOT: Command Line Interpreter, Histograms and Fitting, Writing a; Graphical User Interface, 2D Graphics, Input/Output , Collection; Classes, Script Processor. There are also less commonly used components, as: 3D Graphics,; Parallel Processing (PROOF), Run Time Type Identification (RTTI),; Socket and Network Communication, Threads. #### Advantages of Frameworks. The benefits of frameworks can be summarized as follows:. - Less code to write - the programmer should be able to use and; reuse the majority of the existing code. Basic functionality, such; as fitting and histogramming are implemented and ready to use and; customize. - More reliable and robust code - the code inherited from a; framework has already been tested and integrated with the rest of; the framework. - More consistent and modular code - the code reuse provides; consistency and common capabilities between programs, no matter; who writes them. Frameworks make it easier to break programs into; smaller pieces. - More focus on areas of expertise - users can concentrate on their; particular problem domain. They do not have to be experts at; writing user interfaces, graphics, or networking to use the; frameworks that provide those services. ### Why Object-Oriented?. Object-Oriented Programming offers considerable benefits compared to; Procedure-Oriented Programming:. - Encapsulation enforces data abstraction and increases opportunity; for reuse. - Sub classing and inheritance make it possible to extend and modify; objects. - Class hierarchies and containment containment hierarchies provide; a flexible mechanism for modeling real-world objects and the; relationships among them. - Complexity is reduced because there is ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md:7395,reliab,reliable,7395,documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Introduction.md,2,"['reliab', 'robust']","['reliable', 'robust']"

For symmetry reasons, ``ident.ll`` is just a dummy file that doesn't; actually participate in the test besides holding the ``RUN:`` lines. .. note::. Some existing tests use ``RUN: true`` in extra files instead of just; putting the extra files in an ``Inputs/`` directory. This pattern is; deprecated. Fragile tests; -------------. It is easy to write a fragile test that would fail spuriously if the tool being; tested outputs a full path to the input file. For example, :program:`opt` by; default outputs a ``ModuleID``:. .. code-block:: console. $ cat example.ll; define i32 @main() nounwind {; ret i32 0; }. $ opt -S /path/to/example.ll; ; ModuleID = '/path/to/example.ll'. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ret i32 0; }. ``ModuleID`` can unexpectedly match against ``CHECK`` lines. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: opt -S %s | FileCheck. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ; CHECK-NOT: load; ret i32 0; }. This test will fail if placed into a ``download`` directory. To make your tests robust, always use ``opt ... < %s`` in the RUN line.; :program:`opt` does not output a ``ModuleID`` when input comes from stdin. Platform-Specific Tests; -----------------------. Whenever adding tests that require the knowledge of a specific platform,; either related to code generated, specific output or back-end features,; you must make sure to isolate the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures.

Identifying pointers at run-time requires compiler support to; locate all places that hold live pointer variables at run-time, including the; :ref:`processor stack and registers <gcroot>`. Conservative garbage collection is attractive because it does not require any; special compiler support, but it does have problems. In particular, because the; conservative garbage collector cannot *know* that a particular word in the; machine is a pointer, it cannot move live objects in the heap (preventing the; use of compacting and generational GC algorithms) and it can occasionally suffer; from memory leaks due to integer values that happen to point to objects in the; program. In addition, some aggressive compiler transformations can break; conservative garbage collectors (though these seem rare in practice). Accurate garbage collectors do not suffer from any of these problems, but they; can suffer from degraded scalar optimization of the program. In particular,; because the runtime must be able to identify and update all pointers active in; the program, some optimizations are less effective. In practice, however, the; locality and performance benefits of using aggressive garbage collection; techniques dominates any low-level losses. This document describes the mechanisms and interfaces provided by LLVM to; support accurate garbage collection. Goals and non-goals; -------------------.

ContainsErrors bit; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Beyond the template dependence bits, we add a new “ContainsErrors” bit to; express “Does this expression or anything within it contain errors” semantic,; this bit is always set for RecoveryExpr, and propagated to other related nodes.; This provides a fast way to query whether any (recursive) child of an expression; had an error, which is often used to improve diagnostics. .. code-block:: C++. // C++; void recoveryExpr(int abc) {; unknownFunction(); // type-dependent, value-dependent, contains-errors. std::string(42).size(); // value-dependent, contains-errors,; // not type-dependent, as we know the type is std::string; }. .. code-block:: C. // C; void recoveryExpr(int abc) {; unknownVar + abc; // type-dependent, value-dependent, contains-errors; }.

If a file that has been not properly closed is opened again, it is; scanned and rebuilt according to the information in the record header.; The recovery algorithm reads the file and creates the saved objects in; memory according to the header information. It then rebuilds the; directory and file structure. If the file is opened in write mode, the; recovery makes the correction on disk when the file is closed; however; if the file is opened in read mode, the correction can not be written to; disk. You can also explicitly invoke the recovery procedure by calling; the `TFile::Recover()` method. You can recover the directory structure,; but you cannot save what you recovered to the file on disk. In the; following example, we interrupted and aborted the previous ROOT session,; causing the file not to be closed. When we start a new session and; attempt to open the file, it gives us an explanation and status on the; recovery attempt. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f(""demo.root""); Warning in <TFile::TFile>: file demo.root probably not closed, trying to recover successfully recovered 15 keys; ```. ## The Logical ROOT File: TFile and TKey. We saw that the `TFile::Map()` method reads the file sequentially and; prints information about each record while scanning the file. It is not; feasible to support only sequential access and hence ROOT provides; random or direct access, i.e. reading a specified object at a time. To; do so, `TFile` keeps a list of **`TKeys`**, which is; essentially an index to the objects in the file. The **`TKey`** class; describes the record headers of objects in the file. For example, we can; get the list of keys and print them. To find a specific object on the; file we can use the **`TFile::Get()` method.**. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f(""demo.root""); root[] f.GetListOfKeys()->Print(); TKey Name = h0, Title = histo nr:0, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:16104,recover,recovery,16104,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['recover'],['recovery']

The llvm_unreachable function can be used to document areas of control flow; that should never be entered if the program invariants hold:. .. code-block:: c++. enum { Foo, Bar, Baz } X = foo();. switch (X) {; case Foo: /* Handle Foo */; break;; case Bar: /* Handle Bar */; break;; default:; llvm_unreachable(""X should be Foo or Bar here"");; }. Recoverable Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error.

Here, the named constructor passes an ``Error`` by reference into the actual; constructor, which the constructor can then use to return errors. The; ``ErrorAsOutParameter`` utility sets the ``Error`` value's checked flag on entry; to the constructor so that the error can be assigned to, then resets it on exit; to force the client (the named constructor) to check the error.

To have a tool bar in your application you do not need to do anything; special - only to create objects: a tool bar and its picture buttons.; This sample code creates the following three toolbar buttons:. ![](pictures/03000218.png). First we need to complete a `ToolBarData_t` structure for each tool bar; button before adding it to the tool bar. This structure contains:. - the icon file name ""`filename.xpm`"". - the tool tip text - a short help message explaining the button; purpose. - the Boolean variable defining the button behavior when is clicked. - `kFALSE` - do not stay down. - `kTRUE` - to stay down. - the button ID. - the button pointer (**`TGButton *`**) - should be `NULL`. We create an array `*xpms[]` containing the icon file names that will be; used for a picture button creation. If you write only the file names; here ROOT will search these files in `$ROOTSYS/icons` directory. If the; icon files are not there, you should provide the full path name also.; The array `*tips[] `contains the tool tip texts for buttons. The integer; variable separator is used to set the distance between two groups of; toolbar buttons. It defines the amount of pixels to the left for each; button. We create a tool bar object and add the buttons using the `AddButton`; method. The variable separator helps us to define no space between the; buttons in a group (0), and 5 pixels extra-space before and after. All; buttons added via this method will be deleted by the toolbar.

This may normally happen; only if the parameter is so close to a limit (internal value at an odd; multiple of $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$ that `Minuit` prints a warning to this; effect when it prints the parameter values. The minimized can become; blocked at a limit, because at a limit the derivative seen by the; minimized $\frac{\partial F}{\partial Pint}$ is zero no matter what the real; derivative $\frac{\partial F}{\partial Pext}$ is. $$; \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial Pint}\right) =; \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial Pext}\right); \left(\frac{\partial Pext}{\partial Pint}\right) =; \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial Pext}\right) = 0; $$. #### Getting the Right Parameter Errors with Limits. In the best case, where the minimum is far from any limits, `Minuit`; will correctly transform the error matrix, and the parameter errors it; reports should be accurate and very close to those you would have got; without limits. In other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you would not need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. #### Interpretation of Parameter Errors. There are two kinds of problems that can arise: the reliability of; `Minuit`'s error estimates, and their statistical interpretation,; assuming they are accurate. #### Statistical Interpretation.

Reference to different views of the matrix can be created through the; classes on the right-hand side, see ""Matrix Views"". These references; provide a natural connection to vectors. Matrix decompositions (used in equation solving and matrix inversion); are available through the classes on the left-hand side (see ""Matrix; Decompositions""). They inherit from the **`TDecompBase`** class. The; Eigen Analysis is performed through the classes at the top, see ""Matrix; Eigen Analysis"". In both cases, only some matrix types can be analyzed.; For instance, **`TDecompChol`** will only accept symmetric matrices as; defined **`TMatrixDSym`**.

Availability,"ified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward. However, this; transformation is legal for all other rounding modes. For values other than ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes may assume that the; actual runtime rounding mode (as defined in a target-specific manner) matches; the specified rounding mode, but this is not guaranteed. Using a specific; non-dynamic rounding mode which does not match the actual rounding mode at; runtime results in undefined behavior. The exception behavior argument is a metadata string describing the floating; point exception semantics that required for the intrinsic. This argument; must be one of the following strings:. ::. ""fpexcept.ignore""; ""fpexcept.maytrap""; ""fpexcept.strict"". If this argument is ""fpexcept.ignore"" optimization passes may assume that the; exception status flags will not be read and that floating-point exceptions will; be masked. This allows transformations to be performed that may change the; exception semantics of the original code. For example, FP operations may be; speculatively executed in this case whereas they must not be for either of the; other possible values of this argument. If the exception behavior argument is ""fpexcept.maytrap"" optimization passes; must avoid transformations that may raise exceptions that would not have been; raised by the original code (such as speculatively executing FP operations), but; passes are not required to preserve all exceptions that are implied by the; original code. For example, exceptions may be potentially hidden by constant; folding.

Depending on the `name` argument, the function returns a **`TFile`** or one; of its derivations, for example a; **`TNetXNGFile`** or a **`TDavixFile`** object. In case a URL; specifies a local file, a **`TFile`** object will be returned (and of; course no login information is needed). The arguments of the `Open()`; function are the same as the ones for the **`TFile`** constructor. Using `ReOpen()` method it is possible to reopen a file with a; different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE,; RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either ""READ"" or; ""UPDATE"". The method returns:. - 0 in case the mode was successfully modified;. - 1 in case the mode did not change (it was already as requested or; there were wrong input arguments);. - -1 in case of failure. In the last case the file cannot be used; anymore. ## Remotely Access to ROOT Files. ROOT files can be accessed remotely in many ways, on the base of the protocol; URL. Among the most popular are XRootD (protocols 'root://' and 'xrd://') and; a Web server (protocl 'http://' or 'https://'). The rootd daemon is deprecated and has been removed in version 6.16/00. Please refer to the XRootD documentation for starting and ensuring that such a; daemon is running. Reading and writing ROOT files over the net can be done by creating a; **`TFile`** object using the static method **`TFile::Open()`** object.; This will instantiate the appropriate derivation of **`TFile`** to handle the; request. Inheriting from the **`TFile`** class, the returned instance will have; exactly the same interface and behavior of **`TFile`**.

Availability,"iler versions, and compiler vendors is technically infeasible. Using Modules; =============; To enable modules, pass the command-line flag ``-fmodules``. This will make any modules-enabled software libraries available as modules as well as introducing any modules-specific syntax. Additional `command-line parameters`_ are described in a separate section later. Standard C++ Modules; --------------------; .. note::; Modules are adopted into C++20 Standard. And its semantic and command line interface are very different from the Clang C++ modules. See `StandardCPlusPlusModules <StandardCPlusPlusModules.html>`_ for details. Objective-C Import declaration; ------------------------------; Objective-C provides syntax for importing a module via an *@import declaration*, which imports the named module:. .. parsed-literal::. @import std;. The ``@import`` declaration above imports the entire contents of the ``std`` module (which would contain, e.g., the entire C or C++ standard library) and make its API available within the current translation unit. To import only part of a module, one may use dot syntax to specific a particular submodule, e.g.,. .. parsed-literal::. @import std.io;. Redundant import declarations are ignored, and one is free to import modules at any point within the translation unit, so long as the import declaration is at global scope. At present, there is no C or C++ syntax for import declarations. Clang; will track the modules proposal in the C++ committee. See the section; `Includes as imports`_ to see how modules get imported today. Includes as imports; -------------------; The primary user-level feature of modules is the import operation, which provides access to the API of software libraries. However, today's programs make extensive use of ``#include``, and it is unrealistic to assume that all of this code will change overnight. Instead, modules automatically translate ``#include`` directives into the corresponding module import. For example, the include d",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:8581,avail,available,8581,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Definitions typically live in header files and symbols in libraries.; Headers can be loaded with ``cppyy.include`` and libraries with the; ``cppyy.load_library`` call.; Loading the header is sufficient to start exploring, with ``cppyy.gbl`` the; starting point of all things C++, while the linker symbols are only needed at ; the point of first use. Here is an example using the `zlib`_ library, which is likely available on; your system:. .. code-block:: python. >>> import cppyy; >>> cppyy.include('zlib.h') # bring in C++ definitions; >>> cppyy.load_library('libz') # load linker symbols; >>> cppyy.gbl.zlibVersion() # use a zlib API; '1.2.11'; >>>. Since header files can include other header files, it is easy to aggregate; all relevant ones into a single header to include.; If there are project-specific include paths, you can add those paths through; ``cppyy.add_include_path``.; If a header is C-only and not set for use with C++, use ``cppyy.c_include``,; which adds ``extern ""C""`` around the header. Library files can be aggregated by linking all relevant ones to a single; library to load.; Using the linker for this purpose allows regular system features such as; ``rpath`` and envars such as ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to be applied as usual.; Note that any mechanism that exposes the library symbols will work.; For example, you could also use the standard module ``ctypes`` through; ``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/starting.rst:1439,avail,available,1439,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/starting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/starting.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

It uses several techniques to reduce the; amount of code pushed through the LLVM code generator, to reduce the potential; scope of the problem. After it is finished, it emits two bitcode files (called; ""test"" [to be compiled with the code generator] and ""safe"" [to be compiled with; the ""safe"" backend], respectively), and instructions for reproducing the; problem. The code generator debugger assumes that the ""safe"" backend produces; good code. .. _miscompilation debugger:. Miscompilation debugger; -----------------------. The miscompilation debugger works similarly to the code generator debugger. It; works by splitting the test program into two pieces, running the optimizations; specified on one piece, linking the two pieces back together, and then executing; the result. It attempts to narrow down the list of passes to the one (or few); which are causing the miscompilation, then reduce the portion of the test; program which is being miscompiled. The miscompilation debugger assumes that; the selected code generator is working properly. Advice for using bugpoint; =========================. ``bugpoint`` can be a remarkably useful tool, but it sometimes works in; non-obvious ways. Here are some hints and tips:. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, ``bugpoint`` only works; with programs that have deterministic output. Thus, if the program outputs; ``argv[0]``, the date, time, or any other ""random"" data, ``bugpoint`` may; misinterpret differences in these data, when output, as the result of a; miscompilation. Programs should be temporarily modified to disable outputs; that are likely to vary from run to run. * In the `crash debugger`_, ``bugpoint`` does not distinguish different crashes; during reduction. Thus, if new crash or miscompilation happens, ``bugpoint``; will continue with the new crash instead.

Availability,"ility of Declarations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. During import of a global variable with external visibility, the lookup will; find variables (with the same name) but with static visibility (linkage).; Clearly, we cannot put them into the same redeclaration chain. The same is true; the in case of functions. Also, we have to take care of other kinds of; declarations like enums, classes, etc. if they are in anonymous namespaces.; Therefore, we filter the lookup results and consider only those which have the; same visibility as the declaration we currently import. We consider two declarations in two anonymous namespaces to have the same; visibility only if they are imported from the same AST context. Strategies to Handle Conflicting Names; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. During the import we lookup existing declarations with the same name. We filter; the lookup results based on their :ref:`visibility <visibility>`. If any of the; found declarations are not structurally equivalent then we bumped to a name; conflict error (ODR violation in C++). In this case, we return with an; ``Error`` and we set up the ``Error`` object for the declaration. However, some; clients of the ``ASTImporter`` may require a different, perhaps less; conservative and more liberal error handling strategy. E.g. static analysis clients may benefit if the node is created even if there; is a name conflict. During the CTU analysis of certain projects, we recognized; that there are global declarations which collide with declarations from other; translation units, but they are not referenced outside from their translation; unit. These declarations should be in an unnamed namespace ideally. If we treat; these collisions liberally then CTU analysis can find more results.

If there was an error during one import then we return with; that error. (Exception: when we import the members of a class, we collect the; individual errors with each member and we concatenate them in one Error; object.) We cache these errors in cases of declarations. During the next import; call if there is an existing error we just return with that. So, clients of the; library receive an Error object, which they must check.

Failing to do that will result in a memory leak, one of the; most common and most hard-to-find C++ bugs. To send a message to an object via a pointer to it, you need to use; the ""`->`"" operator e.g.:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; ```.

Fortunately, the compiler won't tolerate an attempt to do; something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr.Solve();; ```.

They can also be accessed via pointers:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] Quad stack_quad(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *stack_ptr = &stack_quad;; root[] stack_ptr->Solve();; ```.

The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid.

HLSL also allows omitting empty template; parameter lists when all template parameters are defaulted. This is an ambiguous; syntax in C++, but Clang detects the case and issues a diagnostic.

HLSL uses the OpenCL vector extensions, and also provides C++-style constructors; for vectors that are not supported by Clang. Standard Library; ----------------. HLSL does not support the C or C++ standard libraries. Like OpenCL, HLSL; describes its own library of built in types, complex data types, and functions. Unsupported C & C++ Features; ----------------------------. HLSL does not support all features of C and C++. In implementing HLSL in Clang; use of some C and C++ features will produce diagnostics under HLSL, and others; will be supported as language extensions. In general, any C or C++ feature that; can be supported by the DXIL and SPIR-V code generation targets could be treated; as a clang HLSL extension. Features that cannot be lowered to DXIL or SPIR-V,; must be diagnosed as errors. HLSL does not support the following C features:. * Pointers; * References; * ``goto`` or labels; * Variable Length Arrays; * ``_Complex`` and ``_Imaginary``; * C Threads or Atomics (or Obj-C blocks); * ``union`` types `(in progress for HLSL 202x) <https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/pull/4132>`_; * Most features C11 and later.

Hence the; code location of actual interest is usually the call site itself rather than; the return address, i.e. one instruction earlier. When presenting the source; location for a return address frame, the symbolizing filter will subtract one; byte or one instruction length from the actual return address for the call; site, with the intent that the address logged can be translated directly to a; source location for the call site and not for the apparent return site; thereafter (which can be confusing). When inlined functions are involved, the; call site and the return site can appear to be in different functions at; entirely unrelated source locations rather than just a line away, making the; confusion of showing the return site rather the call site quite severe. Often the first frame in a backtrace (""frame zero"") identifies the precise; code location of a fault, trap, or asynchronous interrupt rather than a return; address. At other times, even the first frame is actually a return address; (for example, backtraces collected at the time of an object allocation and; reported later when the allocated object is used or misused). When a system; supports in-thread trap handling, there may also be frames after the first; that represent a precise interrupted code location rather than a return; address, presented as the ""caller"" of a trap handler function (for example,; signal handlers in POSIX systems). Return address frames are identified by the ``:ra`` suffix. Precise code; location frames are identified by the ``:pc`` suffix.

Many; ""LLVM bugs"" that we have chased down ended up being bugs in the program being; compiled, not LLVM. Once you determine that the program itself is not buggy, you should choose; which code generator you wish to compile the program with (e.g. LLC or the JIT); and optionally a series of LLVM passes to run. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint -run-llc [... optzn passes ...] file-to-test.bc --args -- [program arguments]. bugpoint will try to narrow down your list of passes to the one pass that; causes an error, and simplify the bitcode file as much as it can to assist; you.

Like the ExitOnError utility, cantFail simplifies control flow. Their treatment; of error cases is very different however: Where ExitOnError is guaranteed to; terminate the program on an error input, cantFail simply asserts that the result; is success. In debug builds this will result in an assertion failure if an error; is encountered. In release builds the behavior of cantFail for failure values is; undefined. As such, care must be taken in the use of cantFail: clients must be; certain that a cantFail wrapped call really can not fail with the given; arguments.

We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #.

Availability,"ing a Tree. Writing a ROOT **`TTree`** in a Python session is a little convoluted,; if only because you will need a C++ class to make sure that data members; can be mapped, unless you are working with built-in types. Here is an; example for working with the latter only:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TFile, TTree; from array import array. h = TH1F('h1','test',100,-10.,10.); f = TFile('test.root','recreate'); t = TTree('t1','tree with histos'); maxn = 10; n = array('i',[0]); d = array('f',maxn*[0.]); t.Branch('mynum',n,'mynum/I'); t.Branch('myval',d,'myval[mynum]/F'). for i in range(25):; n[0] = min(i,maxn); for j in range(n[0]):; d[j] = i*0.1+j; t.Fill(). f.Write(); f.Close(); ```. The use of arrays is needed, because the pointer to the address of the; object that is used for filling must be given to the **`TTree::Branch()`**; call, even though the formal argument is declared a '`void*'`. In the; case of ROOT objects, similar pointer manipulation is unnecessary,; because the full type information is available, and `TTree::Branch()`; has been Pythonized to take care of the call details. However, data; members of such objects that are of built-in types, still require; something extra since they are normally translated to Python primitive; types on access and hence their address cannot be taken. For that; purpose, there is the `AddressOf()` function. As an example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TFile, TTree; from ROOT import gROOT, AddressOf. gROOT.ProcessLine(; ""struct MyStruct { Int_t fMyInt1; Int_t fMyInt2; Int_t fMyInt3; Char_t fMyCode[4]; };"" );. from ROOT import MyStruct; mystruct = MyStruct(); f = TFile('mytree.root','RECREATE'); tree = TTree('T','Just A Tree'); tree.Branch('myints',mystruct,'MyInt1/I:MyInt2:MyInt3'); tree.Branch('mycode',AddressOf(mystruct,'fMyCode'),'MyCode/C'); for i in range(0,10):; mystruct.fMyInt1 = i; mystruct.fMyInt2 = i*i; mystruct.fMyInt3 = i*i*i; mystruct.fMyCode = ""%03d"" % i # note string assignment. tree.Fill(). f.Write(); f.Close(); ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:31065,avail,available,31065,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"ing function; parameters, are treated as single object pointers (i.e., ``__single``), ensuring; that they always have the tightest bounds by default and offering a strong; bounds safety guarantee. By implementing default bounds annotations based on ABI visibility, a; considerable portion of C code can operate without modifications within this; programming model, reducing the adoption burden. The rest of the section will discuss individual bounds annotations and the; programming model in more detail. Bounds annotations; ------------------. Annotation for pointers to a single object; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The C language allows pointer arithmetic on arbitrary pointers and this has been; a source of many bounds safety issues. In practice, many pointers are merely; pointing to a single object and incrementing or decrementing such a pointer; immediately makes the pointer go out-of-bounds. To prevent this unsafety,; ``-fbounds-safety`` provides the annotation ``__single`` that causes pointer; arithmetic on annotated pointers to be a compile time error. * ``__single`` : indicates that the pointer is either pointing to a single; object or null. Hence, pointers with ``__single`` do not permit pointer; arithmetic nor being subscripted with a non-zero index. Dereferencing a; ``__single`` pointer is allowed but it requires a null check. Upper and lower; bounds checks are not required because the ``__single`` pointer should point; to a valid object unless it's null. ``__single`` is the default annotation for ABI-visible pointers. This; gives strong security guarantees in that these pointers cannot be incremented or; decremented unless they have an explicit, overriding bounds annotation that can; be used to verify the safety of the operation. The compiler issues an error when; a ``__single`` pointer is utilized for pointer arithmetic or array access, as; these operations would immediately cause the pointer to exceed its bounds.; Consequently, this prompts pro",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:7595,error,error,7595,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['error'],['error']

If no mitigating adjective is given, then at least `Minuit` believes; the errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that; `Minuit` has been fooled. Some visible signs that `Minuit` may have; been fooled:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error; analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of EDM too big (estimated Distance to Minimum). - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parameterized so that individual errors are; not very meaningful because they are so highly correlated. - Parameter at limit. This condition, signaled by a `Minuit` warning; message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors; unreliable.

LLVM is currently ineffective at statically eliminating allocations; after fully inlining returned-continuation coroutines into a caller.; This may be acceptable if LLVM's coroutine support is primarily being; used for low-level lowering and inlining is expected to be applied; earlier in the pipeline. Async Lowering; --------------. In async-continuation lowering, signaled by the use of `llvm.coro.id.async`,; handling of control-flow must be handled explicitly by the frontend. In this lowering, a coroutine is assumed to take the current `async context` as; one of its arguments (the argument position is determined by; `llvm.coro.id.async`). It is used to marshal arguments and return values of the; coroutine. Therefore an async coroutine returns `void`. .. code-block:: llvm. define swiftcc void @async_coroutine(ptr %async.ctxt, ptr, ptr) {; }. Values live across a suspend point need to be stored in the coroutine frame to; be available in the continuation function. This frame is stored as a tail to the; `async context`. Every suspend point takes an `context projection function` argument which; describes how-to obtain the continuations `async context` and every suspend; point has an associated `resume function` denoted by the; `llvm.coro.async.resume` intrinsic. The coroutine is resumed by calling this; `resume function` passing the `async context` as the one of its arguments; argument. The `resume function` can restore its (the caller's) `async context`; by applying a `context projection function` that is provided by the frontend as; a parameter to the `llvm.coro.suspend.async` intrinsic. .. code-block:: c. // For example:; struct async_context {; struct async_context *caller_context;; ...; }. char *context_projection_function(struct async_context *callee_ctxt) {; return callee_ctxt->caller_context;; }. .. code-block:: llvm. %resume_func_ptr = call ptr @llvm.coro.async.resume(); call {",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Coroutines.rst:8282,avail,available,8282,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Coroutines.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Coroutines.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

ContainsErrors bit; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Beyond the template dependence bits, we add a new “ContainsErrors” bit to; express “Does this expression or anything within it contain errors” semantic,; this bit is always set for RecoveryExpr, and propagated to other related nodes.; This provides a fast way to query whether any (recursive) child of an expression; had an error, which is often used to improve diagnostics. .. code-block:: C++. // C++; void recoveryExpr(int abc) {; unknownFunction(); // type-dependent, value-dependent, contains-errors. std::string(42).size(); // value-dependent, contains-errors,; // not type-dependent, as we know the type is std::string; }. .. code-block:: C. // C; void recoveryExpr(int abc) {; unknownVar + abc; // type-dependent, value-dependent, contains-errors; }.

First, we must store the flags to the; stack and reload them. Second, this causes the stack pointer to be adjusted; dynamically, requiring a frame pointer be used for referring to temporaries; spilled to the stack, etc. On newer x86 processors we can use the `lahf` and `sahf` instructions to save; all of the flags besides the overflow flag in a register rather than on the; stack. We can then use `seto` and `add` to save and restore the overflow flag; in a register. Combined, this will save and restore flags in the same manner as; above but using two registers rather than the stack. That is still very; expensive if slightly less expensive than `pushf` and `popf` in most cases. ###### A flag-less alternative on Haswell, Zen and newer processors. Starting with the BMI2 x86 instruction set extensions available on Haswell and; Zen processors, there is an instruction for shifting that does not set any; flags: `shrx`. We can use this and the `lea` instruction to implement analogous; code sequences to the above ones. However, these are still very marginally; slower, as there are fewer ports able to dispatch shift instructions in most; modern x86 processors than there are for `or` instructions.

To install ROOT you have the choice to; download the binaries or the source. The source is quicker to transfer; since it is only \~22 MB, but you will need to compile and link it. The; binaries compiled with no debug information range from \~35 MB to \~45; MB depending on the target platform. The installation and building of ROOT is described in Appendix A:; Install and Build ROOT. You can download the binaries, or the source.; The GNU g++ compiler on most UNIX platforms can compile ROOT. Before downloading a binary version make sure your machine contains the; right run-time environment. In most cases it is not possible to run a; version compiled with, e.g., gcc4.0 on a platform where only gcc 3.2 is; installed. In such cases you'll have to install ROOT from source.

One; possible way to achieve that is to add ``-target; aarch64-linux -march=armv8+memtag`` to compilation flags. Implementation; ==============. See `HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizer`_ for a general overview of a; tag-based approach to memory safety. MemTagSanitizer follows a; similar implementation strategy, but with the tag storage (shadow); provided by the hardware. A quick overview of MTE hardware capabilities:. * Every 16 aligned bytes of memory can be assigned a 4-bit Allocation Tag.; * Every pointer can have a 4-bit Address Tag that is in its most significant byte.; * Most memory access instructions generate an exception if Address Tag != Allocation Tag.; * Special instructions are provided for fast tag manipulation. Stack instrumentation; =====================. Stack-based memory errors are detected by updating Allocation Tag for; each local variable to a random value at the start of its lifetime,; and resetting it to the stack pointer Address Tag at the end of; it. Unallocated stack space is expected to match the Address Tag of; SP; this allows to skip tagging of any variable when memory safety can; be statically proven. Allocating a truly random tag for each stack variable in a large; function may incur significant code size overhead, because it means; that each variable's address is an independent, non-rematerializable; value; thus a function with N local variables will have extra N live; values to keep through most of its life time. For this reason MemTagSanitizer generates at most one random tag per; function, called a ""base tag"". Other stack variables, if there are; any, are assigned tags at a fixed offset from the base.

Availability,"ins along X and variable size bins; along Y or vice-versa. The functions to fill, manipulate, draw, or; access histograms are identical in both cases. ### Convention. For all histogram types: `nbins` , `xlow` , `xup`. Bin\# 0 contains the underflow. Bin\# 1 contains the first bin with low-edge ( `xlow` INCLUDED). The second to last bin (bin\# `nbins`) contains the upper-edge; (`xup` EXCLUDED). The Last bin (bin\# `nbins+1)` contains the overflow. In case of 2-D or 3-D histograms, a ""global bin"" number is defined.; For example, assuming a 3-D histogram `h` with `binx`, `biny`, `binz`,; the function returns a global/linear bin number. ``` {.cpp}; Int_t bin = h->GetBin(binx, biny, binz);; ```. This global bin is useful to access the bin information independently; of the dimension. ### Re-binning; \index{histogram!rebin}. At any time, a histogram can be re-binned via the **`TH1`**`::Rebin()`; method. It returns a new histogram with the re-binned contents. If bin; errors were stored, they are recomputed during the re-binning. ## Filling Histograms. A histogram is typically filled with statements like:. ``` {.cpp}; h1->Fill(x);; h1->Fill(x,w); // with weight; h2->Fill(x,y);; h2->Fill(x,y,w);; h3->Fill(x,y,z);; h3->Fill(x,y,z,w);; ```. The `Fill` method computes the bin number corresponding to the given; x, y or z argument and increments this bin by the given weight. The; `Fill()` method returns the bin number for 1-D histograms or global; bin number for 2-D and 3-D histograms. If **`TH1`**`::Sumw2()` has; been called before filling, the sum of squares is also stored. One can; increment a bin number directly by calling; **`TH1`**`::AddBinContent()`, replace the existing content via; **`TH1`**`::SetBinContent()` , and access the bin content of a given; bin via **`TH1`**`::GetBinContent()` . ``` {.cpp}; Double_t binContent = h->GetBinContent(bin);; ```. ### Automatic Re-binning Option.

A ``RecordVal`` instance can be printed to an output stream with the ``<<``; operator. ``RecTy``; ---------. The ``RecTy`` class is used to represent the types of field values. It is; the base class for a series of subclasses, one for each of the; available field types. The ``RecTy`` class has one data member that is an; enumerated type specifying the specific type of field value. (A better; name for this class might be ``FieldTy``.). The ``RecTy`` class provides a few useful functions. * A virtual function to get the type name as a string. * A virtual function to check whether all the values of this type can; be converted to another given type. * A virtual function to check whether this type is a subtype of; another given type. * A function to get the corresponding ``list``; type for lists with elements of this type. For example, the function; returns the ``list<int>`` type when called with the ``int`` type. The subclasses that inherit from ``RecTy`` are; ``BitRecTy``,; ``BitsRecTy``,; ``CodeRecTy``,; ``DagRecTy``,; ``IntRecTy``,; ``ListRecTy``,; ``RecordRecTy``, and; ``StringRecTy``.; Some of these classes have additional members that; are described in the following subsections. *All* of the classes de",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/BackGuide.rst:6068,avail,available,6068,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/BackGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/BackGuide.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

The verbosity can therefore be adjusted using; RooMsgService::instance().getStream(2).minLevel = RooFit::PROGRESS;. `hist2workspace` is also much less verbose.

Availability,"instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it. However, the loader and base libraries can also; simply refuse to map the heap, data segments, or stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again make everything hard. Unfortunately, the technique of using `orq`-instructions has a serious flaw on; x86. The very thing that makes it easy to accumulate state, the flag registers; containing predicates, causes serious problems here because they may be alive; and used by the loading instruction or subsequent instructions. On x86, the; `orq` instruction **sets** the flags and will override anything already there.; This makes inserting them into the instruction stream very hazardous.; Unfortunately, unlike when hardening the loaded value, we have no fallback here; and so we must have a fully general approach available. The first thing we must do when generating these sequences is try to analyze; the surrounding code to prove that the flags are not in fact alive or being; used. Typically, it has been set by some other instruction which just happens; to set the flags register (much like ours!) with no actual dependency. In those; cases, it is safe to directly insert these instructions. Alternatively we may; be able to move them earlier to avoid clobbering the used value. However, this may ultimately be impossible. In that case, we need to preserve; the flags around these instructions:; ```; ... .LBB",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:31453,alive,alive,31453,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['alive'],['alive']

Only some options apply only for fitting histograms,; these are the options ""`L`"", ""`WL`"" and ""`I`"".; These options apply instead only for `TGraph::Fit`, the rest of options (appart from ""`L`"", ""`WL`"" and ""`I`"" are the same). * `TGraph` specific *options*. 	- ""`EX0`"" When fitting a `TGraphErrors` or a `TgraphAsymErrors` the errors on the coordinates are not used in the fit. 	- ""`ROB`"" in case of linear fitting use the Robust fitting. Compute the LTS regression coefficients (robust (resistant) regression),; using the default fraction of good points.; 	- ""`ROB=0.x`"" as above, but compute the LTS regression coefficients, using 0.x as a fraction of good points. ## The `TF1` function class. Here we will show how to create the **`TF1`** class that is used for fitting histograms and graphs. ### Fit with a Predefined Function. To fit a histogram with a predefined function, simply pass the name of; the function in the first parameter of `TH1::Fit`. For example,; this line fits histogram object `hist` with a Gaussian. ``` {.cpp}; root[] hist.Fit(""gaus"");; ```. The initial parameter values (and eventual limits) for pre-defined functions are set; automatically. For overriding the default limits values use the fit option `B`. The list of pre-defined functions that can be used with the `Fit` method is the following:. - ""`gaus`"" Gaussian function with 3 parameters:; `f(x) = p0*exp(-0.5*((x-p1)/p2)^2)`. - ""`expo`""An Exponential with 2 parameters: `f(x) = exp(p0+p1*x)`. - ""`pol`*`N`*"" A p",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:4038,robust,robust,4038,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['robust'],['robust']

Instead of creating one TBasket object and one TBuffer object and its associated memory buffer; for each onfile basket of each branch, we now create only one TBasket and one TBuffer object for the lifetime of; each branch. The memory buffer associated with the TBuffer object is also created once and rarely reallocated;; it is reallocated only when the buffer size is reset (for example by the AutoFlush mechanism) and when the user; object do not fit in the currently allocated memory (but we do not shrink it after that.

Availability,"ion are implemented. The default is; linear error propagation, and results in an error band that is by; construction symmetric. The linear error is calculated as. error(x) = Z* F_a(x) * Corr(a,a') F_a'(x). where F_a(x) = [ f(x,a+da) - f(x,a-da) ] / 2,. with f(x) = the plotted curve; 'da' = error taken from the fit result; Corr(a,a') = the correlation matrix from the fit result; Z = requested significance 'Z sigma band'. The linear method is fast (requires 2*N evaluations of the curve,; where N is the number of parameters), but may not be accurate in the; presence of strong correlations (~>0.9) and at Z>2 due to linear and; Gaussian approximations made. Alternatively, errors can be visualized using a sampling method. In; this method a number of curves is calculated with variations of the; parameter values, as sampled from a multi-variate Gaussian p.d.f. that; is constructed from the fit results covariance matrix. The error(x); is determined by calculating a central interval that capture N% of the; variations for each value of x, where N% is controlled by Z (i.e. Z=1; gives N=68%). The number of sampling curves is chosen to be such that; at least 100 curves are expected to be outside the N% interval. Intervals from; the sampling method can be asymmetric, and may perform better in the; presence of strong correlations, but may take (much) longer to; calculate. The sampling method also assumes that the uncertainty on the; parameters can modeled by a multi-variate Gaussian distribution. A complete example is provided in a new tutorial macro rf610_visualerror.C,; the output of which is shown below. It is also possible to visualize partial errors (from a subset of the parameters),; as shown above. Binned dataset generation.

Such a value contains; information about the number of active lanes, the element width and a bit that; tells whether the generated mask should be inverted. ACLE intrinsics should be; used to move the predicate-as-counter value to/from a predicate vector. There are certain limitations on the type:. * The type can be used for function parameters and return values. * The supported LLVM operations on this type are limited to ``load``, ``store``,; ``phi``, ``select`` and ``alloca`` instructions.

Due to a bug in its implementation, GCC allows implicit downcasts; of Objective-C pointers (from a base class to a derived class) when; calling functions. Such code is inherently unsafe, since the object; might not actually be an instance of the derived class, and is; rejected by Clang. For example, given this code:. @interface Base @end; @interface Derived : Base @end. void f(Derived *p);; void g(Base *p) {; f(p);; }. Clang produces the following error:. downcast.mm:6:3: error: no matching function for call to 'f'; f(p);; ^; downcast.mm:4:6: note: candidate function not viable: cannot convert from; superclass 'Base *' to subclass 'Derived *' for 1st argument; void f(Derived *p);; ^. If the downcast is actually correct (e.g., because the code has; already checked that the object has the appropriate type), add an; explicit cast:. f((Derived *)base);. Using class as a property name. In C and Objective-C, class is a normal identifier and; can be used to name fields, ivars, methods, and so on. In; C++, class is a keyword. For compatibility with existing; code, Clang permits class to be used as part of a method; selector in Objective-C++, but this does not extend to any other part; of the language. In particular, it is impossible to use property dot; syntax in Objective-C++ with the property name class, so; the following code will fail to parse:. @interface I {; int cls;; }; + (int)class;; @end. @implementation I; - (int) ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html:22394,error,error,22394,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html,1,['error'],['error']

This condition, signalled by a M warning; message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors; unreliable. See section [answer:right-errors], *Getting the right; parameter errors with limits*. The best way to be absolutely sure of the errors, is to use; ""independent"" calculations and compare them, or compare the calculated; errors with a picture of the function if possible. For example, if there; is only one free parameter, $\mbox{SCAN}$ allows the user to verify; approximately the function curvature. Similarly, if there are only two; free parameters, use $\mbox{CONTOURS}$. To verify a full error; matrix, compare the results of $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ with those; (calculated afterward) by $\mbox{HESSE}$, which uses a different; method.

AArch64 has `Address Tagging`_ (or top-byte-ignore, TBI), a hardware feature that allows; software to use the 8 most significant bits of a 64-bit pointer as; a tag. HWASAN uses `Address Tagging`_; to implement a memory safety tool, similar to :doc:`AddressSanitizer`,; but with smaller memory overhead and slightly different (mostly better); accuracy guarantees. Intel's `Linear Address Masking`_ (LAM) also provides address tagging for; x86_64, though it is not widely available in hardware yet. For x86_64, HWASAN; has a limited implementation using page aliasing instead. Algorithm; =========; * Every heap/stack/global memory object is forcibly aligned by `TG` bytes; (`TG` is e.g. 16 or 64). We call `TG` the **tagging granularity**.; * For every such object a random `TS`-bit tag `T` is chosen (`TS`, or tag size, is e.g. 4 or 8); * The pointer to the object is tagged with `T`.; * The memory for the object is also tagged with `T` (using a `TG=>1` shadow memory); * Every load and store is instrumented to read the memory tag and compare it; with the pointer tag, exception is raised on tag mismatch.

MIR patterns use the DAG datatype in TableGen. .. code-block:: text.

Semantics:. * A typed operand always adds an operand type check to the matcher.; * There is a trivial type inference system to propagate types. * e.g. You only need to use ``i32:$x`` once in any pattern of a; ``GICombinePatFrag`` alternative or ``GICombineRule``, then all; other patterns in that rule/alternative can simply use ``$x``; (``i32:$x`` is redundant). * A named operand's behavior depends on whether the name has been seen before. * For match patterns, reusing an operand name checks that the operands; are identical (see example 2 below).; * For apply patterns, reusing an operand name simply copies that operand into; the new instruction (see example 2 below). Operands are ordered just like they would be in a MachineInstr: the defs (outs); come first, then the uses (ins). Patterns are generally grouped into another DAG datatype with a dummy operator; such as ``match``, ``apply`` or ``pattern``. Finally, any DAG datatype in TableGen can be named.

Availability,"is the most important class in the LLVM Source base. It; represents a typed value that may be used (among other things) as an operand to; an instruction. There are many different types of ``Value``\ s, such as; Constant_\ s, Argument_\ s. Even Instruction_\ s and :ref:`Function; <c_Function>`\ s are ``Value``\ s. A particular ``Value`` may be used many times in the LLVM representation for a; program. For example, an incoming argument to a function (represented with an; instance of the Argument_ class) is ""used"" by every instruction in the function; that references the argument. To keep track of this relationship, the ``Value``; class keeps a list of all of the ``User``\ s that is using it (the User_ class; is a base class for all nodes in the LLVM graph that can refer to ``Value``\ s).; This use list is how LLVM represents def-use information in the program, and is; accessible through the ``use_*`` methods, shown below. Because LLVM is a typed representation, every LLVM ``Value`` is typed, and this; Type_ is available through the ``getType()`` method. In addition, all LLVM; values can be named.

For this purpose, use a; ``std::map`` of pointers to the ``Value`` itself instead. One important aspect of LLVM is that there is no distinction between an SSA; variable and the operation that produces it.

Availability,"isExpect diagnostics are intended to help developers identify and address; these situations, by comparing the branch weights added by the ``llvm.expect``; intrinsic to those collected through profiling. Whenever these values are; mismatched, a diagnostic is surfaced to the user. Details on how the checks; operate in the LLVM backed can be found in LLVM's documentation. By default MisExpect checking is quite strict, because the use of the; ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic is designed for specialized cases, where the outcome; of a condition is severely skewed. As a result, the optimizer can be extremely; aggressive, which can result in performance degradation if the outcome is less; predictable than the annotation suggests. Even when the annotation is correct; 90% of the time, it may be beneficial to either remove the annotation or to use; a different intrinsic that can communicate the probability more directly. Because this may be too strict, MisExpect diagnostics are not enabled by; default, and support an additional flag to tolerate some deviation from the; exact thresholds. The ``-fdiagnostic-misexpect-tolerance=N`` accepts; deviations when comparing branch weights within ``N%`` of the expected values.; So passing ``-fdiagnostic-misexpect-tolerance=5`` will not report diagnostic messages; if the branch weight from the profile is within 5% of the weight added by; the ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic.

This transform happens at the ``MachineInstr`` level, not the LLVM IR; level (so the above example is only representative, not literal). The; ``ImplicitNullChecks`` pass runs during codegen, if; ``-enable-implicit-null-checks`` is passed to ``llc``. The ``ImplicitNullChecks`` pass adds entries to the; ``__llvm_faultmaps`` section described above as needed. ``make.implicit`` metadata; --------------------------. Making null checks implicit is an aggressive optimization, and it can; be a net performance pessimization if too many memory operations end; up faulting because of it. A language runtime typically needs to; ensure that only a negligible number of implicit null checks actually; fault once the application has reached a steady state. A standard way; of doing this is by healing failed implicit null checks into explicit; null checks via code patching or recompilation. It follows that there; are two requirements an explicit null check needs to satisfy for it to; be profitable to convert it to an implicit null check:. 1. The case where the pointer is actually null (i.e. the ""failing""; case) is extremely rare. 2. The failing path heals the implicit null check into an explicit; null check so that the application does not repeatedly page; fault. The frontend is expected to mark branches that satisfy (1) and (2); using a ``!make.implicit`` metadata node (the actual content of the; metadata node is ignored). Only branches that are marked with; ``!make.implicit`` metadata are considered as candidates for; conversion into implicit null checks.

The masked-off lanes in the result vector are taken from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is a vector of pointers which holds all memory addresses to read. The second operand is an alignment of the source addresses. It must be 0 or a power of two constant integer value. The third operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values with the same number of elements as the return type. The fourth is a pass-through value that is used to fill the masked-off lanes of the result. The return type, underlying type of the vector of pointers and the type of the '``passthru``' operand are the same vector types. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.gather``' intrinsic is designed for conditional reading of multiple scalar values from arbitrary memory locations in a single IR operation. It is useful for targets that support vector masked gathers and allows vectorizing basic blocks with data and control divergence. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of scalar load operations.; The semantics of this operation are equivalent to a sequence of conditional scalar loads with subsequent gathering all loaded values into a single vector. The mask restricts memory access to certain lanes and facilitates vectorization of predicated basic blocks. ::. %res = call <4 x double> @llvm.masked.gather.v4f64.v4p0(<4 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 8, <4 x i1> <i1 true, i1 true, i1 true, i1 true>, <4 x double> poison). ;; The gather with all-true mask is equivalent to the following instruction sequence; %ptr0 = extractelement <4 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 0; %ptr1 = extractelement <4 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 1; %ptr2 = extractelement <4 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 2; %ptr3 = extractelement <4 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 3. %val0 = load double, ptr %ptr0, align 8; %val1 = load double, ptr %ptr1, align 8; %val2 = load double, ptr %ptr2, align",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:850295,mask,masked,850295,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['mask'],['masked']

Upper and lower; bounds checks are not required because the ``__single`` pointer should point; to a valid object unless it's null. ``__single`` is the default annotation for ABI-visible pointers.

Actions; typically pass control to a *landing pad*. A landing pad corresponds roughly to the code found in the ``catch`` portion of; a ``try``/``catch`` sequence. When execution resumes at a landing pad, it; receives an *exception structure* and a *selector value* corresponding to the; *type* of exception thrown. The selector is then used to determine which *catch*; should actually process the exception. LLVM Code Generation; ====================. From a C++ developer's perspective, exceptions are defined in terms of the; ``throw`` and ``try``/``catch`` statements. In this section we will describe the; implementation of LLVM exception handling in terms of C++ examples. Throw; -----. Languages that support exception handling typically provide a ``throw``; operation to initiate the exception process. Internally, a ``throw`` operation; breaks down into two steps. #. A request is made to allocate exception space for an exception structure.; This structure needs to survive beyond the current activation. This structure; will contain the type and value of the object being thrown. #. A call is made to the runtime to raise the exception, passing the exception; structure as an argument. In C++, the allocation of the exception structure is done by the; ``__cxa_allocate_exception`` runtime function. The exception raising is handled; by ``__cxa_throw``. The type of the exception is represented using a C++ RTTI; structure. Try/Catch; ---------. A call within the scope of a *try* statement can potentially raise an; exception. In those circumstances, the LLVM C++ front-end replaces the call with; an ``invoke`` instruction. Unlike a call, the ``invoke`` has two potential; continuation points:. #. where to continue when the call succeeds as per normal, and. #. where to continue if the call raises an exception, either by a throw",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:6199,down,down,6199,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"iting. For simple cases like the above, inspecting the value of the `__coro_index`; variable in the coroutine frame works well. However, it is not quite so simple in really complex situations. In these; cases, it is necessary to use the coroutine libraries to insert the; line-number. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // For all the promise_type we want:; class promise_type {; ...; + unsigned line_number = 0xffffffff;; };. #include <source_location>. // For all the awaiter types we need:; class awaiter {; ...; template <typename Promise>; void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<Promise> handle,; std::source_location sl = std::source_location::current()) {; ...; handle.promise().line_number = sl.line();; }; };. In this case, we use `std::source_location` to store the line number of the; await inside the `promise_type`. Since we can locate the coroutine function; from the address of the coroutine, we can identify suspended points this way; as well. The downside here is that this comes at the price of additional runtime cost.; This is consistent with the C++ philosophy of ""Pay for what you use"". Get the asynchronous stack; ==========================. Another important requirement to debug a coroutine is to print the asynchronous; stack to identify the asynchronous caller of the coroutine. As many; implementations of coroutine types store `std::coroutine_handle<> continuation`; in the promise type, identifying the caller should be trivial. The; `continuation` is typically the awaiting coroutine for the current coroutine.; That is, the asynchronous parent. Since the `promise_type` is obtainable from the address of a coroutine and; contains the corresponding continuation (which itself is a coroutine with a; `promise_type`), it should be trivial to print the entire asynchronous stack. This logic should be quite easily captured in a debugger script. Examples to print asynchronous stack; ------------------------------------.

Availability,"itoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; therefore there is no guarantee that the file content is not changed/replaced between consequent read operations. Therefore, one should expect frequent I/O failures while trying to monitor data from ROOT binary files. There is a workaround for the problem - one could load the file completely and exclude many partial I/O operations by this. To achieve this with JSROOT, one should add ""+"" sign at the end of the file name. Of course, it only could work for small files. If somebody still wants to use monitoring of data from ROOT files, could try link like:. - <https://root.cern/js/latest/?nobrowser&file=../files/hsimple.root+&item=hpx;1&monitoring=2000>. In this particular case, the histogram is not changing. ## JSROOT API. JSROOT can be used in arbitrary HTML pages to display data, produced with or without ROOT-based applications. Many different examples of JSROOT API usage can be found on [JSROOT API examples](https://root.cern/js/latest/api.htm) page. ### Import JSROOT functionality.

Unit tests are relatively small and quick programs focused to check if; small pieces of code and API work as expected. Integration tests are checks; which ensure the synergy between different (unit tested) components. Put in; practice, unit tests verify (member) function behavior whereas integration tests; check classes and their cooperation. The boundary between both kinds of testing; is blurred. ROOT has support for both kinds of tests in the [roottest repository](https://github.com/root-project/roottest); and supports ""inline"" unit tests in each component's `test` folder. Unit testing; uses the [GTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest) infrastructure; along with small ROOT-specific extensions located in; [TestSupport](../core/test_support/). The documentation of GTest; and GMock is rather extensive and we will describe some of the features of; ROOT::TestSupport. In order to write an inline unit test, add a new file in the; nearest to the tested component's `test` folder and call `ROOT_ADD_GTEST` in the; `CMakeLists.txt` file. In many cases using standard GTest facility is sufficient to write a good test.; However, we disallow error messages in gtests, or sometimes we want to test the; error conditions of an interface and its diagnostics. For example,. ```cpp. void MyROOTFunc(unsigned x); {; if (x == 0) {; Error(""MyROOTFunc"", ""x should be greater than 0!"");; return;; }; /* some work */; }. ```. In order to check if the error is printed on the right spot we can write the; following test:. ```cpp. #include ""ROOT/TestSupport.hxx"". #include ""gtest/gtest.h"". TEST(MyROOTFunc, ErrorCases); {; ROOT_EXPECT_ERROR(MyROOTFunc(0), ""MyROOTFunc"", ""x should be greater than 0!"");; // Also ROOT_EXPECT_WARNING, ROOT_EXPECT_INFO, ROOT_EXPECT_NODIAG and ROOT_EXPECT_SYSERROR available.; }. ```.

Their treatment; of error cases is very different however: Where ExitOnError is guaranteed to; terminate the program on an error input, cantFail simply asserts that the result; is success. In debug builds this will result in an assertion failure if an error; is encountered. In release builds the behavior of cantFail for failure values is; undefined. As such, care must be taken in the use of cantFail: clients must be; certain that a cantFail wrapped call really can not fail with the given; arguments. Use of the cantFail functions should be rare in library code, but they are; likely to be of more use in tool and unit-test code where inputs and/or; mocked-up classes or functions may be known to be safe. Fallible constructors; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Some classes require resource acquisition or other complex initialization that; can fail during construction. Unfortunately constructors can't return errors,; and having clients test objects after they're constructed to ensure that they're; valid is error prone as it's all too easy to forget the test. To work around; this, use the named constructor idiom and return an ``Expected<T>``:. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo {; public:. static Expected<Foo> Create(Resource R1, Resource R2) {; Error Err = Error::success();; Foo F(R1, R2, Err);; if (Err); return std::move(Err);; return std::move(F);; }. private:. Foo(Resource R1, Resource R2, Error &Err) {; ErrorAsOutParameter EAO(&Err);; if (auto Err2 = R1.acquire()) {; Err = std::move(Err2);; return;; }; Err = R2.acquire();; }; };. Here, the named constructor passes an ``Error`` by reference into the actual; constructor, which the constructor can then use to return errors. The; ``ErrorAsOutParameter`` utility sets the ``Error`` value's checked flag on entry; to the constructor so that the error can be assigned to, then resets it on exit; to force the client (the named constructor) to check the error.

It should simplify building the CFG and my guess is it could; enable some significant optimizations, though we should think about which. o In the lookup-indirect form of the switch, is there a reason not to make; the val-type uint? Most HLL switch statements (including Java and C++); require that anyway. And it would also make the val-type uniform ; in the two forms of the switch. I did see the switch-on-bool examples and, while cute, we can just use; the branch instructions in that particular case. o I agree with your comment that we don't need 'neg'. o There's a trade-off with the cast instruction:; + it avoids having to define all the upcasts and downcasts that are; valid for the operands of each instruction (you probably have thought; of other benefits also); - it could make the bytecode significantly larger because there could; be a lot of cast operations. o Making the second arg. to 'shl' a ubyte seems good enough to me.; 255 positions seems adequate for several generations of machines; and is more compact than uint. o I still have some major concerns about including malloc and free in the; language (either as builtin functions or instructions).

You need to have gold with plugin support and build the LLVMgold plugin.; The gold linker is installed as ld.gold. To see whether gold is the default; on your system, run ``/usr/bin/ld -v``. It will report ""GNU; gold"" or else ""GNU ld"" if not. If gold is already installed at; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold``, one option is to simply make that the default by; backing up your existing ``/usr/bin/ld`` and creating a symbolic link; with ``ln -s /usr/bin/ld.gold /usr/bin/ld``. Alternatively, you can build; with clang's ``-fuse-ld=gold`` or add ``-fuse-ld=gold`` to LDFLAGS, which will; cause the clang driver to invoke ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` directly. If you have gold installed, check for plugin support by running; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold -plugin``. If it complains ""missing argument"" then; you have plugin support. If not, and you get an error such as ""unknown option"",; then you will either need to build gold or install a version with plugin; support. * Download, configure and build gold with plugin support:. .. code-block:: bash. $ git clone --depth 1 git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git binutils; $ mkdir build; $ cd build; $ ../binutils/configure --enable-gold --enable-plugins --disable-werror; $ make all-gold. That should leave you with ``build/gold/ld-new`` which supports; the ``-plugin`` option. Running ``make`` will additionally build; ``build/binutils/ar`` and ``nm-new`` binaries supporting plugins. Once you're ready to switch to using gold, backup your existing; ``/usr/bin/ld`` then replace it with ``ld-new``. Alternatively, install; in ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` and use ``-fuse-ld=gold`` as described earlier. Optionally, add ``--enable-gold=default`` to the above configure invocation; to automatically install the newly built gold as the default linker with; ``make install``. * Build the LLVMgold plugin.

Availability,"ize Offsetting of Location Descriptions; --------------------------------------------------. The ``DW_OP_plus`` and ``DW_OP_minus`` operations can be defined to operate on a; memory location description in the default target architecture specific address; space and a generic type value to produce an updated memory location; description. This allows them to continue to be used to offset an address. To generalize offsetting to any location description, including location; descriptions that describe when bytes are in registers, are implicit, or a; composite of these, the ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset``, ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset_uconst``, and; ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset`` offset operations are added. The offset operations can operate on location storage of any size. For example,; implicit location storage could be any number of bits in size. It is simpler to; define offsets that exceed the size of the location storage as being an; evaluation error, than having to force an implementation to support potentially; infinite precision offsets to allow it to correctly track a series of positive; and negative offsets that may transiently overflow or underflow, but end up in; range. This is simple for the arithmetic operations as they are defined in terms; of two's complement arithmetic on a base type of a fixed size. Therefore, the; offset operation define that integer overflow is ill-formed. This is in contrast; to the ``DW_OP_plus``, ``DW_OP_plus_uconst``, and ``DW_OP_minus`` arithmetic; operations which define that it causes wrap-around. Having the offset operations allows ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` to push a; location description that may be in a register, or be an implicit value. The; DWARF expression of ``DW_TAG_ptr_to_member_type`` can use the offset operations; without regard to what kind of location description was pushed.

Q: How do I tell the analyzer that my instance variable does not need to be released in -dealloc under Manual Retain/Release?; If your class only uses an instance variable for part of its lifetime, it may; maintain an invariant guaranteeing that the instance variable is always released; before -dealloc. In this case, you can silence a warning about a missing release; by either adding assert(_ivar == nil) or an explicit release; [_ivar release] (which will be a no-op when the variable is nil) in; -dealloc. ; Q: How do I decide whether a method's return type should be _Nullable or _Nonnull?; Depending on the implementation of the method, this puts you in one of five situations:. You actually never return nil.; You do return nil sometimes, and callers are supposed to handle that. This; includes cases where your method is documented to return nil given certain; inputs.; You return nil based on some external condition (such as an out-of-memory; error), but the client can't do anything about it either.; You return nil only when the caller passes input documented to be invalid.; That means it's the client's fault.; You return nil in some totally undocumented case. In (1) you should annotate the method as returning a _Nonnull; object.; In (2) the method should be marked _Nullable.; In (3) you should probably annotate the method _Nonnull. Why?; Because no callers will actually check for nil, given that they can't do; anything about the situation and don't know what went wrong. At this point; things have gone so poorly that there's basically no way to recover.; The least happy case is (4) because the resulting program will almost; certainly either crash or just silently do the wrong thing.; If this is a new method or you control the callers, you can use; NSParameterAssert() (or the equivalent) to check the precondition and; remove the nil return.

The minimizer can become blocked at a limit, because at a limit the; derivative seen by the minimizer; $\partial F / \partial P_{\mathrm{int}}$ is zero no matter what the real; derivative $\partial F / \partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}$ is. $$\frac{\partial F}{\partial P_{\mathrm{int}}} =; \frac{\partial F}{\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}}; \frac{\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}}{\partial P_{\mathrm{int}}} =; \frac{\partial F}{\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}} = 0$$. For a stepping method (like $\mbox{SIMPLEX}$) this seldom poses any; problem, but a method based on derivatives ($\mbox{MIGRAD}$) may; become blocked at such a value. If this happens, it may be necessary to; move the value of the parameter in question a significant distance from; the limit (e.g. with MnMigrad::setValue(...)) and restart the; minimization, perhaps with that parameter fixed temporarily. ### Getting the right parameter errors with limits ###. [answer:right-errors]. In the best case, where the minimum is far from any limits, M will; correctly transform the error matrix, and the parameter errors it; reports should be accurate and very close to those you would have got; without limits. In other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you wouldn't need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. On the; other hand, the $\mbox{MINOS}$ analysis is still meaningful, at; least in principle, as long as $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (which is called; internally by $\mbox{MINOS}$) does not get blocked at a limit.; Unfortunately, the user has no control over this aspect of the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ calculation, although it is possible to get enough; printout from the $\mbox{MINOS}$ result to b",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:65417,error,errors,65417,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['error'],['errors']

This also implies that the driver; should be able to call the language specific compilers (e.g. cc1); directly, which means that it must have enough information to forward; command line arguments to child processes correctly. Design Overview; ---------------. The diagram below shows the significant components of the driver; architecture and how they relate to one another. The orange components; represent concrete data structures built by the driver, the green; components indicate conceptually distinct stages which manipulate these; data structures, and the blue components are important helper classes. .. image:: DriverArchitecture.png; :align: center; :alt: Driver Architecture Diagram. Driver Stages; -------------. The driver functionality is conceptually divided into five stages:. #. **Parse: Option Parsing**. The command line argument strings are decomposed into arguments; (``Arg`` instances). The driver expects to understand all available; options, although there is some facility for just passing certain; classes of options through (like ``-Wl,``). Each argument corresponds to exactly one abstract ``Option``; definition, which describes how the option is parsed along with some; additional metadata. The Arg instances themselves are lightweight and; merely contain enough information for clients to determine which; option they correspond to and their values (if they have additional; parameters). For example, a command line like ""-Ifoo -I foo"" would parse to two; Arg instances (a JoinedArg and a SeparateArg instance), but each; would refer to the same Option. Options are lazily created in order to avoid populating all Option; classes when the driver is loaded. Most of the driver code only needs; to deal with options by their unique ID (e.g., ``options::OPT_I``),. Arg instances themselves do not generally store the values of; parameters. In many cases, this would simply result in creating; unnecessary string copies. Instead, Arg instances are always embedd",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:4032,avail,available,4032,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

It is strongly recommended to use JSON when communicating with ROOT application.; THttpServer provides a JSON representation for every registered object with an url address like:. http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json. Such JSON representation generated using the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class. One could create JSON file for any ROOT object directly, just writing in the code:. ```cpp; obj->SaveAs(""file.json"");; ```. To access data from a remote web server, it is recommended to use the `httpRequest` method.; For instance to receive object from a THttpServer server one could do:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = await httpRequest(""http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json"", ""object""); console.log('Read object of type', obj._typename);; ```. Function returns Promise, which provides parsed object (or Error in case of failure). If JSON string was obtained by different method, it could be parsed with `parse` function:. ```javascript; import { parse } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = parse(json_string);; ```. ### Objects drawing. After an object has been created, one can directly draw it. If HTML page has `<div>` element:. ```html; <div id=""drawing""></div>; ```. One could use the `draw` function:. ```javascript; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; ```. The first argument is the id of the HTML div element, where drawing will be performed. The second argument is the object to draw and the third one is the drawing option.

Thus, these intrinsics perform an element-wise; less than comparison of VIV with the loop tripcount, producing a mask of; true/false values representing active/inactive vector lanes, except if the VIV; overflows in which case they return false in the lanes where the VIV overflows.; The arguments are scalar types to accommodate scalable vector types, for which; it is unknown what the type of the step vector needs to be that enumerate its; lanes without overflow. This mask ``%m`` can e.g. be used in masked load/store instructions. These; intrinsics provide a hint to the backend. I.e., for a vector loop, the; back-edge taken count of the original scalar loop is explicit as the second; argument.

One other feature of YAML is the ability to define multiple documents in a; single file. That is why reading YAML produces a vector of your document type. Error Handling; ==============. When parsing a YAML document, if the input does not match your schema (as; expressed in your XxxTraits<> specializations). YAML I/O; will print out an error message and your Input object's error() method will; return true. For instance the following document:. .. code-block:: yaml. - name: Tom; shoe-size: 12; - name: Dan; hat-size: 7. Has a key (shoe-size) that is not defined in the schema. YAML I/O will; automatically generate this error:. .. code-block:: yaml. YAML:2:2: error: unknown key 'shoe-size'; shoe-size: 12; ^~~~~~~~~. Similar errors are produced for other input not conforming to the schema. Scalars; =======. YAML scalars are just strings (i.e. not a sequence or mapping). The YAML I/O; library provides support for translating between YAML scalars and specific; C++ types. Built-in types; --------------; The following types have built-in support in YAML I/O:. * bool; * float; * double; * StringRef; * std::string; * int64_t; * int32_t; * int16_t; * int8_t; * uint64_t; * uint32_t; * uint16_t; * uint8_t. That is, you can use those types in fields of MappingTraits or as element type; in sequence. When reading, YAML I/O will validate that the string found; is convertible to that type and error out if not. Unique types; ------------; Given that YAML I/O is trait based, the selection of how to convert your data; to YAML is based on the type of your data. But in C++ type matching, typedefs; do not generate unique type names.

If you are having problems building or using LLVM, or if you have any other; general questions about LLVM, please consult the `Frequently Asked; Questions <FAQ.html>`_ page. If you are having problems with limited memory and build time, please try; building with ninja instead of make. Please consider configuring the; following options with cmake:. * -G Ninja; Setting this option will allow you to build with ninja instead of make.; Building with ninja significantly improves your build time, especially with; incremental builds, and improves your memory usage. * -DLLVM_USE_LINKER; Setting this option to lld will significantly reduce linking time for LLVM; executables on ELF-based platforms, such as Linux. If you are building LLVM; for the first time and lld is not available to you as a binary package, then; you may want to use the gold linker as a faster alternative to GNU ld. * -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE; Controls optimization level and debug information of the build. This setting; can affect RAM and disk usage, see :ref:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE <cmake_build_type>`; for more information. * -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS; This option defaults to ON for Debug builds and defaults to OFF for Release; builds. As mentioned in the previous option, using the Release build type and; enabling assertions may be a good alternative to using the Debug build type. * -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS; Set this equal to number of jobs you wish to run simultaneously. This is; similar to the -j option used with make, but only for link jobs. This option; can only be used with ninja. You may wish to use a very low number of jobs,; as this will greatly reduce the amount of memory used during the build; process. If you have limited memory, you may wish to set this to 1. * -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD; Set this equal to the tar",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst:44618,avail,available,44618,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Block literal expressions within functions are extended to allow const; use of C++ objects, pointers, or references held in automatic storage. As usual, within the block, references to captured variables become; const-qualified, as if they were references to members of a const; object. Note that this does not change the type of a variable of; reference type. For example, given a class Foo:. .. code-block:: c. Foo foo;; Foo &fooRef = foo;; Foo *fooPtr = &foo;. A Block that referenced these variables would import the variables as; const variations:. .. code-block:: c. const Foo block_foo = foo;; Foo &block_fooRef = fooRef;; Foo *const block_fooPtr = fooPtr;. Captured variables are copied into the Block at the instant of; evaluating the Block literal expression. They are also copied when; calling ``Block_copy()`` on a Block allocated on the stack. In both; cases, they are copied as if the variable were const-qualified, and; it's an error if there's no such constructor. Captured variables in Blocks on the stack are destroyed when control; leaves the compound statement that contains the Block literal; expression. Captured variables in Blocks on the heap are destroyed; when the reference count of the Block drops to zero. Variables declared as residing in ``__block`` storage may be initially; allocated in the heap or may first appear on the stack and be copied; to the heap as a result of a ``Block_copy()`` operation. When copied; from the stack, ``__block`` variables are copied using their normal; qualification (i.e. without adding const). In C++11, ``__block``; variables are copied as x-values if that is possible, then as l-values; if not; if both fail, it's an error. The destructor for any initial; stack-based version is called at the variable's normal end of scope.

The default compression algorithm used when writing ROOT files has been updated to use LZ4 in particular to improve read (decompression) performance. You can change this default for each file through (for example) the `TFile constructor` or `TFile::SetCompressionAlgorithm`. It should be noted that ROOT files written with LZ4 compression can not be read with older release of ROOT. Support for LZ4 was however back-ported to the patch branches of previous releases and the following tags (and later release in the same patch series) can read ROOT files written with LZ4 compression:. * v5.34/38; * v6.08/06 [not yet released]; * v6.10/08; * v6.12/02. ## Removed interfaces. ## Core Libraries; - Optimize away redundant deserialization of template specializations.

The ``handleAllErrors``; function should generally be avoided: the introduction of a new error type; elsewhere in the program can easily turn a formerly exhaustive list of errors; into a non-exhaustive list, risking unexpected program termination. Where; possible, use handleErrors and propagate unknown errors up the stack instead. For tool code, where errors can be handled by printing an error message then; exiting with an error code, the :ref:`ExitOnError <err_exitonerr>` utility; may be a better choice than handleErrors, as it simplifies control flow when; calling fallible functions. In situations where it is known that a particular call to a fallible function; will always succeed (for example, a call to a function that can only fail on a; subset of inputs with an input that is known to be safe) the; :ref:`cantFail <err_cantfail>` functions can be used to remove the error type,; simplifying control flow.

At a high level, whenever MCJIT generates new machine code, it does so in an; in-memory object file that contains the debug information in DWARF format.; MCJIT then adds this in-memory object file to a global list of dynamically; generated object files and calls a special function; ``__jit_debug_register_code`` that the debugger knows about. When the debugger; attaches to a process, it puts a breakpoint in this function and associates a; special handler with it. Once MCJIT calls the registration function, the; debugger catches the breakpoint signal, loads the new object file from the; inferior's memory and resumes execution. This way it can obtain debug; information for pure in-memory object files. GDB Version; ===========. In order to debug code JIT-ed by LLVM, you need GDB 7.0 or newer, which is; available on most modern distributions of Linux. The version of GDB that; Apple ships with Xcode has been frozen at 6.3 for a while. LLDB Version; ============. Due to a regression in release 6.0, LLDB didn't support JITed code debugging for; a while. The bug was fixed in mainline recently, so that debugging JITed ELF; objects should be possible again from the upcoming release 12.0 on. On macOS the; feature must be enabled explicitly using the ``plugin.jit-loader.gdb.enable``; setting. Debugging MCJIT-ed code; =======================. The emerging MCJIT component of LLVM allows full debugging of JIT-ed code with; GDB. This is due to MCJIT's ability to use the MC emitter to provide full; DWARF debugging information to GDB.

When parsing an; Expression Statement, if the last semicolon is missing, then the code will; pretend that there one and set a marker there for later utilization, and; continue parsing. A semicolon is normally required in C++, but this feature expands the C++; syntax to handle cases where a missing semicolon is expected (i.e., when; handling an expression statement). It also makes sure that an error is not; generated for the missing semicolon in this specific case. This is accomplished by identifying the end position of the user input; (expression statement). This helps store and return the expression statement; effectively, so that it can be printed (displayed to the user automatically). **Note:** This logic is only available for C++ for now, since part of the; implementation itself requires C++ features.

If a class or struct has no user-defined default; constructor, C++ doesn't allow you to default construct a const; instance of it like this ([dcl.init], p9):. class Foo {; public:; // The compiler-supplied default constructor works fine, so we; // don't bother with defining one.; ...; };. void Bar() {; const Foo foo; // Error!; ...; }. To fix this, you can define a default constructor for the class:. class Foo {; public:; Foo() {}; ...; };. void Bar() {; const Foo foo; // Now the compiler is happy.; ...; }. An upcoming change to the C++ standard is expected to weaken this rule to only; apply when the compiler-supplied default constructor would leave a member; uninitialized. Clang implements the more relaxed rule in version 3.8 onwards. Parameter name lookup. Some versions of GCC allow the redeclaration of function parameter names within a function prototype in C++ code, e.g. void f(int a, int a);. Clang diagnoses this error (where the parameter name has been redeclared). To fix this problem, rename one of the parameters. C++11 compatibility. Deleted special member functions. In C++11, the explicit declaration of a move constructor or a move; assignment operator within a class deletes the implicit declaration; of the copy constructor and copy assignment operator.

As a best; practice, before creating the node in the ""to"" context, avoid importing of; other nodes which are not needed for the constructor of node ``A``. Error Handling; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every import function returns with either an ``llvm::Error`` or an; ``llvm::Expected<T>`` object. This enforces to check the return value of the; import functions. If there was an error during one import then we return with; that error. (Exception: when we import the members of a class, we collect the; individual errors with each member and we concatenate them in one Error; object.) We cache these errors in cases of declarations. During the next import; call if there is an existing error we just return with that. So, clients of the; library receive an Error object, which they must check. During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we recognize an error. In this case, we signal back; the error to the caller, but the ""to"" context remains polluted with those nodes; which had been created. Ideally, those nodes should not had been created, but; that time we did not know about the error, the error happened later. Since the; AST is immutable (most of the cases we can't remove existing nodes) we choose; to mark these nodes as erroneous. We cache the errors associated with declarations in the ""from"" context in; ``ASTImporter::ImportDeclErrors`` and the ones which are associated with the; ""to"" context in ``ASTImporterSharedState::ImportErrors``. Note that, there may; be several ASTImporter objects which import into the same ""to"" context but from; different ""from"" contexts; in this case, they have to share the associated; errors of the ""to"" context.

Availability,"le:: raw-html(raw); :format: html. =================================; LLVM Code Coverage Mapping Format; =================================. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============. LLVM's code coverage mapping format is used to provide code coverage; analysis using LLVM's and Clang's instrumentation based profiling; (Clang's ``-fprofile-instr-generate`` option). This document is aimed at those who would like to know how LLVM's code coverage; mapping works under the hood. A prior knowledge of how Clang's profile guided; optimization works is useful, but not required. For those interested in using; LLVM to provide code coverage analysis for their own programs, see the `Clang; documentation <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html>`. We start by briefly describing LLVM's code coverage mapping format and the; way that Clang and LLVM's code coverage tool work with this format. After; the basics are down, more advanced features of the coverage mapping format; are discussed - such as the data structures, LLVM IR representation and; the binary encoding. High Level Overview; ===================. LLVM's code coverage mapping format is designed to be a self contained; data format that can be embedded into the LLVM IR and into object files.; It's described in this document as a **mapping** format because its goal is; to store the data that is required for a code coverage tool to map between; the specific source ranges in a file and the execution counts obtained; after running the instrumented version of the program. The mapping data is used in two places in the code coverage process:. 1. When clang compiles a source file with ``-fcoverage-mapping``, it; generates the mapping information that describes the mapping between the; source ranges and the profiling instrumentation counters.; This information gets embedded into the LLVM IR and conveniently; ends up in the final executable file when the program is linked. 2. It is also used by *llvm-cov* - the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CoverageMappingFormat.rst:940,down,down,940,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CoverageMappingFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CoverageMappingFormat.rst,1,['down'],['down']

Try the; following little macro, `RunMySelector.C`, which contains two extra; lines compared to the example above (adjust the number of workers; according to the number of CPU cores):. ``` {.cpp}; {// set up a TChain; TChain *ch=new TChain(""cond_data"", ""My Chain for Example N-Tuple"");; ch->Add(""conductivity_experiment*.root"");; // eventually, start Proof Lite on cores; TProof::Open(""workers=4"");; ch->SetProof();; ch->Process(""MySelector.C+"");}; ```. The first command, `TProof::Open(const char*)` starts a local PROOF; server (if no arguments are specified, all cores will be used), and the; command `ch->SetProof();` enables processing of the chain using PROOF.; Now, when issuing the command `ch->Process(""MySelector.C+);`, the code; in `MySelector.C` is compiled and executed on each slave node. The; methods `Begin()` and `Terminate()` are executed on the master only. The; list of n-tuple files is analysed, and portions of the data are assigned; to the available slave processes. Histograms booked in `SlaveBegin()`; exist in the processes on the slave nodes, and are filled accordingly.; Upon termination, the PROOF master collects the histograms from the; slaves and merges them. In `Terminate()` all merged histograms are; available and can be inspected, analysed or stored. The histograms are; handled via the instances `fOutput` of class `TList` in each slave; process, and can be retrieved from this list after merging in; `Terminate`. To explore the power of this mechanism, generate some very large; n-tuples using the script from the section; [Storing Arbitrary N-tuples](#storing-arbitrary-n-tuples) -; you could try 10 000 000 events (this; results in a large n-tuple of about 160 MByte in size).

Availability,"le](pictures/03000070.png). ## Result of the fit. Here we will show how to obtain the result of the fit (fitted function, parameter values, errors; and eventually the covariance and correlation matrix). ### Associated Function. One or more objects (typically a **`TF1\*`**) can be added to the list; of functions (`fFunctions`) associated to each histogram. A call to; `TH1::Fit` adds the fitted function to this list. Given a histogram; `h`, one can retrieve the associated function with:. ``` {.cpp}; TF1 *myfunc = h->GetFunction(""myfunc"");; ```. ### Access to the Fit Parameters and Results. If the histogram (or graph) is made persistent, the list of associated; functions is also persistent. Retrieve a pointer to the function with; the `TH1::GetFunction()` method. Then you can retrieve the fit; parameters from the function (**`TF1`**) with calls such as:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TF1 *fit = hist->GetFunction(function_name);; root[] Double_t chi2 = fit->GetChisquare();; // value of the first parameter; root[] Double_t p1 = fit->GetParameter(0);; // error of the first parameter; root[] Double_t e1 = fit->GetParError(0);; ```. Using the fit option `S` one can access the full result of the fit including the covariance and correlation matrix.; See later the paragraph `TFitResult`. ### Associated Errors. By default, for each bin, the sum of weights is computed at fill time.; One can also call `TH1::Sumw2` to force the storage and computation of; the sum of the square of weights per bin. If Sumw2 has been called,; the error per bin is computed as the `sqrt(sum of squares of; weights)`; otherwise, the error is set equal to the; `sqrt(bin content)`. To return the error for a given bin number, do:. ``` {.cpp}; Double_t error = h->GetBinError(bin);; ```. Empty bins are excluded in the fit when using the Chi-square fit method.; When fitting an histogram representing counts (i.e with Poisson statistics) it is recommended to; use the Log-Likelihood method (option ‘`L`' or ""`WL`""), particula",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:18182,error,error,18182,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"lective Unwrapping; Many programmers use high-level user defined types, typedefs, and other; syntactic sugar to refer to types in their program. This is useful because they; can abbreviate otherwise very long types and it is useful to preserve the; typename in diagnostics. However, sometimes very simple typedefs can wrap; trivial types and it is important to strip off the typedef to understand what; is going on. Clang aims to handle both cases well.; The following example shows where it is important to preserve; a typedef in C. $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:15:11: error: can't convert between vector values of different size ('__m128' and 'int const *'); myvec[1]/P;; ~~~~~~~~^~. The following example shows where it is useful for the compiler to expose; underlying details of a typedef. If the user was somehow confused about how the; system ""pid_t"" typedef is defined, Clang helpfully displays it with ""aka"". $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:13:9: error: member reference base type 'pid_t' (aka 'int') is not a structure or union; myvar = myvar.x;; ~~~~~ ^. In C++, type preservation includes retaining any qualification written into type names. For example, if we take a small snippet of code such as:. namespace services {; struct WebService { };; }; namespace myapp {; namespace servers {; struct Server { };; }; }. using namespace myapp;; void addHTTPService(servers::Server const &server, ::services::WebService const *http) {; server += http;; }. and then compile it, we see that Clang is both providing accurate information and is retaining the types as written by the user (e.g., ""servers::Server"", ""::services::WebService""):. $ clang -fsyntax-only t.cpp; t.cpp:9:10: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('servers::Server const' and '::services::WebService const *'); server += http;; ~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~.

We currently implement this in codegen, however this is suboptimal; because it means that it would be quite awkward to implement the; optimization for callers. A better implementation would be to relax the LLVM IR rules for sret; arguments to allow a function with an sret argument to have a non-void; return type, and to have the front-end to set up the sret argument value; as the return value of the function.

The code; for splitting the input data into training and test samples for; all classes and the mixing of those samples to one training and; one test sample has been rewritten completely. The new code is; more performant and has a clearer structure. This fixes several; bugs which have been reported by some users of TMVA.; Code and performance test framework: A unit; test framework for daily software and method performance; validation has been implemented.; .

For a stepping method (like $\mbox{SIMPLEX}$) this seldom poses any; problem, but a method based on derivatives ($\mbox{MIGRAD}$) may; become blocked at such a value. If this happens, it may be necessary to; move the value of the parameter in question a significant distance from; the limit (e.g. with MnMigrad::setValue(...)) and restart the; minimization, perhaps with that parameter fixed temporarily. ### Getting the right parameter errors with limits ###. [answer:right-errors]. In the best case, where the minimum is far from any limits, M will; correctly transform the error matrix, and the parameter errors it; reports should be accurate and very close to those you would have got; without limits. In other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you wouldn't need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. On the; other hand, the $\mbox{MINOS}$ analysis is still meaningful, at; least in principle, as long as $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (which is called; internally by $\mbox{MINOS}$) does not get blocked at a limit.; Unfortunately, the user has no control over this aspect of the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ calculation, although it is possible to get enough; printout from the $\mbox{MINOS}$ result to be able to determine; whether the results are reliable or not. ## Fixing and releasing parameters ##.

If the provided argument contains a directory separator, it is considered as; a file path, and options are read from that file. Otherwise the argument is; treated as a file name and is searched for sequentially in the directories:. - user directory,; - system directory,; - the directory where Clang executable resides.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`lit` is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test; suites, summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures.; :program:`lit` is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a; user interface as possible. :program:`lit` should be run with one or more *tests* to run specified on the; command line. Tests can be either individual test files or directories to; search for tests (see :ref:`test-discovery`). Each specified test will be executed (potentially concurrently) and once all; tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on the number; of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-results`). The; :program:`lit` program will execute with a non-zero exit code if any tests; fail. By default :program:`lit` will use a succinct progress display and will only; print summary information for test failures. See :ref:`output-options` for; options controlling the :program:`lit` progress display and output. :program:`lit` also includes a number of options for controlling how tests are; executed (specific features may depend on the particular test format). See; :ref:`execution-options` for more information. Finally, :program:`lit` also supports additional options for only running a; subset of the options specified on the command line, see; :ref:`selection-options` for more information. :program:`lit` parses options from the environment variable ``LIT_OPTS`` after; parsing options from the command line. ``LIT_OPTS`` is primarily useful for; supplementing or overriding the command-line options supplied to :program:`lit`; by ``check`` targets defined by a project's build system. :program:`lit` can also read options from response files which are specified as; inputs using the ``@path/to/file.rsp`` syntax.

The answer is surprisingly; simple: The KaleidoscopeJIT has a straightforward symbol resolution rule that; it uses to find symbols that aren't available in any given module: First; it searches all the modules that have already been added to the JIT, from the; most recent to the oldest, to find the newest definition. If no definition is; found inside the JIT, it falls back to calling ""``dlsym(""sin"")``"" on the; Kaleidoscope process itself. Since ""``sin``"" is defined within the JIT's; address space, it simply patches up calls in the module to call the libm; version of ``sin`` directly. But in some cases this even goes further:; as sin and cos are names of standard math functions, the constant folder; will directly evaluate the function calls to the correct result when called; with constants like in the ""``sin(1.0)``"" above. In the future we'll see how tweaking this symbol resolution rule can be used to; enable all sorts of useful features, from security (restricting the set of; symbols available to JIT'd code), to dynamic code generation based on symbol; names, and even lazy compilation.

These are ADAM (the new default), ADAGRAD,; RMSPROP, ADADELTA. A new option, *Optimizer* has been added in the option string used to define the training strategy options.; - Add support for regression in MethodDL; - Use single precision (float) types as the fundamental type for the neural network architecture. Double precision could be enabled, but it will require recompiling TMVA. ; - Support inference (network evaluation) in batch mode in addition to single event. Batch mode evaluation is now the default when used within the `TMVA::Factory` class (i.e. when calling; `Factory::TestAllMethod()` or `Factory::EvaluateAllMethods()`; - Support splitting the overall training data in Train and Validation data. The train data is used for finding the optimal network weight and the validation data is used to monitor the validation; error. The weights which are giving a minimal validation error will be stored. For the splitting a new option, *ValidationSize* has been added to the global options for `MethodDL`.; The same option is also available in the `PyKeras` method of `PyMVA`; - The fast tanh implementation from VDT is now used as activation function when training the network on CPU.; - Using `Cblas` from the GSL library is supported for CPU training when no other Blas libraries are found. However, it is strongly recommended, to use an optimized Blas implementation such as `libopenblas`, that is; available in cvmfs.; - Add several performance optimizations for both CPU and GPU versions of `MethodDL`. . ### Other New TMVA Features. - Add a new option to the `DataLoader` to switch off computation of correlation matrix.

GC parseable calls to '``llvm.memcpy.element.unordered.atomic.*``',; '``llvm.memmove.element.unordered.atomic.*``' intrinsics are lowered to calls; to '``__llvm_memcpy_element_unordered_atomic_safepoint_*``',; '``__llvm_memmove_element_unordered_atomic_safepoint_*``' symbols respectively.; This way the runtime can provide implementations of copy operations with and; without safepoints.

It is configurable via compile time options. - the Secondary allocator: slower, it services larger allocation sizes via the; memory mapping primitives of the underlying operating system. Secondary backed; allocations are surrounded by Guard Pages. It is also configurable via compile; time options. - the thread specific data Registry: defines how local caches operate for each; thread. There are currently two models implemented: the exclusive model where; each thread holds its own caches (using the ELF TLS); or the shared model; where threads share a fixed size pool of caches. - the Quarantine: offers a way to delay the deallocation operations, preventing; blocks to be immediately available for reuse. Blocks held will be recycled; once certain size criteria are reached. This is essentially a delayed freelist; which can help mitigate some use-after-free situations. This feature is fairly; costly in terms of performance and memory footprint, is mostly controlled by; runtime options and is disabled by default. Allocations Header; ------------------; Every chunk of heap memory returned to an application by the allocator will be; preceded by a header. This has two purposes:. - being to store various information about the chunk, that can be leveraged to; ensure consistency of the heap operations;. - being able to detect potential corruption. For this purpose, the header is; checksummed and corruption of the header will be detected when said header is; accessed (note that if the corrupted header is not accessed, the corruption; will remain undetected).

This option is equivalent to the one in; `THStack`. It allows to draw all the `TGraphs` in separated pads. ### THStack. - By default the background of the histograms is erased before drawing the; histograms. The new option `noclear` avoid this behaviour. This is useful; when drawing a `THStack` on top of an other plot. If the patterns used to; draw the histograms in the stack are transparents, then the plot behind; will be visible. ### TH2Poly. - Implement a simple version of ""Scale"". ### TF1. - Change `TF1::Integral(double a, double b, double * params = 0, double eps = 1.E-12)` to; `TF1::Integral(doubnle a, double b, double epsrel=1.E-12)`. One should use `TF1::SetParameters` to; set the function parameters before computing the integral. - Add a new function `TF1::IntegralOneDim(Double_t a, Double_t b, Double_t epsrel, Double_t epsabs, Double_t &err)`; that returns as last argument the error in the integration. `TF1::Integral` is implemented using `Tf1::IntegralOneDim`. - The one-dim and multi-dim integral functions are now implemented using the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim`; classes. This allows to change the integration algorithm used in `TF1` using the static methods of the classes; `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDimOptions` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions`. The default algorithm used are; `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDimOptions::DefaultIntegratorType()` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions::DefaultIntegratorType()`.; For example, if ROOT has been built with mathmore the default one-dim integration type is the GSL AdaptiveSingular integration algorithm. - Implement the possibility to save a `TF1` as C code indenpant from; ROOT.

Because the same entity can be defined multiple times in different modules,; it is also possible for there to be multiple definitions of (for instance); a ``CXXRecordDecl``, all of which describe a definition of the same class.; In such a case, only one of those ""definitions"" is considered by Clang to be; the definition of the class, and the others are treated as non-defining; declarations that happen to also contain member declarations. Corresponding; members in each definition of such multiply-defined classes are identified; either by redeclaration chains (if the members are ``Redeclarable``); or by simply a pointer to the canonical declaration (if the declarations; are not ``Redeclarable`` -- in that case, a ``Mergeable`` base class is used; instead). Error Handling; --------------. Clang produces an AST even when the code contains errors. Clang won't generate; and optimize code for it, but it's used as parsing continues to detect further; errors in the input. Clang-based tools also depend on such ASTs, and IDEs in; particular benefit from a high-quality AST for broken code. In presence of errors, clang uses a few error-recovery strategies to present the; broken code in the AST:. - correcting errors: in cases where clang is confident about the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics. Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery.

HLSL disallows the pointer dereference; operators (unary ``*``, and ``->``), as well as the address of operator (unary; &). While HLSL disallows pointers and references in the syntax, HLSL does use; reference types in the AST, and we intend to use pointer decay in the AST in; the Clang implementation. HLSL ``this`` Keyword; ---------------------. HLSL does support member functions, and (in HLSL 2021) limited operator; overloading. With member function support, HLSL also has a ``this`` keyword. The; ``this`` keyword is an example of one of the places where HLSL relies on; references in the AST, because ``this`` is a reference. Bitshifts; ---------. In deviation from C, HLSL bitshifts are defined to mask the shift count by the; size of the type. In DXC, the semantics of LLVM IR were altered to accommodate; this, in Clang we intend to generate the mask explicitly in the IR. In cases; where the shift value is constant, this will be constant folded appropriately,; in other cases we can clean it up in the DXIL target. Non-short Circuiting Logical Operators; --------------------------------------. In HLSL 2018 and earlier, HLSL supported logical operators (and the ternary; operator) on vector types. This behavior required that operators not short; circuit. The non-short circuiting behavior applies to all data types until HLSL; 2021. In HLSL 2021, logical and ternary operators do not support vector types; instead builtin functions ``and``, ``or`` and ``select`` are available, and; operators short circuit matching C behavior.

Availability,"llvm-mca - LLVM Machine Code Analyzer; =====================================. .. program:: llvm-mca. SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`llvm-mca` [*options*] [input]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`llvm-mca` is a performance analysis tool that uses information; available in LLVM (e.g. scheduling models) to statically measure the performance; of machine code in a specific CPU. Performance is measured in terms of throughput as well as processor resource; consumption. The tool currently works for processors with a backend for which; there is a scheduling model available in LLVM. The main goal of this tool is not just to predict the performance of the code; when run on the target, but also help with diagnosing potential performance; issues. Given an assembly code sequence, :program:`llvm-mca` estimates the Instructions; Per Cycle (IPC), as well as hardware resource pressure. The analysis and; reporting style were inspired by the IACA tool from Intel. For example, you can compile code with clang, output assembly, and pipe it; directly into :program:`llvm-mca` for analysis:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang foo.c -O2 --target=x86_64 -S -o - | llvm-mca -mcpu=btver2. Or for Intel syntax:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang foo.c -O2 --target=x86_64 -masm=intel -S -o - | llvm-mca -mcpu=btver2. (:program:`llvm-mca` detects Intel syntax by the presence of an `.intel_syntax`; directive at the beginning of the input. By default its output syntax matches; that of its input.). Scheduling models are not just used to compute instruction latencies and; throughput, but also to understand what processor resources are available; and how to simulate them. By design, the quality of the analysis conducted by :program:`llvm-mca` is; inevitably affected by the quality of the scheduling models in LLVM. If you see that the performance report is not accurate for a processor,; please `file a bug <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues>`_; against the appropriate backend. OPTIONS; -------.

Calling; ``exit`` upon encountering an error dramatically simplifies control flow as the; error no longer needs to be propagated up the stack. This allows code to be; written in straight-line style, as long as each fallible call is wrapped in a; check and call to exit.

Availability,"loating Point; =============================. Clang supports three half-precision (16-bit) floating point types:; ``__fp16``, ``_Float16`` and ``__bf16``. These types are supported; in all language modes, but their support differs between targets.; A target is said to have ""native support"" for a type if the target; processor offers instructions for directly performing basic arithmetic; on that type. In the absence of native support, a type can still be; supported if the compiler can emulate arithmetic on the type by promoting; to ``float``; see below for more information on this emulation. * ``__fp16`` is supported on all targets. The special semantics of this; type mean that no arithmetic is ever performed directly on ``__fp16`` values;; see below. * ``_Float16`` is supported on the following targets:. * 32-bit ARM (natively on some architecture versions); * 64-bit ARM (AArch64) (natively on ARMv8.2a and above); * AMDGPU (natively); * SPIR (natively); * X86 (if SSE2 is available; natively if AVX512-FP16 is also available); * RISC-V (natively if Zfh or Zhinx is available). * ``__bf16`` is supported on the following targets (currently never natively):. * 32-bit ARM; * 64-bit ARM (AArch64); * RISC-V; * X86 (when SSE2 is available). (For X86, SSE2 is available on 64-bit and all recent 32-bit processors.). ``__fp16`` and ``_Float16`` both use the binary16 format from IEEE; 754-2008, which provides a 5-bit exponent and an 11-bit significand; (counting the implicit leading 1). ``__bf16`` uses the `bfloat16; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format>`_ format,; which provides an 8-bit exponent and an 8-bit significand; this is the same; exponent range as `float`, just with greatly reduced precision. ``_Float16`` and ``__bf16`` follow the usual rules for arithmetic; floating-point types. Most importantly, this means that arithmetic operations; on operands of these types are formally performed in the type and produce; values of the type. ``__fp16`` does no",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:30850,avail,available,30850,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,3,['avail'],['available']

C Language Features; ===================. The support for standard C in clang is feature-complete except for the; C99 floating-point pragmas. Extensions supported by clang; -----------------------------. See :doc:`LanguageExtensions`. Differences between various standard modes; ------------------------------------------. clang supports the -std option, which changes what language mode clang uses.; The supported modes for C are c89, gnu89, c94, c99, gnu99, c11, gnu11, c17,; gnu17, c23, gnu23, and various aliases for those modes. If no -std option is; specified, clang defaults to gnu17 mode. Many C99 and C11 features are; supported in earlier modes as a conforming extension, with a warning. Use; ``-pedantic-errors`` to request an error if a feature from a later standard; revision is used in an earlier mode. Differences between all ``c*`` and ``gnu*`` modes:. - ``c*`` modes define ""``__STRICT_ANSI__``"".; - Target-specific defines not prefixed by underscores, like ``linux``,; are defined in ``gnu*`` modes.; - Trigraphs default to being off in ``gnu*`` modes; they can be enabled; by the ``-trigraphs`` option.; - The parser recognizes ``asm`` and ``typeof`` as keywords in ``gnu*`` modes;; the variants ``__asm__`` and ``__typeof__`` are recognized in all modes.; - The parser recognizes ``inline`` as a keyword in ``gnu*`` mode, in; addition to recognizing it in the ``*99`` and later modes for which it is; part of the ISO C standard. The variant ``__inline__`` is recognized in all; modes.; - The Apple ""blocks"" extension is recognized by default in ``gnu*`` modes; on some platforms; it can be enabled in any mode with the ``-fblocks``; option.

Availability,"loop. The directive; provides options for vectorization, interleaving, predication, unrolling and; distribution. Loop hints can be specified before any loop and will be ignored if; the optimization is not safe to apply. There are loop hints that control transformations (e.g. vectorization, loop; unrolling) and there are loop hints that set transformation options (e.g.; ``vectorize_width``, ``unroll_count``). Pragmas setting transformation options; imply the transformation is enabled, as if it was enabled via the corresponding; transformation pragma (e.g. ``vectorize(enable)``). If the transformation is; disabled (e.g. ``vectorize(disable)``), that takes precedence over; transformations option pragmas implying that transformation. Vectorization, Interleaving, and Predication; --------------------------------------------. A vectorized loop performs multiple iterations of the original loop; in parallel using vector instructions. The instruction set of the target; processor determines which vector instructions are available and their vector; widths. This restricts the types of loops that can be vectorized. The vectorizer; automatically determines if the loop is safe and profitable to vectorize. A; vector instruction cost model is used to select the vector width. Interleaving multiple loop iterations allows modern processors to further; improve instruction-level parallelism (ILP) using advanced hardware features,; such as multiple execution units and out-of-order execution. The vectorizer uses; a cost model that depends on the register pressure and generated code size to; select the interleaving count. Vectorization is enabled by ``vectorize(enable)`` and interleaving is enabled; by ``interleave(enable)``. This is useful when compiling with ``-Os`` to; manually enable vectorization or interleaving. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable); #pragma clang loop interleave(enable); for(...) {; ...; }.

Availability,"lti parameter FORTRAN function to; which one must give the generic name `FCN`. In the ROOT; implementation, the function `FCN` is defined via the `Minuit`; `SetFCN` member function when an histogram fitting is invoked. The; value of `FCN` will in general depend on one or more variable; parameters. ### The Transformation of Limited Parameters. For variable parameters with limits, `Minuit` uses the following; transformation:. `Pint = arcsin(2((Pext-a)/(b-a))-1) `. `Pext = a+((b-a)/(2))(sinPint+1)`. so that the internal value `Pint` can take on any value, while the; external value Pext can take on values only between the lower limit a; and the ext upper limit b. Since the transformation is necessarily; non-linear, it would transform a nice linear problem into a nasty; non-linear one, which is the reason why limits should be avoided if; not necessary. In addition, the transformation does require some; computer time, so it slows down the computation a little bit, and more; importantly, it introduces additional numerical inaccuracy into the; problem in addition to what is introduced in the numerical calculation; of the FCN value. The effects of non-linearity and numerical round off; both become more important as the external value gets closer to one of; the limits (expressed as the distance to nearest limit divided by; distance between limits). The user must therefore be aware of the fact; that, for example, if they put limits of (0, 1010) on a parameter, then; the values 0.0 and 1. 0 will be indistinguishable to the accuracy of; most machines. The transformation also affects the parameter error matrix, of course,; so Minuit does a transformation of the error matrix (and the; ''parabolic'' parameter errors) when there are parameter limits. Users; should however realize that the transformation is only a linear; approximation, and that it cannot give a meaningful result if one or; more parameters is very close to a limit, where; $\frac{\partial Pext}{\partial Pint} \neq 0$.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:56025,down,down,56025,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['down'],['down']

Histograms objects (not pointers) **`TH1F`** `h1` can be multiplied by; a constant using:. ``` {.cpp}; h1.Scale(const); ```. A new histogram can be created without changing the original one by; doing:. ``` {.cpp}; TH1F h3 = 8*h1;; ```. To multiply two histogram objects and put the result in a 3rd one do:. ``` {.cpp}; TH1F h3 = h1*h2;; ```.

Of course, the **`TH1`** methods `Add` , `Multiply` and `Divide` can; be used instead of these operators. If a histogram has associated error bars ( **`TH1`**`::Sumw2()` has; been called), the resulting error bars are also computed assuming; independent histograms. In case of divisions, binomial errors are also; supported. ## Projections. One can make:. - a 1-D projection of a 2-D histogram or profile.

So, here, you'll be a lot safer if you specify the include/library; directories manually (via ``-I`` and ``-L``). Target-Specific Libraries; =========================. All libraries that you compile as part of your build will be; cross-compiled to your target, and your build system will probably; find them in the right place. But all dependencies that are; normally checked against (like ``libxml`` or ``libz`` etc) will match; against the host platform, not the target. So, if the build system is not aware that you want to cross-compile; your code, it will get every dependency wrong, and your compilation; will fail during build time, not configure time. Also, finding the libraries for your target are not as easy; as for your host machine. There aren't many cross-libraries available; as packages to most OS's, so you'll have to either cross-compile them; from source, or download the package for your target platform,; extract the libraries and headers, put them in specific directories; and add ``-I`` and ``-L`` pointing to them. Also, some libraries have different dependencies on different targets,; so configuration tools to find dependencies in the host can get the; list wrong for the target platform. This means that the configuration; of your build can get things wrong when setting their own library; paths, and you'll have to augment it via additional flags (configure,; Make, CMake, etc). Multilibs; ---------. When you want to cross-compile to more than one configuration, for; example hard-float-ARM and soft-float-ARM, you'll have to have multiple; copies of your libraries and (possibly) headers.

Availability,"ly. When a compilation is successful (there are no errors), the driver; checks the bit and emits an ""unused argument"" warning for any arguments; which were never accessed. This is conservative (the argument may not; have been used to do what the user wanted) but still catches the most; obvious cases. Relation to GCC Driver Concepts; -------------------------------. For those familiar with the gcc driver, this section provides a brief; overview of how things from the gcc driver map to the clang driver. - **Driver Driver**. The driver driver is fully integrated into the clang driver. The; driver simply constructs additional Actions to bind the architecture; during the *Pipeline* phase. The tool chain specific argument; translation is responsible for handling ``-Xarch_``. The one caveat is that this approach requires ``-Xarch_`` not be used; to alter the compilation itself (for example, one cannot provide; ``-S`` as an ``-Xarch_`` argument). The driver attempts to reject; such invocations, and overall there isn't a good reason to abuse; ``-Xarch_`` to that end in practice. The upside is that the clang driver is more efficient and does little; extra work to support universal builds. It also provides better error; reporting and UI consistency. - **Specs**. The clang driver has no direct correspondent for ""specs"". The; majority of the functionality that is embedded in specs is in the; Tool specific argument translation routines. The parts of specs which; control the compilation pipeline are generally part of the *Pipeline*; stage. - **Toolchains**. The gcc driver has no direct understanding of tool chains. Each gcc; binary roughly corresponds to the information which is embedded; inside a single ToolChain. The clang driver is intended to be portable and support complex; compilation environments. All platform and tool chain specific code; should be protected behind either abstract or well defined interfaces; (such as whether the platform supports use as a driver driver).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:15960,error,error,15960,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['error'],['error']

The memory is accessed according to the provided mask. The mask holds a bit for each vector lane, and is used to prevent memory accesses to the masked-off lanes. The masked-off lanes in the result vector are taken from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is a vector of pointers which holds all memory addresses to read. The second operand is an alignment of the source addresses. It must be 0 or a power of two constant integer value. The third operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values with the same number of elements as the return type. The fourth is a pass-through value that is used to fill the masked-off lanes of the result. The return type, underlying type of the vector of pointers and the type of the '``passthru``' operand are the same vector types. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.gather``' intrinsic is designed for conditional reading of multiple scalar values from arbitrary memory locations in a single IR operation. It is useful for targets that support vector masked gathers and allows vectorizing basic blocks with data and control divergence. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of scalar load operations.; The semantics of this operation are equivalent to a sequence of conditional scalar loads with subsequent gathering all loaded values into a single vector. The mask restricts memory access to certain lanes and facilitates vectorization of predicated basic blocks. ::. %res = call <4 x double> @llvm.masked.gather.v4f64.v4p0(<4 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 8, <4 x i1> <i1 true, i1 true, i1 true, i1 true>, <4 x double> poison). ;; The gather with all-true mask is equivalent to the following instruction sequence; %ptr0 = extractelement <4 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 0; %ptr1 = extractelement <4 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 1; %ptr2 ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:850103,mask,masked,850103,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['mask'],['masked']

This mangling allows such; parameters to be differentiated from those with the regular unqualified ``id``; type. This was a non-backward compatible mangling change to the ABI.

LLVM provides intrinsics for predicated vector load and store operations. The predicate is specified by a mask operand, which holds one bit per vector element, switching the associated vector lane on or off. The memory addresses corresponding to the ""off"" lanes are not accessed. When all bits of the mask are on, the intrinsic is identical to a regular vector load or store.

Overflow cannot occur in; ``(%base + i)`` and its comparison against ``%n`` as it is performed in integer; numbers and not in machine numbers. If ``%n`` is ``0``, then the result is a; poison value. The above is equivalent to:. ::. %m = @llvm.get.active.lane.mask(%base, %n). This can, for example, be emitted by the loop vectorizer in which case; ``%base`` is the first element of the vector induction variable (VIV) and; ``%n`` is the loop tripcount. Thus, these intrinsics perform an element-wise; less than comparison of VIV with the loop tripcount, producing a mask of; true/false values representing active/inactive vector lanes, except if the VIV; overflows in which case they return false in the lanes where the VIV overflows.; The arguments are scalar types to accommodate scalable vector types, for which; it is unknown what the type of the step vector needs to be that enumerate its; lanes without overflow. This mask ``%m`` can e.g. be used in masked load/store instructions. These; intrinsics provide a hint to the backend.

An **import path** is the list of the AST nodes which we visit during an Import; call. If node ``A`` depends on node ``B`` then the path contains an ``A->B``; edge. From the call stack of the import functions, we can read the very same; path. Now imagine the following AST, where the ``->`` represents dependency in terms; of the import (all nodes are declarations). .. code-block:: text. A->B->C->D; `->E. We would like to import A.; The import behaves like a DFS, so we will visit the nodes in this order: ABCDE.; During the visitation we will have the following import paths:. .. code-block:: text. A; AB; ABC; ABCD; ABC; AB; ABE; AB; A. If during the visit of E there is an error then we set an error for E, then as; the call stack shrinks for B, then for A:. .. code-block:: text.

A **`TGraphErrors`** is a **`TGraph`** with error bars. The various; draw format options of `TGraphErrors::Paint()` are derived from; **`TGraph`**. ``` {.cpp}; void TGraphErrors::Paint(Option_t *option); ```. ![Graphs with different draw options of error bars](pictures/03000050.png). In addition, it can be drawn with the ""`Z`"" option to leave off the; small lines at the end of the error bars. If option contains ""`>`"", an; arrow is drawn at the end of the error bars. If option contains; ""`|>`"", a full arrow is drawn at the end of the error bars. The size; of the arrow is set to 2/3 of the marker size. The option ""`[]`"" is interesting to superimpose systematic errors on; top of the graph with the statistical errors. When it is specified,; only the end vertical/horizontal lines of the error bars are drawn. To control the size of the lines at the end of the error bars (when; option 1 is chosen) use `SetEndErrorSize(np)`.

Sequences are collections that are externally ordered because they; maintain internal elements according to the order in which they were; added. The following sequences are available:. - **`TList`**. - **`THashList`**. - **`TOrdCollection`**. - **`TObjArray`**. - **`TClonesArray`**. The **`TOrdCollection`**, **`TObjArray`** as well as the; **`TClonesArray`** can be sorted using their Sort() member function (for; this, the stored objects must provide a comparison function by; overriding TObject::Compare() and also must enable sorting by overriding; TObject::IsSortable() to return true). Ordered collections all derive; from the abstract base class **`TSeqCollection`**. Sorted collections; are ordered by an internal (automatic) sorting mechanism. The following; sorted collections are available (the stored items must be sortable):. - **`TSortedList`**. - **`TBtree`**. Unordered collections don't maintain the order in which the elements; were added, i.e. when you iterate over an unordered collection, you are; not likely to retrieve elements in the same order they were added to the; collection. The following unordered collections are available:. - **`THashTable`**. - **`TMap`**. ## Iterators: Processing a Collection. The concept of processing all the members of a collection is generic,; i.e. independent of any specific representation of a collection. To; process each object in a collection one needs some type of cursor that; is initialized and then steps over each member of the collection in; turn.

This technique works transparently; for any p.d.f. stored in a RooWorkspace. One can store numeric integral values for problems with zero, one or two floating parameters.; In the first case, the value is simply stored. In cases with one or two floating parameters; a grid (histogram) of integral values is stored, which are interpolated to return integral; values for each value of the parameters. A new tutorial macro rf903_numintcache.C has been added to $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit; to illustrate the use of this feature. Representation of function and p.d.f. derivatives; A new class has been added that can represent the derivative of any p.d.f or function w.r.t. any; parameter or observable. To construct e.g. a first order derivative of a Gaussian p.d.f, do. RooAbsReal* dgdx = gauss.derivative(x,1) ;. A more complete example is available in the new tutorial macro rf111_derivatives.C. Improved handling of chi-squared fits; Chi-squared fits can now be performed through the same style of interface as likelihood fits,; through the newly added method RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataHist&,...). Functions that can be fitted with chi-squared minimization are any RooAbsReal based function; as well as RooAbsPdf based p.d.f.s. In case of non-extended p.d.f.s the probability density; calculated by the p.d.f. is multiplied with the number of events in the histogram to adjust; the scale of the function. In case of extended p.d.f.s, the adjustment is made with the expected; number of events, rather than the observed number of events. Tutorial macro rf602_chi2fit.C has been updated to use this new interface.

A :arc-term:`retainable object pointer` (or ""retainable pointer"") is a value of; a :arc-term:`retainable object pointer type` (""retainable type""). There are; three kinds of retainable object pointer types:. * block pointers (formed by applying the caret (``^``) declarator sigil to a; function type); * Objective-C object pointers (``id``, ``Class``, ``NSFoo*``, etc.); * typedefs marked with ``__attribute__((NSObject))``. Other pointer types, such as ``int*`` and ``CFStringRef``, are not subject to; ARC's semantics and restrictions. .. admonition:: Rationale. We are not at liberty to require all code to be recompiled with ARC;; therefore, ARC must interoperate with Objective-C code which manages retains; and releases manually. In general, there are three requirements in order for; a compiler-supported reference-count system to provide reliable; interoperation:. * The type system must reliably identify which objects are to be managed. An; ``int*`` might be a pointer to a ``malloc``'ed array, or it might be an; interior pointer to such an array, or it might point to some field or local; variable. In contrast, values of the retainable object pointer types are; never interior. * The type system must reliably indicate how to manage objects of a type.; This usually means that the type must imply a procedure for incrementing; and decrementing retain counts. Supporting single-ownership objects; requires a lot more explicit mediation in the language. * There must be reliable conventions for whether and when ""ownership"" is; passed between caller and callee, for both arguments and return values.; Objective-C methods follow such a convention very reliably, at least for; system libraries on macOS, and functions always pass objects at +0.

Other possible implementations could use the GPU or external tools like TensorFlow. The coupling of all these classes to `RooMinimizer` is made via the `MinuitFcnGrad` class, which owns the `Wrappers` that calculate the likelihood components. Note: a second `LikelihoodWrapper` class called `LikelihoodJob` is also available.; This class emulates the existing `NumCPU(>1)` functionality of the `RooAbsTestStatistic` tree, which is implemented based on `RooRealMPFE`.; This class is not yet thoroughly tested and should not be considered production ready. ### Usage example: `MultiProcess` enabled parallel gradient calculator.

Live in values are marked as such, and are given a dummy ""defining""; instruction during live intervals analysis. If the last basic block of a; function is a ``return``, then it's marked as using all live out values in the; function. ``PHI`` nodes need to be handled specially, because the calculation of the live; variable information from a depth first traversal of the CFG of the function; won't guarantee that a virtual register used by the ``PHI`` node is defined; before it's used. When a ``PHI`` node is encountered, only the definition is; handled, because the uses will be handled in other basic blocks. For each ``PHI`` node of the current basic block, we simulate an assignment at; the end of the current basic block and traverse the successor basic blocks. If a; successor basic block has a ``PHI`` node and one of the ``PHI`` node's operands; is coming from the current basic block, then the variable is marked as *alive*; within the current basic block and all of its predecessor basic blocks, until; the basic block with the defining instruction is encountered. Live Intervals Analysis; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. We now have the information available to perform the live intervals analysis and; build the live intervals themselves. We start off by numbering the basic blocks; and machine instructions. We then handle the ""live-in"" values. These are in; physical registers, so the physical register is assumed to be killed by the end; of the basic block. Live intervals for virtual registers are computed for some; ordering of the machine instructions ``[1, N]``.

For tool code, where errors can be handled by printing an error message then; exiting with an error code, the :ref:`ExitOnError <err_exitonerr>` utility; may be a better choice than handleErrors, as it simplifies control flow when; calling fallible functions. In situations where it is known that a particular call to a fallible function; will always succeed (for example, a call to a function that can only fail on a; subset of inputs with an input that is known to be safe) the; :ref:`cantFail <err_cantfail>` functions can be used to remove the error type,; simplifying control flow.

To cleanly support; situations like this, the LLVM Pass Infrastructure supports the notion of; Analysis Groups. Analysis Group Concepts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An Analysis Group is a single simple interface that may be implemented by; multiple different passes. Analysis Groups can be given human readable names; just like passes, but unlike passes, they need not derive from the ``Pass``; class. An analysis group may have one or more implementations, one of which is; the ""default"" implementation. Analysis groups are used by client passes just like other passes are: the; ``AnalysisUsage::addRequired()`` and ``Pass::getAnalysis()`` methods. In order; to resolve this requirement, the :ref:`PassManager; <writing-an-llvm-pass-passmanager>` scans the available passes to see if any; implementations of the analysis group are available. If none is available, the; default implementation is created for the pass to use. All standard rules for; :ref:`interaction between passes <writing-an-llvm-pass-interaction>` still; apply. Although :ref:`Pass Registration <writing-an-llvm-pass-registration>` is; optional for normal passes, all analysis group implementations must be; registered, and must use the :ref:`INITIALIZE_AG_PASS; <writing-an-llvm-pass-RegisterAnalysisGroup>` template to join the; implementation pool. Also, a default implementation of the interface **must**; be registered with :ref:`RegisterAnalysisGroup; <writing-an-llvm-pass-RegisterAnalysisGroup>`. As a concrete example of an Analysis Group in action, consider the; `AliasAnalysis <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasAnalysis.html>`_; analysis group.

Clang disallows jumps into the scope of a __block; variable. Variables marked with __block require special; runtime initialization. A jump into the scope of a __block; variable bypasses this initialization, leaving the variable's metadata; in an invalid state. Consider the following code fragment:. int fetch_object_state(struct MyObject *c) {; if (!c->active) goto error;. __block int result;; run_specially_somehow(^{ result = c->state; });; return result;. error:; fprintf(stderr, ""error while fetching object state"");; return -1;; }.

With ``-fsanitize-coverage=trace-cmp`` (default with ``-fsanitize=fuzzer``); and extra run-time flag ``-use_value_profile=1`` the fuzzer will; collect value profiles for the parameters of compare instructions; and treat some new values as new coverage. The current implementation does roughly the following:. * The compiler instruments all CMP instructions with a callback that receives both CMP arguments.; * The callback computes `(caller_pc&4095) | (popcnt(Arg1 ^ Arg2) << 12)` and uses this value to set a bit in a bitset.; * Every new observed bit in the bitset is treated as new coverage. This feature has a potential to discover many interesting inputs,; but there are two downsides.; First, the extra instrumentation may bring up to 2x additional slowdown.; Second, the corpus may grow by several times. Fuzzer-friendly build mode; ---------------------------; Sometimes the code under test is not fuzzing-friendly. Examples:. - The target code uses a PRNG seeded e.g. by system time and; thus two consequent invocations may potentially execute different code paths; even if the end result will be the same. This will cause a fuzzer to treat; two similar inputs as significantly different and it will blow up the test corpus.; E.g. libxml uses ``rand()`` inside its hash table.; - The target code uses checksums to protect from invalid inputs.; E.g. png checks CRC for every chunk. In many cases it makes sense to build a special fuzzing-friendly build; with certain fuzzing-unfriendly features disabled.

This affects some early C++11 code, including Boost's popular shared_ptr; up to version 1.47.0. The fix for Boost's shared_ptr is; available here. Objective-C++ compatibility. Implicit downcasts. Due to a bug in its implementation, GCC allows implicit downcasts; of Objective-C pointers (from a base class to a derived class) when; calling functions. Such code is inherently unsafe, since the object; might not actually be an instance of the derived class, and is; rejected by Clang. For example, given this code:. @interface Base @end; @interface Derived : Base @end. void f(Derived *p);; void g(Base *p) {; f(p);; }. Clang produces the following error:. downcast.mm:6:3: error: no matching function for call to 'f'; f(p);; ^; downcast.mm:4:6: note: candidate function not viable: cannot convert from; superclass 'Base *' to subclass 'Derived *' for 1st argument; void f(Derived *p);; ^. If the downcast is actually correct (e.g., because the code has; already checked that the object has the appropriate type), add an; explicit cast:. f((Derived *)base);. Using class as a property name. In C and Objective-C, class is a normal identifier and; can be used to name fields, ivars, methods, and so on. In; C++, class is a keyword. For compatibility with existing; code, Clang permits class to be used as part of a method; selector in Objective-C++, but this does not extend to any other part; of the language. In particular, it is impossible to use property dot; syntax in Objective-C++ with the property name class, so; the following code will fail to parse:. @interface I {; int cls;; }; + (int)class;; @end. @implementation I; - (int) Meth { return I.class; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html:22402,down,downcast,22402,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html,1,['down'],['downcast']
Availability,"mples; =======================. Introduction; ============. This page provides some examples of the kinds of things that people have; done with Clang that might serve as useful guides (or starting points) from; which to develop your own tools. They may be helpful even for something as; banal (but necessary) as how to set up your build to integrate Clang. Clang's library-based design is deliberately aimed at facilitating use by; external projects, and we are always interested in improving Clang to; better serve our external users. Some typical categories of applications; where Clang is used are:. - Static analysis.; - Documentation/cross-reference generation. If you know of (or wrote!) a tool or project using Clang, please post on; `the Discourse forums (Clang Frontend category); <https://discourse.llvm.org/c/clang/6>`_ to have it added.; (or if you are already a Clang contributor, feel free to directly commit; additions).

A **`TGraphErrors`** is a **`TGraph`** with error bars. The various; draw format options of `TGraphErrors::Paint()` are derived from; **`TGraph`**. ``` {.cpp}; void TGraphErrors::Paint(Option_t *option); ```. ![Graphs with different draw options of error bars](pictures/03000050.png). In addition, it can be drawn with the ""`Z`"" option to leave off the; small lines at the end of the error bars. If option contains ""`>`"", an; arrow is drawn at the end of the error bars. If option contains; ""`|>`"", a full arrow is drawn at the end of the error bars. The size; of the arrow is set to 2/3 of the marker size. The option ""`[]`"" is interesting to superimpose systematic errors on; top of the graph with the statistical errors. When it is specified,; only the end vertical/horizontal lines of the error bars are drawn. To control the size of the lines at the end of the error bars (when; option 1 is chosen) use `SetEndErrorSize(np)`. By default `np=1`; `np`; represents the number of pixels. ``` {.cpp}; gStyle->SetEndErrorSize(np);; ```.

Availability,"n 26000; lines of code. ```cpp; // Main.cpp; #include ""A.h""; int main() {; do();; return 0;; }. ```; Main.cpp, reuses code from libA by including libA's descriptor and links against; libA. The full descriptor can contain thousands of files expanding to millions; of lines of code -- a common case for framework libraries, for instance. ROOT goes further and enhances C++ by allowing the following code to work without; explicitly requiring to `#include <A.h>`. Currently, ROOT's lack of support of; line `#5` is a long-standing, known limitation that is lifted with modules. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] AStruct<float> S0; // #1: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] AStruct<float>* S1; // #2: implicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] if (gFile) S1->doIt(); // #3: implicit loading of libA. Full descriptor required.; root [] gSystem->Load(""libA""); // #4: explicit loading of libA. No full descriptor required.; root [] do(); // #5: error: implicit loading of libA is currently unsupported. ```. This pattern is not only used in the ROOT prompt but in I/O hotspots such as; `ShowMembers` and `TClass::IsA`. A naive implementation of this feature would require inclusion of all reachable; library descriptors (aka header files) at ROOT startup time. Of course this is; not feasible and ROOT inserts a set of optimizations to fence itself from the; costly full header inclusion. Unfortunately, several of them are home-grown and; in a few cases inaccurate (eg line #5) causing a noticeable technical debt. Here we will briefly describe the three common layers of optimizations: ROOT PCH,; ROOTMAP and RDICT. The ROOT precompiled header (PCH) reduces the CPU and memory cost for ROOT's; most used libraries. The precompiled header technology is well-understood since; decades [[4]].

To have a tool bar in your application you do not need to do anything; special - only to create objects: a tool bar and its picture buttons.; This sample code creates the following three toolbar buttons:. ![](pictures/03000218.png). First we need to complete a `ToolBarData_t` structure for each tool bar; button before adding it to the tool bar. This structure contains:. - the icon file name ""`filename.xpm`"". - the tool tip text - a short help message explaining the button; purpose. - the Boolean variable defining the button behavior when is clicked. - `kFALSE` - do not stay down. - `kTRUE` - to stay down. - the button ID. - the button pointer (**`TGButton *`**) - should be `NULL`. We create an array `*xpms[]` containing the icon file names that will be; used for a picture button creation. If you write only the file names; here ROOT will search these files in `$ROOTSYS/icons` directory. If the; icon files are not there, you should provide the full path name also.; The array `*tips[] `contains the tool tip texts for buttons. The integer; variable separator is used to set the distance between two groups of; toolbar buttons. It defines the amount of pixels to the left for each; button. We create a tool bar object and add the buttons using the `AddButton`; method. The variable separator helps us to define no space between the; buttons in a group (0), and 5 pixels extra-space before and after. All; buttons added via this method will be deleted by the toolbar.

Modules; (and other program representations, e.g. Object Files) are no longer added; directly to JIT classes or layers. Instead, they are added to ``JITDylib``; instances *by* layers. The ``JITDylib`` determines *where* the definitions; reside, the layers determine *how* the definitions will be compiled.; Linkage relationships between ``JITDylibs`` determine how inter-module; references are resolved, and symbol resolvers are no longer used. See the; section `Design Overview`_ for more details. Unless multiple JITDylibs are needed to model linkage relationships, ORCv1; clients should place all code in a single JITDylib.; MCJIT clients should use LLJIT (see `LLJIT and LLLazyJIT`_), and can place; code in LLJIT's default created main JITDylib (See; ``LLJIT::getMainJITDylib()``). 2. All JIT stacks now need an ``ExecutionSession`` instance. ExecutionSession; manages the string pool, error reporting, synchronization, and symbol; lookup. 3. ORCv2 uses uniqued strings (``SymbolStringPtr`` instances) rather than; string values in order to reduce memory overhead and improve lookup; performance. See the subsection `How to manage symbol strings`_. 4. IR layers require ThreadSafeModule instances, rather than; std::unique_ptr<Module>s. ThreadSafeModule is a wrapper that ensures that; Modules that use the same LLVMContext are not accessed concurrently.; See `How to use ThreadSafeModule and ThreadSafeContext`_. 5.

Doing this helps to avoid bugs where the definition does not match the; declaration from the header. For example, the following C++ code defines a new; overload of ``llvm::foo`` instead of providing a definition for the existing; function declared in the header:. .. code-block:: c++. // Foo.cpp; #include ""Foo.h""; namespace llvm {; int foo(char *s) { // Mismatch between ""const char *"" and ""char *""; }; } // namespace llvm. This error will not be caught until the build is nearly complete, when the; linker fails to find a definition for any uses of the original function. If the; function were instead defined with a namespace qualifier, the error would have; been caught immediately when the definition was compiled.

This condition, signaled by a `Minuit` warning; message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors; unreliable. See the discussion above ‘Getting the right parameter; errors with limits'. The best way to be absolutely sure of the errors is to use; ''independent'' calculations and compare them, or compare the; calculated errors with a picture of the function. Theoretically, the; covariance matrix for a ''physical'' function must be; positive-definite at the minimum, although it may not be so for all; points far away from the minimum, even for a well-determined physical; problem. Therefore, if `MIGRAD` reports that it has found a; non-positive-definite covariance matrix, this may be a sign of one or; more of the following:. #### A Non-physical Region. On its way to the minimum, `MIGRAD` may have traversed a region that; has unphysical behavior, which is of course not a serious problem as; long as it recovers and leaves such a region. #### An Underdetermined Problem. If the matrix is not positive-definite even at the minimum, this may; mean that the solution is not well defined, for example that there are; more unknowns than there are data points, or that the parameterization; of the fit contains a linear dependence. If this is the case, then; `Minuit` (or any other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely.; The error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user; must remove the under determinedness by reformulating the; parameterization. `Minuit` cannot do this itself. #### Numerical Inaccuracies. It is possible that the apparent lack of positive-definiteness is due; to excessive round off errors in numerical calculations (in the user; function), or not enough precision.

Note that `majorname` and `minorname` may be expressions using original; tree variables e.g.: ""`run-90000`"", ""`event +3*xx`"". In case an; expression is specified, the equivalent expression must be computed when; calling `GetEntryWithIndex()`. To build an index with only `majorname`,; specify `minorname=""0""` (default). Note that once the index is built, it can be saved with the **`TTree`**; object with:. ``` {.cpp}; tree.Write(); //if the file has been open in ""update"" mode; ```.

The organization of branches allows the designer to optimize the data; for the anticipated use. The class for a branch is called **`TBranch`**.; If two variables are independent, and the designer knows the variables; will not be used together, they should be placed on separate branches.; If, however, the variables are related, such as the coordinates of a; point, it is most efficient to create one branch with both coordinates; on it. A variable on a **`TBranch`** is called a leaf (yes -; **`TLeaf`**). Another point to keep in mind when designing trees is that; branches of the same **`TTree`** can be written to separate files. To; add a **`TBranch`** to a **`TTree`** we call the; method **`TTree::Branch()`**. Note that we DO NOT use the `TBranch`; constructor. The `TTree::Branch` method has several signatures.

Availability,"n of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them. This requirement makes sure that the; compiler does not insert additional exception handling code into the interface; functions. This is a performance consideration: ``lib/Support`` functions are; at the bottom of many call chains and as such can be frequently called. We; need them to be as efficient as possible. However, no routines in the system; library should actually throw exceptions.

After finding out the node containing; the particle, one can check if the geometry state is different compared; to the last located point:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t *TGeoManager::IsSameLocation(); ```. The algorithm for finding where a point is located in geometry is; presented in the figure 17-36. It always starts by checking if the last computed modeller state is the; answer. This optimizes the search when continuously tracking a particle.; The main actions performed are:. - moving up and down in the logical node tree while updating the; current node and its global matrix; - converting the global position into the local frame of the current; node/volume; - checking whether the local position lies within the geometrical; shape of the current volume - if this is the case continue the; search downwards for the daughters of the current node, otherwise; search upwards its containers until the top level is reached.; - the number of candidate nodes to be checked at a given level is; minimized by an additional optimization structure: voxels. This is; effective even in case there is only one daughter of the current; volume.; - in case the current node is declared as possibly overlapping, the; method FindInCluster() is invoked.

In ``-fbounds-safety``, arrays are also; decayed to pointers, but with the addition of an implicit bounds annotation,; which includes variable-length arrays (VLAs). As shown in the following example,; arrays on function prototypes are decalyed to corresponding ``__counted_by``; pointers. .. code-block:: c. // Function prototype: void foo(int n, int *__counted_by(n) arr);; void foo(int n, int arr[n]);. // Function prototype: void bar(int *__counted_by(10) arr);; void bar(int arr[10]);. This means the array parameters are treated as `__counted_by` pointers within; the function and callers of the function also see them as the corresponding; `__counted_by` pointers. Incomplete arrays on function prototypes will cause a compiler error unless it; has ``__counted_by`` annotation in its bracket. .. code-block:: c. void f1(int n, int arr[]); // error. void f3(int n, int arr[__counted_by(n)]); // ok. void f2(int n, int arr[n]); // ok, decays to int *__counted_by(n). void f4(int n, int *__counted_by(n) arr); // ok. void f5(int n, int *arr); // ok, but decays to int *__single,; // and cannot be used for pointer arithmetic.

In C, similar to arrays on the function prototypes, a reference to array is; automatically promoted (or ""decayed"") to a pointer to its first element (e.g.,; ``&arr[0]``). In `-fbounds-safety`, array references are promoted to ``__bidi_indexable``; pointers which contain the upper and lower bounds of the array, with the; equivalent of ``&arr[0]`` serving as the lower bound and ``&arr[array_size]``; (or one past the last element) serving as the upper bound.

The minimum required version of CMake has been updated to 3.9 or newer to be; able to take advantage of new features such as native support for the CUDA; language, among other things. Please refer to CMake's release notes for further; information. The method to select the C++ standard has changed. Now the recommended way; to select the C++ standard is via the option `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=XX`, which; is the idiomatic way to do it in CMake. The old options still work, but have; been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Build option descriptions have been updated to indicate which builtins require; an active network connection during the build. You can inspect the list of; options and their descriptions by running `cmake -LH $PWD` in the build; directory. The build system has been updated to remove most file globbing to improve; the reliability of incremental builds when source files are added or removed. A new check has been added to make ROOT fail during the configuration step; if incompatible versions of the Python interpreter and its libraries are; selected. The `all=ON` option now tries to enable more options. Some options had their; default value toggled to disabled, which affected `all=ON`. Now all options; are listed explicitly so that they are enabled regardless of their default; value. ### Builtins. The following builtins had their versions updated for this release:. * VecCore 0.5.2; * Vc 1.4.1; * XRootD 4.8.5; * OpenSSL 1.0.2q; * PCRE 8.42. ### Header location and `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` / `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`.

To support reading and writing such fields, you need to use the maskedBitSet(); method and provide the bit values, their names and the enumeration mask. .. code-block:: c++. template <>; struct ScalarBitSetTraits<MyFlags> {; static void bitset(IO &io, MyFlags &value) {; io.bitSetCase(value, ""featureA"", flagsFeatureA);; io.bitSetCase(value, ""featureB"", flagsFeatureB);; io.bitSetCase(value, ""featureC"", flagsFeatureC);; io.maskedBitSetCase(value, ""CPU1"", flagsCPU1, flagsCPUMask);; io.maskedBitSetCase(value, ""CPU2"", flagsCPU2, flagsCPUMask);; }; };. YAML I/O (when writing) will apply the enumeration mask to the flags field,; and compare the result and values from the bitset. As in case of a regular; bitset, each that matches will cause the corresponding string to be added; to the flow sequence. Custom Scalar; -------------; Sometimes for readability a scalar needs to be formatted in a custom way. For; instance your internal data structure may use an integer for time (seconds since; some epoch), but in YAML it would be much nicer to express that integer in; some time format (e.g. 4-May-2012 10:30pm). YAML I/O has a way to support; custom formatting and parsing of scalar types by specializing ScalarTraits<> on; your data type. When writing, YAML I/O will provide the native type and; your specialization must create a temporary llvm::StringRef.

The last step is implementing the ``-cc1`` command line argument; parsing/generation that initializes/serializes the option class (in our case; ``CodeGenOptions``) stored within ``CompilerInvocation``. This can be done; automatically by using the marshalling annotations on the option definition:. .. code-block:: diff. // Options.td. def fpass_plugin_EQ : Joined<[""-""], ""fpass-plugin="">,; Group<f_Group>, Flags<[CC1Option]>,; HelpText<""Load pass plugin from a dynamic shared object file."">,; + MarshallingInfoStringVector<CodeGenOpts<""PassPlugins"">>;.

Here is an example that shows how to replace it in the unlikely case you were using it:. ```C++; RooArgSet normSet{x}; // normalization set. // Old way 1: create a RooGenFunction:; RooGenFunction func1{pdf, x, {}, normSet};. // Old way 2: use `RooAbsReal::iGenFunction()`:; std::unique_ptr<ROOT::Math::IGenFunction> func2{; pdf.iGenFunction(x, normSet); };. // How to do it now:; RooFunctor functor{pdf, x, {}, normSet};; ROOT::Math::Functor1D func3{functor};; // Functor1D takes by reference, so the RooFunctor also needs to stay alive.; ```. For the same reason, the `RooMultiGenFunction` class that implements a multidimensional `ROOT::Math::IMultiGenFunction` is removed too.; It can easily be replaced by a `ROOT::Math::Functor`:. ```C++; RooFunctor functor{pdf, observables, {}, normSet};; ROOT::Math::Functor func4{functor, static_cast<unsigned int>(functor.nObs())};; // Functor takes by reference, so the RooFunctor also needs to stay alive.; ```. ### Define infinity as `std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity()`. RooFit has its internal representation of infinity in `RooNumber::infinity()`, which was `1e30` before. Now, it is defined as `std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity()`, to be consistent with the C++ standard library and other code. This change also affects the `RooNumber::isInfinite()` function. ### Remove `add(row, weight, weightError)` from RooAbsData interface. It was not good to have this signature in RooAbsData, because the; implementations in the two derived classes RooDataHist and RooDataSet were; inconsistent. The RooDataSet indeed took the weight error as the third argument, but; the RooDataHist version instead took the sum of weights squared, which; is equivalent to the squared weight error. Therefore, the virtual `RooAbsData::add(row, weight, weightError)` function was removed. ### Removal of `RooMomentMorphND` class.

The power; in TableGen is, however, to interpret the source files into an internal; representation that can be generated into anything you want. Current usage of TableGen is to create huge include files with tables that you; can either include directly (if the output is in the language you're coding),; or be used in pre-processing via macros surrounding the include of the file. Direct output can be used if the backend already prints a table in C format; or if the output is just a list of strings (for error and warning messages).; Pre-processed output should be used if the same information needs to be used; in different contexts (like Instruction names), so your backend should print; a meta-information list that can be shaped into different compile-time formats. See :doc:`TableGen BackEnds <./BackEnds>` for a list of available; backends, and see the :doc:`TableGen Backend Developer's Guide <./BackGuide>`; for information on how to write and debug a new backend.

The common theme is that, while TableGen allows; you to build domain specific languages, the final languages that you create; lack the power of other DSLs, which in turn increase considerably the size; and complexity of TableGen files.

It creates a; class that loops over the trees entries one by one. You can then expand; it to do the logic of your analysis. The `TTree::MakeSelector` is the recommended method for ROOT data; analysis. It is especially important for large data set in a parallel; processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several; processors and you can specify which entries to send to each processor.; With `MakeClass` the user has control over the event loop, with; `MakeSelector `the tree is in control of the event loop. ## Simple Analysis Using TTree::Draw.

Corresponding; members in each definition of such multiply-defined classes are identified; either by redeclaration chains (if the members are ``Redeclarable``); or by simply a pointer to the canonical declaration (if the declarations; are not ``Redeclarable`` -- in that case, a ``Mergeable`` base class is used; instead). Error Handling; --------------. Clang produces an AST even when the code contains errors. Clang won't generate; and optimize code for it, but it's used as parsing continues to detect further; errors in the input. Clang-based tools also depend on such ASTs, and IDEs in; particular benefit from a high-quality AST for broken code. In presence of errors, clang uses a few error-recovery strategies to present the; broken code in the AST:. - correcting errors: in cases where clang is confident about the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics. Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery. Prior to Recovery AST, a mismatched-argument function call; expression was dropped though a CallExpr was created for semantic analysis. With these strategies, clang surfaces better diagnostics, and provides AST; consumers a rich AST reflecting the written source code as much as possible even; for broken code.

One of the things this main program has to do is initialize the Cling interpreter. There are optional calls to pass command line arguments to Cling.

Typedef Preservation and Selective Unwrapping; Many programmers use high-level user defined types, typedefs, and other; syntactic sugar to refer to types in their program. This is useful because they; can abbreviate otherwise very long types and it is useful to preserve the; typename in diagnostics. However, sometimes very simple typedefs can wrap; trivial types and it is important to strip off the typedef to understand what; is going on. Clang aims to handle both cases well.; The following example shows where it is important to preserve; a typedef in C. $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:15:11: error: can't convert between vector values of different size ('__m128' and 'int const *'); myvec[1]/P;; ~~~~~~~~^~. The following example shows where it is useful for the compiler to expose; underlying details of a typedef. If the user was somehow confused about how the; system ""pid_t"" typedef is defined, Clang helpfully displays it with ""aka"". $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:13:9: error: member reference base type 'pid_t' (aka 'int') is not a structure or union; myvar = myvar.x;; ~~~~~ ^. In C++, type preservation includes retaining any qualification written into type names.

Fortunately, incorrect manglings usually do not result; in runtime errors. Non-inline functions with incorrect manglings usually; result in link errors, which are relatively easy to diagnose. Incorrect; manglings for inline functions and templates result in multiple copies in the; final image. The C++ standard requires that those addresses be equal, but few; programs rely on this. * Member pointers: :good:`Mostly complete`. Standard C++ member pointers are; fully implemented and should be ABI compatible. Both `#pragma; pointers_to_members`_ and the `/vm`_ flags are supported.

If you need some functionality that; you cannot find in a class you know, you might want to check for classes in the same; module - maybe one of them does what you need. List of Modules; Modules are listed ontop of the Class Index and as part; of the Library Dependencies Chart. Modules' Library Dependencies; Each module is assumed to be part of a library. The dependencies of libraries are; not only relevant for linking, but often reflect also the contextual dependencies.; The dependencies of all modules are shown in the; Library Dependencies Chart. Class Reference; Pages like the one for TH2 are; class references. They document the use and functionality of a class. Sections; Each class reference page has a class documentation, which documents what the class; can be used for, and gives hints on how to use it. This allows you to figure out; whether a certain class is appropriate for what you try to do. The page then lists; all available members; they define a class's functionality and its interaction with; your code. The next item is a tabbed set of charts, which allow you to study the; class's inheritance diagram, what members get inherited from where, and which members; are re-implemented, which files get indirectly included by including the class's; header, and which libraries this class depends on. The remainder of the page contains; the functions' documentation. And there is a little tool box floating around, which; gives you some display options and a link to this help page. We will now go through all these parts in detail. Link Box; On the top of the page you can find a list of links. The first line contains the current; ""location"", giving the home page, the module name, and the class name.; The second line links to generic pages, like ROOT's home page, the; Class Index, and the Class Hierarchy.; The last line allows you to jump to the sections of the current page and a colored; version of the class's header and source file.

Basic blocks in LLVM are an important part; of functions that define the `Control Flow; Graph <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow_graph>`_. Since we; don't have any control flow, our functions will only contain one block; at this point. We'll fix this in `Chapter 5 <LangImpl05.html>`_ :). Next we add the function arguments to the NamedValues map (after first clearing; it out) so that they're accessible to ``VariableExprAST`` nodes. .. code-block:: c++. if (Value *RetVal = Body->codegen()) {; // Finish off the function.; Builder->CreateRet(RetVal);. // Validate the generated code, checking for consistency.; verifyFunction(*TheFunction);. return TheFunction;; }. Once the insertion point has been set up and the NamedValues map populated,; we call the ``codegen()`` method for the root expression of the function. If no; error happens, this emits code to compute the expression into the entry block; and returns the value that was computed. Assuming no error, we then create an; LLVM `ret instruction <../../LangRef.html#ret-instruction>`_, which completes the function.; Once the function is built, we call ``verifyFunction``, which is; provided by LLVM. This function does a variety of consistency checks on; the generated code, to determine if our compiler is doing everything; right. Using this is important: it can catch a lot of bugs. Once the; function is finished and validated, we return it. .. code-block:: c++. // Error reading body, remove function.; TheFunction->eraseFromParent();; return nullptr;; }. The only piece left here is handling of the error case. For simplicity,; we handle this by merely deleting the function we produced with the; ``eraseFromParent`` method. This allows the user to redefine a function; that they incorrectly typed in before: if we didn't delete it, it would; live in the symbol table, with a body, preventing future redefinition.

See the ""RooFit Libraries"" section below for more details, or see [the tutorial](https://root.cern/doc/master/rf408__RDataFrameToRooFit_8C.html). ### Notable changes in behavior. - Using `Alias`, it is now possible to register homonymous aliases (alternative column names) in different branches of the computation graph, in line with the behavior of `Define` (until now, aliases were required to be unique in the whole computaton graph).; - The `Histo*D` methods now support the combination of scalar values and vector-like weight values. For each entry, the histogram is filled once for each weight, always with the same scalar value.; - The `Histo*D` methods do not work on columns of type `std::string` anymore. They used to fill the histogram with the integer value corresponding to each of the characters in the string. Please use `Fill` with a custom class to recover the old behavior if that was what was desired. ### Other improvements. - The scaling to a large amount of threads of computation graphs with many simple `Filter`s or `Define`s has been greatly improved, see also [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1036730/#1-a-performance-study-of-the-r) for more details; - The output format of `Display` has been significantly improved.; - The `Fill` method now correctly supports user-defined classes with arbitrary `Fill` signatures (see [#9428](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9428)). ### Experimental Distributed RDataFrame. The distributed RDataFrame module has been improved. Now it supports sending RDataFrame tasks to a [Dask](https://dask.org/) scheduler. Through Dask, RDataFrame can be also scaled to a cluster of machines managed through a batch system like HTCondor or Slurm.

However, this is really only intended to cover common cases; that we have seen arise: different situations are different, and we are open; to discussing unusual cases as well - just start an RFC thread on the; `LLVM Discourse forums`_. Adding a New Target; -------------------. LLVM is very receptive to new targets, even experimental ones, but a number of; problems can appear when adding new large portions of code, and back-ends are; normally added in bulk.

To aleviate the pain for Windows users who want to try ROOT 6 we provide; a recipe on how to run ROOT 6 in a VM on Windows. Building ROOT also requires a C++11 compatible compiler, so one needs to either have installed gcc >= 4.8 or Clang >= 3.4. On most lecagy platforms these newer compilers are available via a special install.; See the [build prerequisites](https://root.cern/install/dependencies/) page. Despite that, an additional platform as been added: the [x32; psAPI](https://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/), called linuxx32gcc. It is; a regular x86-64 ABI but with shorter pointers (4 bytes instead of 8).; This reduces the addressable memory per process to 4GB - but that is; usally sufficient. The advantages are reduced memory consumption (due to; the smaller pointers) and increased performance compared to 32 bit; applications due to the availability of the 64 bit instructions. The; Clang developers mailing list archive [contains a good; comparison](http://clang-developers.42468.n3.nabble.com/Re-PATCH-add-x32-psABI-support-td4024297.html). To build and run binaries compiled in x32, toolchain support is needed.; That is available in the in binutils (2.22), GCC (4.8), glibc (2.16),; Linux kernel (3.4) and even GDB (7.5).

In; the code above, the `DBG_INSTR_REF` instruction refers to instruction number; one, operand zero, while the `ADD32rr` has a `debug-instr-number` attribute; attached indicating that it is instruction number one. De-coupling variable locations from registers avoids difficulties involving; register allocation and optimisation, but requires additional instrumentation; when the instructions are optimised instead. Optimisations that replace; instructions with optimised versions that compute the same value must either; preserve the instruction number, or record a substitution from the old; instruction / operand number pair to the new instruction / operand pair -- see; `MachineFunction::substituteDebugValuesForInst`. If debug info maintenance is; not performed, or an instruction is eliminated as dead code, the variable; location is safely dropped and marked ""optimised out"". The exception is; instructions that are mutated rather than replaced, which always need debug info; maintenance. # Register allocator considerations. When the register allocator runs, debugging instructions do not directly refer; to any virtual registers, and thus there is no need for expensive location; maintenance during regalloc (i.e. `LiveDebugVariables`). Debug instructions are; unlinked from the function, then linked back in after register allocation; completes. The exception is `PHI` instructions: these become implicit definitions at; control flow merges once regalloc finishes, and any debug numbers attached to; `PHI` instructions are lost.

Use a semaphore; to synchronize threads. The platform dependent implementation is in the; **`TMutexImp`** and **`TConditionImp`** classes. ### TThread for Pedestrians. To run a thread in ROOT, follow these steps:. 1. Initialization. Add these lines to your `rootlogon.C`:. ``` {.cpp}; {; ...; // The next line may be unnecessary on some platforms; gSystem->Load(""/usr/lib/libpthread.so"");; gSystem->Load(""$ROOTSYS/lib/libThread.so"");; ...; }; ```. This loads the library with the **`TThread`** class and the `pthread`; specific implementation file for `Posix` threads. 2. Coding. Define a function (e.g. `void* UserFun(void* UserArgs))` that should run; as a thread. The code for the examples is at the web site of the authors; (Jörn Adamczewski, Marc Hemberger). After downloading the code from this; site, you can follow the example below:. <http://www-linux.gsi.de/~go4/HOWTOthreads/howtothreadsbody.html>. 3. Loading. Start an interactive ROOT session. Load the shared library:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gSystem->Load(""mhs3.so""); // or; root[] gSystem->Load(""CalcPiThread.so"");; ```. 4. Creating. Create a thread instance (see also example `RunMhs3.C `or` RunPi.C`); with:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TThread *th = new TThread(UserFun,UserArgs);; ```. When called from the interpreter, this gives the name ""`UserFun`"" to the; thread. This name can be used to retrieve the thread later. However,; when called from compiled code, this method does not give any name to; the thread. So give a name to the thread in compiled use:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TThread *th = new TThread(""MyThread"", UserFun, UserArgs);; ```. You can pass arguments to the thread function using the; `UserArgs`-pointer. When you want to start a method of a class as a; thread, you have to give the pointer to the class instance as; `UserArgs`. 5.

Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types. Success values are created by calling ``Error::success()``, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. Error foo() {; // Do something.; // Return success.; return Error::success();; }. Success values are very cheap to construct and return - they have minimal; impact on program performance. Failure values are constructed using ``make_error<T>``, where ``T`` is any class; that inherits from the ErrorInfo utility, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. class BadFileFormat : public ErrorInfo<BadFileFormat> {; public:; static char ID;; std::string Path;.

Availability,"ndler Carruth - [chandlerc@google.com](mailto:chandlerc@google.com). ## Problem Statement. Recently, Google Project Zero and other researchers have found information leak; vulnerabilities by exploiting speculative execution in modern CPUs. These; exploits are currently broken down into three variants:; * GPZ Variant #1 (a.k.a. Spectre Variant #1): Bounds check (or predicate) bypass; * GPZ Variant #2 (a.k.a. Spectre Variant #2): Branch target injection; * GPZ Variant #3 (a.k.a. Meltdown): Rogue data cache load. For more details, see the Google Project Zero blog post and the Spectre research; paper:; * https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html; * https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf. The core problem of GPZ Variant #1 is that speculative execution uses branch; prediction to select the path of instructions speculatively executed. This path; is speculatively executed with the available data, and may load from memory and; leak the loaded values through various side channels that survive even when the; speculative execution is unwound due to being incorrect. Mispredicted paths can; cause code to be executed with data inputs that never occur in correct; executions, making checks against malicious inputs ineffective and allowing; attackers to use malicious data inputs to leak secret data. Here is an example,; extracted and simplified from the Project Zero paper:; ```; struct array {; unsigned long length;; unsigned char data[];; };; struct array *arr1 = ...; // small array; struct array *arr2 = ...; // array of size 0x400; unsigned long untrusted_offset_from_caller = ...;; if (untrusted_offset_from_caller < arr1->length) {; unsigned char value = arr1->data[untrusted_offset_from_caller];; unsigned long index2 = ((value&1)*0x100)+0x200;; unsigned char value2 = arr2->data[index2];; }; ```.

The `suspend` block contains code to be executed when coroutine runs to; completion or suspended. The `coro.end`_ intrinsic marks the point where; a coroutine needs to return control back to the caller if it is not an initial; invocation of the coroutine. The `loop` blocks represents the body of the coroutine. The `coro.suspend`_; intrinsic in combination with the following switch indicates what happens to; control flow when a coroutine is suspended (default case), resumed (case 0) or; destroyed (case 1). Coroutine Transformation; ------------------------. One of the steps of coroutine lowering is building the coroutine frame. The; def-use chains are analyzed to determine which objects need be kept alive across; suspend points. In the coroutine shown in the previous section, use of virtual register; `%inc` is separated from the definition by a suspend point, therefore, it; cannot reside on the stack frame since the latter goes away once the coroutine; is suspended and control is returned back to the caller. An i32 slot is; allocated in the coroutine frame and `%inc` is spilled and reloaded from that; slot as needed. We also store addresses of the resume and destroy functions so that the; `coro.resume` and `coro.destroy` intrinsics can resume and destroy the coroutine; when its identity cannot be determined statically at compile time. For our; example, the coroutine frame will be:. .. code-block:: llvm. %f.frame = type { ptr, ptr, i32 }.

This convention behaves identically to the `C`; calling convention on how arguments and return values are passed, but it; uses a different set of caller/callee-saved registers. This alleviates the; burden of saving and recovering a large register set before and after the; call in the caller.

The idea behind this convention is to support calls to runtime functions; that have a hot path and a cold path. The hot path is usually a small piece; of code that doesn't use many registers.

In the best case, where the minimum is far from any limits, M will; correctly transform the error matrix, and the parameter errors it; reports should be accurate and very close to those you would have got; without limits. In other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you wouldn't need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. On the; other hand, the $\mbox{MINOS}$ analysis is still meaningful, at; least in principle, as long as $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (which is called; internally by $\mbox{MINOS}$) does not get blocked at a limit.; Unfortunately, the user has no control over this aspect of the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ calculation, although it is possible to get enough; printout from the $\mbox{MINOS}$ result to be able to determine; whether the results are reliable or not. ## Fixing and releasing parameters ##.

One way to avoid this is to fix; parameter four at a ""good"" value (not necessarily the best, since you; presumably don't know that yet), and minimize with respect to the; others. Then release parameter four and minimize again.

Availability,"ng. With this version we introduce a new module, core/multiproc, for multi-processing on multi-core machines. This module is based on fork technology and offers an interface inspired from Python multiprocessor module. The new interface, implemented in the class TProcPool, provides the possibility to perform in parallel a very generic set of tasks, described by macros, functions or lambdas. This illustrates the usage of lambdas:. ``` {.cpp}; {; TProcPool pool;; auto ten = pool.MapReduce([]() { return 1; }, 10, [](std::vector<int> v) { return std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0); }); }; ```. And this how it can be used to generate ten histos and merge them:. ``` {.cpp}; {; TObject *CreateAndFillHists(); {. TH1F *h = new TH1F(""h"", """", 100, -3., 3.);; h->SetDirectory(0);; h->FillRandom(""gaus"", 1000);; return h;; }. TProcPool pool;; auto hist = pool.MapReduce(CreateAndFillHists, 10, PoolUtils::ReduceObjects);; hist->DrawClone();; }; ```. Tutorials illustrating other usages of the new class TProcPool are available under tutorials/multicore. ## Language Bindings. ### Notebooks; We provided integration of ROOT with the Jupyter technology, integrating ROOT with Python Notebooks and providing a ROOT Kernel like functionality - de facto an enhanced C++ web based shell. Tab completion, output and graphics inlining have been added. These functionalities are automatically available upon import of the ROOT module in a Notebook or at startup of a ROOT prompt kernel.; We made it easier to use ROOT notebooks locally, by providing a 'root --notebook' command option to start a local notebook server customised with all the ROOT features. New tutorials and code examples have been provided. The simplest example showing the integration of ROOT with the notebook technology can be found [here](https://root.cern.ch/notebooks/HowTos/HowTo_ROOT-Notebooks.html) and many more snippets [here](https://root.cern.ch/code-examples#notebooks).

Availability,"not needed for the constructor of node ``A``. Error Handling; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every import function returns with either an ``llvm::Error`` or an; ``llvm::Expected<T>`` object. This enforces to check the return value of the; import functions. If there was an error during one import then we return with; that error. (Exception: when we import the members of a class, we collect the; individual errors with each member and we concatenate them in one Error; object.) We cache these errors in cases of declarations. During the next import; call if there is an existing error we just return with that. So, clients of the; library receive an Error object, which they must check. During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we recognize an error. In this case, we signal back; the error to the caller, but the ""to"" context remains polluted with those nodes; which had been created. Ideally, those nodes should not had been created, but; that time we did not know about the error, the error happened later. Since the; AST is immutable (most of the cases we can't remove existing nodes) we choose; to mark these nodes as erroneous. We cache the errors associated with declarations in the ""from"" context in; ``ASTImporter::ImportDeclErrors`` and the ones which are associated with the; ""to"" context in ``ASTImporterSharedState::ImportErrors``. Note that, there may; be several ASTImporter objects which import into the same ""to"" context but from; different ""from"" contexts; in this case, they have to share the associated; errors of the ""to"" context. When an error happens, that propagates through the call stack, through all the; dependant nodes. However, in case of dependency cycles, this is not enough,; because we strive to mark the erroneous nodes so clients can act upon.

For example, leaf `""l""` under branch `""b""` might now be mentioned as `""l""` as well as `""b.l""`, while only one of the two spellings might have been recognized before.; - Certain RDF-related types in the `ROOT::Detail` and `ROOT::Internal` namespaces have been renamed, most notably `RCustomColumn` is now `RDefine`. This does not impact code that only makes use of entities in the public ROOT namespace, and should not impact downstream code unless it was patching or reusing internal `RDataFrame` types. ### Notable bug fixes and improvements. - A critical issue has been fixed that could potentially result in wrong data being silently read in multi-thread runs when an input `TChain` contained more than one `TTree` coming from the _same_ input file.

The predicate is specified by a mask operand, which holds one bit per vector element, switching the associated vector lane on or off.

The physical layout changes slightly from big endian to little endian so that it matches the in-memory layout on; most modern architectures. Combined with a clear separation of offset/index data and payload data for collections,; uncompressed RNTuple data can be directly mapped to memory without further copies. Goals; -----. RNTuple shall investigate improvements of the TTree I/O in the following ways. 1. More speed; * Improve mapping to vectorized and parallel hardware; * For types known at compile / JIT time: generate optimized code; * Optimized for simple types (float, int, and vectors of them); * Better memory control: work with a fixed budget of pre-defined I/O buffers; * Naturally thread-safe and asynchronous interfaces. 2. More robust interfaces; * Compile-time type safety by default; * Decomposition into layers: logical layer, primitives layer, storage layer; * Separation of data model and live data; * Self-contained I/O code to support creation of a standalone I/O library. Concepts; --------. At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which represents a memory location; storing a value of the given C++ type. These distinguished memory locations are the destinations and sources for the; deserialization and serialization. The (de-)serialization is a mapping from the C++ type to the more simple **column** type system.

The tool would simplify the code to:. ```c++; void Example() {; f();; g();; }; ```. We can solve this problem with a classic constant propagation lattice combined; with symbolic evaluation. ## Example: finding inefficient usages of associative containers. Real-world code often accidentally performs repeated lookups in associative; containers:. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; xs[42]->name = ""..."";; xs[42]->title = ""..."";; ```. To find the above inefficiency we can use the available expressions analysis to; understand that `m[42]` is evaluated twice. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; Employee &e = xs[42];; e->name = ""..."";; e->title = ""..."";; ```. We can also track the `m.contains()` check in the flow condition to find; redundant checks, like in the example below. ```c++; std::map<int, Employee> xs;; if (!xs.contains(42)) {; xs.insert({42, someEmployee});; }; ```. ## Example: refactoring types that implicitly convert to each other. Refactoring one strong type to another is difficult, but the compiler can help:; once you refactor one reference to the type, the compiler will flag other places; where this information flows with type mismatch errors. Unfortunately this; strategy does not work when you are refactoring types that implicitly convert to; each other, for example, replacing `int32_t` with `int64_t`. Imagine that we want to change user IDs from 32 to 64-bit integers. In other; words, we need to find all integers tainted with user IDs. We can use data flow; analysis to implement taint analysis. ```c++; void UseUser(int32_t user_id) {; int32_t id = user_id;; // Variable `id` is tainted with a user ID.; ...; }; ```.

Thus, if you need a value to be live across basic; block boundaries, it *must* live in a virtual register. Call-clobbered registers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Some machine instructions, like calls, clobber a large number of physical; registers. Rather than adding ``<def,dead>`` operands for all of them, it is; possible to use an ``MO_RegisterMask`` operand instead.

In (1) you should annotate the method as returning a _Nonnull; object.; In (2) the method should be marked _Nullable.; In (3) you should probably annotate the method _Nonnull.

After a `HESSE` step, the errors are usually; quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. `Minuit`, when it; prints out error values, also gives some indication of how reliable it; thinks they are.

The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed.

If the error value that is passed to; ``handleErrors`` does not match any of the handlers it will be returned from; handleErrors. Idiomatic use of ``handleErrors`` thus looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. if (auto Err =; handleErrors(; processFormattedFile(...),; [](const BadFileFormat &BFF) {; report(""Unable to process "" + BFF.Path + "": bad format"");; },; [](const FileNotFound &FNF) {; report(""File not found "" + FNF.Path);; })); return Err;. In cases where you truly know that the handler list is exhaustive the; ``handleAllErrors`` function can be used instead. This is identical to; ``handleErrors`` except that it will terminate the program if an unhandled; error is passed in, and can therefore return void. The ``handleAllErrors``; function should generally be avoided: the introduction of a new error type; elsewhere in the program can easily turn a formerly exhaustive list of errors; into a non-exhaustive list, risking unexpected program termination. Where; possible, use handleErrors and propagate unknown errors up the stack instead. For tool code, where errors can be handled by printing an error message then; exiting with an error code, the :ref:`ExitOnError <err_exitonerr>` utility; may be a better choice than handleErrors, as it simplifies control flow when; calling fallible functions.

Therefore, it is; recommended that:. - Limits on variable parameters should be used only when needed in; order to prevent the parameter from taking on unphysical values. - When a satisfactory minimum has been found using limits, the; limits should then be removed if possible, in order to perform or; re-perform the error analysis without limits. ### How to Get the Right Answer from Minuit. `Minuit` offers the user a choice of several minimization algorithms.; The `MIGRAD` algorithm is in general the best minimized for nearly all; functions. It is a variable-metric method with inexact line search, a; stable metric updating scheme, and checks for positive-definiteness.; Its main weakness is that it depends heavily on knowledge of the first; derivatives, and fails miserably if they are very inaccurate. If parameter limits are needed, in spite of the side effects, then the; user should be aware of the following techniques to alleviate problems; caused by limits:. #### Getting the Right Minimum with Limits. If MIGRAD converges normally to a point where no parameter is near one; of its limits, then the existence of limits has probably not prevented; `Minuit` from finding the right minimum. On the other hand, if one or; more parameters is near it",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:57404,error,error,57404,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['error'],['error']

All of this only applies to C code; the meaning of inline; in C++ is very different from its meaning in either GNU89 or C99. ""missing"" vector __builtin functions. The Intel and AMD manuals document a number ""<*mmintrin.h>""; header files, which define a standardized API for accessing vector operations; on X86 CPUs. These functions have names like _mm_xor_ps and; _mm256_addsub_pd. Compilers have leeway to implement these functions; however they want. Since Clang supports an excellent set of native vector operations,; the Clang headers implement these interfaces in terms of the native vector; operations. In contrast, GCC implements these functions mostly as a 1-to-1 mapping to; builtin function calls, like __builtin_ia32_paddw128. These builtin; functions are an internal implementation detail of GCC, and are not portable to; the Intel compiler, the Microsoft compiler, or Clang. If you get build errors; mentioning these, the fix is simple: switch to the *mmintrin.h functions.; The same issue occurs for NEON and Altivec for the ARM and PowerPC; architectures respectively. For these, make sure to use the <arm_neon.h>; and <altivec.h> headers.; For x86 architectures this script should help with; the manual migration process. It will rewrite your source files in place to; use the APIs instead of builtin function calls. Just call it like this:. builtins.py *.c *.h. and it will rewrite all of the .c and .h files in the current directory to; use the API calls instead of calls like __builtin_ia32_paddw128. Lvalue casts. Old versions of GCC permit casting the left-hand side of an assignment to a; different type. Clang produces an error on similar code, e.g.,. lvalue.c:2:3: error: assignment to cast is illegal, lvalue casts are not supported; (int*)addr = val;; ^~~~~~~~~~ ~. To fix this problem, move the cast to the right-hand side. In this; example, one could use:. addr = (float *)val;.

If this is the case, then M; (or any other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely, and the; error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user; must remove the under-determinedness by reformulating the; parametrization. M cannot do this itself, but it can provide some; hints (contours, global correlation coefficients, eigenvalues) which; can help the clever user to find out what is wrong. - **Numerical inaccuracies.** It is possible that the apparent lack of; positive–definiteness is in fact only due to excessive roundoff; errors in numerical calculations, either in $\mbox{FCN}$ or in M; .

Also, we have to take care of other kinds of; declarations like enums, classes, etc. if they are in anonymous namespaces.; Therefore, we filter the lookup results and consider only those which have the; same visibility as the declaration we currently import. We consider two declarations in two anonymous namespaces to have the same; visibility only if they are imported from the same AST context. Strategies to Handle Conflicting Names; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. During the import we lookup existing declarations with the same name. We filter; the lookup results based on their :ref:`visibility <visibility>`. If any of the; found declarations are not structurally equivalent then we bumped to a name; conflict error (ODR violation in C++). In this case, we return with an; ``Error`` and we set up the ``Error`` object for the declaration. However, some; clients of the ``ASTImporter`` may require a different, perhaps less; conservative and more liberal error handling strategy. E.g. static analysis clients may benefit if the node is created even if there; is a name conflict. During the CTU analysis of certain projects, we recognized; that there are global declarations which collide with declarations from other; translation units, but they are not referenced outside from their translation; unit. These declarations should be in an unnamed namespace ideally. If we treat; these collisions liberally then CTU analysis can find more results.

The amount of code that needs to; be executed is usually quite small and not on the critical path of any; computation, so the overall performance impact of the barrier is tolerable. Barriers often require access to the *object pointer* rather than the *derived; pointer* (which is a pointer to the field within the object).

Here is the signatures of `TH1::Fit` and an explanation of the; parameters:. ``` {.cpp}; TFitResultPtr Fit(TF1 *function, Option_t *option, Option_t *goption,; Axis_t xxmin, Axis_t xxmax); ```; - `function` a pointer to the fitted function (the fit model) object.; One can also use the function name. This name may be one of ROOT pre-defined; function names or a user-defined function. See the next paragraph for the list of pre-defined functions. - `*option:` The second parameter is the fitting option. Here is the; list of fitting options:. 	- ""`W`"" Set all weights to 1 for non empty bins; ignore error bars. 	- ""`WW`"" Set all weights to 1 including empty bins; ignore error; bars. 	- ""`I`"" Use integral of function in bin instead of value at bin; center. 	- ""`L`"" Use log likelihood method (default is chi-square method). To be used when; the histogram represents counts. 	- ""`WL`"" Weighted log likelihood method. To be used when the histogram has been filled with; 	weights different than 1. - ""`P`"" Use Pearson chi-square method, using expected errors instead of the observed one given by `TH1::GetBinError` (default case).; The expected error is instead estimated from the square-root of the bin function value. 	- ""`Q`"" Quiet mode (minimum printing). 	- ""`V`"" Verbose mode (default is between Q and V). 	- ""`S`"" The result of the fit is returned in the `TFitResultPtr`. 	- ""`E`"" Perform better errors estimation using the Minos technique. 	- ""`M`"" Improve fit results, by using the *IMPROVE* algorithm of TMinuit. 	- ""`R`"" Use the range specified in the function range.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:1317,error,error,1317,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['error'],['error']

In this section, we'll be giving examples produced by the Clang command line; driver, but diagnostics can be :ref:`rendered in many different ways; <DiagnosticConsumer>` depending on how the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is; implemented. A representative example of a diagnostic is:. .. code-block:: text. t.c:38:15: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('int *' and '_Complex float'); P = (P-42) + Gamma*4;; ~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~.

Users report that applying this to Clang and LLVM can; decrease overall compile time by 20%. This guide walks you through how to build Clang with PGO, though it also applies; to other subprojects, such as LLD.

We have a script at ``utils/collect_and_build_with_pgo.py``. This script is; tested on a few Linux flavors, and requires a checkout of LLVM, Clang, and; compiler-rt. Despite the name, it performs four clean builds of Clang, so it; can take a while to run to completion. Please see the script's ``--help`` for; more information on how to run it, and the different options available to you.; If you want to get the most out of PGO for a particular use-case (e.g. compiling; a specific large piece of software), please do read the section below on; 'benchmark' selection. Please note that this script is only tested on a few Linux distros. Patches to; add support for other platforms, as always, are highly appreciated. :).

M always carries around its own current estimates of the parameter; errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how accurate they; are at any given point in the execution. For example, at initialization,; these estimates are just the starting step sizes as specified by the; user. After a $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ or $\mbox{HESSE}$ step, the errors; are usually quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. If no; mitigating adjective is given in the printout of the errors, then at; least M believes the errors are accurate, although there is always a; small chance that M has been fooled. Some visible signs that M may have; been fooled are:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of $\mbox{EDM}$ too big. For a ""normal"" minimization,; after $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, the value of $\mbox{EDM}$ is usually; more than three orders of magnitude smaller than $\mbox{up}$,; unless a looser tolerance has been specified. - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).\; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parametrized so that individual errors are not; very meaningful because they are so highly correlated. - Parameter at limit. This condition, signalled by a M warning; message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors; unreliable. See section [answer:right-errors], *Getting the right; parameter errors with limits*. The best way to be absolutely sure of the errors, is to use; ""independent"" calculations and com",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:69407,error,error,69407,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"of relocatable object files. All operations; are performed eagerly on symbol lookup (i.e. a symbol's definition is compiled; as soon as you attempt to look up its address). LLJIT is a suitable replacement; for MCJIT in most cases (note: some more advanced features, e.g.; JITEventListeners are not supported yet). The LLLazyJIT extends LLJIT and adds a CompileOnDemandLayer to enable lazy; compilation of LLVM IR. When an LLVM IR module is added via the addLazyIRModule; method, function bodies in that module will not be compiled until they are first; called. LLLazyJIT aims to provide a replacement of LLVM's original (pre-MCJIT); JIT API. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT instances can be created using their respective builder; classes: LLJITBuilder and LLazyJITBuilder. For example, assuming you have a; module ``M`` loaded on a ThreadSafeContext ``Ctx``:. .. code-block:: c++. // Try to detect the host arch and construct an LLJIT instance.; auto JIT = LLJITBuilder().create();. // If we could not construct an instance, return an error.; if (!JIT); return JIT.takeError();. // Add the module.; if (auto Err = JIT->addIRModule(TheadSafeModule(std::move(M), Ctx))); return Err;. // Look up the JIT'd code entry point.; auto EntrySym = JIT->lookup(""entry"");; if (!EntrySym); return EntrySym.takeError();. // Cast the entry point address to a function pointer.; auto *Entry = EntrySym.getAddress().toPtr<void(*)()>();. // Call into JIT'd code.; Entry();. The builder classes provide a number of configuration options that can be; specified before the JIT instance is constructed. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // Build an LLLazyJIT instance that uses four worker threads for compilation,; // and jumps to a specific error handler (rather than null) on lazy compile; // failures. void handleLazyCompileFailure() {; // JIT'd code will jump here if lazy compilation fails, giving us an; // opportunity to exit or throw an exception into JIT'd code.; throw JITFailed();; }. auto JIT = LLLazyJITBuilder(); .setN",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst:4932,error,error,4932,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them. This requirement makes sure that the; compiler does not insert additional exception handling code into the interface; functions. This is a performance consideration: ``lib/Support`` functions are; at the bottom of many call chains and as such can be frequently called. We; need them to be as efficient as possible. However, no routines in the system; library should actually throw exceptions. Code Organization; -----------------.

Offload Device Compilation; --------------------------. The input file is compiled for each active device toolchain. The device; compilation stage is performed differently from the host stage. Namely, we do; not generate any offloading entries. This is set by passing the; ``-fopenmp-is-target-device`` flag to the front-end. We use the host bitcode to; determine which symbols to export from the device. The bitcode file is passed in; from the previous stage using the ``-fopenmp-host-ir-file-path`` flag.; Compilation is otherwise performed as it would be for any other target triple. When compiling for the OpenMP device, we set the visibility of all device; symbols to be ``protected`` by default. This improves performance and prevents a; class of errors where a symbol in the target device could preempt a host; library. The OpenMP runtime library is linked in during compilation to provide the; implementations for standard OpenMP functionality. For GPU targets this is done; by linking in a special bitcode library during compilation, (e.g.; ``libomptarget-nvptx64-sm_70.bc``) using the ``-mlink-builtin-bitcode`` flag.; Other device libraries, such as CUDA's libdevice, are also linked this way. If; the target is a standard architecture with an existing ``libomp``; implementation, that will be linked instead. Finally, device tools are used to; create a relocatable device object file that can be embedded in the host. .. _Creating Fat Objects:. Creating Fat Objects; --------------------.

Availability,"of your script. The default behavior of `rootcling` is to; not link in (i.e. generate the dictionary for) any of the symbols. In; particular, this means that the following lines are, in the; general case, unnecessary. ``` {.cpp}; #pragma link off all globals;; #pragma link off all classes;; #pragma link off all functions;; ```. This also means that linking the instantiation of a class template:. ``` {.cpp}; #pragma link C++ class mytemplate<int>;; ```. ONLY links this specific class. You need to; request the generation of the iterators explicitly. See the documentation of `rootcling` for details how `pragma` can be; used. NOTE: You should not call ACLiC with a script that has a function; called `main()`. ### Intermediate Steps and Files. ACLiC executes two steps and a third one if needed. These are:. - Calling `rootcling` to create a dictionary using `rootcling`.; - Calling the compiler to build the shared library from the script.; - If there are errors, it calls the compiler to build a dummy; executable to clearly report unresolved symbols. ACLiC makes a shared library with a dictionary containing the; classes and functions declared in the script. It also adds the; classes and functions declared in included files with the same name; as the script file and any of the following extensions: `.h`, `.hh`,; `.hpp`, `.hxx`, `.hPP`, `.hXX`. This means that, by default, you; cannot combine scripts from different files into one library by using; `#include` statements; you will need to compile each script; separately. In a future release, we plan to add the global variables; declared in the script to the dictionary also. If you are curious; about the specific calls, you can raise the ROOT debug level: gDebug=3; and ACLiC will print these steps. If you need to keep the intermediate; files around, for example when debugging the script using gdb, use; gDebug=7. ### Moving between Interpreter and Compiler.

It aims to reduce large test cases to small, useful ones.; For more information on the design and inner workings of **bugpoint**, as well as; advice for using bugpoint, see :doc:`/Bugpoint` in the LLVM; distribution. OPTIONS; -------. **--additional-so** *library*. Load the dynamic shared object *library* into the test program whenever it is; run. This is useful if you are debugging programs which depend on non-LLVM; libraries (such as the X or curses libraries) to run. **--append-exit-code**\ =\ *{true,false}*. Append the test programs exit code to the output file so that a change in exit; code is considered a test failure. Defaults to false. **--args** *program args*. Pass all arguments specified after **--args** to the test program whenever it runs.; Note that if any of the *program args* start with a ""``-``"", you should use:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint [bugpoint args] --args -- [program args].

Pass all arguments specified after **--tool-args** to the LLVM tool under test; (**llc**, **lli**, etc.) whenever it runs. You should use this option in the; following way:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint [bugpoint args] --tool-args -- [tool args].

Given; typedef int X;; typedefType(); matches ""typedef int X"". Matcher<Type>unaryTransformTypeMatcher<UnaryTransformType>...; Matches types nodes representing unary type transformations. Given:; typedef __underlying_type(T) type;; unaryTransformType(); matches ""__underlying_type(T)"". Matcher<Type>usingTypeMatcher<UsingType>...; Matches types specified through a using declaration. Given; namespace a { struct S {}; }; using a::S;; S s;. usingType() matches the type of the variable declaration of s. Matcher<Type>variableArrayTypeMatcher<VariableArrayType>...; Matches C arrays with a specified size that is not an; integer-constant-expression. Given; void f() {; int a[] = { 2, 3 }; int b[42];; int c[a[0]];; }; variableArrayType(); matches ""int c[a[0]]"". Narrowing Matchers. Narrowing matchers match certain attributes on the current node, thus; narrowing down the set of nodes of the current type to match on.; There are special logical narrowing matchers (allOf, anyOf, anything and unless); which allow users to create more powerful match expressions. Return typeNameParameters. Matcher<*>allOfMatcher<*>, ..., Matcher<*>; Matches if all given matchers match. Usable as: Any Matcher. Matcher<*>anyOfMatcher<*>, ..., Matcher<*>; Matches if any of the given matchers matches. Usable as: Any Matcher. Matcher<*>anything; Matches any node. Useful when another matcher requires a child matcher, but there's no; additional constraint. This will often be used with an explicit conversion; to an internal::Matcher<> type such as TypeMatcher. Example: DeclarationMatcher(anything()) matches all declarations, e.g.,; ""int* p"" and ""void f()"" in; int* p;; void f();. Usable as: Any Matcher. unspecifiedmapAnyOfnodeMatcherFunction...; Matches any of the NodeMatchers with InnerMatchers nested within.
