Safety,"We decided to remove the ""conversion"" to AllelicCapseg output from ModelSegments, since this was an ill defined procedure. The models used by AllelicCapseg and AllelicCNV/ModelSegments are simply different, so it's not possible to define a unique conversion between their model parameters. Compounding this, we also had difficulty finding up-to-date documentation about the models used by various versions of both AllelicCapseg and ABSOLUTE. That said, some of this removed functionality can be found in unsupported WDLs at https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/master/scripts/unsupported/combine_tracks_postprocessing_cnv (specifically, see the PrototypeACSConversion task in combine_tracks.wdl). These scripts also attempt to perform rudimentary filtering of germline events found in the matched normal; see first link below for some additional caveats. Note that we cannot really answer further questions or otherwise support these scripts (and it's possible that the experimental/beta GATK tools used in the WDLs may be removed in the future), and the developer responsible for them has moved on from the Broad---use them at your own risk.

Safety,"We decided to replace SparkGenomeReadCounts with a relatively simple ReadWalker to avoid various bugs we were running into (some of which were due to Hadoop-BAM). We found that these bugs gave rise to a relatively high failure rate---roughly 1 in 50 TCGA BAMs. Like any ReadWalker, you can specify custom read filters using GATK engine arguments such as `--disable-default-read-filters` and `--read-filter ...` However, because we count fragment centers (rather than read starts, as in SparkGenomeReadCounts), disabling filters which check that reads are properly paired may lead to unexpected behavior. In principle, we could write a similar ReadWalkerSpark version of the tool. However, our experience running the tool showed that CollectFragmentCounts was already faster than SparkGenomeReadCounts in Spark local mode, sometimes by a factor of ~5 (and, more importantly, it didn't run into Hadoop-BAM failures).

Safety,"Well, you're welcome to use gatk-launch as a launch script if you'd like (and feel free to rename to whatever you like...) A. There are a few reasons we have spark and non-spark versions of the tools. . 1. We wanted to port and validate certain tools as quickly as possible and doing a direct port from gatk3 -> gatk4 was easier than making them sparkified at the same time. 2. There's a tradeoff in using spark where you end up spending more total cpu hours in order to finish a job faster. Ideally this would be 1:1, double the number of cores and you halve the time to finish a job. It never scales perfectly though, there's always some overhead for being parallel. Our production pipelines are extremely sensitive to cost and not very sensitive to runtime, so they prefer we have a version that's optimized to use the least cpu hours even if that means a longer runtime. Other users prefer to be able to finish a job quickly and are willing to pay slightly more to do so, so we also have a spark version. . 3. Some tool are complicated to make work well spark. Spark works best when you can divide the input data into independent shards and then process them separately. This is complicated for things like the AssemblyRegion walker where you need context around each location of interest. We had to do things like add extra overlapping padding and things like that to avoid boundary issues where there are shard divisions. We don't yet fully understand spark performance and it's caveats, we're looking into that actively now. We hope that we'll be able to optimize our tools so that a spark pipeline of several tools in series is faster than running the individual non-spark versions, since it lets us avoid doing things like loading the bam file multiple times from disk. Whether or not we can achieve this is still and open question though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2345#issuecomment-273318100:1373,avoid,avoid,1373,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2345#issuecomment-273318100,2,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"When the engine ""marginalizes"" haplotype likelihoods into allele likelihoods it avoids double-counting of both the MNP at 151 and the SNP at 152. That is, the CT->TC MNP haplotype is consistent at 152 with the T->C SNP, but it has a different start position and therefore is not marginalized into the evidence for the SNP. So the fact that the DP in sample1 is much less at 152 than at 151 makes sense. I am also confused about sample2. If we're both still confused tomorrow, let's take a look in IGV. Might even need IntelliJ. Might even be a bug -- if you look in `AssemblyBasedCallerGenotypingEngine.createAlleleMapper`, you'll see that the overlapping event logic assumes we're dealing with upstream spanning deletions.

Safety,"Yup, as you might recall from some discussions with @bhanugandham and @mwalker174, getting automated pipeline-level CNV evaluations up and running was highest on my list before I handed over the role and went on paternity leave. I think these tests would be more useful than unit/integration tests for correctness, but they would almost certainly have to run on CARROT. That said, the current level of unit/integration test coverage is a bit different from that for the somatic tools, because 1) it's difficult to run gCNV in any useful way on Travis infrastructure, and 2) we hadn't decided on a framework/convention for python unit tests at the time the production code went in (although I think @ldgauthier has added some python unit tests by now). So we currently only have plumbing WDL/integration tests on very small data for gCNV---and these only test that the tools run, not for correctness. For somatic CNV, we have unit tests for correctness on small simulated data (e.g., for things like segmentation and modeling classes), but integration tests don't cover correctness (and it would be pretty redundant to use the same simulated data for integration, so I'd rather put effort towards pipeline-level tests on real data).

Safety,"aps pushing a fresh branch to this repo might make it a little easier for us to check it out for review---again, not a big deal, so I'll leave it up to you. 2) We try to adhere to the Google style guide https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html, so the review may yield a lot of seemingly minor and nitpicky change requests. Don't take these personally---the goal is just to make the code base as uniform and easy to maintain as possible! If you prefer, I'm sure we can find a GATK developer to take a quick once over of your branch and make these minor changes. 3) Since the new tool borrows so heavily from CollectAllelicCounts, I think it might be worth consolidating shared code and reducing code duplication---again, with the goal of making future maintenance more straightforward. I'll try to identify some places this can be done during my review. Again, we can make these changes on our end during the once over, or you can address them after the review (or we could also do this on our end in a separate PR after this one goes in). 4) In the near future, I think we should finally make the effort to replace both GetPileupSummaries and CollectAllelicCounts with this new tool. As mentioned in our email thread, @davidbenjamin and I discussed this long ago, e.g. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-386734926. From a methods perspective, we'd simply need expand the current functionality of your tool to also report the reference allele and do some quick sanity checks to make sure that the differences in count definition and read filtering don't have any undesired downstream effects. However, as we also discussed, this will come with some additional overhead---we'll need to update documentation, workshop slides, tutorials, WDLs, and make sure that any changes in output formats are clearly highlighted in the release notes. I'll leave this effort to @davidbenjamin and @mwalker174. Thanks again for doing this.

Safety,"breakpoint}, where the complication is mainly used for two purposes: 1) adjusting the exact locations of the breakpoints, and 2) useful for downstream annotations for the associated VCF records.; * NARL is constructed from an input CA, which in turn has two ways of being constructed: 1) deliberate construction with two neighboring alignments on the contig, 2) construction from an input contig whose alignments are scanned through in a semi pair-wise fashion. The second way is the master version currently in use in out pipeline, and is planned to be phased out eventually. Note that the second way extracts neighboring alignments that it considers good quality and send the information to the first version for actual construction. ; * The ctor for CA that takes two neighboring alignments also takes in a string representation of mapping locations of suspected insertions. In master version, this information is extracted from the alignments that are considered not strong enough, e.g. lower MQ, shorter alignment length, but the actual inserted sequence is not extracted in CA, but rather in BC.; * The BC field in NARL, holding inserted sequence, micro-homology and other information (e.g. for duplication), does not contain where the inserted sequence, if any, is mapped, and the inserted sequence is extracted from the distance on the contig between two neighboring alignments stored in the input CA.; * The variant, after its NARL locations are pinned down, is annotated by information stored in both CA and BC, where the information for BC is critical for reconstructing the alt haplotype and those in CA mainly for evaluating evidence strength. . Hence we should put the suspected inserted sequence and mapping in the same class, proposed to be in BC. But I think this PR is getting bigger than it should be, and the cigar operation is what I now need for the graph-based cpx sv detection.

Safety,"e deleted, and its use `support = range(lo, hi)` should become `support = new IndexRange(lo, hi)`. Then `IntStream.of(support).mapToDouble(___).toArray()` becomes `range.mapToDouble(___)` and `apply(promote(support), ___)` becomes `support.mapToDouble(___)`. * `final double relErr = 1 + pow(10, -7)` should become a `static` constant. * The steps; ```java; final double maxD1 = arrayMax(d1);; final double[] d2 = apply(apply(d1, d -> d - maxD1), d -> exp(d));; final double sumD2 = sum(d2);; return apply(d2, d -> d/sumD2);; ```; inside `dnHyper` are just a home-brewed way to normalize the log-space array `d1`. Let's go throught the steps: 1) find the max. 2) subtract the max -- subtracting a constant in log-space is equivalent to dividing by a constant in real space, and since we're normalizing in the end this constant is arbitrary. It's done for numerical stability. 3) exponentiate to get an unnormalized real-space array. 4) find the sum. 5) divide by the sum to get the normalized result. The log-10 version of this is `MathUtils::normalizeFromLog10ToLinearSpace(d1)`. You could either calculate `d1` in log-10 space or convert it, replacing the above line with `return MathUtils.normalizeFromLog10ToLinearSpace(MathUtils.applyToArrayInPlace(d1, MathUtils::logToLog10))`. The latter option is simpler. * Import static should be avoided except to escape horrible clutter, which is not the case here. * The second argument of `Utils.validateArg(condition, calculated string expression)` should become `Utils.validateArg(condition, () -> calculated string expression)`. In the first version, the expression is calculated *even if* the condition is satisfied, whereas in the second it is only calculated as needed. It's not critical here but it's a good habit to get into. PS I am a zealot of the Boy Scout Rule (always leave the camp site cleaner than you found it).

Safety,"e to old PoNs. Segmentation/modeling:; - Instead of separate tools for copy-ratio segmentation (`PerformSegmentation`) and allele-fraction segmentation/union/modeling (`AllelicCNV`), there is now just a single segmentation/modeling tool (`ModelSegments`).; - Input is denoised copy ratio and/or allelic counts. If only one input is provided, then we only model only the corresponding quantity.; - There is no separate allele-fraction workflow. Unlike the old approach, we do not perform any genotyping or modeling before doing kernel segmentation.; - [x] Old code and classes are used for segment union. We should port or possibly replace this with a simple method that uses kernel segmentation. EDIT: Actually, just tried running a WGS sample and this is still a major bottleneck. EDIT 2: Hmm...actually doesn't seem to be an issue on my desktop (compared to my laptop, on which the run hangs here). Will try to track down the source of the discrepancy. EDIT 3: Added segment union based on single-changepoint detection using kernel segmentation.; - [x] Segment union should be replaced by a proper joint kernel segmentation. EDIT: I've added this, but there could be some minor improvements. Right now, only use one het per copy-ratio interval and throw away those off-target/bin. There are a few percent of targets/bins that have more than one het, and we could potentially rescue the off-target/bin hets as well with some care.; - Old code and models are used for modeling. Since the old allele-fraction model only models hets, we perform a `GetHetCoverage`-like binomial genotyping step (and output the results) before modeling. However, instead of assuming the null hypothesis of het (f = 0.5) and accepting a site when we cannot reject the null, we assume the null hypothesis of hom (f = error rate or 1 - error rate) and accept a site when we can reject the null.

Safety,"es. I'll have to do some performance testing to see whether or not this is the case. Will try to get to this within the next few weeks, but the QC project has immediate priority. [...]. Discussed this with Ryan -- we agreed that the right thing to do is to move the enforcement of the hard cap on the total number of reads that can be in an active region from the HC walker to the engine, and have the size of the cap be controlled by a new argument (not dcov). That way you never pay the cost of storing the undownsampled reads for an active region in memory. We'd also have to educate users on exactly what the various downsampling arguments do for active region walkers. [...]. Making the hardcoded per-active-region cap settable from the command line is the easy part -- what seems hard is:; - Determining whether we can avoid storing all undownsampled reads in memory at once without affecting the quality of calls. Currently, as outlined in earlier comments on this ticket, we do a downsampling pass per locus which respects dcov (in LocusIteratorByState) but keep all undownsampled reads in memory anyway (defeating the main purpose of that first pass), then do a second downsampling pass per active region that does not respect dcov (uses the hardcoded per-region limit).; - If we find that we can't avoid storing all of the undownsampled reads in memory at once for some reason, then perhaps the right thing to do would be to completely disable the downsampling pass in LocusIteratorByState for active region traversals, and disallow the -dcov argument for active region walkers. Downsampling would then by controlled solely by the new argument to set the max # of reads per active region.; - Clarifying the meaning of the per-locus DP annotation for the HC given things like realignment of reads to haplotypes and region-based downsampling. ---. Eventually it was agreed that this would never be fixed in Classic GATK but should be taken into account in designing Hellbender's downsampling.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/103#issuecomment-78379345:6173,avoid,avoid,6173,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/103#issuecomment-78379345,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"explain what the splitting index is a bit better and then it will make more sense I think. Spark works by splitting files up into similar sized chunks and passing those chunks to different worker machines. ; Bam files are hard to split nicely into chunks. The way they're structured makes it hard to identify where safe boundaries are to split on. If you don't have a splitting index, we have an algorithm to start reading at essentially random locations and look for safe splitting points, but we've had some issues in the past where you can misidentify a split (which results in a crash) or miss good splits. The splitting index is a precomputed list of split points, which works around the problem of having to find the splits again next time. It's only used by spark tools that load bams, so it won't benefit Mutect2 because that's not built on spark. . We should add some documentation about this somewhere... #4235",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4219#issuecomment-359826965:315,safe,safe,315,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4219#issuecomment-359826965,2,['safe'],['safe']

This seems to have caused the two thresholds to assemble different haplotypes after dangling end recovery (since all of these are dangling ends because the assembly engine can't do anything else because there is not enough padding provided) and it just so happens this failed assembly misses the correct haplotype in that 20 threshold graph and we end up throwing away most of the reads as incongruent with assembly as a result which is why the depth drops out so low at that site.

In general though this issue might or might not have existed if the bam snippet provided (and especially the calling interval you provided of chr7:145945238-145945238) were not centered on one single point since assembly works best and is most likely to succeed when it has a few hundred bases of padding around the variant in question (typically for a SNP we end up with at least 100 bases of active window plus another 300 bases of padding on either side for assembly) which cuts down on the risk of assembly failures like this one. I'm curious if you observed this behavior on the initial variantcalling run of HaplotypeCaller on this data or only when you try scalpel out the SNP at chr7:145945238 for testing in this experiment.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7124#issuecomment-1021629139:1564,recover,recover,1564,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7124#issuecomment-1021629139,2,"['recover', 'risk']","['recover', 'risk']"

Safety,"h the code, but I do have some concerns about the design:. In the SV group's pipeline, we distribute this multi-gig file from its home in the cloud once at cluster-creation time, and then reuse it for multiple client executions. There are no superfluous copies lying about anywhere, and no redundant copying operations. We can give it any name we wish, and put it anywhere we desire (except that the path must be the same on every worker). This code, if I'm reading it correctly, will redistribute the file from a non-permanent home on the master's local file system or on the HDFS (to which it must be copied redundantly at least once per cluster instantiation), and then it will further be redundantly copied to a temporary location on each worker's local file system with every client execution. I don't know if that's overhead that we can live with, or whether that might prevent us from writing clients with brief execution times. I'm just opening the issue for discussion. We also lose a little flexibility in that the image must live in the same directory as the reference, though I don't think that's a serious drawback -- it's a perfectly logical place for it. However, since we're just appending a fixed extension ("".img"") to the reference name we can only have one image file per reference, which may be a problem because different images need to be created for different versions of bwa and for various options such as the list of alt contigs. We can handle the first problem by insisting that all clients on a particular cluster stick to one version of bwa, which is probably a good idea, anyway, but I think we're stuck if clients need to specify various alt contig lists. It might be better to provide a default path of ""ref-name""+"".img"", but allow that default to be overridden. Also, just to twist the knife a bit, it's too bad we never reviewed my PR for gatk-bwamem-jni, which version-stamped the images for safety. It's now languished since July, and has suffered serious bit rot.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3643#issuecomment-333598350:1960,safe,safety,1960,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3643#issuecomment-333598350,1,['safe'],['safety']

Safety,"implementation is different from the one in `ReadWindowWalker`: first, the overlap between windows is only in one direction; second, `SlidingWindowWalker` is more like a reference/interval walker, from the beginning of the reference (or interval) till the end, it walks in overlapping windows. One example is the following (window-size 10, window-step 5, the - represent the window):. ```; Reference: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows1: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows2: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows3: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows4: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows5: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; ```. Of course, after having a look to `ReadWindowWalker` I think that several things could be improved in my implementation for a general `SlidingWindowWalker`:; - Apply function similar to the `ReadWindowWalker`, with `ReadWindow` being empty if reads are not provided.; - Three window options: `windowSize` (the actual size of the window), `windowStep` (how much advance for the following window) and `windowPadding` (how much extend the window in both directions). Using this abstraction, `ReadWindowWalker` could be implemented setting `windowSize=windowStep`, and the problem that I need to solve could be implemented setting `windowPadding=0`. The simplest way to acomplish this is to use the current implementation of `ReadWindowWalker` to develop a `SlidingWindowWalker` adding three abstract methods for the three parameters (`getWindowSize()`, `getWindowStep()` and `getWindowPadding()`, and implement `ReadWindowWalker` as a extension of this interface setting `getWindowStep()` to return `getWindowSize()` and `requiresReads()` to true. I can do this once the PR #1567 is accepted and generate the two interfaces (to be sure that the integration with the HC engine is working as expected with the changes), or just implement the `SlidingWindowWalker` and you can include it in the HC PR, or update afterwards to avoid redundancy in the code.

Safety,"in the count files, and perhaps fail if one is provided for any of the tools (I don’t recall exactly how VCF indexing is triggered by providing one, as seems to be indicated by the tutorial, but hopefully we can disallow external dictionaries while still taking advantage of the relevant engine features for VCF writing). EDIT: Went digging in Slack to try to remind myself of the context of these changes, and found the following PR comment from 1/7 (although it seems to have mysteriously disappeared from GitHub):. > Just so I understand, are we allowing overriding of the sequence dictionary in the shards (and skipping the consistency check) by allowing the parameter --sequence-dictionary to be specified? If so, we might want to document. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to enforce using the sequence dictionary in the shards (and ensuring the consistency check across shards is performed) by changing the null check in getBestAvailableSequenceDictionary to a check that the dictionary has not been set via the command line. EDIT^2: I think I misremembered the details of how #6330 hooked up the sequence dictionary and how getBestAvailableSequenceDictionary in GATKTool works (which probably explains why that comment was deleted...). Now that I actually go back and look, the `--sequence-dictionary` is not hooked up at all, so there is no change to revert in point 4!. Note that after all of this, it will *still* be possible to get into trouble at the gCNV step if you make funky shards (e.g., you could have shard 1 contain intervals from chr1 and chr3, and shard 2 contain intervals from chr2). I don't think it is possible to check for this case early, but you would still fail at PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls as above. Of course, all of these possibilities can be avoided by simply using the WDL, but it will be good to harden checks for those still working at the command line. @ldgauthier @droazen @mwalker174 what do you think?

I agree it is not optimal, particularly for filtering out the huge variants. ; The huge variants come from 2 sources: `<DEL>`, `<INV>`.; For huge deletions, the 50% (or a custom value) reciprocal overlap should classify almost all of them as FP; actually the PacBio call sets (CHM1, CHM13, and the mixture) do not contain any deletion records that are over 30K in size.; For huge inversions though, I am not sure exactly what to do with them. The scripts currently avoid overlap analysis on the inversions actually because IMO we are overly confident in the `<INV>` variants, and the new variant interpretation methods will not emit <INV> records at all&mdash;they become BND's with appripriate annotations and are submitted to a yet-to-be-implemented unit for further interpretation if it is a dispersed duplication or inversion. > What's the reason for storing compiled Rdata objects in with the scripts?

Safety,"m.google.cloud.genomics.gatk.common. I've been working on this bam file issue, correcting errors in the files used for tests. Many of the errors involve reads with FLAGs that indicate that they are in pairs, but the mate is not extant in the file, causing the error. A way to fix this without deleting the offending reads is to set the FLAG to zero and also modify the RNEXT, PNEXT, and TLEN fields, if necessary, so that the read becomes single (provided that the values of all of these fields are not important for the tests). However, when I do this, I find that tests that write and then read bam files fail, because when the just-written file is read back, SAM validation complains that the mate unmapped FLAG is set for an unpaired read. It turns out that the copy of the file written by the test substitutes the value '8' for '0' as the FLAG for the modified reads. The relevant code in GenomicsConvertermakeSamRecord() (line 170) is:. flags += ((read.getNextMatePosition() == null || read.getNextMatePosition.getPosition() == null)) ? 8 : 0;. The effect of this line is that all reads which have null mate positions, even those which the FLAG specifies as unpaired, get the mate unmapped FLAG set, causing the validation errors that i'm seeing. The reason the tests have not failed before is apparently that the existing test files do not contain any reads with FLAGs that specify them as unpaired. A simple fix for this would be to convert the line above to:. flags += ( paired && (read.getNextMatePosition() == null || read.getNextMatePosition.getPosition() == null)) ? 8 : 0;. The redundant parens in the original code suggest that something like this may have been intended,but the google genomics documentation at http://google-genomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migrating_tips.html gives the following pseudocode:. flags += read.nextMatePosition.position == null ? 8 : 0 #mate_unmapped. so it looks like the doc supports the existing code. Should I submit this as an issue? .

Safety,"nt bin* provides equal weight---rather than the counts themselves. As usual, modeling each bin as Poisson is close enough to modeling all bins as multinomial for our purposes. If we directly use the NB likelihood and simply weight the count likelihood by occurrences, occurrences in the peak will strongly affect the result, adversely so if the count likelihood is actually misspecified there. As an example, consider trying to fit a Poisson to data that is actually zero-inflated Poisson---fitting the histogram will actually result in a more robust estimate for the mean. Another benefit is that truncated data (as we have here) is straightforwardly handled in an unbiased way. In the special case of complete, trivially-binned data, the full, unbinned likelihood is recovered. I think this sort of histogram fitting is pretty standard in the astro/particle community. We can certainly change up the model to include strictly quantized + free-floating states as you describe (rather than the ""fuzzily quantized"" states I use here), but I just wanted to avoid having another level of mixtures/logsumexps for this quick prototype. However, note that modeling mosaicism on the autosomes is desirable, but there we also want the strong diploid prior to nail down the depth and per-contig bias. So we will have to be a little careful about how we introduce free-floating states. Also, since I was not using gcnvkernel, I had to integrate out all discrete parameters. It may be that we can write down a nice model with discrete parameters if we use your inference framework. Finally, I did not further bin the counts here (or rather, the bin size is 1), which already yields the maximum information, but I did use a maximum-count cutoff. If we use the same cutoff for all samples, this allows us to simply pass a non-ragged matrix from Java (with dimensions of samples x contigs x maximum count) as a TSV. However, we may run into trouble if we hit a case sample with very high depth. So some sort of spa",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-376307522:1159,avoid,avoid,1159,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-376307522,2,['avoid'],['avoid']

For example, there is a small 13-bin deletion in chr19 that is found when running the 100% normal alone, but gets broken up into two adjacent deletions when running the 100% tumor alone (probably just due to statistical noise in the copy ratios). When running jointly, the deletion does not get broken up. However, as discussed over Slack, we should probably run some scenarios with simulated data to check behavior---for example, how robust is the joint segmentation to some of the samples being noisy/oversegmented?. There are lots of options for restructuring the workflow. We could potentially modify ModelSegments to take in the denoised copy ratios from the normal, when available, and add modeling of the normal and germline tagging to that tool. Or we could break things up into separate tools. @fleharty any opinions?. Note that another benefit of using this joint segmentation for germline tagging is that common breakpoints will be shared. This obviates the need for a lot of the idiosyncratic code (in the experimental postprocessing tools) that deals with reconciling segmentations and combining breakpoints. In general, I think such code is extremely prone to off-by-one errors and should be avoided, if possible.

If I'm reading the process correctly, I don't actually think this should work. CombineGVCFs is specifically for combining GVCFs and it expects GVCFs to have <NON_REF> alleles. If you've already run the data through GenotypeGVCFs then you can't use CombineGVCFs again because the <NON_REF> likelihoods have been applied and those alleles are gone. The vcfcombine tool from bcftools is quite fast if all you want to do is join the samples together. -; Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbroadinstitute%2Fgatk%2Fissues%2F7737%23issuecomment-1081062021&data=04%7C01%7CEmily.Puckett%40memphis.edu%7C51db6aa9f41b483e1ce408da10f2aa5d%7Cae145aeacdb2446ab05a7858dde5ddba%7C0%7C0%7C637840931685525269%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Pxg8joQfE51l5e3cUUbKA9bQEYDZjp0AxdX0aqDG1MY%3D&reserved=0>, or unsubscribe<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotifications%2Funsubscribe-auth%2FALDFEHAXSKZ7YHSFGISLPUTVCIDGZANCNFSM5RZSK5PA&data=04%7C01%7CEmily.Puckett%40memphis.edu%7C51db6aa9f41b483e1ce408da10f2aa5d%7Cae145aeacdb2446ab05a7858dde5ddba%7C0%7C0%7C637840931685525269%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=6Dkb6rbHDZpS05bYUHhlIRHJitgVtR%2FPB5rNHHFMg%2FQ%3D&reserved=0>.; You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID: ***@***.******@***.***>",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7737#issuecomment-1082170127:1022,safe,safelinks,1022,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7737#issuecomment-1082170127,1,['safe'],['safelinks']

Safety,"ore refinements to the method and have settled on the following procedure:. Assume we have _N_ data points:; ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/29580954-bea24562-8745-11e7-9c8c-d68504ba31da.png); To find segments, we:; 1) Select _C<sub>max</sub>_, the maximum number of changepoints to discover. In practice, _C<sub>max</sub> = 100_ per chromosome should more than suffice.; 2) Select a kernel (linear for sensitivity to changes in the distribution mean, Gaussian with a specified variance _σ<sup>2</sup>_ for multimodal data, etc.) and a subsample of _p_ points to approximate it using SVD.; 3) Select window sizes _w<sub>j</sub>_ for which to compute local costs at each point. To be precise, we compute the cost of a changepoint at the point with index _i_, assuming adjacent segments containing the points with indices _[i - w<sub>j</sub> + 1, i]_ and _[i + 1, i + w<sub>j</sub>]_. Selecting a minimum window size and then doubling up to relevant length scales (noting that longer window lengths allow for more subtle changepoints to be detected) works well in practice. For example, here are what the cost functions look like for window sizes of 8, 16, 32, and 64:. ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/29582011-210d37b8-8749-11e7-9383-0c657232347e.png). ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/29582016-23fbc6a6-8749-11e7-951e-f618e8489a0b.png). ![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/29582044-3eb20a1e-8749-11e7-84a0-3734bad15e1f.png). ![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/29582047-410ac490-8749-11e7-8a98-b2098cf1b5ea.png); 4) For each of these cost functions, find (up to) the _C<sub>max</sub>_ most significant local minima. The problem of finding local minima of a noisy function can be solved by using topological persistence (e.g., https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~weinkauf/notes/persistence1d.html and http://www2.iap.fr/users/sousbie/web/html/indexd3dd.html?post/Persistence-and-simplification).

Safety,"tes** total and produced an **11GB PoN** (this file includes all of the input read counts---which take up 20GB as a combined TSV file and a whopping 63GB as individual TSV files---as well as the eigenvectors, filtering results, etc.). The run can be found in /dsde/working/slee/wgs-pon-test/tieout/no-gc. It completed successfully with **-Xmx32G** (in comparison, CreatePanelOfNormals crashed after 40 minutes with -Xmx128G). The runtime breakdown was as follows:. - ~45 minutes simply from reading of the 90 TSV read-count files in serial. Hopefully #3349 should greatly speed this up. (In comparison, CombineReadCounts reading 10 files in parallel at a time took ~100 minutes to create the aforementioned 20GB combined TSV file, creating 25+GB of temp files along the way.). - ~5 minutes from the preprocessing and filtering steps. We could probably further optimize some of this code in terms of speed and heap usage. (I had to throw in a call to System.gc() to avoid an OOM with -Xmx32G, which I encountered in my first attempt at the run...). - ~5 minutes from performing the SVD of the post-filtering 8643028 x 86 matrix, maintaining 30 eigensamples. I could write a quick implementation of randomized SVD, which I think could bring this down a bit (the scikit-learn implementation takes <2 minutes on a 10M x 100 matrix), but this can probably wait. Clearly making I/O faster and more space efficient is the highest priority. Luckily it's also low hanging fruit. The 8643028 x 30 matrix of eigenvectors takes <2 minutes to read from HDF5 when the WGS PoN is used in DenoiseReadCounts, which gives us a rough idea of how long it should take to read in the original ~11.5M x 90 counts from HDF5. So once #3349 is in, then I think that a **~15 minute single-core WGS PoN could easily be viable**. I believe that a PoN on the order of this size will be all that is required for WGS denoising, if it is not already overkill. To go bigger by more than an order of magnitude, we'll have to go out of ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-317614503:1066,avoid,avoid,1066,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-317614503,2,['avoid'],['avoid']
Safety,thanks for the review @kcibul. I made some changes accordingly. re: PrepareCallset file of sample names. That would be nice! It would make this workflow simpler and it also simplifies the access requirements for PrepareCallset. re: Dockstore. We actually ruled this out because Terra says that the definition of a method configuration can change automatically if its updated in dockstore. Which can be useful but it adds a security risk since a compromised Dockstore can change the definition of the production AoU extraction WDL which runs with highly elevated permissions. We already have a script that creates method configurations from github so I can probably add something a little hacky to resolve relative imports to the raw github file that it refers to.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7242#issuecomment-846494686:432,risk,risk,432,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7242#issuecomment-846494686,2,['risk'],['risk']

Safety,"ually less expensive in typical (non-extreme) cases than reconstructing the full set of post-downsampling reads in an active region from multiple AlignmentContexts emitted by LIBS without any duplicates. I'll have to do some performance testing to see whether or not this is the case. Will try to get to this within the next few weeks, but the QC project has immediate priority. [...]. Discussed this with Ryan -- we agreed that the right thing to do is to move the enforcement of the hard cap on the total number of reads that can be in an active region from the HC walker to the engine, and have the size of the cap be controlled by a new argument (not dcov). That way you never pay the cost of storing the undownsampled reads for an active region in memory. We'd also have to educate users on exactly what the various downsampling arguments do for active region walkers. [...]. Making the hardcoded per-active-region cap settable from the command line is the easy part -- what seems hard is:; - Determining whether we can avoid storing all undownsampled reads in memory at once without affecting the quality of calls. Currently, as outlined in earlier comments on this ticket, we do a downsampling pass per locus which respects dcov (in LocusIteratorByState) but keep all undownsampled reads in memory anyway (defeating the main purpose of that first pass), then do a second downsampling pass per active region that does not respect dcov (uses the hardcoded per-region limit).; - If we find that we can't avoid storing all of the undownsampled reads in memory at once for some reason, then perhaps the right thing to do would be to completely disable the downsampling pass in LocusIteratorByState for active region traversals, and disallow the -dcov argument for active region walkers. Downsampling would then by controlled solely by the new argument to set the max # of reads per active region.; - Clarifying the meaning of the per-locus DP annotation for the HC given things like realignment of ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/103#issuecomment-78379345:5690,avoid,avoid,5690,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/103#issuecomment-78379345,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

A straightforward watershed algorithm can sort all local minima by persistence in linear time after an initial sort of the data.; 5) These sets of local minima from all window sizes together provide the pool of candidate changepoints (some of which may overlap exactly or approximately). We perform backwards selection using the global segmentation cost. That is, we compute the global segmentation cost given all the candidate changepoints, calculate the cost change for removing each of the changepoints individually, remove the changepoint with the minimum cost change, and repeat. This gives the global cost as a function of the number of changepoints _C_.; 6) Add a penalty _a C + b C log(N / C)_ to the global cost and find the minimum to determine the number of changepoints.

Security," also removes by debugging code and comments. I think it is ready for a review. To some other questions you had above:. 1) The HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>> can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place. I realize that's non-optimal, but this isnt anything I introduced here. I would really like to keep this PR as limited as we can, and address some larger refactoring in a different PR, once we've migrated to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart. 2) I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me. If we can't solve that problem completely in this PR (which is fine, I'm all for trying to contain this), are those changes necessary ? Perhaps that part should just wait for the next round. As noted above, I'd like to propose this as iterative, with a second PR coming soon. I did this b/c it moved us toward not needing to pass around the walker. It minimizes the code that has access to the walker (as opposed to setting it after creating the instance of the Evaluator, etc. Yes, it exposes it for two methods, but those classes no longer hang on to it. I would like to ultimately remove this entirely. 3) To re-iterate testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields: the input file, noGenotypes.vcf, has a header dictionary with the full set of contigs, and a single variant from chr 1. Prior to this PR, the test executed and supplied b37_reference_20_21 as the reference FASTA. The variant in that VCF is from chr 1, not 20/21. The old code should have failed. It didnt, probably since it was preferentially taking the sequence dictionary from the VCF header and basically ignoring the FASTA. It didnt make much practical difference, but I believe my change here is right. I added the test case testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFieldsWrongRef to cover that error.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-747619130:1619,access,access,1619,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-747619130,2,"['access', 'expose']","['access', 'exposes']"

Security," in the sampling of denoised copy ratios, fixes a memory leak by updating theano, and also adds some theano flags that typically yield a factor of ~2 speedup (notably, the OpenMP elemwise flag, although we also get a slight boost from using numpy MKL). This allows us to run, e.g.: . 2 shards of 50 samples by 100000 intervals on n1-standard-8s (8 CPU, 30GB memory, $0.08 / hr) each taking ~5 hours = ~1.6 cents / sample; 4 shards of 50 samples by 50000 intervals on n1-highmem-4s (4 CPU, 26GB memory, $0.05 / hr) each taking ~3.25 hours = ~1.3 cents / sample; 45 shards of 50 samples by 5000 intervals on *n1-standard-1s* (1CPU, 3.75GB memory, $0.01 / hr) each taking ~0.5 hours = ~0.5 cents / sample. For these runs, we used a slightly larger interval list and 1/4 the number of samples than in the first example, but because everything scales linearly, it's probably fair to compare the per-sample-and-interval costs. So we get a factor of ~8 savings if we keep the shard size the same. The cost was already satisfactory, but fixing the leak allows us to more easily run scatters that are not so wide, which may be crucial for running the megaWDL. Adding the OpenMP flag also lets CPU scalability work as intended. We can do a more systematic optimization for cost if desired, and we should also revalidate to make sure performance doesn't vary too much with shard size (from spot checking, it looks like marginal and/or single-bin calls may flicker on and off). Note that we have still not optimized inference for WES, although I believe @vruano has done some optimizations for WGS. @mwalker174 @vruano for WGS with 2kb bins, I would expect the cost of the gCNV step to be ~10 cents in cohort mode before inference optimizations, assuming we address #5716 to minimize disk costs. @asmirnov239 can you review? And maybe you can address dCR output in PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls and expose the number of samples in a separate PR? We can make some further changes to the dCR format there if we need.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5781#issuecomment-471570697:2172,expose,expose,2172,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5781#issuecomment-471570697,1,['expose'],['expose']

Security," pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above. I would hope that with more variants or reliable training/truth (as in your data), things might stabilize or line up better. I'll try running with more malaria data, as well. The following trios x sites heatmap (top plot) for the validation set might better illustrate the arbitrariness in F1 (click to enlarge):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385585-1a0dfe8e-d4b7-4770-aed0-19ad81162c92.png). Here, yellow = het errors (since these are supposed to be clonal malaria samples), red = Mendelian errors, grey = no calls, green = Mendelian consistency, white = reference. The second plot shows the training/truth positives used to train the model and to calculate the LL score in the validation shard. The third plot shows the ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives used to calculate F1. So we can see that the difficulty in deriving F1 as a function of the score along the horizontal axis to give the third plot lies in collapsing the columns in the top plot into a single condition positive or condition negative status. Again, hard to do so without some arbitrariness; I simply came up with some rules to convert various amounts of red, yellow, green, etc. in each column to a red/white/green status. If you're using a single gold-standard sample, this should definitely be more straightforward. In any case, the optimal validation LL score at ~0.02 does appear to line up quite well visually with where one might manually set a threshold. It corresponds pretty well with the transition from the yellow/red/grey junk to the clean green/white sites in the top plot. Here's the same for the test set:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385662-6693a6c9-709c-482f-9a7e-5bb7030b3383.png).

In `computeSBAnnotation()` we have `perAlleleValues.values().removeIf(Objects::isNull)`, which seems to rule out the former option (perAlleleValues for a particular allele itself being null), and implies that instead one of the individual Integers in the `List<Integer>` perAlleleValues for a particular allele is null.

I think if we're going to include it we might as well just add it as one of our normal dependencies though. Assuming there aren't any dependency conflicts it **should** (always a risky statement) be independent from everything else. . Thanks also for identifying the different issues you mentioned. It's expected that it won't work with most picard tools as you discovered, but we're actively in the process of updating more of them too support Paths instead of Files so that will slowly improve. The second issue is more worrisome. We regularly use an equivalent provider with google to read reference files through the exact same code, so I suspect there is either some sort of mismatched assumptions in the way they are handling things. Maybe something strange with the Path.resolve methods or the like. (Or in in the much worse potential case a bug in their look ahead caching.). I'd like to look into that before we'd merge this.

Security,"@EdwardDixon Sure, here's my suggested repair process:. 1. If you haven't already, add an ""upstream"" remote to your git clone via `git remote add upstream git@github.com:broadinstitute/gatk.git` (or `https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk.git` if you don't have ssh authentication set up with github). 2. `git fetch upstream`. 3. Copy the files you actually intended to change in this PR into a temp directory somewhere. 4. Create a new temporary branch off of `upstream/master`: `git checkout -b avxcheck_repaired upstream/master`. 5. Copy the files you saved in step 3 back into their original locations in the working tree. 6. `git commit -a`. 7. Examine the diff against upstream/master via `git diff upstream/master HEAD`. Verify that the diff is what you expect. 8. Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and save the commit ID it outputs. 9. Switch back to the broken version of the branch: `git checkout avxcheck`. 10. Run `git reset --hard commit_id_from_step_8`. This will force the branch to point to the repaired commit we created in step 6. 11. Run `git push -f origin avxcheck:avxcheck` to force-push the repaired version of the branch into your fork. Then check that it looks ok on github. For avoiding this sort of thing in the future, here's a few tips:. * Never run `git merge` or `git pull`. Always update your branch with changes from the latest gatk master branch via the command: `git fetch upstream && git rebase -i upstream/master`, followed by `git push -f` to push the rebased branch into your fork. * If you've never run `git rebase` before, read a tutorial on it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5291#issuecomment-437415495:266,authenticat,authentication,266,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5291#issuecomment-437415495,1,['authenticat'],['authentication']

Security,"@LeeTL1220 @katevoss @ruchim I started exposing all optional task-level parameters in the somatic workflows so that they could be specified via json when the workflows are used as subworkflows. E.g., `CNVSomaticPanelWorkflow.PreprocessIntervals.bin_length` is an optional task-level parameter that can be specified properly via json when `CNVSomaticPanelWorkflow` is the top-level workflow, but not when `CNVSomaticPanelWorkflow` is used as a subworkflow. This is because `MetaWorkflow.CNVSomaticPanelWorkflow.PreprocessIntervals.bin_length` cannot be set, correct?. However, things quickly became very messy. For example, alongside parameters like `bin_length` which are unique to the PreprocessIntervals task, we also have a lot of optional runtime parameters that are named generic things like `mem` which are not. So to expose these, we'd have to have workflow-level parameters with names like `preprocess_intervals_mem`, etc. It seems like this is exactly the problem the expected functionality would solve, if only it worked past the subworkflow level and the namespace is propagated as one would expect. Requiring that these be exposed also partially obviates the reason for having optional task-level arguments in the first place---what's the point of having them be optional if I have to add lines of code to expose all of them at the workflow level?. So again, I'm strongly against exposing all inputs for a particular workflow on the off-chance that that workflow might be used as a subworkflow. This adds a lot of unnecessary boilerplate that quickly gets very messy. I think that this problem should instead be solved by dynamically bubbling up all inputs, optional or required, at all levels.

Security,"@LeeTL1220 Having started to implement this. I have a number of design questions that would be informed by your usecases. . Firstly, is there a reason to preserve symbolic alleles? It seems as though spanning deletions could/should be dropped as in most cases there is another variant context representing that deletion elsewhere in your file? Should there be validation around dropping spanning deletion symbolic alleles to ensure we aren't dropping a spanning deletion that isn't represented anywhere else? What about nocalls? . Your example suggests that we rely on the header line counts for subsetting annotations, if there is a disagreement in the header do you want any more sophisticated behavior than just throwing? My understanding is that we are lenient with splitting in htsjdk and there have been some mislabeled header lines in the past that would make this an expected state. Furthermore, most allele specific annotators are of type string because there is no standard for ""|"" delimiters which makes them hard to handle properly. @ldgauthier do you have any suggestions as to how to detect and handle allele specific annotations?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4976#issuecomment-404949363:360,validat,validation,360,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4976#issuecomment-404949363,1,['validat'],['validation']

Security,"@Tintest Sorry for the slow reply. I'm not sure exactly what the issue is. I've never seen this exact error before. . I have two guesses, one is that there's something really weird going on in spark that's causing that null pointer exception which is killing the heartbeat. I'm not sure how to debug that without your access to your input data . The other theory which I think is more likely, is that you're running out of memory and it's causing weird errors to occur.

Security,"@cmnbroad I started down this road. i wanted to make sure i follow your reasoning on some of this.

This is paired with a change to set the 'source' on each VariantContext to match the name of the source feature context.

Security,"@cmnbroad OK, considerable progress here. I was able to adjust behavior such that only two tests have changed behavior from GATK4/master. I think this is now correct. One instance of changed behavior is the Snpeff/overlap one we discussed above. The second is the one where we now provide the full genome as REF, not the truncated genome. I think this difference is justified since the tool now requires a reference, and the prior version was arguably too lenient on validation of contigs. Anyway, this branch now also removes by debugging code and comments. I think it is ready for a review. To some other questions you had above:. 1) The HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>> can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place. I realize that's non-optimal, but this isnt anything I introduced here. I would really like to keep this PR as limited as we can, and address some larger refactoring in a different PR, once we've migrated to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart. 2) I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me. If we can't solve that problem completely in this PR (which is fine, I'm all for trying to contain this), are those changes necessary ? Perhaps that part should just wait for the next round.

To summarize changes since your last review:. - I backed out the earlier changes to FeatureInput/FeatureDataSource in favor of those from #7219 ; - I dont entirely know why this didnt hit before, but I made an update to VariantStratifiers to make tests pass. See: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973/commits/1569a909d3dc2301337e46441cc0cd969843c8d1. The gist is that we now instantiate those classes and pass VariantEvalEngine. Two of these classes had validation in their constructors, and could throw a CommandLineException if the tool was executed with bad arguments. This exception was getting caught and re-thrown as GATKException with the misleading message ""Problem making an instance of ...."". This proposal is to make a separate VariantStratifier.validateArgs() method, with a default no-op validation, and to call this only after instantiation. This was already exercised under the tests, such as testMultipleEvalTracksAlleleCountWithoutMerge(). VariantEval tests pass locally for me.

Security,"@cmnbroad 👍 to adding an advanced command line option for it. . @magicDGS Our goal is to make it unnecessary for normal users to ever need to see a stacktrace. We're definitely not at the point yet where every UserException produces either a) the complete information necessary to debug, or even b) the correct information. We're trying to fix all those cases, but there's a lot of possible failure modes between cloud access, spark, filesystem plugins, etc, so it's going to be an issue for a while. . I don't think it will hurt the user experience to have an extra commandline argument for it. Printing the stacktrace when debug is on isn't a bad idea, but I think it's better to have finer grained control over it. . The other issue is that it's easier to explain to an unsophisticated user how to set an extra commmand line argument rather than trying to get them to set the environment variable which well be helpful for our support team when they're trying to debug someone's problem.

Security,"@davidbenjamin I've significantly refactored the production code, see the last commit. Most of this refactoring was to done make the code for the accounting of different modes (SNP/INDEL/both x BGMM/python x non/allele-specific) more minimal and straightforward. I've also combined the score/apply steps using the TwoPassVariantWalker. There's still lots of documentation, cleanup, and hardening/validation to be done, but most of the key methods and design choices have been documented, so I think it could be worth a quick review at this stage. Again, no need to nitpick code-style details, etc. (unless you really want to!) In the meantime, I'm going to do some more testing/tieout to make sure the refactor didn't break anything. This covers ~1800 LOC, which is roughly 50% of the equivalent VQSR code. Even modulo the remaining work just mentioned, which may add a few hundred LOC, I think this is a decent improvement---additional functionality, stability, etc. notwithstanding!. There's stubs for adding the truth-sensitivity conversion you proposed---should be pretty straightforward.

Security,"@davidbenjamin, et al. I have two recommendations:. 1) Though I prefer to work symbolically and through proofs, it might be nice to first expand on the validation by proof in the JavaDoc - including for the specific function's header - and anywhere else where necessary across the GATK code, just for sanity's sake, and for tying things together neatly and properly. This process of always going through the mathematical steps alerts me when I code that I have not missed anything. . 2) When dealing with multiple levels of transformations, it probably would be good to formulate a collection of complete set of simple tests. Since like you mentioned {phased} is a subset (⊂) of {unphased}, then the paths of phased genotypes one works with would also be ideal to test on. Does this function have any validation tests confirming the correct likelihoods, which would be performed for both phased and unphased genotypes?

Security,"@droazen @cmnbroad @mbabadi I generally agree with the sentiments expressed in #4127, except that I think it's OK to require a conda environment (or even use of the Docker) for these particular tools. How we should validate this requirement is another question. We can discuss more with @vdauwera. @stefandiederich Hopefully once you get the conda environment set up you will be able to run the tools. We would definitely appreciate any feedback you might be able to provide. Note that the gCNV model is relatively sophisticated, so there may be some parameters (which control the priors for the model as well as how inference is performed) that you will need to adjust for your data. Depending on the number of intervals/bins you are using and your memory constraints, you may also need to scatter across multiple GermlineCNVCaller runs; see how things are done in the WDLs here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/master/scripts/cnv_wdl/germline. As you noted, this pipeline is still in beta. We are currently running several evaluations and hope to soon release some Best Practices recommendations for the aforementioned parameter values that should work well for various data types generated at the Broad. We will also have some blog or forum posts that explain the new CNV pipelines in more detail coming soon---stay tuned!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4125#issuecomment-357034364:215,validat,validate,215,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4125#issuecomment-357034364,2,['validat'],['validate']
Security,"@droazen @davidbenjamin any thoughts regarding the last bullet above in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-891907471 on possible integration tests? Started looking at this today and was wondering if you might have any suggestions. Ideally, we'd want to test that the exposure was done correctly through the 3 affected tools: HaplotypeCaller, Mutect2, and FilterAlignmentArtifacts. I can certainly take the approach outlined above and 1) on master, pick one or more integration tests for each tool, then generate results by changing the original unexposed constants and running on the relevant test data, 2) on this branch, commit those new results, then add corresponding versions of the integration tests that change the exposed inputs and check against the results. However, not sure if we'll want to clutter the repo with more test files just for this sort of exposing of constants, and such tests don't really feel complete anyway. So alternatively, I could probably write a script to do essentially the same thing and just check consistency between the branches for a bunch of randomly generated SW parameter values, perhaps also running on more substantial test files for each tool. I can document this process and then we can move on without committing any new tests or test files once we're satisfied that the exposure was done correctly. Or if you guys have additional suggestions, would be glad to hear them!. Finally, it looks like FilterAlignmentArtifacts doesn't have any integration tests for correctness---let me know if there are auxiliary tests we'd want to run there. Anyway, probably overthinking things, but the exposure was enough of a headache that I want to make sure I did it right. But would also rather fully hash out what to do beforehand, so I don't end up having to redo things after review.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-896314077:749,expose,exposed,749,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-896314077,2,"['expose', 'hash']","['exposed', 'hash']"

Security,"@droazen any thoughts how we should proceed here, if at all? @ldgauthier reminded me that this story was unfinished and is getting a little stale. @fleharty take note if we want to report progress on this front to our MalariaGEN collaborators. On my end, there are a couple of things to do:; - [x] rebase and resolve conflicts; - [x] change TSV input as discussed above; - [x] add doc strings for new arguments; - [x] add integration tests to make absolutely sure exposure was done correctly, perhaps? I'm open to discussion about how this should be done. Complete coverage here will be difficult and perhaps not worth the effort, but I can probably put in a few tests that make sure changing the hard-coded values in master and doing the same via the exposed parameters in this branch have the same effect on a few existing test cases. However, while I'm doing the last three, I wonder if we could run whatever canonical evaluations/optimizations we have to see whether it's worth consolidating some of the parameter sets at this stage? I think there's an argument for having at least two sets (haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype), but I'm not sure how to justify having a separate set for dangling heads/tails. But also not sure which set the latter should be consolidated with---@jamesemery thoughts? Again, let me reiterate that it seems that many of these parameter values were chosen arbitrarily (or, if not, that the procedure for choosing them has been lost). As a start, you can see the results of some optimizations I did on the CHM mix on slide 15 at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zGuquAZWSUQ-wNxp8D6HhGNjIaFcV0_X9WAS4LODbEo/edit?usp=sharing Here, I optimized over haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype SW parameters on various metrics after variant normalization using vcfeval.

Security,@droazen sorry for a late response. I agree moving to java 17 would help. I do see that GATK itself is using the newer version of log4j but then its the transitive dependencies for the libraries used that bring in the older version of log4j. . this creates situations that the final compiled jar has both version of the log4j and this could create problems. . Gatk being a very useful tool gets integrated in multiple other tools and pipelines so in a way affecting the security posture of where its being used.

Security,"@jamesemery Back to you, at long last. I adopted your suggestion of a proper search that doesn't revisit already-seen vertices and came up with a better way of seeding the ""good"" subgraph that is safe from your STR concern. As far as code is concerned it's a total rewrite — you can pretend the first PR commit doesn't exist. The new criterion for seeding the search is chains with good log odds on both ends and which are incident on a vertex with multiple good out-edges or multiple good in-edges. The rationale is that the adjacency of two bad edges may have good log odds (Suppose a bad edge comes in and two bad edges come out. One is a new error on top of the original error and one is the continuation of the original error) but two have two outgoing edges with good log odds requires an actual real variant. On our M2 validations this essentially no effect on sensitivity and a mild reduction in false positives.

Security,"@jamesemery and now the overview of the more complex changes:. - `AssemblyResultSet`: the code for adding and removing haplotypes based on pileup alleles has become a `void` method of this class, where it belongs. Here and elsewhere I introduce snappy variable and function named referring to ""good"" and ""bad"" alleles, which I find visually much clearer. The code is basically the same as before but somewhat streamified. I extracted a `makeHaplotypeWithInsertedEvent` method to eliminate some code duplication between GGA and pileup force-calling.; - `HaplotypeCallerEngine` and `Mutect2Engine`: Force-calling alleles are split into biallelic `Events`. Duplicated code for finding all pileup events, then sifting them into good event to force-call and bad events to remove is extracted as `PileupBasedAlleles.goodAndBadPileupEvents`. Computing `allVariationEvents` is much simpler because 1) it now uses `Event` instead of `VariantContext` and 2) `Event` overrides `equals` and `hashCode`.; - `PileupBasedAlleles`: `getPileupVariantContexts` and sorting into good and bad pileup variants has been unified into `goodAndBadPileupEvents()`. It has additionally been somewhat rewritten for conciseness. Also, instead of the somewhat kludgy method of making `VariantContext` with four temporary attributes, then filtering based on those attributes, it calculates the filtering status immediately and uses `Events`. Also fixed the somewhat-misleading use of the word `alt` to mean `SNP`.; - `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils`: `applyPileupEventsAsForcedAlleles`, along with several helper methods that it calls, has been moved into `AssemblyResultResult`, where it is now a void member method.; - `GATKVariantContextUtils` mainly just using `Event` instead of `VariantContext`, which simplifies the code for splitting a `VariantContext` into biallelics.

Security,"@jamesemery sorry to bug on this topic, but I'm hoping to make a push early this year to fully migrate my lab off GATK3 . I looked more closely at the specific annotations we need to migrate. I decided that I will implement our walker, 'DiscvrVariantAnnotator', which is basically a light wrapper around VariantAnnotation. This will make it easier to spike in custom annotations. In that walker, I will override makeVariantAnnotations(). I will make a new marker interface for EngineAwareAnnotation, and test that on all the Annotation classes, and use this to inject FeatureManager. So no core GATK changes needed. I did find one thing I'd like to propose. You probably know PedigreeAnnotation is special-cased in GATK. Annotations that use it have automatic argument validation and have the SampleDB injected. Currently, PedigreeAnnotation is a subclass of InfoFieldAnnotation, so isnt available to GenotypeAnnotations. There doesnt appear to be a solid reason why. I tried to fix that and my best idea is the proposal here: #7041 . The core idea is to convert InfoFieldAnnotation and GenotypeAnnotation to interfaces. This is generally a trivial switch in existing code. With that, it becomes possible for classes that currently extend PedigreeAnnotation (which I switched to no longer extend InfoFieldAnnotation) to simply PedigreeAnnotation and implement InfoFieldAnnotation. This makes it possible for future classes to extend PedigreeAnnotation and implement GenotypeAnnotation.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6930#issuecomment-760424063:561,inject,inject,561,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6930#issuecomment-760424063,6,"['inject', 'validat']","['inject', 'injected', 'validation']"

This is why I feel strongly that the datasource objects should not be directly accessible to walker-based tools. Note that it's still possible for walkers to create their own, separate datasources without reaching into the ones used by the engine, or a tool author can extend `GATKTool` directly rather than one of the walker base classes and have the freedom to access everything (which was not possible before this PR).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4964#issuecomment-401423305:524,access,accessible,524,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4964#issuecomment-401423305,2,['access'],"['access', 'accessible']"

Note that the malaria data used was pretty small: chr1-2 training (~20k positive training/truth variants, ~50k negative training variants; note also that the threshold for determining negative training was not tuned---a threshold corresponding to a 98% truth sensitivity was arbitrarily chosen), chr3 validation (~50k variants), and chr4-6 test (~150k variants). The LL score is calculated from a validation set held out from the training/truth positives used to train the model, while the F1 score is calculated using ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives determined using 3 families of ~30 trios each. However, there's some arbitrariness in how we define the boundary for the latter positives/negatives, and hence some arbitrariness in the F1 score itself. But I'd expect using gold-standard GIAB truth would be more straightforward. Not sure how much we can conclude, but that the validation and test F1s are similar and that the validation LL score isn't *too* far off are encouraging. That said, there is a pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above. I would hope that with more variants or reliable training/truth (as in your data), things might stabilize or line up better. I'll try running with more malaria data, as well. The following trios x sites heatmap (top plot) for the validation set might better illustrate the arbitrariness in F1 (click to enlarge):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385585-1a0dfe8e-d4b7-4770-aed0-19ad81162c92.png).

Security,"@meganshand There is a warning in the docs for `ReadCoordinateComparator` that it should not be used for bam file output that needs to match the ordering of `SAMRecordCoordinateComparator` exactly, since it sorts all unmapped reads after all mapped reads. `ReadCoordinateComparator` is a comparator for `GATKRead`, and that interface does not allow unmapped reads to have a position. Ie., even if an unmapped `SAMRecord` is assigned the position of its mapped mate, calling `getContig()`/`getStart()` on the unmapped read via the `GATKRead` interface will return null/0. This was done mainly for consistency reasons and to simplify client code. Whenever we need bam file order for reads in GATK4, we operate on SAMRecords directly and use either the `SAMRecordCoordinateComparator` from htsjdk or the `HeaderlessSAMRecordCoordinateComparator` (for headerless Spark reads) that produces the same ordering. I recommend addressing this for this tool via `presorted = false` for now, since the GATK3 version has it set to false as well with the comment: ""**we don't want to assume that reads will be written in order by the manager because in deep, deep pileups it won't work**"". This suggests that even if you were to change the comparator used by this tool to behave like `SAMRecordCoordinateComparator`, you'd still have ordering issues in deep coverage areas. It's worthwhile, though, to open a separate ticket to explore whether `ReadCoordinateComparator` could be changed to exactly match bam file order. Eg., perhaps we could add `getAssignedContig()`, `getAssignedStart()`, etc. methods to `GATKRead` to expose the positions that unmapped reads with mapped mates get assigned for sorting purposes.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1853#issuecomment-224668518:1608,expose,expose,1608,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1853#issuecomment-224668518,1,['expose'],['expose']

Security,"@munrosa @ldgauthier Possible breakthrough. . First, what's definitely true about the het at 169510380 in 55_55003_F5region.bam when I reproduce the bug with `-L chr1:169510380 -ip 100`:. * The variant is considered active and triggers assembly, as it should.; * For every kmer size there are non-unique kmers in the reference, so it increases up to k = 85, the last attempt at which the engine relaxes the unique kmers requirement. (See `ReadThreadingAssembler` line 425).; * Once it reaches this kmer size, there are cycles in the graph and so no assembly is returned. (See `ReadThreadingAssembler` line 464). Thus no alt haplotype is discovered and the variant is missed. I believe there are two possible solutions.; * The assembly engine looks for cycles before pruning, but this order could be switched with no ill effects. In the case of this het there are no cycles after pruning because the apparent cycle was a poorly-supported path due to sequencing error. Here regular pruning works but the new `--adaptive-pruning` option would give a bit more security against false cycles.; * We don't actually have to check for cycles, especially in the last, desperate kmer attempt. Well, we do with the current recursive implementation of `KBestHaplotypeFinder`, but we *don't* in the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation currently under review: #5462. (Technical note: @ldgauthier I know I promised that this PR gives entirely equivalent results to the existing implementation, but technically this is only true if the existing implementation finishes in finite time. Due to the greedy -- but optimal -- nature of Dijkstra's algorithm, cycles do not cause issues).

Security,"Actually, I'm going to go ahead and add some exact match tests to guard against this sort of thing. Behavior for key somatic CNV tool modules (i.e., kernel segmentation and MCMC) is unit tested to within statistical noise (so, not exact match) on simulated data, but most integration tests just check for plumbing and not correctness. The idea was always that this sort of thing would be covered by what eventually became CARROT, since such tests would probably have to be long running and require more resources than are available in the repo to be useful. See the high priority but long dormant issues https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4122 and https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123, as well as https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4630. In fact, I think the original idea was that Lee's validation would be the first to go into CARROT. Note also that I did some work to set up transition of all existing CNV tests (also including the somatic CNV validation against TCGA SNP calls that I put together on Terra) before going on leave and moving off CNVs, but during all that, we managed to 1) lose TCGA access, 2) delete the test files on which Lee based his validation after he left, and 3) reassign at least one of the people that was going to help with the transition. Again, the resulting differences here are minor and it's unlikely that future non-CNV code changes will have similar effects, since the CNV code is relatively well encapsulated, but the exact-match checks will hopefully give us some peace of mind until CARROT tests are ready. @jonn-smith @KevinCLydon looping you in just in case you're not aware of all of this history.

Both are kind of gross, with the former taking a LOT of extra space and the latter being basically unreadable by eye.

It sheds some additional light on this issue and explains why we believe that fine-tuning of the error model introduced in Mutect2 4.1.9.0 led to overcalling of variants in samples with increased (but not pathologic) DNA degradation. Presentation of the poster led to several interesting discussions with other users of Mutect2 at the conference.

In this manner, you could leave the parameter at `5` by default but allow users who work on clinical (especially FFPE) samples to change it to `0` instead, thus effectively restoring the behaviour shown (and benchmarked) prior to 4.1.9.0.

Security,"Done. Full results are on the internal presentation slides. The summary table follows:. | speedup vs async on a 1-core machine | slice | whole | intervals |; |-------------|----------|---------|----------|; | vcf | 0.91| 1.40| 0.57|; | bam (exome)| 40.42| 1.06| 1.02|; | bam (wgs)| 111.18| 1.21| 0.99|. This table compares the execution time of a single machine running PrintReads or SelectVariants, getting its input either directly from the Google bucket (NIO), or by first copying it with gsutil and then running off the local disk (with the async option turned on, allowing eager decompression of the stream - a feature the NIO code does not have). Each experiment is run four times, and each number here represents the ratio of two such experiments. Numbers larger than 1 indicate that NIO was faster. Each row is a different input file: vcf, small bam (exome), large bam (whole genome). Each column is a selection of what to read from the file (via the `-L` argument): a megabase slice, the whole file, or a long list of intervals. The NIO code relies heavily on prefetching, so it doesn't perform well with the many disjoint accesses of the right column. When processing only a small part of the (already small) vcf file, NIO loses out to copy + local processing. Everywhere else the direct-to-bucket ""NIO"" code performs quite well, up to 111x faster than the ""copy then process"" approach. I also ran the full set with async disabled. It makes a difference but NIO still wins and loses at the same places by similar margins (in particular the 111x win remains).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2424#issuecomment-284056956:1132,access,accesses,1132,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2424#issuecomment-284056956,1,['access'],['accesses']

Thus, users who previously ran in allele-fraction-only mode will have to retune parameters to achieve the same level of sensitivity.

Technically we could expose support to modify existing samples, but that get's a bit hairy because of the way data is retrieved. . I'm not sure why the queries for intact chromosomes take so much longer. Since you were able to replicate with a single sample, ~7m interval is there any chance you can share just that bit (workspace, or even better that portion of the gvcf) and we can take a deeper look?. To your question about whether GenomicsDBImport includes variants that span the specified import interval: it will definitely include variants that start in those intervals, but it won't always store variants that start before the import interval.

Security,"Great! And yes, LL will be optimized separately for SNPs and INDELs. How about this for a first workflow to target?. 1) Run ExtractVariantAnnotations on a training set of chromosomes. You can keep training/truth labels as in Best Practices, for now.; 2) Run TrainVariantAnnotationsModel on that. We'll use the truth scores generated here for any sensitivity conversions---i.e., we'll be calibrating scores only to the truth sites that are contained in the training set of chromosomes.; 3) Use the trained model to run a single shard of ScoreVariantAnnotations on a validation set of chromosomes.; 4) Run some variation of the above script on the resulting outputs to determine SNP and INDEL score thresholds for optimizing the corresponding LL scores. We can also add some code to the script to use the truth scores from step 2 to convert these score thresholds into truth-sensitivity thresholds.; 5) Provide these truth-sensitivity thresholds to ScoreVariantAnnotations and use them to hard filter. Evaluate on a test set of chromosomes. If all looks good, we can later move steps 3-4 into the train tool and automate the passing of sensitivities in 5 via outputs in the model directory. This will let us keep the basic interface of ScoreVariantAnnotations the same, but we'll have to add a few basic parameters to TrainVariantAnnotationsModel to control the train/validation split.

Do you think you can handle implementing that in this branch, and then the rest at the WDL level? I can help with the python script for the LL stuff (or anything else), if needed.

For the next round of evaluations we need to:. - Decide on appropriate metrics for evaluating performance on trios and write scripts that implement them; - Expand the range of hyperparameters in search space (possibly include different bin sizes, GC vs no GC correction, and fragment mid point coverage collection vs largest fragment overlap coverage collection); - Use gnomAD subset of matched WES/WGS pairs for validation",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123#issuecomment-362075071:446,validat,validated,446,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123#issuecomment-362075071,2,['validat'],"['validated', 'validation']"

Security,Hi @icemduru ; Looks like your slurm workload manager was configured to have a limit of 48GBs of maximum process memory size per execution. Your java instance is set with -Xmx45G which will cover most of this limit and leaves only a handful of memory space for the native GenomicsDB library. Native libraries work above the heapsize so it is better for you to set your -Xmx to a more sensible size of 8~12GB and leave rest of the memory space to the native library to use. . Keep in mind that this memory limit on slurm could be set per user not per task therefore you may need to run a single contig at a time or maybe 2 of them simultaneously. Otherwise slurm may interefere with all the tasks and cancel all your jobs. . One final reminder. We strongly recommend users to set the temporary directory to somewhere else other than /tmp. Slurm workload manager interferes with this preference and sometimes results in premature termination of the gatk processes due to deletion of extracted native library and accessory files. . I hope this helps.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8918#issuecomment-2283694332:1010,access,accessory,1010,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8918#issuecomment-2283694332,1,['access'],['accessory']

Security,"Hmm, as we discussed, I'm not sure this will be so straightforward, given that we only have easy access to scores for positive truth---and hence, no false positives, which precludes calculation of precision and F1. I *think* we could pass a VCF for a sample with gold-standard positives and negatives and use the existing code for extracting labels, but this will require a bit of engineering and be more trouble than it's worth. There are other options---see https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/30479, for example. We might want to experiment with the LL score discussed there (see https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICML/2003/ICML03-060.pdf for the original paper---although note that despite the paper's high citation count, I'm not sure what the canonical name for this metric actually is, but it doesn't appear to be ""LL score""---perhaps someone else knows or has better Google-fu and can figure it out) before moving on to their methods for estimating F1. Doing a literature search for other discussions of optimizing F1 or other metrics in the context of positive-unlabeled learning might be worthwhile, but I think most methods will probably involve some sort of estimation of the base rate in unlabeled data. I think we may have to add some mechanism for holding out a validation set during training if we want to automatically tune thresholds in a rigorous fashion. Shouldn't be too bad---we can just have the training tool randomly mask out a set of the truth and pass the mask to the scoring tool (or maybe just determine the threshold in the training tool, if we are running in positive/negative mode and have access to unlabeled data)---but does add a couple of parameters to the tool interfaces. This also adds additional dependence on the quality of the truth resources. I think an implicit assumption in any use of the truth---even just thresholding/calibrating by sensitivity---is that it is a random sample; however, I'm not sure how true this is in actual use.

Security,"I appreciate the desire for minimal changes, but I would point out that tying the VariantContext to the source FeatureInput is likely to be a somewhat common need for MultiVariantWalkers. I realize you have a lot of existing example that dont need this capability. While I started this using VariantEval/VariantQC, I more recently tried to port CombineVariants to GATK4 and hit a similar roadblock. I have one or two other lab-specific walkers that would benefit from using the iteration pattern of MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart, but also need some ability to retain the FeatureInput->VariantContext link. I believe GATK3 retained this. It would be nice to at least make this a capability available to all MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart walkers. My suggestion above about making a FeatureInputAwareVariantContext wasnt necessarily meant to be introduced into every class.

Security,"I didn't realize before that there is no ""include"" (opt-in) validation type arg, only ""exclude"". So I'm not sure what the purpose of having ""ALL"" is in the first place, if the only thing you can usefully do with it is exclude it. I think the best longer term fix would be to add an ""--validation-type-to-include"" arg, and have it default to the everything except for IDs, and then construct the actual types based on merging include/exclude args. But thats a bigger change then just fixing the current (silent do-nothing) default behavior, and requires more error checking for conflicting args. Lets start with changing it so that in the default (no args) case, we log a warning message saying that IDs will be left out since no IDS were provided, and proceed with the remaining validations. Then if we want to get more ambitious we can talk about making the bigger change. Also, as part of the initial fix, it might be a good idea to change `calculateValidationTypesToApply` so that it doesn't modify the `excludeTypes` list directly, since this is the list provided by the user, and instead uses it's own temporary list.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279:60,validat,validation,60,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279,3,['validat'],"['validation', 'validation-type-to-include', 'validations']"

Security,"I don't think that hiding/disable arguments would work in every case: sometimes, an argument shouldn't be exposed but still available to set programmatically, or maybe just reduce visibility making it `@Hidden` and/or `@Advance`. What is the problem of making an interface for the top-level argument to the GATK? Changing the interface or the `CommadnLineProgram` has the same effect, but the API user can still behave the same as before. It is much more extensible and downstream-friendly. What's about making the `CLPConfigurationArgumentCollection` an interface always returning defaults to be able to change it in a proper way? The cycle of development of a new argument will be: 1) add a new method to the interface with a default returning what will be expected from the previous behaviour, 2) add and return by the argument in the GATK implementation, 3) use the getter in the CLP for perform the operation. This only adds the first point, and operating in 3 classes instead of 3. For API user it is really easy to maintain the previous behavior when upgrading the dependency by just using their own implementation of the class, or include the top-level new arguments by using the GATK implementation. It is much more flexible and extensible (I always think about GATK also as a library). In addition, I think that this approach is also important for evolving GATK. For example, if a new top-level argument is tagged as experimental (still not supported but requested in Barclay), removing it would allow to keep the interface (no version bump) the same and final users can still operate with the experimental argument. The same applies to the `GATKTool` base class (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4341), and for downstream projects the aim should be to be able to extend safely the `CommandLineProgram` directly to implement their own toolkit using the powerful GATK framework.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3998#issuecomment-366185003:106,expose,exposed,106,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3998#issuecomment-366185003,1,['expose'],['exposed']

For input files, this is expected (if the input has changed, it is expected that the result change), but for arguments it shouldn't be the case (independently of the file changing, the tool was running with exactly that parameters).

Security,"I'd also be hesitant to break the previous expectation that IntervalArgumentCollection contains a non-empty list of intervals. If I understand correctly (and apologies if not, I'm glancing at the repo between paternity-leave duties and am quite sleep deprived!), all calling code would have to add an explicit check that the new option isn't enabled or risk failing ungracefully downstream. For CNV code, this might be as simple as changing the validation method `CopyNumberArgumentValidationUtils.validateIntervalArgumentCollection`, but I wouldn't generally expect it to be so straightforward to add such checks throughout the codebase.

Security,"I'm new at this, so I may be missing something, but it looks to me like there is an issue with the conversion code in GenomicsConverter.makeSAMRecord() in com.google.cloud.genomics.gatk.common. I've been working on this bam file issue, correcting errors in the files used for tests. Many of the errors involve reads with FLAGs that indicate that they are in pairs, but the mate is not extant in the file, causing the error. A way to fix this without deleting the offending reads is to set the FLAG to zero and also modify the RNEXT, PNEXT, and TLEN fields, if necessary, so that the read becomes single (provided that the values of all of these fields are not important for the tests). However, when I do this, I find that tests that write and then read bam files fail, because when the just-written file is read back, SAM validation complains that the mate unmapped FLAG is set for an unpaired read. It turns out that the copy of the file written by the test substitutes the value '8' for '0' as the FLAG for the modified reads. The relevant code in GenomicsConvertermakeSamRecord() (line 170) is:. flags += ((read.getNextMatePosition() == null || read.getNextMatePosition.getPosition() == null)) ? 8 : 0;. The effect of this line is that all reads which have null mate positions, even those which the FLAG specifies as unpaired, get the mate unmapped FLAG set, causing the validation errors that i'm seeing. The reason the tests have not failed before is apparently that the existing test files do not contain any reads with FLAGs that specify them as unpaired. A simple fix for this would be to convert the line above to:. flags += ( paired && (read.getNextMatePosition() == null || read.getNextMatePosition.getPosition() == null)) ? 8 : 0;. The redundant parens in the original code suggest that something like this may have been intended,but the google genomics documentation at http://google-genomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migrating_tips.html gives the following pseudocode:. flags += read.n",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/569#issuecomment-114101033:823,validat,validation,823,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/569#issuecomment-114101033,1,['validat'],['validation']

Security,"I'm not sure exactly what's happening but I suspect it has something to do with the way the files are mounted.

Its probably some sort of bug in amazon's fuse implementation which isn't properly hiding network problems from the software. .

Security,"Just to make sure I understand the issue---will this cause technical problems in the Firecloud environment, or is it more of a style issue?. If the latter, one reason I prefer the use of optional file inputs to trigger tool-level ""modes"" when possible is that it propagates more naturally from the tool level. For example, let's consider a tool that can operate in either tumor-only or matched-pair mode. It is natural at the tool level to make the tumor a required input and the normal optional. The other options are quite awkward: 1) make both inputs required and switch between using the normal or not with a flag (in which case it is very easy for the user to shoot themselves in the foot if they forget to set the flag right, and we'd have to pass a dummy normal every time we want to run tumor only if we don't actually have a pair), 2) leave the normal as optional but add a flag anyway, which would be redundant and require an additional validation (i.e., if the flag is set to matched mode but we don't have a normal, we should fail early), or 3) write separate tools for each mode with the corresponding required inputs. If we accept that optional file input is the way to handle such a scenario at the tool level but not at the workflow level, then we will simply run into the same problems at the workflow level. I'm sure there are more complex scenarios when triggering on file presence/absence doesn't uniquely specify a workflow, in which case flags are a must. But for simple scenarios, I'm not sure why we shouldn't take advantage of the ability to specify optional file inputs in WDL (actually, I'm not sure how else we are supposed to use them?). However, if this is a problem for Firecloud, then I'd like to understand why---and what possible solutions there might be.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3657#issuecomment-334046444:947,validat,validation,947,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3657#issuecomment-334046444,2,['validat'],['validation']

Security,"Let's discuss further before you get too far along. The design of the Collections code was intended to ensure that very strict file formats are adhered to within the CNV pipeline. Making it more flexible to accommodate TSVs with arbitrary column headers, relax requirements for sequence dictionaries, etc. undermines that goal. There are also two other issues to consider:. 1) It looks like @jonn-smith has also been putting considerable effort into building a TSV framework for Funcotator. Perhaps CombineSegmentBreakpoints should consider using that framework instead, if it is more appropriate. We can also discuss bringing the CNV pipeline over into that framework, but this should definitely wait until after release. The end goal is for CNV team to spend as little time as possible writing or maintaining any code related to TSV parsing. 2) @mbabadi has put together some python evaluation code for the new gCNV, which makes use of the IntervalTree python package and PyVCF to accomplish some things that are very similar to what CombineSegmentBreakpoints is doing. Perhaps we could implement a similar approach purely in Java by making use of the IntervalTree implementation in htsjdk. I think for now we should treat CombineSegmentBreakpoints as a one-off tool to be used for internal validations. After release, we should design a more generic evaluation tool. This tool could take as input multiple collections of annotated locatables, with a few rigidly defined formats allowed (e.g., VCF, CNV Collection TSVs, perhaps some TSVs from other tools, etc.), with one designated as ground truth. The regions for evaluation could also be specified via -L (since it is possible this might not completely specified by the ground-truth collection). The appropriate intersections and lookups could then be performed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3995#issuecomment-352860616:1293,validat,validations,1293,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3995#issuecomment-352860616,1,['validat'],['validations']
Security,"Let's talk about groupReadPairs, pairedReads, and unpairedReads. The groupBy method called by groupReadPairs is very expensive both in time and in memory. It's a full hash shuffle of GATKReads (time expensive), that results in a gazillion 1- and 2-element Lists (memory expensive). So you certainly don't want to do it twice. But the way pairedReads and unpairedReads is set up, you *will* do it twice if you want to process both paired and unpaired reads. (And even if you aren't, someone else might try to use this code to do so.). So my first suggestion is that you remove the call to groupReadPairs from pairedReads and unpairedReads, and let a user groupReadPairs once, and reuse the resulting JavaPairRDD to process paired and unpaired reads. My second suggestion is quite a bit more complicated, but I think it would result in far better performance. I'll sketch it out here, and then I can explain it further in person, if it's a direction you'd like to pursue. The first step is to create a JavaRDD<GATKRead> in which all pairs sharing a template name are in the same partition (but without grouping them). To do that, you temporarily boost the input JavaRDD into a JavaPairRDD<String,GATKRead> by extracting the read name as a key. Then you repartition (to do the shuffle). Then you map back to an ordinary JavaRDD<GATKRead> by keeping just the value. (Note: if the BAM has queryname sort order, you can just skip this step entirely.); Now you can do a mapPartition operation to filter for paired or unpaired reads: Iterate over the reads in the partition, and keep a hash map of [name -> read] of reads that have not yet found mates. To filter for paired reads, whenever you find the name of the current read already in the table, just emit the current read and the read in the map as a pair, and delete the read from the map (you're done with that name -- this keeps the table smaller). To filter for unpaired reads, just delete any map entry that you successfully look up, and insert any ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2664#issuecomment-299955039:167,hash,hash,167,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2664#issuecomment-299955039,1,['hash'],['hash']

Security,"Multiple causes can cause closed connections when reading from GCS, almost all of which are outside of our control. This will never be ""completely fixed"" in the sense that even if the code is perfect it's completely possible to send too many requests to GCS, and it'll respond by closing connections. The main factors that I know of are:. - number of concurrent accesses to the GCS bucket in question; - number of concurrent accesses to the GCP project in question; - storage class of the GCS bucket in question (the more expensive ones have more replicas, thus can handle a higher load). If you're running into those difficulties I would suggest trying to reduce the load (reduce the number of concurrent workers or threads) and making sure it's not a single-region storage bucket. If that fails, perhaps try using a different bucket that no one else is also using (to reduce other sources of load). If I understand correctly that you didn't change the version you're using but are suddenly seeing more issues than before, then perhaps the cause is a server-side change from GCS (outside of our control), a change in configuration (are you reading from a bucket of a different class from before), or perhaps just an increase of other activity on the same bucket/project. The current code is very persistent in its retries: as you can see from the messages it spent a whole half hour waiting. If it's an overload situation then you may get better performance by reducing the worker count (as they will have to retry less).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716:362,access,accesses,362,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716,2,['access'],['accesses']

Security,"My recollection is that this is a use case we never put any priority on so there's no test in the GATK suite for access to private files. There should be, of course. The feature is there and (at least locally) it worked when I tried it. NIO does not use the API_KEY, it uses default credentials. Those are environment variables that are set by the `gcloud` command or pre-set for you in the case of virtual machines on Google. There are two cases: local execution and Spark. . I just tested local execution and it worked fine for me:. ```; $ ./gatk-launch PrintReads -L Broad.human.exome.b37.small.interval_list -I gs://jpmartin-private/bench/WGS-G94982-NA12878.bam -O t_gcs.bam; ```. this command worked even though (unless I'm mistaken) neither the bucket nor the file are public. One challenge however is that the way to set default credentials has changed recently. Calling `gcloud auth login` used to be enough but now we have to call (IIRC) `gcloud auth application-default login`. For Spark, the default credentials are set as whoever owns the dataproc environment that's used to run the show. So it should be set so it has access to the buckets necessary.

I did write a python script to use where necessary for converting multiple unpaired reads in a file to single reads, and I used bash scripts to call the picard tools to convert multiple files at a time from bam to sam for editing and then back again after they were modified.

My plan is to pass a VariantEvalContext object, which would obscure any need to have knowledge of the walker. In an attempt to keep this PR simpler, I didnt complete that work.

When switching to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart, the reference is required, and the tool will error if the contigs dont match.

Regarding actually saving the state of StratificationManager to disk: some form of Jackson-based serialization would probably be easiest. My initial thought would be to make a new class specifically for serializing: SerializedStratificationManager. This would cache the relevant information and be the object that is serialized/deserialized.

Security,"Overriding the defaults would get us most of the way there.

If we override defaults, we'd still perform the check to make sure the user didn't muck with them, but it'd still be nicer than forcing the user to change the original defaults on their own. However, there are still two more awkward points: 1) there is no value for `-interval-set-rule` that does *nothing* to the incoming intervals (you must either union or intersect), and 2) we have to specify our own `padding` argument in `PreprocessIntervals` that is distinct from `-interval-padding`, since we want to implement our own padding. The first can be easily addressed by adding an option to do nothing to the intervals; I'm not so sure what the best way to handle the second would be, so we can punt on it if it'd be more work than it's worth---these are relatively minor pain points, in the end.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4341#issuecomment-363219857:222,Validat,Validate,222,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4341#issuecomment-363219857,6,"['Validat', 'validat']","['Validate', 'validateArg', 'validateIntervalArgumentCollection']"

Joint segmentation of the 100% normal and the 100% tumor yields 241 segments (up from 130 for the 100% tumor alone, as above). Using this joint segmentation for subsequent ModelSegments runs:.

I haven't performed detailed validations, but some spot checking suggests that this actually mitigate oversegmentation while still increasing sensitivity to shared events. For example, there is a small 13-bin deletion in chr19 that is found when running the 100% normal alone, but gets broken up into two adjacent deletions when running the 100% tumor alone (probably just due to statistical noise in the copy ratios). When running jointly, the deletion does not get broken up. However, as discussed over Slack, we should probably run some scenarios with simulated data to check behavior---for example, how robust is the joint segmentation to some of the samples being noisy/oversegmented?. There are lots of options for restructuring the workflow. We could potentially modify ModelSegments to take in the denoised copy ratios from the normal, when available, and add modeling of the normal and germline tagging to that tool. Or we could break things up into separate tools. @fleharty any opinions?.

Security,"Sorry @cmnbroad, I misunderstood your comment before - what I've got is that it is ok to have beta/experimental for this, but it's obviosly not what you said, so my fault for not reading carefully. In that case, I would like to have a proposal for how to proceed here:. * I will implement the port for the tools in two independent PRs - just direct translation into the new framework, documentation and kebab-case argument style.; * The port for `RealignerTargetCreator` will be similar to this one; * The port for `IndelRealigner` would not have support for n-way output, although it will be fully functional in other ways. The n-way option can be ported in the future as an extra feature if necessary (maybe the communications team can weight in, and tell if it is really a needed feature); * For the first test, which will be removed before merging, I will use the data from the tutorial. This will be the validation for the port before test data valid for the repository is provided; * For the final tests, I will draft the class with the tests from GAKT3 without the data and disabled, waiting for @sooheelee for meaningful tests (or other people from your team). The main idea is to have two PRs with the port validated with the tutorial data, and add other tests similar to the GATK3's ones for extra validation and/or covering missing codepaths using @sooheelee or ported GATK3 data. Does it makes sense, @cmnbroad and @sooheelee?. @sooheelee - I think that the 1000G data can be a good validation if chromosomes 20/21 have realigned reads without a pair mapping on other chromosomes. In that case, some of that reads can be extracted and reset to the state previous to realignment to validate the new tool.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-371728774:909,validat,validation,909,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-371728774,5,['validat'],"['validate', 'validated', 'validation']"

Security,"Thank you @kshakir. What I see there is that the code sets the default NIO option, and as part of this is creates a google cloud `StorageOptions` object. Sadly for us, when this object is created it determines which Google credentials to use, and if nothing was specified by the user it will send some network messages to try to figure out whether it's running on a Google Compute Engine machine. When we wrote the default-setting code we didn't realize that setting the number of retries was going to cause a network message to be sent, with the associated potential retries and delays. We can't change the way Google Compute Engine works, or how the Google authentication works either. Ideally we'd want some way to only search for credentials when we know NIO is going to be used. The point of these defaults is that they're used for anything that uses NIO, including third-party library code. We can't fully replicate this behavior in a different way from the outside. So I think the ""correct"" fix would be to go deep inside the Google NIO library and change it so that instead of providing a default configuration (that the user would have to put together, causing the problem you've seen), we can provide a *callback* that sets the configuration when the Google Cloud NIO provider is loaded. This is harder for future developers to wrap their heads around, but at least it would prevent this delay if NIO is not used. I'd like to think about this some more before doing something quite this drastic, though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504:659,authenticat,authentication,659,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504,1,['authenticat'],['authentication']
Security,"Thank you @vruano for your diligent review. I've implemented logger classes to encapsulate the metrics classes. Unfortunately the metrics classes must remain public in order to write output using `MetricsUtils.saveMetrics()`, but at least the tools aren't using them directly. There are two logging class groups - one for Filter and one Score. For Filter, there is an interface `PSFilterLogger` that is implemented by a file-logging class `PSFilterFileLogger` and a dummy class `PSFilterEmptyLogger` that does nothing. There are analogous classes for Score, but there is no Empty logger because it's not actually necessary. This adds a lot of new classes (maybe you can think of a better way) but usage has been greatly simplified. As we discussed in person, I don't think there is a faster way to count the reads in Spark. If you wanted to count the reads as they pass through, you would have to use some kind of atomic type that would be slow. Also it may be impossible to account for cases when tasks fail and restart. @lbergelson @droazen In this PR, I wanted to use htsjdk's MetricsFile and MetricBase classes for writing metrics to a file. I notice that these classes are mostly used for picard-related things. Is this the preferred way to do things? They do force you to expose public variables and also use an upper-case naming convention.

Security,"Thanks a lot for looking into this @sooheelee - I understand the pain of making the small data for the tests, so I really appreciate your work there. I have almost prepare a PR for the new port of `RealignerTargetCreator` that will have TODOs for the test data prepared by you, and with some tests using files already in the repository (for the target-creator, I guess that the validation for getting the regions to realign would be enough, because thanks to that tests I realized of a small bug due to not including all the loci in the `LocusWalker`). On the other hand, I will still fight for the `--nWayOut` not blocking the inclusion of `IndelRealigner` in the first place. My reasons are the following:; ; 1. Looking a bit into the code of GATK3, there is a lot of complication to get the reader ID for each read. It will require to modify the `GATKRead` interface, the data source for reads, or find an *ad hoc* solution on `IndelRealignment` to set the procedence of the read. This requires going into the engine-level code, which in my experience is difficult to port from GATK3 and also slow on the reviewing/acceptance process.; 1. My idea for developing a new writer of general use as the n-way output (which can be used in other tools as well) is to factor out some code from `SplitReads` to have a custom `GATKReadWriter` for arbitrary splitting. i'm already using a similar solution on `ReadTools`, so backporting the code to GATK might be a solution. Nevertheless, this still requires that the `GATKRead` has somehow the identity store at the object level, which requires to address point 1.; 1. The use case of the tumor-normal pair can be resolved by an extra processing step (split by read group). I understand that it is quite convenient to add this argument, but I would suggest that until it can be develop.; 1. Last, bu quite important for me as a developer, I don't have time to spend looking at that engine-level features required to include that argument.

I might include more detail with the note (""Substantially improves results on FFPE samples""), for posterity---it's probably true, but we can't really say anything definitive with only N=1 and without the cross-validation procedure I mentioned on Slack. That is, the higher degree of denoising might just be an artifact of effectively removing more PCs with GC-bias correction (since I'm assuming the same number of PCs were explicitly removed in both cases), but it's possible that removing the optimal number of PCs without GC-bias correction could achieve a better result.

Security,"Thanks very much for your analysis. Job 4 does create a lot of garbage, but that appears to be inevitable whenever you are dealing with a PairRDD: You have to use a Tuple2 to represent key and value rather than using a more memory-conservative custom data object. You end up with a gazillion tiny objects that survive only during the shuffle. Too bad they didn't base PairRDD on an interface like Map.Entry. Also too bad that you cannot force a shuffle on a (plain old, non-Pair) RDD. Why not just treat it as a key-only structure and allow repartitioning? I mention this not merely to whine, but also in the faint hope that you've developed some helpful workarounds. I don't think we have enough memory to persist the reads, but we can revisit that later. Job 5 *is* doing a lot of computation. It's turning each read into kmers and testing each of those kmers to see if they exist in a large hash table. I don't think there's much opportunity for further optimization -- I knew this would be a bottleneck and tried my best to make the code efficient.

Security,"Thanks, @gokalpcelik! That's unfortunate that the packages are no longer accessible. However, this old version of the environment was also somewhat problematic in that it included build strings, installed many packages using pip instead of conda, and was otherwise overly restrictive, see e.g. https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360061666671-Broken-conda-env-create-n-gatk-f-gatkcondaenv-yml. I would suggest, in the following order:. 1) Users upgrade to more recent versions of GATK; 2) Users use the 4.1.0.0 Docker; 3) Users edit the 4.1.0.0 environment to be less restrictive. For example, using Ubuntu 20.04.2 + conda 23.10.0, I was able to build something that is probably sufficiently close to the 4.1.0.0 conda environment by making the following changes:. ``` <- certifi=2016.2.28=py36_0; < - openssl=1.0.2l=0; < - pip=9.0.1=py36_1; < - python=3.6.2=0; < - readline=6.2=2; < - setuptools=36.4.0=py36_1; < - sqlite=3.13.0=0; < - tk=8.5.18=0; < - wheel=0.29.0=py36_0; < - xz=5.2.3=0; < - zlib=1.2.11=0; ---; > - openssl=1.0.2l; > - pip=9.0.1; > - python=3.6.2; > - setuptools=36.5.0; > - wheel=0.29.0; > - xz=5.2.3; > - zlib=1.2.11 ; ```. There is some clobbering that happens with the pip installs, but nothing major.

It calculates the number of bases covered for each partition, sorts the list, and grabs the middle entry. The code is not very defensive, and sadly, this number is 0 for your BAM. This could be because there are no partitions (I don't know why this might be), or because more than half of the partitions cover no bases (if, e.g., there are no mapped reads in the partition). Do you have a BAM that runs properly in the tool? You could try the Picard tool ValidateBAM or some tool that gathers mapping statistics (maybe samtools?) and compare the statistics on the good BAM as well as on the failing BAM.

Security,"There were a few issues with this case. First, the data source was not constructed 100% correctly. The config file is correct. . The index file is for the tar.gz version of the source data and not for the uncompressed version that they're using. The index should correspond to the source data in the file referenced by the config file itself (not a zipped or otherwise transformed version). Secondly, the source `tsv` data file has the header line for the table commented out. The Xsv codec is aware of leading hash marks as comments and will ignore any such lines. Because of this, the leading hash in the table header is ignored and the file cannot be properly parsed. The fix is simple - just remove the leading hash from the table header (the preceding line with the two hash marks is correctly interpreted as a file header because of the leading hashes acting as comments). Lastly, even if the user fixed the file they would still need to index it with`IndexFeatureFile`.

If `--shm-size` is indeed not exposed, why doesn't the Google backend scale /dev/shm or other tmpfs space with requested machine memory?. If there really is no other way around it, then all we're doing is filtering out the lines beginning with `@`. We could do this first by calling system commands within R to write to a temporary file, and then reading that back in with fread.

Then I confirmed that the slowness had nothing to do with SGE or cromwell (it shouldn't, because I was getting runtime from the GATK output log, not the cromwell log, but just in case. . .) by re-running each interval on gsa5. In *every* case, the slow intervals had extremely deep coverage (2,000 - 30,000) due to mapping error. Even after filtering to MQ == 60, the high coverage usually remained, although it often decreased significantly. In addition to the extreme depth, the only other sign was a significant proportion of reads with multiple SNVs relative to the reference. Unfortunately, something cheap to compute, like CIGAR complexity, was often not a sign, because many CIGARs were eg 101M, with many of the M's coming from SNVs. One quick solution would be to completely skip calling on regions with extremely high depth. It's hard to imagine being able to trust any calls from them. Another option is MQ-based downsampling, for example downsampling to the 1000 reads with the best MQ. Some people might like the downsampling option for the secure feeling of not losing sensitivity, although realistically those regions are so terrible that this security is an illusion.

Security,"We already added the functionality needed for the gCNV workflow to IntervalListTools in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1208. The issue is that the tool outputs each scattered interval list to a separate directory if the number of scatters is greater than 1, but it just outputs to a file (essentially a noop) if we don't need to scatter. Not sure the reason for this design, but it makes things difficult from the perspective of WDL. Would be easier if the expected output was always `Array[File]+`. I don't really see why IntervalListTools needs to create those intermediate directories (nor why the naming scheme is determined by `DecimalFormat(""0000"")`---don't think this is documented, either), but I am not sure if that behavior is expected by now or if it is safe to modify it. Pretty sure SplitIntervals is just calling the same backend class used by IntervalListTools. Perhaps that tool might've been spun off before we exposed the Picard tools?

Security,"Well, you're welcome to use gatk-launch as a launch script if you'd like (and feel free to rename to whatever you like...) A. There are a few reasons we have spark and non-spark versions of the tools. . 1. We wanted to port and validate certain tools as quickly as possible and doing a direct port from gatk3 -> gatk4 was easier than making them sparkified at the same time. 2. There's a tradeoff in using spark where you end up spending more total cpu hours in order to finish a job faster. Ideally this would be 1:1, double the number of cores and you halve the time to finish a job. It never scales perfectly though, there's always some overhead for being parallel. Our production pipelines are extremely sensitive to cost and not very sensitive to runtime, so they prefer we have a version that's optimized to use the least cpu hours even if that means a longer runtime. Other users prefer to be able to finish a job quickly and are willing to pay slightly more to do so, so we also have a spark version. . 3. Some tool are complicated to make work well spark. Spark works best when you can divide the input data into independent shards and then process them separately. This is complicated for things like the AssemblyRegion walker where you need context around each location of interest. We had to do things like add extra overlapping padding and things like that to avoid boundary issues where there are shard divisions. We don't yet fully understand spark performance and it's caveats, we're looking into that actively now. We hope that we'll be able to optimize our tools so that a spark pipeline of several tools in series is faster than running the individual non-spark versions, since it lets us avoid doing things like loading the bam file multiple times from disk. Whether or not we can achieve this is still and open question though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2345#issuecomment-273318100:228,validat,validate,228,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2345#issuecomment-273318100,1,['validat'],['validate']

Security,"Your interpretation sounds right, although I wish the language in the SAM spec were clearer - something like ""if 0x1 is unset, fields 0x2, 0x8, 0x20, 0x40, and 0x80 have no meaning and are ignored by the tools"". SAMRecord.IsValid() returns errors not only for 0x8(mate unmapped)/unpaired read, but also for the other four fields, so all of these errors would need to be removed. IsValid() also triggers an error when an unpaired read has RNEXT set, but the spec. ; doesn't appear to exclude this error. No error is triggered for the unpaired/PNEXT case. . So I agree that it looks like IsValid() should be changed to align with the spec. But I can also imagine potential pitfalls of leaving the GenomicsConverter code the way it is. The code adds spurious information to the bam that might cause problems with legacy versions of the tools. I don't know what the plans are for the state of the existing tool distribution once gatk4 is released. Is it possible that bam files produced in the cloud could make their way into gatk3 workflows, maybe via the sharing of bams between groups? If this happens, then unpaired reads processed in the cloud, with their mate unpaired flags set by the converter, could trigger validation errors when they are fed to the legacy tools. Is there a downside to altering the converter code as well as modifying the ; validator (I don't know what altering google packages entails...)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/569#issuecomment-114510392:1213,validat,validation,1213,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/569#issuecomment-114510392,2,['validat'],"['validation', 'validator']"

Security,"ah---this is what I get for making an example inputs file when we really didn't need one and for choosing the full AoU 1k release (vat_kc_vat_1) as the default. I wanted to run the validations here because it is the largest dataset and it is the AoU data (not just Anvil data) BUT it has no values for gvs_all_ac or gvs_all_an yet because that step wasn't implemented by the time of creation. (Validation #9 was added by Lee recently) The table vat_jul18 does have those values as it was created just last week, but may get cleaned up...so this might be a good best practices question for what we run this on in the future if there is ever an automated version?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7365#issuecomment-886085289:181,validat,validations,181,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7365#issuecomment-886085289,2,"['Validat', 'validat']","['Validation', 'validations']"

Security,"ampleIndex);; final int[] indexesToRemove = evidences.stream().mapToInt(e -> {; final int index = evidenceIndexes.getInt(e);; if (index == MISSING_INDEX) {; throw new IllegalArgumentException(""evidence provided is not in sample"");; }; ```; We get an error when `evidenceIndexBySampleIndex(sampleIndex)` yields a `Map` that for some reason doesn't contain a read that it should. So let's investigate `evidenceIndexBySampleIndex()`. This method returns the `evidenceIndexBySampleIndex.get(sampleIndex)` field if it is not `null` (ie uninitialized); otherwise it fills it and then returns it. The code for filling it seems fine, and it explicitly loops over every sample read, so it's hard to see that the error could come from there. It seems rather that the problem is in returning the cached value whenever it is not `null`. The cached value of `evidenceIndexBySampleIndex.get(sampleIndex)` becomes invalid whenever reads are added or removed. However, you can check all the accesses of `evidenceIndexBySampleIndex` (there are only six) and verify that the class never accounts for this. So, suppose that an `AlleleLikelihoods` object invokes `evidenceIndexBySampleIndex(sampleIndex)` more than once and adds or removes reads between these. The second call returns the cached map from the first call, which is bogus. Even if it doesn't explain this issue, it is a bug. Now let's think about which public methods `evidenceIndexBySampleIndex(sampleIndex)` is called in and where this occurs in HaplotypeCaller:. * `addEvidence` (in HC this happens only in the likelihoods for annotations, downstream of our issue, so this is not the culprit).; * `filterPoorlyModeledEvidence` (this happens after Pair-HMM to the haplotype likelihoods, so not the culprit either); * `contaminationDownsampling`; * `retainEvidence` (hmmm in HC `readAlleleLikelihoods.retainEvidence(variantCallingRelevantOverlap::overlaps);` occurs immediately before `contaminationDownsampling`); * `indexOfEvidence` (nothing stands out)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6586#issuecomment-625021336:1166,access,accesses,1166,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6586#issuecomment-625021336,1,['access'],['accesses']

There are other options---see https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/30479, for example. We might want to experiment with the LL score discussed there (see https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICML/2003/ICML03-060.pdf for the original paper---although note that despite the paper's high citation count, I'm not sure what the canonical name for this metric actually is, but it doesn't appear to be ""LL score""---perhaps someone else knows or has better Google-fu and can figure it out) before moving on to their methods for estimating F1. Doing a literature search for other discussions of optimizing F1 or other metrics in the context of positive-unlabeled learning might be worthwhile, but I think most methods will probably involve some sort of estimation of the base rate in unlabeled data. I think we may have to add some mechanism for holding out a validation set during training if we want to automatically tune thresholds in a rigorous fashion. Shouldn't be too bad---we can just have the training tool randomly mask out a set of the truth and pass the mask to the scoring tool (or maybe just determine the threshold in the training tool, if we are running in positive/negative mode and have access to unlabeled data)---but does add a couple of parameters to the tool interfaces. This also adds additional dependence on the quality of the truth resources. I think an implicit assumption in any use of the truth---even just thresholding/calibrating by sensitivity---is that it is a random sample; however, I'm not sure how true this is in actual use. For example, in malaria, it looks like we may have to resort to using a callset that has been very conservatively filtered as truth, which will bias us towards high scores and the peaks of the positive distribution. Perhaps we can also experiment with just treating training/truth on an equal footing (I think the d",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1062931241:1257,validat,validation,1257,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1062931241,2,['validat'],['validation']

Security,"dian count is significantly away from the main peak (due to the abundance of low mappability bins with small counts). . Also, the second peak of chrX coverage in XY samples that you show above is not a large germline event -- it is simply a low mappable PAR-like region that borrows reads from chrY. Here's how the X coverage distribution looks like on an XY sample after mappability filtering (which removes most of all approximate homologies):; ![chrx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15305869/37867778-54e3d196-2f73-11e8-8345-d8964b39a17e.png). **The second spurious peak is gone and range of NB-like behavior is pretty much perfect. Without mappability filtering, all of the bins on the second mode _will_ show up as CN = 2 events (in fact, if you look at gCNV calls on a typical XY samples, there are tons of CN = 2 calls).**. Most, if not all, of the non-NB-like coverage before/after the main peak in your plots are reads from unmappable regions, many of which show up as real CNV events if we do not filter them (reads in these regions do not follow from the coverage model and we are at the mercy of BWA). I strongly believe Genome STRiP has achieved ~ 99% experimental validation accuracy because of aggressive filtering, not because of a superior model (it's an elementary Gaussian mixture mix). Garbage in, garbage out. Anyhow, I am not comfortable at all with cutting a non-Beta release without taking care of about:. 1. Mappability-based bin/read filtering (for WGS), and; 2. Trying out and evaluating a bait-based coverage collection (for WES), so that the raw coverage distribution is more NB-like to begin with. These are both perfectly achievable goals before May 15. I'd be happy to leave stuff such as different coverage collection strategies (e.g. base call coverage) and fragment-based per-sample GC content estimation for later.

Security,"e GATK3 traversal. Initially, I did plan on having `AssemblyRegionWalker` extend the former `ReadWindowWalker`, or an adapted version of your `SlidingWindowWalker`, and I did implement it like this at first, but ultimately I collapsed it into a single class for several reasons:; - Inheriting from a more generic traversal type caused usability issues and confusion with respect to the command-line arguments. The `ReadWindow` was the unit of processing for the superclass, but for `AssemblyRegionWalker` it was the unit of I/O and `AssemblyRegion` was the unit of processing, and I couldn't update the docs for `ReadWindowWalker` to clear up the confusion without mentioning `AssemblyRegion`-specific concepts.; - The `ReadShard` / `ReadWindow` was/is **only** there to prove that we can shard the data without introducing calling artifacts, and to provide a unit of parallelism for the upcoming Spark implementation. It's not something we really want to expose to users as a prominent knob, and we may hide it completely in the future once the shard size is tuned for performance.; - Inheriting from a more abstract walker type caused a number of other problems as well: methods that should have been final in the supertype could no longer be made final, with the result that tool implementations could inappropriately override engine initialization/shutdown routines. Also, there were issues with the progress meter, since both the supertype traversal and subtype traversal needed their own progress meter for their different units of processing. Ultimately it was just too awkward and forced, and the read shard is something that we eventually want to make an internal/encapsulated implementation detail anyway. GATK3 made the mistake, I think, of using long, confusing inheritance chains for its walker types, with the result that you got awkward and forced relationships like `RodWalker` inheriting from `LocusWalker`. It's better, I think, to make each traversal as standalone as possible, esp",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1708#issuecomment-210806513:1255,expose,expose,1255,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1708#issuecomment-210806513,1,['expose'],['expose']

After the proposed change we'll have 3 repos (all BSD licensed):; 1) broadinstitute/gatk; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-AVX; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-PPC. We will duplicate the native code (AVX and PPC will be separate copies of C++ files etc) to simplify the testing burden. The parties interested in working on a specific architecture will contribute code directly to the respective architecture-specific repo and gatk will take occasional updates of those repos. The gatk repo will depend on the other two. The PPC repo will depend on the AVX repo (and any other native repos will depend on the AVX one).

Let's go throught the steps: 1) find the max. 2) subtract the max -- subtracting a constant in log-space is equivalent to dividing by a constant in real space, and since we're normalizing in the end this constant is arbitrary. It's done for numerical stability. 3) exponentiate to get an unnormalized real-space array. 4) find the sum. 5) divide by the sum to get the normalized result. The log-10 version of this is `MathUtils::normalizeFromLog10ToLinearSpace(d1)`. You could either calculate `d1` in log-10 space or convert it, replacing the above line with `return MathUtils.normalizeFromLog10ToLinearSpace(MathUtils.applyToArrayInPlace(d1, MathUtils::logToLog10))`. The latter option is simpler. * Import static should be avoided except to escape horrible clutter, which is not the case here. * The second argument of `Utils.validateArg(condition, calculated string expression)` should become `Utils.validateArg(condition, () -> calculated string expression)`. In the first version, the expression is calculated *even if* the condition is satisfied, whereas in the second it is only calculated as needed. It's not critical here but it's a good habit to get into. PS I am a zealot of the Boy Scout Rule (always leave the camp site cleaner than you found it).

Security,"ed by groupReadPairs is very expensive both in time and in memory. It's a full hash shuffle of GATKReads (time expensive), that results in a gazillion 1- and 2-element Lists (memory expensive). So you certainly don't want to do it twice. But the way pairedReads and unpairedReads is set up, you *will* do it twice if you want to process both paired and unpaired reads. (And even if you aren't, someone else might try to use this code to do so.). So my first suggestion is that you remove the call to groupReadPairs from pairedReads and unpairedReads, and let a user groupReadPairs once, and reuse the resulting JavaPairRDD to process paired and unpaired reads. My second suggestion is quite a bit more complicated, but I think it would result in far better performance. I'll sketch it out here, and then I can explain it further in person, if it's a direction you'd like to pursue. The first step is to create a JavaRDD<GATKRead> in which all pairs sharing a template name are in the same partition (but without grouping them). To do that, you temporarily boost the input JavaRDD into a JavaPairRDD<String,GATKRead> by extracting the read name as a key. Then you repartition (to do the shuffle). Then you map back to an ordinary JavaRDD<GATKRead> by keeping just the value. (Note: if the BAM has queryname sort order, you can just skip this step entirely.); Now you can do a mapPartition operation to filter for paired or unpaired reads: Iterate over the reads in the partition, and keep a hash map of [name -> read] of reads that have not yet found mates. To filter for paired reads, whenever you find the name of the current read already in the table, just emit the current read and the read in the map as a pair, and delete the read from the map (you're done with that name -- this keeps the table smaller). To filter for unpaired reads, just delete any map entry that you successfully look up, and insert any name that you don't. What's left at the end of this process are all the unpaired reads.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2664#issuecomment-299955039:1578,hash,hash,1578,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2664#issuecomment-299955039,1,['hash'],['hash']

Security,"en't seen discussed in these threads.; Perhaps it's impractical, but I'll mention it anyway. It seems like ; another approach would be to create (internal to the implementation) a ; ""header tag"" that could be efficiently serialized; and passed as part of the SAMRecord when you need to distribute it. The ; header tag could be used by the receiver to reattach the SAMRecord to ; its header (either proactively or on demand), but transparently to ; application code that is running against the SAMRecord API.; This would allow SAM headers to be transmitted out-of-band in a way that ; depends on the execution environment. Depending on the environment, ; this might be done by proactive broadcast, or you could think of the ; header tag as a promise to retrieve the header if/when it is needed. ; The size and complexity of the header tag might also depend on the ; execution environment.

Security,"erformed a round of evaluations against XHMM and cn.MOPS on a cohort of 160 samples from SFARI project (which is described in our ASHG poster). For ground truth we used a callset generated from Talkowski lab SV pipeline on matched whole genome samples. Unfortunately, SFARI cohort is not public and cannot be used for public facing evaluations.; - Some hyperparameter tweaking was necessary to achieve good performance. Hyperparameters changed were contained mostly only to `psi_t` parameter.; - We developed a clustering procedure that is based on coverage profile at the set of targets that are highly variable across different capture kits. ; - We found that filtering on a QS metric on a final callset significantly boosted the specificity while lowering sensitivity insignificantly.; - We developed a hyperparameter optimization framework prototype that could be used in a future for general optimizations of cost/performance parameters for all GATK pipelines.; - We resolved several memory issues that came up during validations. **A few issues were encountered along the way:**; - The sensitivity and specificity on multiallellic (common) sites was significantly lower than on rare events.; - Single target calling sensitivity was lower than 20%.; - Pipeline WDL required optimization in order to handle whole genome data, however these changes were not consolidated in the official WDL. **Currently the ongoing work is focused on the following:**; - Improving sensitivity/specificity of calls on common regions. One solution being tested involves setting a prior for common regions derived from a high quality callset. Second solution is to set a different filtering threshold for common regions.; - Consolidating validation scripts to process gCNV output and outputs of competing tools measure their performances against ground truth.; - Analyzing 1000 Genomes exomes, which could be potentially used for public facing automatic evaluations. **The following items are necessary done for auto",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123#issuecomment-532500502:1068,validat,validations,1068,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123#issuecomment-532500502,1,['validat'],['validations']

Note that the malaria data used was pretty small: chr1-2 training (~20k positive training/truth variants, ~50k negative training variants; note also that the threshold for determining negative training was not tuned---a threshold corresponding to a 98% truth sensitivity was arbitrarily chosen), chr3 validation (~50k variants), and chr4-6 test (~150k variants). The LL score is calculated from a validation set held out from the training/truth positives used to train the model, while the F1 score is calculated using ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives determined using 3 families of ~30 trios each. However, there's some arbitrariness in how we define the boundary for the latter positives/negatives, and hence some arbitrariness in the F1 score itself. But I'd expect using gold-standard GIAB truth would be more straightforward. Not sure how much we can conclude, but that the validation and test F1s are similar and that the validation LL score isn't *too* far off are encouraging. That said, there is a pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above.

Security,"factor of around four, which gzip often does not reach (because it doesn't know ahead of time that DNA has only four letters).; Use reference genome fasta as proxy for nearly no repetition at all. It doesn't compress much beyond 2bit. Tweaking of the Huffmann coding etc. might have influenced the compression level much in this case, by ""giving the compressor a subtle hint about the four letters"".; Paradoxically, Intel might have optimized for average data and thus brought a disadvantage for the four letter nature of DNA (and also the few letters used in quality data encoding compared to text). 3. BQSR:; When I did interleaving compression experiments, I noticed that the BQSR step decreases compressiblity considerably.; In this example I had the same BAM file in different versions that were aligned to hs38DH, hs38, hs37d5 and could compress them to nearly the size of one, by putting similar pieces of the files after one another.; Adding the same BAM with BQSR increased final file size more than several pre-BQSR versions together.; Note: This piece-meal packing might be useful for different BAMs mostly only with many BAMs where similar regions accumulate. 4. Even faster:; In my experience, level 0 (no compression) (with samtools view -u) increases speed even more, if files are on a lz4 encrypted disk (such as with ZFS).; The speed-up of lz4 over even level 1 of any gzip-like compression is substantial.; With data on SSDs or similarly fast storage, that can make a huge difference. Another factor 6 six faster than level 1 on compression and a factor 9 on decompression. The then possible decompression speed of 3GB/s makes it possible to e.g. load a 180GB bam into a RAM disk in 60 seconds on a sufficiently fast SSD array (e.g. as on an aws ec2 i3.8xlarge instance).; Still 600MB/s if the RAM is also lz4 compressed.

Security,"ion. We will repeat the het-genotyping step, but this is cheap and it's probably better to repeat it to make sure filtering is applied consistently. It would also require more changes to the command line to specify where to output the hets for each sample during multisample segmentation and to skip genotyping in each scatter, if we were to go that route. There are many possible combinations of inputs that need to be tested, but the same is already true of the current ModelSegments. Furthermore, there are slight wrinkles when running in tumor-only mode (i.e., when `--normal-allelic-counts` are not available). Because each sample is genotyped indiviudally, each may yield a different set of hets (in contrast to genotyping in matched-normal mode, in which the normal determines the set of hets used in all samples). We will thus have to take the intersection of these hets before performing multisample segmentation. Unfortunately, we will not be able to re-perform this intersection in each scatter, since we will no longer have access to the hets from the other samples. However, we *will* ultimately intersect the hets from each sample with the joint segmentation before modeling, which may be a rough proxy for the intersection of hets from all samples. As always, tumor-only mode may yield suboptimal results in certain scenarios, e.g., high purity CNLOH. I think I'm OK with just documenting these wrinkles, rather than working too hard to iron them out. I think this structure sets us up nicely to accommodate germline tagging/filtering in the near future. We can still pass the Picard interval list containing the joint segmentation to the scatter for the normal, but can instead subsequently pass the *.modelBegin.seg result from the normal to the tumors. This modeled-segment file will have breakpoints identical to those from the joint segmentation (as opposed to the *.modelFinal.seg result, since that undergoes segment smoothing/merging), but will also contain the segment-level p",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6499#issuecomment-607313549:3176,access,access,3176,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6499#issuecomment-607313549,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"lity shouldn't really change across some of them.; ; I'm currently just using call outs to system commands to diff and h5diff the VCFs and HDF5s, respectively. I think the latter command should be available in the GATK Conda environment. This will be a bit awkward, in the sense that the tests for this tool will require the Conda environment, but the tool itself will not. But I think this is probably preferable to writing test code to compare HDF5s, minimal though that might be, since the schema might change in the future.; - [x] Tool-level docs. Minor TODOs:. - [x] Parameter-level docs. Could perhaps expand on the `resources` parameter once the required labels are settled.; - [x] Parameter validation.; - [x] Clean up docs for parent walker.; - [x] Decide on required labels. I think ""training"" and ""calibration"" (rather than the legacy ""training"" and ""truth"") might be good candidates. EDIT: Switched ""truth"" to ""calibration"" throughout the codebase.; - [x] Validate privileged labels (snp, training, calibration) in parent walker.; ; Future work:. - [ ] Clean up unlabeled outputs. This includes 1) sorting the corresponding HDF5, and 2) outputting a corresponding sites-only VCF. Unlike the labeled sites, which are written individually to VCF as we traverse them, unlabeled sites are placed into a reservoir of fixed size for subsampling purposes. Thus, we cannot write them to VCF as with labeled sites; furthermore, after traversal, the unlabeled sites are not ordered within the reservoir. Ultimately, the lack of this VCF means that extracted, unlabeled sites cannot be tagged as such by the scoring tool in the final VCF.; - [ ] Consider downsampling of labeled data. This is not done because 1) of the complications just mentioned, 2) we assume that labeled data is precious and that one-time extraction of it will always be relatively cheap, especially compared to training (and that training implementations can always downsample, if needed), and 3) using -L functionality to subs",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1067948059:3440,Validat,Validate,3440,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1067948059,1,['Validat'],['Validate']

Security,"m.google.cloud.genomics.gatk.common. I've been working on this bam file issue, correcting errors in the files used for tests. Many of the errors involve reads with FLAGs that indicate that they are in pairs, but the mate is not extant in the file, causing the error. A way to fix this without deleting the offending reads is to set the FLAG to zero and also modify the RNEXT, PNEXT, and TLEN fields, if necessary, so that the read becomes single (provided that the values of all of these fields are not important for the tests). However, when I do this, I find that tests that write and then read bam files fail, because when the just-written file is read back, SAM validation complains that the mate unmapped FLAG is set for an unpaired read. It turns out that the copy of the file written by the test substitutes the value '8' for '0' as the FLAG for the modified reads. The relevant code in GenomicsConvertermakeSamRecord() (line 170) is:. flags += ((read.getNextMatePosition() == null || read.getNextMatePosition.getPosition() == null)) ? 8 : 0;. The effect of this line is that all reads which have null mate positions, even those which the FLAG specifies as unpaired, get the mate unmapped FLAG set, causing the validation errors that i'm seeing. The reason the tests have not failed before is apparently that the existing test files do not contain any reads with FLAGs that specify them as unpaired. A simple fix for this would be to convert the line above to:. flags += ( paired && (read.getNextMatePosition() == null || read.getNextMatePosition.getPosition() == null)) ? 8 : 0;. The redundant parens in the original code suggest that something like this may have been intended,but the google genomics documentation at http://google-genomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migrating_tips.html gives the following pseudocode:. flags += read.nextMatePosition.position == null ? 8 : 0 #mate_unmapped. so it looks like the doc supports the existing code. Should I submit this as an issue? .

Now there is a single shared `RecalibrationArgumentCollection` that contains **only** the parameters for the `BaseRecalibrationEngine` itself, and this argument collection is exposed by all 3 versions of the tool. Input/output arguments have been removed from this argument collection and put into the individual implementations of BQSR, since they vary between the walker, dataflow, and spark versions of the tool. This eliminates awkward problems such as having both a `knownSites` argument AND a `BQSRKnownVariants` exposed at the same time, with only 1 of them usable for a given version of a tool. The dataflow-only `BaseRecalibrationArgumentCollection` has been deleted completely as no longer needed.; - We tweaked the names of some tool arguments to enforce consistency between the 3 versions of the tool as well as the rest of hellbender (eg., output arg for BQSR is now a more standard `-O`)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/911#issuecomment-142340073:1325,expose,exposed,1325,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/911#issuecomment-142340073,2,['expose'],['exposed']

Security,"olders named ""SAMPLE_#""), and just check the sample_name.txt files at the PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls step. I don't think this should require GermlineCNVCaller code changes, right?. 4) We may require additional code at the WDL level if we want to both switch over to primarily using sample names but also get rid of bundling (i.e., by passing only the calls for each sample when needed). Locally, you can always just search all output for directories containing the appropriate sample_name.txt. But on the cloud, you'd want to make sure that the postprocessing step for a particular sample gets only its corresponding directories, which would have to happen at the WDL level; the check against sample_name.txt at the tool level would just be a formality. I can foresee headaches with globbing and funky sample names. I'm not sure I understand your point about extending PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls to run on all samples. The point of that tool is to take results from all genomic shards for a single sample and stitch them together, right? Even if we extend this to run on a batch of multiple samples (which would just be moving the loop over samples at the WDL level to some lower level, i.e., Java or python), we still need to see all shards for those samples. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding---can you clarify?. @mwalker174 can we once and for all clearly document the issue with the transpose? Perhaps by pointing to specific WGS runs that have issues with call caching? I think being able to pinpoint the exact issue will help us identify the right solution---whether that be choosing an appropriate bundling scheme, taking advantage of #5781 to reduce the number of shards, batching during the postprocessing step, removing unnecessary outputs, etc. Recall that we'd like to be able to use the same WDL locally (when you have easy access to all GermlineCNVCaller results from all genomic shards) and in the cloud, with minimal duplication of output from bundling when running locally, if possible.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6659#issuecomment-644829765:3154,access,access,3154,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6659#issuecomment-644829765,2,['access'],['access']

Security,"onsolidated with---@jamesemery thoughts? Again, let me reiterate that it seems that many of these parameter values were chosen arbitrarily (or, if not, that the procedure for choosing them has been lost). As a start, you can see the results of some optimizations I did on the CHM mix on slide 15 at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zGuquAZWSUQ-wNxp8D6HhGNjIaFcV0_X9WAS4LODbEo/edit?usp=sharing Here, I optimized over haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype SW parameters on various metrics after variant normalization using vcfeval. These optimizations were done using the Bayesian optimization framework I prototyped long ago (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-evaluation/tree/master/pipeline-optimizer and https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t5WOAEOMp0xAzJgpKbP68BUnclNYfIVRrDSL9wl1-3A/edit?usp=sharing); this entailed running parameter scans using a local Cromwell on my desktop. Probably this optimization work could be redone relatively easily using the Neptune framework put together by @dalessioluca, which was still in development at the time I did this work. Happy to share the resources and scripts I used if we go down this route; they are pretty lightweight. See more discussion starting here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564#issuecomment-710107566. Alternatively, we could merge this branch to expose the parameters now and punt on consolidating/optimizing them. I'm not completely convinced we should even do the former unless we are going to follow through on the latter, but happy to defer to others. Finally, note also there is one code optimization that I removed, since it makes assumptions on the SW parameter values that might not be valid for non-default values. I'll highlight this with a comment below. We can restore it if we add code to check whether the assumptions hold, but I'd be curious to see in which cases the optimization makes a big difference.

Thus, we cannot write them to VCF as with labeled sites; furthermore, after traversal, the unlabeled sites are not ordered within the reservoir. Ultimately, the lack of this VCF means that extracted, unlabeled sites cannot be tagged as such by the scoring tool in the final VCF.; - [ ] Consider downsampling of labeled data.

There are links to snyk version update recommendations. I know sometimes its not easy just to upgrade the library version as we could end up with run time errors. I am adding this here so that its handy when ever you look at this further.

Security,"periment with the LL score discussed there (see https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICML/2003/ICML03-060.pdf for the original paper---although note that despite the paper's high citation count, I'm not sure what the canonical name for this metric actually is, but it doesn't appear to be ""LL score""---perhaps someone else knows or has better Google-fu and can figure it out) before moving on to their methods for estimating F1. Doing a literature search for other discussions of optimizing F1 or other metrics in the context of positive-unlabeled learning might be worthwhile, but I think most methods will probably involve some sort of estimation of the base rate in unlabeled data. I think we may have to add some mechanism for holding out a validation set during training if we want to automatically tune thresholds in a rigorous fashion. Shouldn't be too bad---we can just have the training tool randomly mask out a set of the truth and pass the mask to the scoring tool (or maybe just determine the threshold in the training tool, if we are running in positive/negative mode and have access to unlabeled data)---but does add a couple of parameters to the tool interfaces. This also adds additional dependence on the quality of the truth resources. I think an implicit assumption in any use of the truth---even just thresholding/calibrating by sensitivity---is that it is a random sample; however, I'm not sure how true this is in actual use. For example, in malaria, it looks like we may have to resort to using a callset that has been very conservatively filtered as truth, which will bias us towards high scores and the peaks of the positive distribution. Perhaps we can also experiment with just treating training/truth on an equal footing (I think the distinction between the two is somewhat blurry in the original VQSR design, anyway). Perhaps @davidbenjamin has some thoughts? I see some related stuff going on in ThresholdCalculator, but I have to admit that I can't tell whether that's used in a ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1062931241:1602,access,access,1602,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1062931241,2,['access'],['access']

Security,"s where results changed:. - For the snpeff test, since the behavior on this branch seems more correct to me than master, I tried running the GATK4 test case inputs with GATK3, and it produces exactly the same results as this branch does. So I think that issue was introduced by the original GATK4 port, and is fixed in this branch.; - The rest of the tests with changed results don't seem to hit your breakpoint, though. So I think we need to figure out why they changed, and maybe also compare them with GATK3 (which can be a pain because the output format is slightly different).; - As you mentioned, you changed the reference for testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields, which seems to have only affected the number of loci processed. So I'm unclear why that change was necessary. If the test truly should have been failing without this change, will it still fail if the change is reverted ? If not, can we fix it, and either way there should be a negative test for that case. A few other general comments:. - I changed this PR to `draft` mode for now, which just better categorizes it for our internal workflow purposes. When its ready for a detailed code review we can remove the `draft` status.; - The `HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>>` can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place.; - I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me. If we can't solve that problem completely in this PR (which is fine, I'm all for trying to contain this), are those changes necessary ? Perhaps that part should just wait for the next round.; - Any new classes/methods should use `final` for variables and parameters wherever applicable, and public classes and methods should have javadoc.; - Finally, I'm curious if you've tried any perf testing on this branch ? Is it better ?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-744689987:1289,Hash,HashMap,1289,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-744689987,2,['Hash'],['HashMap']

Security,thanks for the review @kcibul. I made some changes accordingly. re: PrepareCallset file of sample names. That would be nice! It would make this workflow simpler and it also simplifies the access requirements for PrepareCallset. re: Dockstore. We actually ruled this out because Terra says that the definition of a method configuration can change automatically if its updated in dockstore. Which can be useful but it adds a security risk since a compromised Dockstore can change the definition of the production AoU extraction WDL which runs with highly elevated permissions. We already have a script that creates method configurations from github so I can probably add something a little hacky to resolve relative imports to the raw github file that it refers to.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7242#issuecomment-846494686:188,access,access,188,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7242#issuecomment-846494686,4,"['access', 'secur']","['access', 'security']"

Security,"this for a first workflow to target?. 1) Run ExtractVariantAnnotations on a training set of chromosomes. You can keep training/truth labels as in Best Practices, for now.; 2) Run TrainVariantAnnotationsModel on that. We'll use the truth scores generated here for any sensitivity conversions---i.e., we'll be calibrating scores only to the truth sites that are contained in the training set of chromosomes.; 3) Use the trained model to run a single shard of ScoreVariantAnnotations on a validation set of chromosomes.; 4) Run some variation of the above script on the resulting outputs to determine SNP and INDEL score thresholds for optimizing the corresponding LL scores. We can also add some code to the script to use the truth scores from step 2 to convert these score thresholds into truth-sensitivity thresholds.; 5) Provide these truth-sensitivity thresholds to ScoreVariantAnnotations and use them to hard filter. Evaluate on a test set of chromosomes. If all looks good, we can later move steps 3-4 into the train tool and automate the passing of sensitivities in 5 via outputs in the model directory. This will let us keep the basic interface of ScoreVariantAnnotations the same, but we'll have to add a few basic parameters to TrainVariantAnnotationsModel to control the train/validation split. So I think all this branch is missing is step 5---we'll simply need to add command-line parameters for the SNP/INDEL sensitivity thresholds and then do the hard filtering in the VCF writing method highlighted above. Do you think you can handle implementing that in this branch, and then the rest at the WDL level? I can help with the python script for the LL stuff (or anything else), if needed. Not sure if you got a chance to check out what your collaborators are doing in the methods you're looking to compare against, but it would be good to understand if this basic scheme for train/validation/test splitting can be replicated over there. You'll want to compare apples to apples, after all!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1068345084:1366,validat,validation,1366,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1068345084,4,['validat'],['validation']

Security,"ward. Not sure how much we can conclude, but that the validation and test F1s are similar and that the validation LL score isn't *too* far off are encouraging. That said, there is a pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above. I would hope that with more variants or reliable training/truth (as in your data), things might stabilize or line up better. I'll try running with more malaria data, as well. The following trios x sites heatmap (top plot) for the validation set might better illustrate the arbitrariness in F1 (click to enlarge):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385585-1a0dfe8e-d4b7-4770-aed0-19ad81162c92.png). Here, yellow = het errors (since these are supposed to be clonal malaria samples), red = Mendelian errors, grey = no calls, green = Mendelian consistency, white = reference. The second plot shows the training/truth positives used to train the model and to calculate the LL score in the validation shard. The third plot shows the ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives used to calculate F1. So we can see that the difficulty in deriving F1 as a function of the score along the horizontal axis to give the third plot lies in collapsing the columns in the top plot into a single condition positive or condition negative status. Again, hard to do so without some arbitrariness; I simply came up with some rules to convert various amounts of red, yellow, green, etc. in each column to a red/white/green status. If you're using a single gold-standard sample, this should definitely be more straightforward. In any case, the optimal validation LL score at ~0.02 does appear to line up quite well visually with where one might manually set a threshold. It corresponds pretty well with the transition from the yellow/red/grey junk to the clean green/white sites in the top plot. Here's the same for the test set:. ![image](https://user-images.gith",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1067396431:2142,validat,validation,2142,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1067396431,2,['validat'],['validation']

But I still get the error. Is GATK using hbase? If yes shall some jars be included to a local SPARK system to enable it to run GATK tools?

In versions of the code prior to #3752 (I think) this set of alignments was being filtered out by the method `isNotSimpleTranslocation` in the `parseOneContig` method of `ChimericAlignment`. Now that check's logic has changed and `isLikelySimpleTranslocation` returns false instead of true and so this alignment is not being filtered out any more. . When it gets to `NovelAdjacencyReferenceLocations.TanDupBreakpointsInference()` both `upstreamBreakpointRefPos` and `downstreamBreakpointRefPos` are being set to zero. It's not immediately clear to me how to fix this. A few thoughts:. - Are we supposed to be processing this `ChimericAlignment` through the main code path right now? ; - Why do we subtract 1 from the start position of the `rightReferenceInterval.getStart()",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3874#issuecomment-347627504:2811,assert,assertEquals,2811,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3874#issuecomment-347627504,2,['assert'],['assertEquals']

Testability," VCF for the input (since this has both non-AS and AS annotations; EDIT: Scratch that, it only has AS_InbreedingCoeff and AS_QD), 2) the Omni SNP training/truth VCF (yielding ~3.5k training), and 3) the Mills training/truth VCF (yielding ~500 training). Incidentally, VariantRecalibrator SNP and INDEL runs both fail to converge on these small training sets without the #7709 fix, but do converge with it. I still need to check if enough multiallelics are included here; if not, I'll choose a different snippet. EDITEDIT: Now using gs://broad-gotc-test-storage/joint_genotyping/exome/scientific/truth/master/gather_vcfs_high_memory/small_callset_low_threshold.vcf.gz provided by @ldgauthier, which does have AS annotations.; ; We'll use expected outputs here as inputs to downstream steps, but rather than provide the expected outputs directly, we'll create copies of them and provide those as inputs. This will make the tests better encapsulated. However, it should be relatively easy to update the whole chain of test files, should one choose to do so. EDIT: Let's just provide the expected outputs directly. So it'll be even easier to update the whole chain---just set the flags for all three tools to overwrite the expected results.; ; We test the Cartesian product of the following options: 1) non-allele-specific vs. allele-specific, 2) SNP vs. indel vs. both, and 3) positive vs. positive-unlabeled. Downstream, we'll further subset to a subset of these options, since training/scoring functionality shouldn't really change across some of them.; ; I'm currently just using call outs to system commands to diff and h5diff the VCFs and HDF5s, respectively. I think the latter command should be available in the GATK Conda environment. This will be a bit awkward, in the sense that the tests for this tool will require the Conda environment, but the tool itself will not. But I think this is probably preferable to writing test code to compare HDF5s, minimal though that might be, since the schema",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1067948059:1985,test,test,1985,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1067948059,1,['test'],['test']

Testability," also removes by debugging code and comments. I think it is ready for a review. To some other questions you had above:. 1) The HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>> can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place. I realize that's non-optimal, but this isnt anything I introduced here. I would really like to keep this PR as limited as we can, and address some larger refactoring in a different PR, once we've migrated to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart. 2) I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me. If we can't solve that problem completely in this PR (which is fine, I'm all for trying to contain this), are those changes necessary ? Perhaps that part should just wait for the next round. As noted above, I'd like to propose this as iterative, with a second PR coming soon. I did this b/c it moved us toward not needing to pass around the walker. It minimizes the code that has access to the walker (as opposed to setting it after creating the instance of the Evaluator, etc. Yes, it exposes it for two methods, but those classes no longer hang on to it. I would like to ultimately remove this entirely. 3) To re-iterate testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields: the input file, noGenotypes.vcf, has a header dictionary with the full set of contigs, and a single variant from chr 1. Prior to this PR, the test executed and supplied b37_reference_20_21 as the reference FASTA. The variant in that VCF is from chr 1, not 20/21. The old code should have failed. It didnt, probably since it was preferentially taking the sequence dictionary from the VCF header and basically ignoring the FASTA. It didnt make much practical difference, but I believe my change here is right. I added the test case testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFieldsWrongRef to cover that error.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-747619130:1862,test,testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields,1862,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-747619130,4,['test'],"['test', 'testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields', 'testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFieldsWrongRef']"
Testability," and capturing/resolving these BND's that are not suitable for _THIS PARTICULAR_ logic. I guess in general my personal preference is to put less algorithm-related information in VCF for analysts (less reading for them), and produce add on files for tool developers. What's your thoughts?. > Does this even have to be a spark tool? It looks like you are just reading the variants into a parallel spark context, filtering, and then collecting them to actually process them. Why not just make this a non-spark tool and process it all in memory on one node?. Answer: Agree. It doesn't have to be, at least in theory, and it probably is going to be faster as we don't need to incur the Spark overhead for such a typically small job. But (I'm saying too many buts....) up to this point all SV tools are under the package `hellbender.tools.spark.sv`, so I'm following suit here. Note the two classes's main interface methods mentions nothing about RDDs (that's on purpose). ; On the other hand, this is an engineering question I believe, and it depends on whether we want to put as much of discovery code as possible into `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark` (the last commit actually hooks the two classes into it, so a single invocation of the tool produces more variants), or we go wdl in pipelining the whole process. -------. All in all, I think the comments and critics are generally about the ""filtering""/""classifying"" part, and the most serious concern about it is false negatives. Am I understanding correctly? If so, given that the filtering step is only picking the BND's that are suitable to the linking logic, I can imagine the false negative problem be solved in the future by other logics (e.g. more relaxed requirement on pair matching, or not even requiring matching INV55/INV33 pairs, etc.) In fact, that's what I'm planning on.; Another part of the problem is how much I can accomplish in this single PR, and how large it should be&mdash;the forever existing problem for new tools.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4789#issuecomment-406483929:6856,log,logic,6856,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4789#issuecomment-406483929,4,['log'],"['logic', 'logics']"

Testability," did not modify the javadoc for any class in that package. The integration test runs `com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute` and asserts that the output code is zero, which does not yield a useful error message. In order to produce something more meaningful I hacked the test to output the entire `stdout` and `stderr` as follows:. ```; final StringWriter out = new StringWriter();; final PrintWriter err = new PrintWriter(out);. final int result = com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute(""program"", err, err, err, ""doclet"",docArgList.toArray(new String[] {}));; err.flush(); // probably not needed; String message = out.toString(); // message contains the entire stdout and stderr of the call to execute; Assert.assertEquals(result, 0, message);; ```.

Comment by @cwhelan ; > I'm a bit confused by this comment: this method is still being called in several places, so how is it obsolete?. Reply by @SHUANG-Broad (also copied to update the ""TODO"" message; > this predicate is currently used in two places (excluding appearance in comments): `BreakpointComplications.IntraChrStrandSwitchBreakpointComplications`, where it is use to test if the input simple chimera indicates an inverse tandem duplication and trigger the logic for inferring duplicated region; and `BreakpointsInference.IntraChrStrandSwitchBreakpointInference`, where it is used for breakpoint inference. The problem is, the contig will not even be sent here, because `AssemblyContigWithFineTunedAlignments.hasIncompletePictureFromTwoAlignments()` defines a simple chimera that has strand switch and the two alignments overlaps on reference as ""incomplete"", so in practice the two uses are not going to be triggered.

Testability," pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above. I would hope that with more variants or reliable training/truth (as in your data), things might stabilize or line up better. I'll try running with more malaria data, as well. The following trios x sites heatmap (top plot) for the validation set might better illustrate the arbitrariness in F1 (click to enlarge):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385585-1a0dfe8e-d4b7-4770-aed0-19ad81162c92.png). Here, yellow = het errors (since these are supposed to be clonal malaria samples), red = Mendelian errors, grey = no calls, green = Mendelian consistency, white = reference. The second plot shows the training/truth positives used to train the model and to calculate the LL score in the validation shard. The third plot shows the ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives used to calculate F1. So we can see that the difficulty in deriving F1 as a function of the score along the horizontal axis to give the third plot lies in collapsing the columns in the top plot into a single condition positive or condition negative status. Again, hard to do so without some arbitrariness; I simply came up with some rules to convert various amounts of red, yellow, green, etc. in each column to a red/white/green status. If you're using a single gold-standard sample, this should definitely be more straightforward. In any case, the optimal validation LL score at ~0.02 does appear to line up quite well visually with where one might manually set a threshold. It corresponds pretty well with the transition from the yellow/red/grey junk to the clean green/white sites in the top plot. Here's the same for the test set:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385662-6693a6c9-709c-482f-9a7e-5bb7030b3383.png).

Testability," publish another artifact so we can move our projects forward. The crux of what I'm trying to achieve with these changes is for our VariantQC tool; however, I'm bumping into several situations where MultiVariantWalkers need to be able to determine the FeatureInput source of the variants. I recognize that this and my original PR #6973 has taken a non-trivial amount of @cmnbroad time, but we have basically been stalled with an otherwise approved PR since Feb 8. The PRs blocking that PR are this one and the related #7021. They both involve creating a way to connect VariantContext to FeatureInput - a capability that would benefit the GATK engine and I have been told by @cmnbroad you're interested in having. It seems like the primary problem associated with these changes is ensuring tests and VariantContext comparison code still works, since VariantContexts are going to tend to report a source. I dont know your internal conversations, so I'm guessing based on what's written in github. As I've said, I'd like to do whatever I can to get these changes into a form that takes as little of your effort as possible. . While this particular PR seems close, there is clearly some cleanup needed from what's there now, including code review from @lbergelson that no one ever fixed. Would it help if I put together #4571 and #7021 into a new branch where I also work through associated test changes and try to get this into one concise piece of code to review? Basically try to put everything together to be the minimal amount of work needed on your side? I havent heard anything one way or the other from GATK staff as to whether this would actually be helpful or not. Are there higher order design decisions that need to be considered that I'm not seeing? . I completely understand your time constraints - I'm just trying to figure out some solution that let's this go forward. Again, if we cant unblock this soon I'm going to probably fork GATK and need to start working off that project.

Testability," samples x 1000 intervals, I have verified determinism/reproducibility for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy COHORT/CASE modes, GermlineCNVCaller COHORT/CASE modes, and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors). Some remaining TODOs:. - [x] Rebuild and push the base Docker. EDIT: Mostly covered by #8610, but this also includes an addition of `libblas-dev`.; - [x] Update expected results for integration tests, perhaps add any that might be missing. EDIT: These were generated on WSL Ubuntu 20.04.2, we'll see if things pass on 22.04. Note that changing the ARD priors does change the *names* of the expected files, since the transform is appended to the corresponding variable name. DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls are missing exact-match tests and should probably have some, but I'll leave that to someone else.; - [x] Update other python integration tests.; - [x] Clean up some of the changes to the priors.; - [x] Clean up some TODO comments that I left to track code changes that might result in changed numerics. I'll try to go through and convert these to PR comments in an initial review pass.; - [x] Test over multiple shards on WGS and WES. Probably some scientific tests on ~100 samples in both cohort and case mode would do the trick. We should also double check runtime/memory performance (I noted ~1.5x speedups, but didn't measure carefully; I also want to make sure the changes to posterior sampling didn't introduce any memory issues). @mwalker174 will ping you when a Docker is ready! Might be good to loop in Isaac and/or Jack as well.; - [x] Perhaps add back the fix for 2-interval shards in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8180, which I removed since the required functionality wasn't immediately ava",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561#issuecomment-1847549285:2333,test,tests,2333,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561#issuecomment-1847549285,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability," the issue describing this (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7005) you had mentioned something about how GenomicsDBFeatureReader required a reference and wasn't sure if you were implying GenomicsDB would get that info from the reference. My understanding of `--force-output-intervals` is that it would cause the resulting output to have homref info if there is evidence in the gvcfs (maybe @droazen can clarify/confirm). As such, the fact that you are getting `N` as the REF would suggest that there is no call made for that particular site. In fact, you can see this in the test case you have here. While it doesn't reproduce the issue, if you examine the output vcf file generated by the test:; - Output contains `N` for `20:10-20` but that is expected because the input gvcf says as much for the first 9999901 bases; ```; 20 1 . N <NON_REF> . . END=9999901 GT:DP:GQ:MIN_DP:PL 0/0:0:0:0:0,0,0; ```; - If you instead change `--force-output-intervals` to `20:9999902-9999910` you will notice that the output file now contains those sites with the right bases and corresponding homref calls:; ```; 20 9999902 . T . . . DP=1 GT:DP:RGQ 0/0:1:3; 20 9999903 . G . . . DP=3 GT:DP:RGQ 0/0:3:9; 20 9999904 . T . . . DP=3 GT:DP:RGQ 0/0:3:9; 20 9999905 . T . . . DP=6 GT:DP:RGQ 0/0:6:18; 20 9999906 . A . . .

DP=11 GT:DP:RGQ 0/0:11:33; ```. Since you replied saying the test isn't reproducing the case you expect, maybe you already know all this - but just wanted to clarify that is the case. Having said all that, if you're still seeing a case where REF is `N` and you know the input should result in something else, can you share a small snippet of an input gvcf that illustrates the case? Since you were looking at specific intervals in the earlier issue, hopefully you can go back to the input gvcfs for that?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7018#issuecomment-755517894:1818,test,test,1818,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7018#issuecomment-755517894,1,['test'],['test']

Testability," we'd just want to let the user be able to specify the theano directory (rather than dump things in `~/.theano` unexpectedly). We should think about whether this should be opt-in, i.e., should we preserve the original behavior of using `~/.theano` by default?; > ; > @mwalker174 opinions? @droazen or engine team, thoughts on what the policy should be for python/R scripts doing this sort of thing? Is it generally true that the GATK leaves no trace, other than producing the expected output?. Dear samuelklee,. Thank you very much for you reply. I also found this problem last night. It seems that the problem is originally from Theano and Pymc3, rather than GATK 4.0. Some similar problems have been reported just like (1) https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/issues/1463 (2) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52270853/how-to-get-rid-of-theano-gof-compilelock and (3) https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/theano-users/eJ2vl2PUTk4. Last night, I have already tried to reset base_compiledir for theano, through two ways: (1) creating a ~/.theanorc file just like you suggested (2) modifying the file ~/.bashrc for my login node, by adding a line: export THEANO_FLAGS=""base_compiledir=/scratch/gatk-user1/z-Temp/z-Temp-Theano-$chr"". However, the truth is that, in our cluster, when I submit the 25 jobs (for each chromosomes), they are assigned to different computer nodes randomly. It means that I have to set THEANO environment variable for each corresponding random computer nodes respectively, which is quite difficult for me, as the nodes are random assigned. So, now I'm going to add lines like below to the ~/.theanorc in my login node, to see what will happen. Maybe It will work.; #######; [global]; config.compile.timeout = 100000 ; ######. However, I'm really appreciate it if some one in your team can help to add a function to specify a temporary directory for the theano directory, which can be bound to the corresponding node shared by other GATK threads. Thank you and Best regards.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6235#issuecomment-548557073:2210,log,login,2210,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6235#issuecomment-548557073,2,['log'],['login']
Testability," will be optimized separately for SNPs and INDELs. How about this for a first workflow to target?. 1) Run ExtractVariantAnnotations on a training set of chromosomes. You can keep training/truth labels as in Best Practices, for now.; 2) Run TrainVariantAnnotationsModel on that. We'll use the truth scores generated here for any sensitivity conversions---i.e., we'll be calibrating scores only to the truth sites that are contained in the training set of chromosomes.; 3) Use the trained model to run a single shard of ScoreVariantAnnotations on a validation set of chromosomes.; 4) Run some variation of the above script on the resulting outputs to determine SNP and INDEL score thresholds for optimizing the corresponding LL scores. We can also add some code to the script to use the truth scores from step 2 to convert these score thresholds into truth-sensitivity thresholds.; 5) Provide these truth-sensitivity thresholds to ScoreVariantAnnotations and use them to hard filter. Evaluate on a test set of chromosomes. If all looks good, we can later move steps 3-4 into the train tool and automate the passing of sensitivities in 5 via outputs in the model directory. This will let us keep the basic interface of ScoreVariantAnnotations the same, but we'll have to add a few basic parameters to TrainVariantAnnotationsModel to control the train/validation split. So I think all this branch is missing is step 5---we'll simply need to add command-line parameters for the SNP/INDEL sensitivity thresholds and then do the hard filtering in the VCF writing method highlighted above. Do you think you can handle implementing that in this branch, and then the rest at the WDL level? I can help with the python script for the LL stuff (or anything else), if needed. Not sure if you got a chance to check out what your collaborators are doing in the methods you're looking to compare against, but it would be good to understand if this basic scheme for train/validation/test splitting can be replicated ove",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1068345084:1014,test,test,1014,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7711#issuecomment-1068345084,2,['test'],['test']

Testability,"* _Large number of open file handles_: this was an issue in TileDB which got fixed as part of the restructuring that @nalinigans did for supporting HDFS/S3/GCS (#5017). I was too lazy to fix this again. If it's going to take some time for PR #5017 to be merged, I can submit a separate fix for this. This would fix any crashes/termination issues.; * _Performance of a single import process with a large number of intervals_; * Restating the obvious, but this is a single process (and by default, a single thread) with many intervals to import. As you increase the number of samples, this will become a performance pain point.; * More important than the number of intervals is the amount of data imported per interval. Each interval import involves opening the VCF files (loading index structures while creating FeatureReader objects), writing to TileDB/GenomicsDB. and closing the VCF file handles (destroying FeatureReader objects). If the amount of data written for each interval is sufficiently large, the cost of opening/closing the VCF files (creating/destroying FeatureReaders) is small relative to the total time taken.; * In the test cases I and Chris were trying, the amount of data written per interval was small (or 0 in many cases). The time taken in opening/closing the VCF files (and loading/destroying the index) dominates the total time.; * For a single import process (single thread), creating a large interval is better (or no worse) than passing several small intervals. TileDB/GenomicsDB has 0 overhead for regions with no data (for example, WES gVCFs). Having larger intervals will likely avoid issues described above. Hence, an advisory message will be beneficial.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5066#issuecomment-410576757:1137,test,test,1137,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5066#issuecomment-410576757,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"+1MOn Sat, Feb 28, 2015 at 1:14 PM, ldgauthier notifications@github.com wrote: It would be wonderful to be able to use SelectVariants with a query like -select ""AF > 0.1"" on a VCF containing multiallelics and have it filter multiallelics by the allele with the highest AF. (Possibly conversely for ""AF < X""queries. Right now it crashes unless you use a crazy JEXL or pull out the multiallelics. Maybe we could make a maxAF/minAF in htsjdk/JEXLmap.java which equals AF for biallelics?. Internally, it might be nice to have a Map with the AF (or AC) for each allele for the SelectVariants issue and to simplify some of the crazy logic already in VariantAnnotator to deal with different allele ordering. As part of this task, we should also make 100% sure that allele ordering is preserved so that AF/AC array ordering is preserved during VC reading/writing/manipulation. —Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/241#issuecomment-76543438:627,log,logic,627,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/241#issuecomment-76543438,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,".Main.main(Main.java:292); ```. ## Cases when the error does not occur; * If I rename `test a` folder in `test-a` as previously said.; * If I copy my current `test a` in the `/tmp/` directory (`/tmp/test a/`). This may suggest that the path length plays a role.; * If I renamed the VCF files (first VCF becomes `a.vcf.gz`, second `b.vcf.gz`) (`gatk MergeVcfs -I data/calling/a.vcf.gz -I data/calling/b.vcf.gz -O out.vcf.gz`).; * If I rename the first VCF file with as many `a` character as characters found in the original filename. (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.vcf.gz).; * If I rename the first VCF by replacing all alphabetical character with a (aaaa_aaaa2.aa_a7_1.vcf.gz); * If I introduce random `_` in the file name (aaaa_aaa_aaaa_aaaa.vcf.gz).; * If I rename the first VCF file by removing the first character (`cerc_prod2.SM_V7_1.vcf.gz` -> `erc_prod2.SM_V7_1.vcf.gz`); * If I rename the first VCF file by introducing a letter at the beginning (`cerc_prod2.SM_V7_1.vcf.gz` -> `ccerc_prod2.SM_V7_1.vcf.gz`). It really seems that the combination of the path lengh, white space and particular filename triggers this. I cannot get my head around this. I don't think this is coming from the content of the VCF as it works well in some cases. Let me know if you need me to make other tests. Fred. ----. ## Update. I investigated a little further after thinking about the tests I did. Because modifying the VCF filename did not trigger the issue and because of the presence of `tabix` related modules in the traces, I decided to see if removing `tbi` file will avoid having the error message. And it did!. After recreating the `tbi` file (`tabix data/calling/cerc_prod2.SM_V7_1.vcf.gz`), the error message appeared again. So it does not seem related to malformed index file. However, index file seems part of the problem. After renaming `test a` folder in `test-a` with the old or new index file, I did not get any error (as usual). Here is my tabix version in case:; ```bash; $ tabix -h.

Looks pretty negligible to me! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: Probably a result of the native code being called by the python/ML packages used in these tools; even minor changes in the compilers across Ubuntu versions might introduce differences like these. A quick fix might be to replace all system calls to `h5diff` in these tests with `h5diff --use-system-epsilon`; seems to do the trick here. But if that doesn't fix all test cases, then perhaps you can relax things with `h5diff -p EPSILON`, where `EPSILON` is a relative threshold. Probably OK to pick something like `1E-6`. OK if I leave it to you to try this or otherwise check the rest of the cases?. Sorry for the inconvenience! I think the exact-match test worked as intended here, but I probably could've put in better messaging originally. Unfortunately, it's a bit awkward to grab the output of system commands. And thanks for dealing with conda again (a necessary evil, unless we want to reimplement the entire field of machine learning in Java)! I'll experiment to see if I can't get the more recent version used in #8561 (23.10) working with the current environment---probably just some minor tweak to the pip version is needed to get around the error you're seeing. You could try unpinning it to see what gets pulled in. It would be great if we could get off",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8610#issuecomment-1848796931:1378,test,tests,1378,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8610#issuecomment-1848796931,2,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"1. We're only processing primary lines. If there are supplementary alignments we grab those from the SA tag on the primary line.; 2. These experiments all have a single amplicon, to which the reads are aligned. All contig names are equal. That there is just one contig is tested on line 681.; 3. That is tested on line 1653 and 1661. If the reference coverage isn't properly gapped the deletionLength could be driven negative, and we won't attempt the merge.; 4. Because that's where the unaligned part of the read is, the could be ""filled in"" by a supplemental alignment.; 5. It could've been a little larger. We're trying to make sure that it isn't something that BWA would've been happy to merge into a single alignment. Negative overlap lengths are possible, and accounted for. (A negative overlap is a gap.) Line 1644 takes Math.abs(overlapLen), so a gap larger than 2, or an overlap larger than 2 are both rejected. I'll fix up the other helpful suggestions tomorrow, after my presentation.

No, I have not examined the output files, but I have run the same app on my local machine with ; ```; spark-submit --master local[2] gatk-package-4.alpha.2-252-gf627ed4-SNAPSHOT-spark.jar PrintReadsSpark -I chr1.bam -O output.bam; ```; And the output.bam has nearly the same size in bytes as the output from the yarn cluster, so it doesn't appear to be truncated.

Testability,"4 [addAssemblyQNames -> getKmerIntervals] mapPartitionsToPair, then reduceByKey, then mapPartitions; * Job 5 [getAssemblyQNames] mapPartitions twice and a collect; * Job 6 [generateFastqs] mapPartitions and combineByKey, then write FASTQ to files. A few observations:; * Jobs 0,1,3 are simple map jobs - very quick 1-2 mins each.; * Job 2 is a simple MR, with a tiny shuffle to sum by key (<1MB of shuffle data); * Job 4 takes a bit longer longer (3min), and shuffles ~3GB. This is a lot faster than when I ran it before with less memory, when it took 9 min. Is it creating a lot of garbage? If you wanted to speed things up you might look at what this is doing on a local machine and see if there are any opportunities to improve CPU efficiency.; * Job 5 takes ~8 mins, and has no shuffle. CPU intensive processing again?; * Job 6 take a little over 3 mins, shuffling ~3GB. Overall, it looks like it’s performing pretty well. There is very little data being shuffled relative to the size of the input (~6GB to 133GB input), so it’s not worth looking into optimizing the data structures there. The input data is being read multiple times, so it _might_ be worth seeing if it can be cached by Spark to avoid reading from disk over and over again. This is only worth it if you have sufficient memory available across the cluster to hold the input (which will be bigger than the on-disk size) _plus_ enough memory for the processing, which as we saw is quite memory hungry anyway. There might be some CPU efficiencies to pursue, especially if some code paths are creating a lot of objects that need garbage collecting (as Jobs 4 and 5 seem to be). Jobs 4 and 5 seem to have some skew (judging from the task time distribution in the UI). You might investigate this by logging the amount of data that each task processes (or rather than logging, generating another output that is some description of the task data - or use a Spark accumulator), and then seeing if there's some way to make it more uniform.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2458#issuecomment-292171884:3162,log,logging,3162,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2458#issuecomment-292171884,4,['log'],['logging']

Testability,"80k is what I had easy access to and what I'm the most invested in; benchmarking right now. Master does fine with the same params. It's slow,; but no failures. We decided to split into 1000 shards (Eric is convinced; that there's a substantial startup cost per shard so we do better in total; cpu-hours on fewer shards) and each of those takes about 24 hours.

In versions of the code prior to #3752 (I think) this set of alignments was being filtered out by the method `isNotSimpleTranslocation` in the `parseOneContig` method of `ChimericAlignment`. Now that check's logic has changed and `isLikelySimpleTranslocation` returns false instead of true and so this alignment is not being filtered out any more. . When it gets to `NovelAdjacencyReferenceLocations.TanDupBreakpointsInference()` both `upstreamBreakpointRefPos` and `downstreamBreakpointRefPos` are being set to zero. It's not immediately clear to me how to fix this. A few thoughts:. - Are we supposed to be processing this `ChimericAlignment` through the main code path right now? ; - Why do we subtract 1 from the start position of the `rightRefe",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3874#issuecomment-347627504:2804,Assert,Assert,2804,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3874#issuecomment-347627504,1,['Assert'],['Assert']

Testability,"; Note that although the error log below says exome, this is a genome sample. I tried raising the ulimit to the same number this other user tried, but I still can get through BaseRecalibratorSpark. I've been trying for awhile to push this data through MarkDuplicatesSpark and finally gave up and switched back to the Picard MarkDuplicates. But even though I got through Picard MarkDuplicates I'm having problems with BaseRecalibratorSpark. I'm running in local mode with 250gb of memory and 128 cores available. . Is there something else for Spark that I can modify to prevent so many tasks getting created in stage 0.0? I'm running on a shared computing system, so it's quite possible that I can't change the ulimit number of open files. I am able to set ulimit -s unlimited, but I might not be able to set ulimit -n beyond a particular threshold on this system. I'll continue to explore the ulimit setting but I'd like to know if there's something else I could try instead.

Overwhelming evidence that a variant is rare _ought_ to make any genotyper more skeptical about it. Note that this will only lose variants with very weak evidence. As for the command line unification that @vruano suggested, I put in a few hours and it's trickier than expected. If we use `pnrm` then we have to add an instance of `AFCalculatorImplementation`, which would need a `Supplier<AlleleFrequencyCalculator>`. But unlike the old exact model `AFCalculator`s the new one knows the heterozygosity priors (needed for Dirichlet prior pseudocounts) and needs to get those in its constructor. But this would mean that `AFCalculatorImplementation` would have to know about the heterozygosity command line arguments which would would in turn demand that it be refactored as something other than an `Enum`.

Testability,"@Aqoolare You might, but there are scaling issues when running within a single java process which is what you're doing. There are issues with lock contention and garbage collection which cause more cores to not be utilized very well. (Lots of cores waiting while garbage collection stops the world, that sort of thing.). . You could definitely test it. We found that 8-16 cores was optimal for our use cases for running in spark local mode, but spark performance is extremely finicky and it's very possible your system might do better than what I'm used to. If you wantt to go very parallel it works better to run an actual spark cluster. You should be able to utilize cores more efficiently that way, but it's more complicated to set up and operatte and there are still bottlenecks that keep it from being infinitely scaleable. (IO bandwidth and network traffic being important ones). . There are lots of articles on the internet about how to set up a local yarn cluster that can help walk you through it if you want to try. .

Testability,"@AxVE Thanks for this PR. We really appreciate your interest and work on resolving this issue! It might take a little bit for me to get to reviewing it properly, we're currently preparing for our release and we're a bit swamped with various issues. I'm worried about changing the `userClassPathFirst` property. We added that a long time ago because it fixed some issues we were running into at the time. It's completely possible that we no longer have the same issue and it's a harmful remnant from a previous time, but I'm afraid that changing it might have unanticipated consequences in our own spark environment. Unfortunately we don't have good automated tests that would necessarily identify any issue. @cwhelan Would you be able to test your pipeline with - ""spark.driver.userClassPathFirst"" : ""false"" and see if you run into any issues? . I'm also a bit confused about why the change to the arguments is necessary. Clearly in your environment it is, but it goes against my understanding of how we set the arguments to spark submit, so I want to properly understand why the existing --deploy-mode arguments aren't working for you before adding an additional hardcoded argument to the launch script.

I think if we're going to include it we might as well just add it as one of our normal dependencies though. Assuming there aren't any dependency conflicts it **should** (always a risky statement) be independent from everything else. . Thanks also for identifying the different issues you mentioned. It's expected that it won't work with most picard tools as you discovered, but we're actively in the process of updating more of them too support Paths instead of Files so that will slowly improve. The second issue is more worrisome. We regularly use an equivalent provider with google to read reference files through the exact same code, so I suspect there is either some sort of mismatched assumptions in the way they are handling things. Maybe something strange with the Path.resolve methods or the like. (Or in in the much worse potential case a bug in their look ahead caching.). I'd like to look into that before we'd merge this.

Testability,"@EvanTheB You have a point, because the implementation of `logSumLog` (okay it's log10 but that's ugly so let's pretend we live in a parallel universe where the GATK uses only natural log) is (assume that `B < A` below); ```; log (10^A + 10^B . . .) = A + log(1 + 10^(B - A) . . .); ```; the accuracy of which could certainly be improved via the dedicated `log1p` method, especially when `B << A`. But accuracy alone doesn't necessarily address the issue. I mean, the results we're getting are like 10^-21 instead of 0. If the numerical answer is epsilon, the crucial thing is that epsilon must be negative, not that abs(epsilon) be minimized. Now, one could always truncated the (alternating) Taylor series for `log(1 + 10^(B - A) . . .)` at some fixed order that guarantees it's an underestimate, but first, even if that's the implementation of `log1p` it's brittle to rely on that; and second, it's not guaranteed that the leading term in dominant. Another alternative is instead of calculating the probability of all the non-variant (that is, hom ref but also het ref / span del and hom span del) genotypes add up just the variant genotypes and subtract those probabilities from 1. I hesitate to do this because it's less efficient when there are many alt alleles (there are many more variant genotypes than non-variant).

Testability,"@SHuang-Broad I see. So the conversion to SAM and back when we write the file actually changes the results (or at least their annotations). It makes me a little nervous that in one version of the pipeline the records go through `BwaMemAlignmentUtils.applyAlignment` and in the other they don't, since that method has some complex logic. Right now we have two possible paths:. `AlignedAssemblyOrExcuse -> SAMRecord -> writeToFile -> GATKRead -> AlignmentRegion`. or . `AlignedAssemblyOrExcuse -> AlignmentRegion`. What if we always converted to `SAMRecord`? It's a little more expensive but it would cut down on alternate code paths and conversion code, and IMO would make the code a lot simpler to read if I didn't have to think about which code path I was in. I'm also worried that the different conversions could lead to bugs that will be hard to debug since you have to know the code path that generated them. @tedsharpe what do you think?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2595#issuecomment-294168022:330,log,logic,330,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2595#issuecomment-294168022,2,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"@Tintest Sorry for the slow reply. I'm not sure exactly what the issue is. I've never seen this exact error before. . I have two guesses, one is that there's something really weird going on in spark that's causing that null pointer exception which is killing the heartbeat. I'm not sure how to debug that without your access to your input data . The other theory which I think is more likely, is that you're running out of memory and it's causing weird errors to occur. How much memory is available to your job? You can set the java -Xmx value with `--java-options ""-Xmx120g""` as a GATK option. I would check that you're not running out of memory on your machine, or giving the job too little.

To troubleshoot the GenomicsDBImport high memory issue my script have, I reran the script on chr1 to narrow down the source of the high memory issue. These are running on reblocked gvcfs. . 1. Without --bypass-feature-reader and -consolidate; 2. With --bypass-feature-reader; 3. With --consolidate without --bypass-feature-reader (This ended up on a node with 384gb.) The other ran on 256GB nodes. . Test 2 ran the fastest with the lowest memory requirements (Wall clock 76 hours); Test 1 ran slower and required more memory 40-50% of 256GB (Wall Clock 94 hours); Test 3 ran initially faster with less memory than test 1 but by batch 65 it was using 75% of 384 GB. This job has not finished and appears stuck on importing batch 65. So the consolidate option appears to have a memory leak or using just requiring too much memory. The -consolidate option was the culprit. So rerunning chr1-3 with just the --bypass-feature-reader option (test2) ran fine without lots of memory being used. Below is the time output from chr1.

Testability,"@bbimber Good questions all. Whenever we do these ports we have to strike a balance between minimizing the changes and updating to GATK4 standards. Generally, though, we want the code to conform to GATK4. This PR is large and likely to require some iteration so I'd be ok with starting with just the minimal ""porting"" changes to keep things simple, and then doing a code hygiene pass at the end. The ""porting"" changes should include things like updated javadoc, GATK4-style command line arguments, updating of outdated GATK3 terminology such as ""ROD"", Utils.nonNull assertions, etc. The finals and curly braces can wait for a separate pass (we will want to do those in this PR though). If you're not sure what to include or not just ask. I like the idea of keeping the GATK3 tests working as we go along. We should make a clear distinction between the old and new tests though. Ideally the GATK3 tests would be in a separate commit that we can just delete at the end, but that can get unwieldy if the files in the commit need to change as we go along. Alternatively you could isolate them into a separate directory. They should either be disabled or made dependent on a test method (see the `@Test` annotation properties `enabled` and `dependsOn`) that is easily toggled so they can be run locally, but don't run on the CI server. Otherwise the CI server build will always fail. In general, its really helpful to have the first commit in the PR contain the completely unmodified GATK3 source files. It makes it much easier for the reviewer to see what changed for the port. I noticed that you have 2 new plugins included in this. I'm not sure if that was suggested by someone on the GATK team (I'm wondering if we want to go down that path...) but I can tell you that the existing plugins required an enormous amount of test development and review iteration. If we do decide to make them plugins, I think it would be a good idea to do so in a separate PR.
