Testability,"@cmnbroad After thinking about this I went ahead and created VariantEvalEngine. Doing this in one PR will simplify some of the sticking points around what is a final change vs. what it expected to be fixed later. With this change, the goal is to strip most logic from VariantEval into the engine. This engine can be constructed with a VariantEvalArgumentCollection, and any kind of GATKTool as the owner. I tried to minimize the amount of context the VariantEvalEngine needed to hang on to. This means all the child classes have visibility on the VariantEvalEngine, but are no longer directly exposed to either the walker class or the argument collection. . All the logic around gathering the arguments to form DrivingVariants is moved to a static method in VariantEvalEngine. .

Seems to work locally, but let's see how the tests shake out. I also went ahead and unpinned the Java 11 version there.

This seems to work, but has the effect of altering behavior in some cases, described more above. In VariantEvalUtils.java I left some debugging code that illustrates the behavior difference that will occur. . 2) It is a fair question as to whether changing the behavior of what is or isnt considered an overlap is appropriate. For now I'm making changes as though it is, since it's sort of a fringe case and this is a beta tool, but it should be discussed. 3) There are ~6 tests with altered expectations, due to that change in detecting overlaps.

While I'll grant the 4th test case I added (where we pass chr 2) isnt especially compelling over just testing chr 1, one could argue more breadth is a good thing here. if you want clarity, pulling that VariantEval report parsing code into a method called extractUniqueContigsFromEvalReport(), or simply adding a comment line, supports this goal.

Testability,"@cmnbroad OK, considerable progress here. I was able to adjust behavior such that only two tests have changed behavior from GATK4/master. I think this is now correct. One instance of changed behavior is the Snpeff/overlap one we discussed above. The second is the one where we now provide the full genome as REF, not the truncated genome. I think this difference is justified since the tool now requires a reference, and the prior version was arguably too lenient on validation of contigs. Anyway, this branch now also removes by debugging code and comments. I think it is ready for a review. To some other questions you had above:. 1) The HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>> can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place. I realize that's non-optimal, but this isnt anything I introduced here. I would really like to keep this PR as limited as we can, and address some larger refactoring in a different PR, once we've migrated to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart. 2) I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me. If we can't solve that problem completely in this PR (which is fine, I'm all for trying to contain this), are those changes necessary ? Perhaps that part should just wait for the next round. As noted above, I'd like to propose this as iterative, with a second PR coming soon. I did this b/c it moved us toward not needing to pass around the walker. It minimizes the code that has access to the walker (as opposed to setting it after creating the instance of the Evaluator, etc. Yes, it exposes it for two methods, but those classes no longer hang on to it. I would like to ultimately remove this entirely. 3) To re-iterate testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields: the input file, noGenotypes.vcf, has a header dictionary with the full set of contigs, and a",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-747619130:91,test,tests,91,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-747619130,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"@cmnbroad The path to the c++ compiler can be specifically provided to theano by setting `theano.config.cxx` in python scripts, or by creating a `.theanorc` in the home directory, or by setting the environmental variable `THEANO_FLAGS=cxx=<path_to_g++>,...`. If a working c++ compiler exists and provided to theano, it is fair to assume that the graph _will_ compile. If the c++ compiler is not explicitly specified, theano will try to discover it. It first tries to execute `g++ -v` in the present environment and if it succeeds, it resolves the absolute path to the executable. On darwin, it further searches for `clang++` and on Win32, it looks for a working mingw gcc setup. We could _enforce_ the presence of a c++ compiler at the beginning of all python scripts and throw an exception and an informative message instead of numpy/python fallback. If we do so, the integration tests (and all gCNV CLI tools) will fail and will force the user to install a c++ compiler.

Testability,"@cmnbroad and I have both observed that the `SortSamSparkIntegrationTest.testSortBAMsSharded` tests fail locally on our machines despite the tests apparently working on travis. The tests fail because the comparator detects the files are out of their reported sort order. When I went digging into the failing tests it appears that the files are getting correctly sorted and written out correctly into 2 shards with proper names (`filename-0000` and `filename-0001`). After reading the sharded directory as input, it appears that the two files are read out of order. That is to say that calling `readsRDD.collect()` clearly places all of the `filename-0001` reads before the `filename-0000` reads. . After digging around it appears the problem might lie in Disq somewhere as it appears everything is working as expected until the `abstractSamSource.getReads()` line is encountered in `HtsjdkReadsRddStorage`. I suspect something is going awry with the filesystem mechanism for ordering the input files on our Macs that travis is sidestepping. .

See: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973/commits/1569a909d3dc2301337e46441cc0cd969843c8d1. The gist is that we now instantiate those classes and pass VariantEvalEngine. Two of these classes had validation in their constructors, and could throw a CommandLineException if the tool was executed with bad arguments. This exception was getting caught and re-thrown as GATKException with the misleading message ""Problem making an instance of ...."". This proposal is to make a separate VariantStratifier.validateArgs() method, with a default no-op validation, and to call this only after instantiation.

Testability,"@cmnbroad yes, i saw the conflict and will get to that and rebase. regarding test expectation changes: in a couple instances the genome territory number changes quite a lot. this is because I needed to switch the genome from the chr20-21 version to the full thing, since the input VCF has variants from other contigs. The old test probably should not have worked (the reference genome was basically ignored then). The biggest changes are in testSelect1.expected.txt and testStandardIndelEval.expected.txt. These changes are generally related to comp overlaps, and I am pretty sure all similar to my example above. To state another way: the tool as-is builds a whitelist of sites, by first identifying any variant overlapping the driving variants (possibly limited by -L). If a multi-site variant overlaps one of those sites, it expands the ReferenceContext. This means if the original variant was a single-base variant at 1423282, but is it overlapped by a large indel starting at 1423281, then the reference context is expanded accordingly. The problem is that the tool as-is then iterates these expanded reference contexts, and asks for every variant in the Comp VCFs that overlaps (defined as starts within) these expanded intervals, not limiting itself to the Eval variants.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-736096877:77,test,test,77,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-736096877,3,['test'],"['test', 'testStandardIndelEval']"

Testability,"@cmnbroad, that's not wholly unreasonable, but i'd like to push back on a number of these points. . 1) First - would GATK consider simply letting us take over VariantEval and maintain as a GATK4-based tool in another repo? My understanding from GATK4 issues is that plan was to never migrate VariantEval (i think in favor of other picard/gatk QC tools). There is a bit of a conflict between keeping a lean core engine and having all these tools built off it. I would think there's an argument for keeping your core engine and the many tools built off it separated (GATK3 seemed to include some dead tools, for example). I appreciate we're the ones pushing this migration, but I hope on the other side you can appreciate the bar is pretty significant on our time. . 2) What new plugins are you talking about? VariantStratification and VariantEvaluator are part of GATK3's VariantEval? Yeah, I wrote a base PluginDescriptor class patterned on how ReadFilters work. It probably should exist in a more core position in code. While there's some good ideas in the argument-parsing/plugin code of GATK/Barlcay, frankly seems like much of it isnt fully developed yet, which is why I kept this separated at the moment. . 3) Be aware, the GATK3 tests depend on ~30GB of files. I dont know the limits of git lfs, but I did not currently have plans to check those in. I assumed I would convert these to use GATK4 chr20/21 data for a final commit, but felt there was a lot of value in using unaltered GATK3 data to confirm parity (and it was during the migration).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-407123968:1235,test,tests,1235,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-407123968,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"@cwhelan . Thanks for adding the docs!. However, I still have concerns about three classes: `StrandedInterval`, `EvidenceTargetLink` and `BreakpointEvidence`. They seem to be tightly coupled, through an un-documented concept called ""distal target"" (not sure if people with more experience would immediately understand what it is, but it took me some time to grasp). . * My understanding is that a target in the ""distal target"" is really an interval that is spanned and/or suggested by a piece of evidence. The ""distal"" part is for representing mate of discordant read pairs, and non primary locations of split reads. Hence the first mention to distal target, in base class `BreakpointEvidence`'s methods `hasDistalTargets()` and `getDistalTargets()`, should document it. * By studying the possible arrangements of innies, outties, lefies and righties, the `strand` information stored in `StrandedInterval` could be understood, where upstream/downstream of possible event breakpoint location has 1-1 correspondence with the ""target""'s strand. (BTW, the doc currently for the class refers to a method called ""getStrand()"" in BreakpointEvidence, which I couldn't find). But using the word ""strand"" is confusing I think, and some example in the documentation/example in `StrandedInterval` is needed.; * `StrandedInterval` at its current state, is almost synonymous to ""distal target region"". I am not advocating that this to be done in this PR, but the BreakpointEvidence is so central to the logic (except the kmer acrobatics) that we should document it better.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3628#issuecomment-333680006:1489,log,logic,1489,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3628#issuecomment-333680006,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"@cwhelan . Thanks for the review!; I've incorporated most of your review suggestions, with the fowling exception because I need to think about what need to be done to make less review rounds. > This logic does more than detect variants, though.. it also annotates existing variants with the imprecise evidence. I'm also a little hesitant to move this all into its own separate class -- we really should be moving towards a model where we look at all three sources of evidence (breakpoint assemblies, imprecise evidence clusters, and coverage) simultaneously for eg @mwalker174 's work, and splitting handling of imprecise evidence into its own class seems like a step in the wrong direction. I agree. That's what I'm thinking about for complex inversions as well. So what about the following in this particular PR:. 1. move `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark.makeEvidenceLinkTree()` into `ImpreciseVariantDetector`;; 2. drop `ImpreciseVariantDetector.detectImpreciseVariantsAndAddReadAnnotations()` considering it really only delegates to `processEvidenceTargetLinks()`; 3. rename `ImpreciseVariantDetector` as `EvidenceTargetLinkHandler`; 4. reduce the work of `DiscoverVariantsFromContigAlignmentsSAMSpark.discoverVariantsAndWriteVCF()` into detecting only simple variants based on assemblies and name it `discoverSimpleVariants()`; 5. let `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark` call into `EvidenceTargetLinkHandler.processEvidenceTargetLinks()` to get back VariantContexts, then write VCF . `processEvidenceTargetLinks()` really does two things at the moment: annotation on breakpoints and call imprecise deletions; preferably, we should go the all-evidence-at-the-same-time approach and decouple the two but I am trying to not mess with it right now.

Testability,"@davidadamsphd Sure, here is a quick guide to the code:. -`BaseRecalibratorSpark` is the standalone BQSR tool, and calls into the `BaseRecalibratorSparkFn` (which is also called from `ReadsPipelineSpark`). -`ApplyBQSRSpark` is the standalone ApplyBQSR tool, and calls into the `ApplyBQSRSparkFn` (also called from `ReadsPipelineSpark`). -Integration tests for the above are in `BaseRecalibratorSparkIntegrationTest` and `ApplyBQSRSparkIntegrationTest`. -Almost all other changes in the branch are related to the BQSR engine refactoring, which I summarize below:; - We pulled out the guts of the walker `BaseRecalibrator` tool, combined it with all of the code from the former `RecalibrationEngine` class (now deleted) to make a new `BaseRecalibrationEngine` class under `utils/recalibration`.; - We stripped out all copies of the code in `BaseRecalibrationEngine` from the walker, dataflow, and spark versions of BQSR, and modified them to call into `BaseRecalibrationEngine`.; - We moved all auxiliary classes needed by the `BaseRecalibrationEngine` (eg., the covariates, etc.) into `utils/recalibration`.; - We refactored the argument collections. Now there is a single shared `RecalibrationArgumentCollection` that contains **only** the parameters for the `BaseRecalibrationEngine` itself, and this argument collection is exposed by all 3 versions of the tool. Input/output arguments have been removed from this argument collection and put into the individual implementations of BQSR, since they vary between the walker, dataflow, and spark versions of the tool. This eliminates awkward problems such as having both a `knownSites` argument AND a `BQSRKnownVariants` exposed at the same time, with only 1 of them usable for a given version of a tool. The dataflow-only `BaseRecalibrationArgumentCollection` has been deleted completely as no longer needed.; - We tweaked the names of some tool arguments to enforce consistency between the 3 versions of the tool as well as the rest of hellbender (eg.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/911#issuecomment-142340073:350,test,tests,350,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/911#issuecomment-142340073,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"@davidadamsphd passing through would work, but it's going to take some work. And if we have to do this for every single object that may be different between Spark and Dataflow, we may have more interface-redefining ahead of us. There may be another way. Perhaps we can use the name of the ""referenceset"" to distinguish the cases, as ReferenceDataflowSource has started doing. It's already the case that if you're using RefAPI, your reference name is going to be gg://reference/_some_id_. This is easy to distinguish from e.g. a Hadoop DFS path. We could use a similar mechanism for the mocks: perhaps have a special case in ReferenceDataflowSource that if the referenceset name is ""mock"", then it returns the static ReferenceDataflowSource.mockInstance member (that the test would then have to set up, naturally, just like it calls setInstance today).

Testability,"@davidadamsphd, @lbergelson, and myself met for an hour or two just now to discuss this issue, and after reviewing all the options I think we were convinced by the following argument:. The `SAMRecord` class currently allows its header to be set to null, so if there are cases where the class won't function properly or can enter into an inconsistent state when a header is not present these should be treated as bugs and patched, and we should add unit tests to htsjdk to prove that headerless `SAMRecords` function properly. Then in hellbender we can freely use headerless `SAMRecords` everywhere, only restoring the header to the record when writing out the final bam (since our bam writers do require that a header be present in the records, I believe). .

First off, this is very cool and I'm so glad to see this making it's way into HC/M2! It's super helpful for functional annotation/clinical interpretation. Thanks for working on this!. I had two thoughts which maybe belong as separate issues, but I figured I'd raise them here first and see what you thought:. 1. It would actually be useful to be able to combine this behavior with GVCF mode in some cases. I understand all the caveats about merging and joint-genotyping when this has been done, but there are use cases for single-sample calling where both GCVF and MNP mode combined would be useful. E.g. in a clinical setting it's very useful to have the GVCF with the reference blocks, and also call MNPs as MNPs. There would be no merging in this case. Any chance this could be allowed, perhaps with a warning or requirement that `--unsafe` be on?; 2. IIRC RBP would also phase combinations of `indel-SNP` and `indel-indel` in addition to `SNP-SNP`. I'm curious how hard it would be to apply the same grouping logic across indels as well? I tried to read the code in the PR, but honestly I don't think I understand the ramifications of including indels sufficiently well.

Testability,"@davidbenjamin : my read of the code is that yes, we would need to alter traversal. It is worth pointing out that GenotypeGVCFs already supports the ""--includeNonVariantSites"" argument, which is similar. The difference between what I propose and --includeNonVariantSites is that this new option would only output a site if present in the provided whitelist file. . I briefly looked at the guts of traversal - my guess is that we could do one of two things: a) make GenotypeGVCFs use some kind of MultiVariantWalker logic (not impossible, but more invasive), or b) traverse every site, but only output the site if non-variant or if present in the whitelist FeatureInput. The latter breaks some of the benefits of this over --includeNonVariantSites; however, at least it's not writing the output for most.

Testability,"@davidbenjamin @ldgauthier: in #6263 you added --force-output-intervals to GenotypeGVCFs, which forces the tool to output variants based on a whitelist of sites. I believe this exposed a pre-existing, not related bug. GenotypeGVCFsEngine.removeNonRefAlleles() currently assumes the input has only one alternate allele. If the gVCF has a site with 3 or more alleles, GenotypeGVCFsEngine.removeNonRefAlleles() isnt going to work as intended. If any NON_REF is found, it *should* remove ALT allele header lines and return the new VC with NON_REF removed. It currently only does this if ""newAlleles.size() == 1"", which I assume is a proxy for not having alternates. That assumes the input had only 2 alleles, which isnt safe. This PR includes a fix for this. When I started investigating this I made a repro case (the attached VCF) and test case in GenotypeGVCFsIntegration test that uses --force-output-intervals to illustrate this. Now that the actual problem is clearer, I could understand if you dont want to add more test data to GATK. .

Testability,"@davidbenjamin As discussed in person, it's my hope that the `AssemblyRegionWalker` changes in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/1ef09b3ca265209e0777c77a8519da74480908ce (which have now been merged into master!) will address `Mutect2` memory usage, and make these somewhat confusing new downsampling arguments unnecessary. That patch reduces the number of reads stored in memory at once by the engine by roughly an order of magnitude without doing any extra downsampling at all. I suggest that we do an evaluation to test whether this really resolves the issues you encountered. `Mutect2` is already hooked up to the new, lower-memory traversal code in the latest gatk/master, so all you have to do is re-run your benchmarking test. I'd suggest that you:. 1. Run with default settings in the latest master, and see if that alone does the trick!. 2. If not, try turning up the existing downsampling a bit. Eg., run with `--maxReadsPerAlignmentStart 10` instead of the default of 50. 3.

Testability,"@davidbenjamin I looked into this more. From what I can tell, when a site is polymorphic, GenotypeGVCFs is going to trim to found alleles. Under normal conditions, when a site is not polymorphic, it doesnt get output. When output is forced (--force-output-interverals or output-all-sites), then the VC is just output as-is. This PR initially fixed the bug in removeNonRefAlleles(). I think GenotypeGVCFs should also prune unused alleles. If the site is not polymorphic, by definition I think that means removing all ALTs? I just checked in a few tweaks:. 1) I switched from the original test gVCF data I added to use an existing gVCF from GATK. This has the advantage of containing actual callable sites, not adding new data, and contains existing multi-allelic sites. . 2) I added code to GenotypeGVCFs so unused alleles will be trimmed as part of removeNonRefAlleles. I could understand if you want to change the name of that method now. This is currently always true; however, I could see a rationale for making --retain-unused-alleles-from-force-output-sites as a command line argument (i'd argue to default to false).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6406#issuecomment-577859097:587,test,test,587,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6406#issuecomment-577859097,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"@davidbenjamin I made the changes you requested, plus some additional cleanup. Since this function takes a `normalizedTable` it only ever actually sees tables whose sums are less than 400. The smallest p-value we'd expect given that we can't have entries that are larger than 400 is around 1e-120. Therefore we don't actually have to take the log of the probability and normalize it, we can just take the probability straight from `HypergeometricDistribution`. We also don't need `relErr`. . Also given this, I didn't make the changes @lh3 described, although this would clearly be a good way to reduce the computation needed for calculating the p-value with larger tables. .

The current default in `Mutect2` for `--maxReadsPerAlignmentStart` is 50, which is almost certainly much higher than it needs to be. That's 50 * 300 = 15,000 reads per assembly region, with on the order of ~2 regions in memory at any time = 30,000 reads.

Testability,"@davidbenjamin I'm not sure I follow your logic. But if you believe the current implementing is doing the expected thing I'd like to understand. In the example above, the site is multi-allelic in the gVCF. However, when run through GenotypeGVCFs it's reduced to being bi-allelic, and the QUAL of the bi-allelic site in the genotyped GVCF doesn't change - it's still `595.64`. . To rephrase the issue - I find that if I run `GenotypeGVCFs -stand-call-conf 0.0` on that variant, it emits a variant with QUAL 595.64. But if I run `GenotypeGVCFs -stand-call-conf 100` that variant doesn't get emitted.

Testability,"@davidbenjamin I've significantly refactored the production code, see the last commit. Most of this refactoring was to done make the code for the accounting of different modes (SNP/INDEL/both x BGMM/python x non/allele-specific) more minimal and straightforward. I've also combined the score/apply steps using the TwoPassVariantWalker. There's still lots of documentation, cleanup, and hardening/validation to be done, but most of the key methods and design choices have been documented, so I think it could be worth a quick review at this stage. Again, no need to nitpick code-style details, etc. (unless you really want to!) In the meantime, I'm going to do some more testing/tieout to make sure the refactor didn't break anything. This covers ~1800 LOC, which is roughly 50% of the equivalent VQSR code. Even modulo the remaining work just mentioned, which may add a few hundred LOC, I think this is a decent improvement---additional functionality, stability, etc. notwithstanding!. There's stubs for adding the truth-sensitivity conversion you proposed---should be pretty straightforward.

Testability,"@davidbenjamin Thanks for the workaround in the 4.1.9.0 release!. I tested the updated `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` with `genomicsDBs` computed in 4.1.7.0 as above and it seems that the workaround recovers a lot of multiallelic variants that were already missing in 4.1.7.0. Using the record and variant counts in 4.1.7.0 as 100% reference, I'm getting 57% more records (all multiallelic) or 142% more variants. No sites from 4.1.7.0 are missing in 4.1.9.0. As a side note, all of the new records have `FRACTION=1` and most (90%) have `BETA=1,1;FRACTION=1`. Among shared records, all multiallelic sites also have `FRACTION=1` and almost always different beta parameter estimates compared to 4.1.7.0. As expected, biallelic sites are unchanged.

Testability,"@davidbenjamin commented on [Tue Jun 07 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/542). Calculating log gammas is an expensive part of the allele fraction model. We could speed this with negligible loss of accuracy by caching a few tens of thousands of values from 0 to 100 or 1000 and using linear interpolation. This issue can be closed by implementing such caching or by showing that it doesn't significantly improve performance. ---. @davidbenjamin commented on [Tue Jun 07 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/542#issuecomment-224329788). The JVM running on my laptop does 10 million log gammas per second, which is about three times as expensive as logarithms. The allele fraction model needs to calculate 4 log gammas per het, so if you have 25,000 hets all the log gammas in the model likelihood take 1/100 of a second. . To get MLEs for each parameter (minor allele fractions, outlier probability etc) might require 100 evaluations each, so we're probably dealing with 10 seconds of log gammas per iteration to find the posterior mode. Getting a few hundred MCMC samples is probably more expensive but roughly comparable. These numbers are manageable but get expensive when we relearn the model at every iteration of segment merging. In my opinion it makes sense to come back to this issue after we have a new segmentation strategy. We'll see how pressing it is then. ---. @samuelklee commented on [Wed Jun 08 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/542#issuecomment-224786950). To clarify, I think this is primarily an issue for WGS, where we have ~1.5 million hets. From the logs in /dsde/working/lichtens/wgs/out_case_chip_wgs/acnv/*out it looks like finding the MLE takes ~10 minutes (which is roughly consistent with your estimate), but 200 MCMC iterations takes ~1 hr. Naive profiling of the AlleleFractionModeller tests suggests that around ~60% CPU is going toward log gammas, so if we can improve on this I think it ",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2860:120,log,log,120,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2860,6,['log'],"['log', 'logarithms']"

Testability,"@davidbenjamin, et al. I have two recommendations:. 1) Though I prefer to work symbolically and through proofs, it might be nice to first expand on the validation by proof in the JavaDoc - including for the specific function's header - and anywhere else where necessary across the GATK code, just for sanity's sake, and for tying things together neatly and properly. This process of always going through the mathematical steps alerts me when I code that I have not missed anything. . 2) When dealing with multiple levels of transformations, it probably would be good to formulate a collection of complete set of simple tests. Since like you mentioned {phased} is a subset (⊂) of {unphased}, then the paths of phased genotypes one works with would also be ideal to test on. Does this function have any validation tests confirming the correct likelihoods, which would be performed for both phased and unphased genotypes? These can be generated tests, if original files do not exists.

Testability,"@droazen @davidbenjamin any thoughts regarding the last bullet above in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-891907471 on possible integration tests? Started looking at this today and was wondering if you might have any suggestions. Ideally, we'd want to test that the exposure was done correctly through the 3 affected tools: HaplotypeCaller, Mutect2, and FilterAlignmentArtifacts. I can certainly take the approach outlined above and 1) on master, pick one or more integration tests for each tool, then generate results by changing the original unexposed constants and running on the relevant test data, 2) on this branch, commit those new results, then add corresponding versions of the integration tests that change the exposed inputs and check against the results. However, not sure if we'll want to clutter the repo with more test files just for this sort of exposing of constants, and such tests don't really feel complete anyway. So alternatively, I could probably write a script to do essentially the same thing and just check consistency between the branches for a bunch of randomly generated SW parameter values, perhaps also running on more substantial test files for each tool.

Compression Level | Intel Deflater File Size | Intel Deflater % of JDK l=5 | JDK Deflater File Size | JDK Delfater % of JDK l=5; ---|------------|----------|---------------|---------; 1 | 54,840,445 | 175.23% | 38,543,684 | 123.16%; 2 | 35,782,642 | 114.33% | 36,745,494 | 117.41%; 3 | 34,989,899 | 111.80% | 35,262,326 | 112.67%; 4 | 31,815,698 | 101.66% | 32,549,560 | 104.00%; 5 | 31,240,892 | 99.82% | 31,296,433 | 100.00%; 6 | 30,675,174 | 98.01% | 30,577,906 | 97.70%; 7 | 30,379,699 | 97.07% | 30,380,325 | 97.07%; 8 | 30,124,200 | 96.25% | 30,124,375 | 96.25%; 9 | 30,064,322 | 96.06% | 30,064,325 | 96.06%. That does seem to suggest that the intel deflator at `level=2` produces a BAM that is smaller than the JDK deflator at either level 2 or 1, and if it is also faster in your testing, that sounds pretty good for intermediate files. It's still ~15% bigger than a `level=5` BAM though, so unless the vast majority of users are switching over to CRAM for storage, I'd hesitate to change the default compression level in any of the toolkits.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3413#issuecomment-323840661:261,test,test,261,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3413#issuecomment-323840661,2,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"

Testability,"@droazen I don't really have much of an opinion about the loggers. I think we chose log4j2 pretty arbitrarily and because it seemed popular. We don't have very complex logging needs so any logger pretty much satisfied our needs. . If there's a good reason to switch to SLF4J with a log4j backend that seems fine to me. It makes sense to use the more general solution so that people can use whatever backend they want. . I do know that we've encountered a lot of issues with having multiple copies of different logging frameworks included as transitive dependencies on spark. So there may be some hassle switching over, we'd have to run tests on google cloud to make sure we don't start crashing all of a sudden for logger related classpath issues. . @magicDGS I don't think anyone here cares that much about which logger we're using as long as it doesn't get in our way.

Testability,"@droazen I hacked one of the TrainVariantAnnotationsModelIntegrationTest cases to run in your Docker (only necessary because it seems like `gradlew test --tests *TrainVariantAnnotationsModelIntegrationTest` doesn't recognize tests that use a `DataProvider`, but perhaps I did something wrong).

Looks pretty negligible to me! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: Probably a result of the native code being called by the python/ML packages used in these tools; even minor changes in the compilers across Ubuntu versions might introduce differences like these. A quick fix might be to replace all system calls to `h5diff` in these tests with `h5diff --use-system-epsilon`; seems to do the trick here. But if that doesn't fix all test cases, then perhaps you can relax things with `h5diff -p EPSILON`, where `EPSILON` is a relative threshold. Probably OK to pick something like `1E-6`. OK if I leave it to you to try this or otherwise check the rest of the cases?. Sorry for the inconvenience!

Testability,"@droazen I think I see how #4801 could introduce a rounding error that creates an extremely small positive log10 probability, which triggers the error. The old code was ; ```; log10PNoVariant += log10GenotypePosteriors[HOM_REF_GENOTYPE_INDEX]; ```. and the new code to handle spanning deletion is; ```; log10PNoVariant += MathUtils.log10SumLog10(nonVariantLog10Posteriors); ```; where `nonVariantLog10Posteriors` includes but the hom ref posterior *and* the posteriors of ref / span del het genotypes. So instead of A, where A is the log 10 hom ref posterior, we have log10(10^A + 10^B), where B is the ref/span del het log10 posterior. This latter quantity should never be positive, but the `log10SumLog10` method it relies on doesn't know that and has finite precision. Given that the problematic number is truly miniscule, `2.559797571100845E-21`, my money is on that explanation. I think a reasonable solution is just to replace it by zero, because we know that's where it comes from. That is, the code should become; ```; log10PNoVariant += Math.min(MathUtils.log10SumLog10(nonVariantLog10Posteriors), 0);; ```.

WLOG `a < b`, so this comes out to `a + log10(1 + 10^(a - b))`. I believe we cache the values of `log10(1 + 10^(x)` over a finely-spaced grid and round `a-b` to the nearest cached `x`. .

Testability,"@droazen Thank you for the confirmation that HaplotypeCaller performs separate filtering passes on the read mapping qualities, and that the code on line 729 of HaplotypeCallerEngine.java (method ```filterNonPassingReads()``` ) is indeed executing subsequent to the ```MappingQualityReadFilter```. May I suggest, however, that MAPQ values less than 20 might not necessarily lead to an increase in FP variant calls? My understanding is that HaplotypeCaller uses MAPQ values only in a nonparametric rank sum test, in which case MAPQ is treated as an ordinal. This seems appropriate since the magnitude of a MAPQ value depends both on the data and on the computational model the read aligner uses to calculate it. With this in mind, a set of mappings with MAPQ in a lower range (e.g., ```--minimum-mapping-quality 10``` and a correspondingly lower ```--maximum-mapping-quality``` as well) might very well be appropriate for variant calling. So changing the semantics of ```MappingQualityReadFilter``` or parameterizing the currently-hardwired MAPQ range would enable additional control without affecting performance. @jamesemery I will watch for the HaplotypeCaller update that implements that functionality. And if you have a moment, could you please point me to the code that might be adversely affected by decreasing the low-end MAPQ threshold? I might have some ideas about that (or not!)...

Testability,"@droazen any thoughts how we should proceed here, if at all? @ldgauthier reminded me that this story was unfinished and is getting a little stale. @fleharty take note if we want to report progress on this front to our MalariaGEN collaborators. On my end, there are a couple of things to do:; - [x] rebase and resolve conflicts; - [x] change TSV input as discussed above; - [x] add doc strings for new arguments; - [x] add integration tests to make absolutely sure exposure was done correctly, perhaps? I'm open to discussion about how this should be done. Complete coverage here will be difficult and perhaps not worth the effort, but I can probably put in a few tests that make sure changing the hard-coded values in master and doing the same via the exposed parameters in this branch have the same effect on a few existing test cases. However, while I'm doing the last three, I wonder if we could run whatever canonical evaluations/optimizations we have to see whether it's worth consolidating some of the parameter sets at this stage? I think there's an argument for having at least two sets (haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype), but I'm not sure how to justify having a separate set for dangling heads/tails. But also not sure which set the latter should be consolidated with---@jamesemery thoughts? Again, let me reiterate that it seems that many of these parameter values were chosen arbitrarily (or, if not, that the procedure for choosing them has been lost). As a start, you can see the results of some optimizations I did on the CHM mix on slide 15 at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zGuquAZWSUQ-wNxp8D6HhGNjIaFcV0_X9WAS4LODbEo/edit?usp=sharing Here, I optimized over haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype SW parameters on various metrics after variant normalization using vcfeval.

In addition to this, there are several other tags used in Gencode v34 that were not present in v28.

This is the unfortunate price we pay for updating the Gencode datasource with the new datasources release. ☹️ . The issue you ran into is not exactly a bug, but an artifact of our data source release process. In order to test them, the data sources must be posted before the code changes to support them (so we can test the code against the data sources as released). Unfortunately there was no warning mechanism to users to let them know that newer data source versions are not yet supported (checks against older versions were already present).

Testability,"@jamesemery Back to you, at long last. I adopted your suggestion of a proper search that doesn't revisit already-seen vertices and came up with a better way of seeding the ""good"" subgraph that is safe from your STR concern. As far as code is concerned it's a total rewrite — you can pretend the first PR commit doesn't exist. The new criterion for seeding the search is chains with good log odds on both ends and which are incident on a vertex with multiple good out-edges or multiple good in-edges. The rationale is that the adjacency of two bad edges may have good log odds (Suppose a bad edge comes in and two bad edges come out. One is a new error on top of the original error and one is the continuation of the original error) but two have two outgoing edges with good log odds requires an actual real variant.

Testability,"@jamesemery sorry to bug on this topic, but I'm hoping to make a push early this year to fully migrate my lab off GATK3 . I looked more closely at the specific annotations we need to migrate. I decided that I will implement our walker, 'DiscvrVariantAnnotator', which is basically a light wrapper around VariantAnnotation. This will make it easier to spike in custom annotations. In that walker, I will override makeVariantAnnotations(). I will make a new marker interface for EngineAwareAnnotation, and test that on all the Annotation classes, and use this to inject FeatureManager. So no core GATK changes needed. I did find one thing I'd like to propose. You probably know PedigreeAnnotation is special-cased in GATK. Annotations that use it have automatic argument validation and have the SampleDB injected. Currently, PedigreeAnnotation is a subclass of InfoFieldAnnotation, so isnt available to GenotypeAnnotations. There doesnt appear to be a solid reason why. I tried to fix that and my best idea is the proposal here: #7041 . The core idea is to convert InfoFieldAnnotation and GenotypeAnnotation to interfaces.

Testability,"@jjfarrell @cmnbroad I tracked the problem down to htsjdk, see https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/1255.

When it gets a negative value it returns early, without filling the buffer. The end result is that the reference is not read correctly, hence the MD5 mismatch errors. The reason we haven't seen this before is that we've only tested on CRAMs with FASTA files that are less than 2GB (ones that don't cover the whole genome, or ones that are gzipped).

Testability,"@jjfarrell and @mlathara: thanks for running these tests and sorry I havent been able to do anything yet with our data. I'm under some grant deadlines until into Oct, but I do hope to add to this. A couple comments:. 1) that broadly matches my experience. 2) My sense is that we were caught between and rock and a hard place with GenomicsDb and GenotypeGVCFs. Our workflow until this summer involved creating a workspace (running per-contig), which involved importing >1500 animals at first. This would execute OK when using a reasonable --batch-size on GenomicsDbImport. However, when we had large workspaces that were imported in lots of batches, GenotypeGVCFs (which we execute scattered, where each job works on a small interval) tended to perform badly and was a bottleneck (i.e. would effectively stall). Therefore we began to --consolidate the workspaces using GenomicsDBImport during the append process. Initially --consolidate worked; however, as @jjfarrell noted, that's memory intensive and once our workspace was a certain size, this basically died again. Therefore we even worked with @nalinigans to their the standalone GenomicsDB consolidate tool. This was a viable way to consolidate the workspaces and we successfully aggregated and consolidated all our data (which took a while). However, these massive, consolidated workspaces seem to choke GenotypeGVCFs. Therefore this process is still basically dead. 3) As I noted above, I'm currently giving up on trying to maintain permanent data in genomicsDB. There's so many advantages to not doing so, and letting the gVCFs exist as the permanent store. Notably, there are many reasons we would want/need to remake a gVCF (like the introduction of reblocking). Whenever any one of the source gVCFs changes, the workspace is basically worthless anyway (which is a massive waste of computation time). We've had great success running each GenotypeGVCFs scattered, where each job runs GenomicsDbImport on-the-fly, to make a transient workspace",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1256246852:51,test,tests,51,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1256246852,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"@jonn-smith @LeeTL1220 @droazen Thanks for sharing the information above, and I looked at it. It seems to me that once we have a chain file for one reference and another reference, the remaining steps are straightforward. I also noticed the following Picard utility [Picard LiftoverVcf]( https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#LiftoverVcf ) that can Lift over a VCF file from one reference to another. ; Therefore, creating the chain file between a pair of references (and limiting ourselves to cases where both references are from the same species, mouse/human) is the key. To that end, according to the following post [List of chain file creators](https://www.biostars.org/p/65558/) most of the chain file creation tools are available as a web interface. However, the UCSC one seems to be more popular, and fortunately, they have the utilities as open source and to some degree explain their steps in the [LiverOver_Howto](http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/LiftOver_Howto) link you sent. With this approach, they first BLAT the pairwise contigs in the reference files and then use the utility DoSameSpeciesLiftOver.pl. . Based on this, it appears to me I should think about the following steps:; a) First, try out their code (UCSC) and make sure it works to produce chain files for two references successfully.; b) Design/propose a solution putting the logic in DoSameSpeciesLiftOver.pl into GATK, which also might need a BLAT run .

Testability,"@jullee . 1. Yes, running in mitochondria-mode is somewhat like running in tumor-only mode because you don't have a matched normal. We have found that the false positive rate is very reasonable and comparable to other tools for mitochondria (including HaplotypeCaller). Your latter point (we're looking for calls at various allele fractions) is exactly why we chose to use Mutect instead of HaplotypeCaller. 2. I don't think we can currently output bp resolution reference confidence in Mutect2. There is development being done to allow Mutect to output a GVCF (which would give you reference confidence) but this is still a work in progress. You might be able to use the ""Genotype Given Alleles"" argument to force Mutect to output qualities at each base, but I haven't tested this at all. 3. We found that value for --min-pruning by looking at whole genome sequencing data. Both HaplotypeCaller and Mutect do a local reassembly at a potential variant site. This reassembly builds a graph where each path is a potential haplotype. The min-pruning argument tells you how many reads each path needs to have in order to be considered (otherwise it is pruned from the graph). By default this value is 1 which makes sense for 30-60X data, but if your coverage is very high (which it usually is for mitochondria) the graph will be too messy due to errors unless you turn that argument up. Because the depth is so high, you need more evidence to be sure a path in the graph isn't just noise. 4. The ploidy argument isn't used by Mutect2 because it is always looking for variation at arbitrary allele fractions. If you are instead using HaplotypeCaller you would need to change that argument either to 1 (this would only allow you to call HomVar sites) or as high as you need to get desired resolution. In other words if you want to be able to call sites at 1% allele fraction, you will need to set the ploidy argument to 100 if you are running HaplotypeCaller. Mutect2 will look for sites at all allele fract",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5193#issuecomment-432645864:770,test,tested,770,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5193#issuecomment-432645864,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability,"@kcibul reports that if the CNNScoreVariants python code throws an exception during async batch processing, the GATK tool hangs (specifically, it was happening when GATK was sending a . for a missing annotation, and the python code was trying to interpret that as a number and blowing up). It looks like this happens because `StreamingPythonScriptExecutor::waitForPreviousBatchCompletion` waits for the async write thread `Future` to complete first, before checking the fifo for an `ACK`/`NCK` (which is when the exception would be propagated). If the async write thread is blocked because the fifo is full because the python code isn't retrieving data because an exception was thrown, the java side will hang waiting for the `Future` complete. The solution is to reverse the order of the `waitForPreviousBatchCompletion` checking (ack first, then validate that the async write `Future` completes). There is a [branch]( https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/cn_async_python_exception) with a test and a fix for the StreamingPythonExecutor, and a [separate branch](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/cn_cnn_exception) with a test for CNNScoreVariants that also has the executor fix.

The test in the PR was super useful as a temporary test, but as you mentioned it runs pretty slowly, and as it stands the test passes on current master anyway.

Also, the user who originally reported the issue was using 11k intervals, and it seems that the stack overflow fix is unlikely to help in that case.

Testability,"@lbergelson @KevinCLydon This branch now passes all tests, is rebased onto the latest master, and is (finally) using the official GATK Python environment rather than the custom NVIDIA-provided one. I had to add two additional Python dependencies to our environment, and make some small modifications to the Python code to account for a newer version of pytorch-lightning that was required. The final outstanding issue in this PR is that I had to temporarily comment out the Jacoco coverage report code in our build.gradle and dockertest.gradle files, due to a bizarre problem where Jacoco was attempting to read/parse the new Pytorch model files added in this branch. This will have to be resolved before we can merge (or we might have to permanently disable Jacoco if it can't be...).

GenomicsDB interfaces use these JSON files today which contain input configuration, list of samples, mapping between sample IDs and TileDB row indexes and stream ids for the input VCFs.

Testability,"@lbergelson I added the ClassLoader fallback code in to `GATKPathSpecifier`.

So I updated the tests to use `GATKPathSpecifier` (they all passed), then integrated the fallback code and changed 3 negative tests that went from FileSystemNotFoundException to ProviderNotFoundException.

Testability,"@lbergelson I just tested with one of our variants in the test suite for HaplotyeCaller (specifically `20	10098219	.	TATATATA	T,<NON_REF>`) and its definately the case that HaplotypeCaller will still output that variant even if you place the -L interval boundary inside the variant (like say at `10098221`) but it will fail to call that same deletion if you make the start of your interval anything but the first base of that deletion. . The HaplotypeCaller has its own filtering at Haplotype->Allele->Genotyper layer that restricts it to only calling alleles that START within the active region (excluding padding) which makes it impossible to output deletions starting before the provided intervals even if they overlap into the specified region. The HaplotypeCaller will however output deletions that go past the end of the provided -L intervals so long as they begin within the intervals in question. The HaplotypeCaller is hopelessly fickle and everything within a few thousand bases of the edge of the calling intervals is subject to start-position/calling failures and any given site may or may not disappear to assembly failures when close to the edge. Adjusting these settings at the VCF writer level could prevent the latter case from occurring (by filtering them with some strict setting to prevent deletions from overhanging the end of the -L region) but it cannot ever allow the former case to exist (that is to say it will never force a deletion from a few bases before the interval to be called by HaplotypeCaller since it will never send that allele to the genotyper under any circumstance). ; ; I would say that your branch adds an entirely new and subtle way for users to get confused about what the HaplotypeCaller is actually doing under the hood and why they did or didn't see a particular variant so we should tread carefully.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6339#issuecomment-908689670:19,test,tested,19,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6339#issuecomment-908689670,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"

Testability,"@lbergelson No, I've never seen this issue locally. Declaring the encoding rather than leaving it to the platform sounds like a good idea, but if we declare it to always be UTF-8, these non-ASCII UTF-8 chars would be allowed in the source and javadoc (although I guess thats happening now anyway). Other than the rare case where we deliberately need non-ASCII chars for test purposes or such (like I recently needed in the htsjdk VCF 4.3 PR), it would be nice if we could keep them out of the source, especially for cases like this where the displayed glyph is hardly distinguishable from the intended one.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5936#issuecomment-492758643:370,test,test,370,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5936#issuecomment-492758643,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"@lbergelson So, the test failures are in `ScoreVariantAnnotationsIntegrationTest` and `TrainVariantAnnotationsModelIntegrationTest`, when run within the conda environment in the new docker image. I've confirmed that they happen with both Ubuntu 22.04 and 20.04. They are assertion failures from `h5diff` indicating that the actual outputs did not match the expected outputs, so there are likely actual numerical differences here. Most likely the newer Ubuntu releases are shipping with newer versions of native libraries that HDF5 (or some other GATK dependency) depends on, and there was some breaking change somewhere along the line. .

Testability,"@lbergelson, @akiezun AFAIK picard tools need you to specify specifically FLAG=true/ FLAG=false if it's a boolean flag. it is true that, if you want, any argument can have a default value (true or false) but to change it you will still need to assign true or false (i.e even if there is a default you cannot simply have FLAG on the commandline). Yes, the logic of the pipeline specifies all the commandline arguments, regardless of defaults so that if the defaults change (which the GATK used to do all the time!) the pipeline will not change.

Testability,"@lbergelson, I don't think that this solution will help in this case, because another error when trying to use `CommandLineProgramTest`is that it extends `BaseTest`, which loads directly a `GenomeLocParser` for a reference that is not present and it blows up in every test. Regarding the `Main` class, because you point it out here, I would like to have some control over `Main` and how it manages things like errors or logging header. Basically all the things that I'm facing at the moment are, apart of this error using the testing framework, is that the framework have tons of mentions to the GATK itself (error messages pointing to the GATK manual page or bundle tools), and little control over which of them should be expose to the final user.

Testability,"@lbergelson. Our simple s3 nio library is not currently open source, but we would be willing to make it so after testing it properly. We found that to get the s3 nio library work with GATK, a few minor changes needed to be made in the GATK source. This is especially true for the spark tools because, on AWS EMR Spark clusters, s3 uris can be treated exactly as if they are HDFS uris. Therefore, it was not quite as simple for us to just add the s3 nio library to the classpath and have everything work as expected. For that reason we put the project on hold until GATK is closer to release.

Testability,"@ldgauthier @davidbenjamin . I now have added in setting the genotype as phased (using a pipe) as well as upgraded htsjdk. The tests need updating, but it's easier to see what breaks then fix than run the tests locally! But please see if you agree with the rest of the PR while I update the tests manually. A few notes on the various tools related to making the genotype phased:. 1. Both `HaplotypeCaller` and `Mutect2` support the `--do-not-run-physical-phasing`, so all this can be turned off by the user. I am not going to add another command line option as this may confuse the user.; 2. `FilterMutectCalls` uses the `Mutect2FilteringEngine` internally. It does not look at the order of the alleles in the genotype (`GT` FORMAT field), but does look at the various other per-allele FORMAT fields (ex. `AD`, `AF`). Fortunately, I do not change their order in this PR as suggested by @ldgauthier.; 3. As @ldguathier note [in this comment](https://github.com/nh13/gatk4/pull/1#issuecomment-433970809) and [in this comment](https://github.com/nh13/gatk4/pull/1#issuecomment-433986488), that VQSR and Sam F's work do not look at genotypes either.; 4.

Testability,@ldgauthier @davidbenjamin please take a look. . Don't allow the number of lines changed intimidate you... (most are in test resource files). The first commit contains the actual main code changes. . The second and third commits update the test resources (where most of the changed lines come from) and test code. . The very last commit changes the default radius to 2... I was planning to set it to 0 since it is more parsimonious (less complex configuration) but it may well affect sensitivity and certainly changes the PL/QUAL values so I guess set the value two the current 2 (for PLs) is a safer and more conservative approach until we evaluate what is the optimal value for this parameter. . Perhaps @davidbenjamin would like to have a different default for Mutec. This is last minute change and may break some of the integration test so bear with me if that is the case.

Testability,"@ldgauthier I think at some point we removed example JSONs in both the CNV and M2 WDL directories. I believe the reasoning was that those JSONs were mostly non-informative templates that could just as easily be generated with `womtool inputs`; since they were also not tested (in contrast to the JSONs used by the Travis WDL tests), they had to be kept in sync manually. @davidbenjamin @LeeTL1220 can correct me if I'm wrong. In contrast, providing Jack's hyperparameters for WES via JSONs will actually be informative! However, we will inevitably run into some issues touched upon in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4719. I agree that it would be desirable to set some default WES/WGS hyperparameters in the featured workspace. However, I hope this wouldn't require two separate workspaces for WES/WGS or any shenanigans like that. Ideally, this sort of thing could be covered at the tool level with argsets, as mentioned in that issue. @droazen any updates there?.

Testability,"@ldgauthier I think it's probably best to try and get to the bottom of why this variant's qual isn't being adjusted as it's reduced from 7 alleles in the gVCF to 2 alleles in the called VCF. This is, as you guessed, all single-sample. I've attached a reduced gVCF that just includes the variant in question, and the resulting genotyped VCF from running the command line below (and their indices) ; [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/3059414/gatk-5793-testcase.tar.gz). ```; gatk GenotypeGVCFs \; -R /Work/refseq/hg19/hg19.fasta \; -V HG02568.g.vcf \; -O HG02568.vcf \; -L chr11:6637700-6637800 \; -stand-call-conf 30; ```. A few observations from running the above command but varying the `-stand-call-conf` at that locus, all performed with GATK 4.1.1.0:; - Running with `-stand-call-conf 30` results in a reduction from 7->2 alleles but no change at all in QUAL; - Running with `-stand-call-conf 0` results in the same genotype and QUAL, but another allele squeaks through even though it's not referenced in the genotype; - Running with `-stand-call-conf 100` results in no variants being emitted. Circling back to one of my original statements, I believe the least confusing way for this to work would be to think of it this way:; - If you run with `-stand-call-conf 0` you should see all variants; - If you run with `-stand-call-conf n` you should only lose variants that were previously emitted with `-stand-call-conf 0` that had QUAL < n.

Testability,"@ldgauthier Tests are still failing because I haven't updated test vcfs. Before I do so could I get your opinion? Here's a summary of the rationale behind each commit:. * fa34758 When we get to `realignReadToBestHaplotype` we have discarded bases outside of the assembly region but we still have hard clips in the read Cigar. This change forces us to keep those Cigar elements after realigning to the best haplotype so that we know how far past the assembly window the read extended.; * 6af7ad4 After the above change, `BaseQualityRankSum` was liable to look for discarded bases in the hard-clipped part of the read. This fixes that.; * 952d217 The `Clipping` annotation doesn't do anything. It counts the number of hard clips, but pre-this PR there are no hard clips because those bases don't get realigned to the best haplotype and post-this PR the ""hard clips"" are just bases outside the assembly region. As a placeholder I'm setting it to zero (note how this doesn't break any tests!) but really I think we should just get rid of it.; * This PR introduced some off-by-one errors in the depth annotation (but not the ADs). While looking into this I found an apparent bug where some reads that don't overlap a variant get counted in the depth. The issue was that we were counting clipped bases in the overlap. I don't think this is correct because by this point in the code we have unclipped soft clips and gone through local reassembly. Therefore, anything clipped here is a part of the read we truly don't believe belongs anywhere near the assembly region. This change alone breaks the tests with a few off-by-one DP fields.; * 8c51c0a Uses hard clips in the Cigar to correct read position annotations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4956#issuecomment-400755806:12,Test,Tests,12,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4956#issuecomment-400755806,4,"['Test', 'test']","['Tests', 'test', 'tests']"

You'll notice that both `GT` and `PGT` have phased genotypes. And in the case of samples with a homozygous genotype, the `PGT` has an incorrect heterozygous genotype. Going back and looking more closely at the test files that I updated, I also see where the `GT` is `1|1` that the `PGT` is erroneously heterozgyous. In talking to @nh13 about this, he pointed me at a section of code in `AssemblyBasedCallerGenotypingEngine` that purposefully sets the genotype to either `0|1` or `1|0` with a long note on line 512 that this is on purpose and that it'll get ""fixed"" later. Evidently that's not happening on the code path in `HaplotypeCaller` that generates a VCF as opposed to a GVCF.

Testability,"@ldgauthier this finishes what we started in #4858 and is necessary for the pileup-calls-on-bamouts MC3 validation. The cause is the same, in that Pair-HMM has a tiny bias in favor of shorter haplotypes and thus it prefers deletion haplotypes when reads end inside STRs. In #4858 we broke near-ties in favor of the reference; this PR fixes the case where two alt haplotypes share a SNV and one of them has a spurious deletion. One important sanity check was that when I set `cigarTerm` to zero in `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils.java` no tests broke. This means that the refactoring needed to set up the change didn't affect behavior. I looked at most of the sites where `PL`s and/or `DP`s changed in the integration test vcfs and in every case the difference was from a fake deletion that this PR fixed.

Testability,"@ldgauthier, @meganshand and I discussed whether we might want to switch from the one-sided p-values currently calculated by ExcessHet to mid p-values (which are used in the Hail implementation, see also https://www2.unil.ch/popgen/teaching/SISG14/Graffelman_Moreno_SAGMB_2013.pdf). She said you probably should make the call. As discussed by that reference, there can be significant differences between one-sided and mid p-values. However, since this PR already introduces differences between the old one-sided p-values and the corrected one-sided p-values, perhaps we want to go a step further and just switch over? Advantages would include consistency with Hail, as well as better power and type-1 error rate, at least according to that reference. But the test would no longer be specific to *excess* heterozygosity, which might not be desirable. I would also be curious to see what differences the correction or the switch would have in practice, given that the filter threshold is relatively conservative.

Testability,"@lucidtronix @mbabadi @samuelklee I think the best solution would be to establish a single, common Python environment, with a single set of dependencies, that all GATK Python tools depend on. We would establish a single docker image that has all of these dependencies pip installed, and could also include a conda env for the GATK environment for users who don't want to use the docker image. If we could do that, it would eliminate the need load per-tool conda environments. From what I've seen so far based on existing branches, the two environments we need (gCNV and CNN-VQSR) don't look that far apart in terms of dependencies. gCNV is using Theano, and CNN Tensorflow, but the rest looks [pretty close](https://docs.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/spreadsheets/d/1RV7--uBQ0ctlXzMH09cmr0VimpZYIU68DdxJzE60y-c/edit?usp=sharing). So a strawman proposal for the main components for a common environment would be:. Python 3.6; Numpy >= 1.13.1; Scipy 1.0.0; Theano .0.9.0; Tensorflow 1.4.0; Pymc3 3.1; Keras 2.1.1.

Testability,"@magicDGS My apologies for the long delay on this.

There is also the bigger issue of testing and validation - ideally at a minimum we'd reproduce the existing GATK3 tests, but since these are dependent on large, private files, those tests will have to be replaced with new tests, and validated/compared against GATK3. These same issues will come up with IndelRealigner. @vdauwera @sooheelee Even with @magicDGS graciously volunteering to do the work of porting the code, retaining the indel realignment tools will require internal review, helping with test development and validation, and support.

Testability,"@magicDGS Overall, the documentation changes are good. A few more minor comments: ; - If these are classes that are really pegged to the usage of LIBS, then you may want to mention that in the javadocs for the class. A comment along the lines of ""these classes are fairly low-level, developers should probably confirm that their changes do not belong in a higher-level calss such as LIBS"". ; - I am okay with an informal test of the speed, even if you just look at some logs. From the review, it looks like behavior of higher-level API calls will be unchanged. >I think that because the LocusIteratorByState is already splitting by sample, that can improve even more performance, because it will come directly in the state where it can be used by-sample in an efficient way. And maybe, if the tool does not require to split by sample at all, we can add an option to disable that behavior while creating the tracker. Agreed. I do not think you need to worry about the flag, for now. If you'd like, file an issue, but I think it is low priority for us. I tend to be worried about new developers or contributors getting lost in the codebase. And many do not have experience w/ GATK3. Hence, the documentation about when to use the class and why it exists. A couple additional things:; - I found a typo (see my comment); - Can you document the `presorted` parameter?

Will you be altering the base data I provide towards these other tests or are we focused just on the primary functionality?

It would be helpful to also see the previous test data if its features are what we want to recapitulate. If we are instead making up new tests, then that is fine too. Since you bring up nwayout, it seems the test should accommodate two samples. I was thinking to make alt-ware mapped GRCh38 snippets that included ALT/HLA contigs, just to cover our bases.

Testability,"@magicDGS, after much discussion with @droazen, we will make this test set even smaller. Also, the current test set will be temporary, to unimpede you, until updates to the main test set can be made (discussion to start next week). @cmnbroad says we need to keep an eye out for coverage in the tests, given the need to make this dataset extremely small. So I removed chr17 from the mini-reference, such that only four small snippets of reference from various chromosomes remained. However, it appears there are only two usable indel realignments going on with GATK3. Note thate these are targeted exome samples with comparatively low coverage. [for_magicDGS.zip](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/1820785/for_magicDGS.zip). There are two samples, so as to enable testing nWayOut, and an artificial reference `hg38_Shl01`. The two sites to hone in on are chr11:177568 and chr11:207134. Note also that the BAMs are in an invalid state according to ValidateSamFile. However, GATK3 RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner did not seem to mind. I think these tools should allow processing of BAMs in any validation state. Apologies for the meager state of the data. On the bright side, the data set including the ref is only 23MB and will meet with @droazen's approval in terms of size. .

Testability,"@magicDGS:. 1. Yes, you're right that you're already correctly testing that you get the right number of shards back. No need for an extra assertion. 2. I think that realistically-sized reads (of differing lengths!) does add to the unit test, since it's important to test with reads that overlap extensively with other reads. You'll also want to vary the read lengths to test with reads of different lengths at the same start position, shorter reads that start after longer reads, and any other arrangements that are significant to your `ShardingIterator`. . It shouldn't be too difficult to write a simple method that uses `ArtificialReadUtils` to create small pileups of reads within a given interval (might be worth extracting into `ArtificialReadUtils` itself so that future tests can use it).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4682#issuecomment-389998139:63,test,testing,63,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4682#issuecomment-389998139,6,"['assert', 'test']","['assertion', 'test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"@magigDGS There are 4 separate issues in here, and I have slightly different feelings about each of them. Some comments:. - Removing the RNA string seems fine.; - I deliberately left the GATK test program group in because even though there is a Picard one, its harmless, and easier for people to find.; - I have reservations about exposing and sharing the super category maps. The Picard docgen process is pretty much unused and unmaintained at this point. The `getSuperCategoryMap` mthod really shouldn't be public, and it may even be removed in the near future. The GATK supercategory map ""truth"" should be defined by GATK.; - I'm reluctant to make the GATK `getSuperCategoryMap` public, because I don't think it can have any kind of useful contract. Its tied to the GATK doc templates and doc process, which we need to be able to change freely. It seems much safer for ReadTools to define it's own set categories (the overlap would probably pretty minimal I think - maybe just ReadFilters, right ?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4247#issuecomment-360832234:192,test,test,192,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4247#issuecomment-360832234,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"@mbabadi @samuelklee The PythonScriptExecutor, which is based on the same underlying code as the RScriptExecutor, redirects the child process's stdout/stderr to an anonymous pipe, and then swallows anything written there without propagating it, unless the process exits with a non-zero exit code.

But it's more complicated to use, since its not one-shot, synchronous command execution.

Testability,"@mbabadi I've updated my PR to use miniconda3. @mbabadi @lucidtronix @samuelklee I think we should aim for tools that at least run out-of-box, without depending on any out-of-band configuration other than the conda env. On top of that we can provide guidance/configs for users on how to enable further optimizations, like g++. Does that sound like an achievable goal ?. As for the docker, we're going to have strike the right balance between image bloat and performance(including test performance). I think we're around 4+ gig now, and counting. Before the Python integration we were at 1.9G, and trying to find ways to reduce it. So lets see where we wind up but keep that in mind. Finally, we need to find a way to install the (GATK) python package(s) without depending on access to the GATK repo. Right now I think the gCNV branch has a ""pip install from source"" added to the conda env .yml. That will work on the docker at the moment (and thus on travis), but that won't work for non-docker users how don't have source/repo access. Also, one of the proposals to reduce the size of the docker is to remove the repo clone that is currently there. My proposal is that we change the gradle build to create an archive/zip of the python source (this would include the VQSR-CNN package code as well as gCNV kernel). We can then copy that on to the docker image, and pip-install it from the copy. That would retain the ability to always run travis tests based on the code in the repo, and also keep the nightly docker image in sync.

I turned off my VPN connection and am able to run PileupSpark locally. (There is an issue ticket on this at https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1534.).

Either this unusual behavior should be fixed or mentioned in the tooldoc. I'm testing this with dataproc now.

Testability,"@meganshand Here's a quick example:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385742-20a3303b-d8ce-4335-b42f-622da9bfa8d3.png); ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385777-6174f8b8-7abb-4b31-92d1-11cc8064854b.png). Note that the malaria data used was pretty small: chr1-2 training (~20k positive training/truth variants, ~50k negative training variants; note also that the threshold for determining negative training was not tuned---a threshold corresponding to a 98% truth sensitivity was arbitrarily chosen), chr3 validation (~50k variants), and chr4-6 test (~150k variants). The LL score is calculated from a validation set held out from the training/truth positives used to train the model, while the F1 score is calculated using ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives determined using 3 families of ~30 trios each. However, there's some arbitrariness in how we define the boundary for the latter positives/negatives, and hence some arbitrariness in the F1 score itself. But I'd expect using gold-standard GIAB truth would be more straightforward. Not sure how much we can conclude, but that the validation and test F1s are similar and that the validation LL score isn't *too* far off are encouraging. That said, there is a pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above. I would hope that with more variants or reliable training/truth (as in your data), things might stabilize or line up better. I'll try running with more malaria data, as well. The following trios x sites heatmap (top plot) for the validation set might better illustrate the arbitrariness in F1 (click to enlarge):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385585-1a0dfe8e-d4b7-4770-aed0-19ad81162c92.png).

Testability,"@mlathara Thanks for the reply. The reason I'm very interested in this is scatter/gather, so in our use-case, the inputs would be identical. Like you say, this would essentially be X jobs initiated with the same command, just different intervals. Merging all the resulting per-contig workspaces back into one workspace has a lot of logistical appeal, and the resulting folder would still be a valid GenomicsDB workspace. The alternate idea we had been considering was to maintain these as a folder of per-workspaces. That might work, but has the downside of not being a 'real' file format.

Testability,"@mlathara The nodes have considerably more (256 or so). is there any rule or thumb or guidance on expected memory needs based on number of gVCFs and/or type of input (WES vs WGS)?.

I will update to leave more buffer as you suggest. Our cluster happens to be undergoing maintenance this week, so this particular job was killed. I'll update the GATK version, add --genomicsdb-shared-posixfs-optimizations, and adjust the memory.

When I was working quickly I thought I repro'd it, but as you point out the REF bases for chr20:10-20 are actually Ns, so in this instance GenotypeGVCFs is doing the right thing. - Since my original posts, we figured out new information (posted above). When we simply do a SelectVariants on the genomicsDB workspace over these intervals, it produces a gVCF with Ns listed as the reference. In the actual reference, those sites are not Ns.

If there is no I/O difference between the user copying a workspace and updating vs. GenomicsDB reading the input workspace and writing the output to a new location, then I guess I agree that one can make an argument that it's not critical for GenomicsDBImport to execute that copy itself.

Testability,"@nalinigans Thanks for the help on this. I wanted to let you know that even with the standalone tool and improvements, we've basically given up on trying to aggregate whole genome GenomicsDB workspaces with more than ~1000 samples. We can get virtually all the chromosomes to consolidate, but the largest (chr 1) can go for 10 days and eventually dies. It's just too unwieldy to be practical. My current idea is to stage our data into more reasonable workspaces of ~500 samples. These have the benefit of allowing existing data to be static, and we just keep appending/making new workspaces as we get more samples. Since GenotypeGVCFs only allows one input, the plan is:. - Run GenotypeGVCFs once per workspace. This is scattered into a huge number of jobs, so each job is reasonable.; - Take the VCFs from each of these and take the union of all sites.; - Repeat GenotypeGVCFs per workspace, giving it those sites as the whitelist of sites to force genotyping; - Merge the resulting VCFs into one.

We've had a lot of issues getting GATK/GenomicsDB to run effectively on this sample set. We have settled on doing the GenomicsDBImport/append operation with a moderate batch size.

Testability,"@nalinigans pointed out that even if we do switch this pipeline back to the BCF codec, it's still likely to encounter errors with 64-bit values due to some recent changes in GenomicsDB, which now throws an exception for these values instead of silently truncating them as it did in the past. So just switching to the BCF codec in the WDL might not be enough. A couple of other options we discussed today for a quick fix for this issue:. - @ldgauthier suggested that we change the WDL to use an older (pre-4.1.8.0) version of GATK that is known to work well with this pipeline, which would be an easy change. The only problem is that users might run `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` in the latest GATK independently of the WDL anyway and continue to run into this issue. - @nalinigans suggested that we patch `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` so that it does something sensible when the AD annotation is completely missing. Since AD was already likely being truncated by the BCF codec in previous versions of this pipeline, its value was never particularly trustworthy to begin with. Whatever option we go with, we'll need to add a good regression test for the PoN workflow that would have caught this issue. Longer term, we'll plan on developing a fix at the HTSJDK level for the way missing values are handled for the AD and PL annotations in the VCF codec (@lbergelson is currently looking into how this could be done). @fleharty What are your thoughts?

Testability,"@nenewell If I understand what is going on correctly I think this may be a bug in the validator.

Does the crash only occur with this one particular sample, or have you seen it on more than one sample? If you could get to the point where you can reproduce it on a shareable bam snippet, that would obviously maximize the chances of this getting fixed. Intel is currently (at our request) doing a pass on the GKL with `valgrind` to find and fix memory safety issues (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL/issues/107), so we expect the next GKL release to fix a bunch of ""use after free""-type errors.

Testability,@pawel125 This looks like a filesystem error - `I/O error in the advisory file locking logic (disk I/O error)`.

Testability,"@pgrosu Yes, that's correct. My point is that _in the code_ the factor of 2 in the numerator of your expression appears to be missing. If I have read the code of `GenotypeLikelihoodsCalculator::genotypeLikelihoods` correctly it behaves as follows (calculations are in log space but I have translated to real space; also it divides by ploidy at the end of the calculation instead of per read, but the effect is the same). Suppose (for pedagogical purposes) we have a triploid genotype AAB. Then the likelihood P(R | G = AAB) of read R given the genotype is (2/3) P (R | A) + (1/3) P (R | B). The overall likelihood of genotype AAB is the product of P(R | G) over all reads. This is the likelihood of the _phased_ genotype AAB, and it is the same GL that is used downstream in HaplotypeCaller. I don't see anywhere in the code where the (equal) contribution of a different permutation (eg ABA, BAA) is added, as in the numerator of your expression. Furthermore, it's hard to see where the correct combinatorial factor is hiding, because until you multiply the read likelihoods (add in log space) of all reads, which is a pretty transparent step, you _have to_ work with phased genotypes (since all reads must share the same phased genotype, you have to have a hierarchical model with unphased genotype -> phased genotype -> { all reads }). Thus, if a permutation factor needs to be there, it could only be put in right after all the read likelihoods are multiplied and nowhere else.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2019#issuecomment-235638474:268,log,log,268,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2019#issuecomment-235638474,2,['log'],['log']

Testability,"@samuelklee . In the non-docker integration test build we do run the R installation script, but a failure doesn't kill the build unless the tests fail because of it. . Would it be less painful if we had a readme explaining how to update the r-dependencies? That way it wouldn't be a surprise that you have to build a new docker image. Typically the workflow when updating the R installation script should probably be to update the base image and update the Dockerfile in the same PR that updates the R dependencies.

If you want to do an evaluation to find the best set of SW parameters now, that's fine of course -- but we wouldn't be able to actually merge any breaking HaplotypeCaller changes until after the November DRAGEN-GATK release, and we'd also have to check whether the proposed changes affect the functional equivalence of GATK and DRAGEN (we're developing tests now that can check this). If you want to expose the SW parameters on the CLI now, I think 12 arguments is fine. Just give each argument a clear prefix indicating what it applies to (eg., `--read-to-haplotype-mismatch-penalty`).

Testability,"@samuelklee I've worked through all of the issues with the other repos (Barclay, picard, etc.), so we're ready to move forward with Java 17 reviews, but the `ModelSegments` tests are still inconsistent. This branch has updated `ModelSegments` expected result files that were produced locally with Java 17 (based on our discussion from some months ago), but now the same tests still fail on the docker. They succeed when run locally or in the CI non-docker job. At one point when I looked into these, the values produced when the tests fail look similar(/identical ?) to the values that the tests USED to produce (i.e., I suspect if we reverted expected results files, the tests might succeed on the docker and fail on the non-docker). I'm not sure what is causing the instability, but this is going to become a blocking issue for this in the next couple of weeks. We also have the option of disabling them only on the docker (or non-docker), but I hate to do that. Can you take a look at this in the next week or so ?.

Graphical model is written down.; - [x] Implement basic algorithm; - CLI roughly implemented in sl_purity_ploidy_mcmc branch. Could stand some refactoring and code cleanup before it is PR ready and needs tests.; - [x] Algorithm improvements; - Currently, the model is initialized assuming a 50-50 normal-tumor split and only a clonal population. This is run for ~100 MCMC iterations, and the result is used to initialize a second run that expands the number of populations. This tends to work reasonably well, but there are situations where the model can get stuck in incorrect, degenerate solutions. Going to try adding some MH steps that will swap populations to see if these can help get the model unstuck.; - Need to add outlier absorption to the model, which appears to be critical for inference of subclonal populations from real data (i.e., ACNV output), which may have spurious segments, oversegmentation, etc. Simple clonal models appear to work reasonably well without this, though.; - [x] Evaluate algorithm on simulated data.; - Implemented simple Queue pipeline for running CLI on simulated ACNV segment files. Takes <2 minutes for ~1000 iterations for each sample, can run 100s of samples in parallel on the gsa clusters.; - Need to write up some scripts to automatically calculate and plot metrics.; - [x] Evaluate algorithm on real data; - Some initial runs on HCC1143 purity series show reasonable results for the clonal model",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2909:762,test,tests,762,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2909,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"@sooheelee - I think that to have a proper test suite similar to GATK's 3, we need also some test that exercise some code paths that requires some specific scientifically meaningful data (for example, known indels that are also included in some sample). I am not that familiar with the test data on this or GATK3 repository, so I am not sure if that was already covered. @sooheelee - this is going to be an exact port of the indel-realignment pipeline, as it is in the GATK3 code, so that means that I won't modify the interval list format or anything (although I will use the HTSJDK/Picard classes as used on GATK3). Because this will be an experimental/beta feature, I think that I can have a look to the new format after acceptance of the original port. @cmnbroad - I understand that a fully functional tool is a requirement for acceptance, but what I mean is that some specific features might require more work than others. I am only concerned about the `NWaySAMFileWriter`, which is just an specific way of output the data but does not add anything to the real realignment process (actually, I think that I've never heard about anyone around me using it). That is a nice feature, but I don't think that it is a high-priority - I care more about having the algorithm implemented to test if the actual processing of the data works, and add support for some way of output the data in a different PR. In addition, if the people still using indel-realignment does not require the n-way output, then it is pointless to spend time on it. I was also thinking about the mate-fixing algorithm in the tool, because it can be performed afterwards with Picard, which is not constraining by any distance between reads or records in RAM - nevertheless, this is really a drop of functionality that will change results, and that's why I didn't propose that.

Testability,"@t-ogasawara @frank-y-liu @gspowley @paolonarvaez @droazen @lbergelson please comment on the following proposal. The proposal is that we would spin off native PairHMM as a separate project/repo on github and host AVX code there and have alternative implementations extend that project/repo (by creating repos that depend on the AVX one). . In other words, now we have 1 repo, broadinstitute/gatk. After the proposed change we'll have 3 repos (all BSD licensed):; 1) broadinstitute/gatk; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-AVX; 2) broadinstitute/nativePairHMM-PPC. We will duplicate the native code (AVX and PPC will be separate copies of C++ files etc) to simplify the testing burden. The parties interested in working on a specific architecture will contribute code directly to the respective architecture-specific repo and gatk will take occasional updates of those repos. The gatk repo will depend on the other two. The PPC repo will depend on the AVX repo (and any other native repos will depend on the AVX one). The avx and ppc repos will have their own build systems and unit tests against the new interface. The AVX repo will expose something like the following Java API (to be worked out in detail). ```; //Used to copy references to byteArrays to JNI from reads; public final class JNIReadDataHolderClass {; public byte[] readBases = null;; public byte[] readQuals = null;; public byte[] insertionGOP = null;; public byte[] deletionGOP = null;; public byte[] overallGCP = null;; }. //Used to copy references to byteArrays to JNI from haplotypes; public final class JNIHaplotypeDataHolderClass {; public byte[] haplotypeBases = null;; }. public interface NativePairHMMKernel extends AutoCloseable { . /**; * Function to initialize the fields of JNIReadDataHolderClass and JNIHaplotypeDataHolderClass from JVM.; * C++ code gets FieldIDs for these classes once and re-uses these IDs for the remainder of the program.

This allowed me to get rid of the de-duplication code, so thanks for the suggestion. It seemed tricky to me to try to cluster these links during the initial pass over the reads while at the same time keeping track of coherent evidence. In my testing it doesn't seem like it is slow to run over the `EvidenceRDD` again to do this, but we could think about trying to change this sometime if we're looking for optimizations. .

Testability,@tedsharpe Looks good. Thanks for all the stylistic revisions and additional commenting! . My IDE caught some string comparisons using `==` which could definitely lead to confusing issues down the road. Once you've addressed the comments feel free to rebase and merge.

Testability,"@tomwhite On the GATK side, I think the steps are:; 1. Rev our Hadoop-BAM dependency once https://github.com/HadoopGenomics/Hadoop-BAM/pull/49 is in.; 2. Take one of our existing test inputs and create a copy of it sorted by query name using the hellbender tool `SortSam`. I think a good file to use would be `src/test/resources/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/BQSR/CEUTrio.HiSeq.WGS.b37.ch20.1m-1m1k.NA12878.noMD.noBQSR.bam`, as that file hasn't had either MD or BQSR run on it, and it's the primary input in the `ReadsPipelineSparkIntegrationTest`.; 3. Before making any actual changes to MarkDuplicatesSpark, write a new integration test proving that MarkDuplicatesSpark can read in the queryname-sorted bam above, and produces the same result as when run on the coordinate-sorted version of the bam. The output in both cases when running with `--shardedOutput false` should be a coordinate-sorted bam.; 4. Now the potentially tricky part: in `MarkDuplicatesSpark`, we want to detect queryname-sorted reads using the `SAMFileHeader` SO attribute (`SAMFileHeader.getSortOrder()`), and if we have them, avoid performing the first `groupByKey()` operation in `MarkDuplicatesSparkUtils.transformReads()`, instead relying on the natural ordering of the reads to create the `PairedEnds` objects.; 5. Make sure that the test you wrote in step 3 doesn't break after doing step 4 :)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1411#issuecomment-170043162:179,test,test,179,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1411#issuecomment-170043162,4,['test'],['test']
Testability,"@tomwhite Review complete. Looks good, very exciting to be getting it running on spark too. I like the approach of toggling spark/google at the command line level. It makes it easy to separate out the testing of each. I ran everything on spark locally without trouble so it works at least for the existing tests. . Could you rebase this onto master as well, there's a recent pull request that adds an `isRemote()` method to `DataflowCommandlineProgram` which needs to be updated to take into account the spark runner. .

Testability,"@tomwhite Review complete. Thanks for this! . I'm at a bit of a loss for how to test the hadoop bam reading. I think we should have a unit test for it, but I don't know the right way to do it. Is there an easy way to spin up something that serves local files as hdfs? Ideally we could have an hdfs layer running on travis that we could query files from in order to test. . At a minimum we need unit tests testing that we can actually read an hdfs file. Even if they have to be stuck in their own hdfs group and excluded from the travis set, we need some thing that can be run to verify that it works.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/553#issuecomment-111200909:80,test,test,80,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/553#issuecomment-111200909,5,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,@tomwhite The point of the singleton pattern is for testing: tests can substitute their own instance instead of the default one.

Testability,"@tovanadler Review complete. Looks good, just a few comments. I have a few comments about the organization of duplicate marking. I think you've inherited some very old style code that could maybe use some refactoring. I think we do need to also include the histogram and the metrics headers. Those could be done in a separate ticket though. I'm a bit worried that the test is indeterministic. Unless I overlooked something which is likely, it seems like it might depend on the ordering of a PCollection which is undefined. This isn't problematic for the actual metric file, but might be for the tests.

I've opened #2316 to deal with the issue. Until that's fixed though, the workaround is to invoke the jars directly and add `-Dsnappy.disable=true`. i.e. `java -Dsnappy.disable=true -jar $GATK_LOCAL_JAR SortSam --input BAM_BWA/SRR2.sorted.bam --output hpcinfra/hadoop/test.bam --SORT_ORDER queryname`",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2300#issuecomment-267119418:741,test,test,741,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2300#issuecomment-267119418,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,@vdauwera The latest game plan for this ticket (which is being addressed in #2021) is to have SplitNCigarReads create a supplementary alignment from each split and soft clip the bases that align elsewhere. This allows the bam to be more usable by other tools (like BQSR) since the logic to handle supplementary reads already exists. This means that we need an additional argument to HaplotypeCaller so that allows using supplementary alignments (See #2043). . My question is how can we document that SplitNCigarReads is not recommended for use with the changes to make the reads supplementary until #2043 is resolved? Is it possible to make the tool hidden in GATK4 or give it some tag that makes it clear it isn't ready for use yet?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1394#issuecomment-235062440:281,log,logic,281,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1394#issuecomment-235062440,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"@vdauwera The tools are categorized and listed in the Google Spreadsheet above. It is waiting for you to assign tech leads to tools for documentation. One thing that @chandrans brought to my attention is that for BaseRecalibrator one of the parameters (`-bqsr`) actually causes an error. One can no longer generate the 2nd recalibration table with correction on the fly and instead must use the recalibrated BAM through BaseRecalibrator to generate the 2nd recal table for plotting. **This type of information is missing from the tool docs.** Furthermore, updates I made to the BQSR slidedeck (that showcase this `-bqsr` parameter) are based on information from a developer and this information turns out to be incorrect now (perhaps correct at some point in development?). Soooo, I think it may be prudent that those responsible for tool docs test the commands on data. - [4] Make sure the doc content enables Best Practices, e.g. plotting BQSR recalibration, and ; - [5] Test example commands to ensure they work. If they do not, make corrections and notate the change in application in the documentation.; - [6] Remember @vdauwera's plan to change the representation of parameters from camel to KEBAB case.

Users who are dealing with large ploidies (typically for pooled experiments) run into limitations where the combination of the ploidy and numbers of alleles in the high teens and above produces too many possible genotypes for GenotypeGVCFs to handle under its current architecture. . For example, in the case reported here, the ploidy is 19 and the number of alternate alleles is 21, so GenotypeGVCFs cannot handle the large number of possible genotypes that result from all the possible combinations. A reasonable way to deal with this would be to cull the possible combinations dynamically at runtime to eliminate the most unlikely combinations up front. ; #### Test data. Has been provided by the user ; #### [Original forum post](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/discussion/4954/combination-of-ploidy-and-number-of-alleles-error-when-running-genotypegvcfs/p1). ---. @vruano commented on [Tue Mar 10 2015](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/855#issuecomment-77993425). The error message explain the reason well ... a possibility to actually address this issue is to dynamically reduce the number of alt alleles loosing the less likely ones base on a maximum number of possible genotypes. So the user does not indicate the maximum number of alternative but the maximum number of genotypes. Which alt. alleles make it could be decided by taking a look in the corresponding hom. alt genotype likelihood dropping those alternatives with the worst hom.

Testability,"@vruano The AF calculator is not where the alleles are removed. It calculates an honest probability that each exists. For example, if we have two alts and PLs are `(999,0,999,0,999,999)` -- that is, it's definitely a het, and we have no clue which alt allele it is, then it correctly says that the posterior probability of each alt allele is 0.5. Now, this probability of 0.5 is quite low for a real variant (below the default confidence threshold). `calculateOutputAlleleSubset` sees that and evaluates each allele independently, thus dropping both, but that's a consequence of relying on marginal probabilities. which this example suggests we ought not to do. The logic in `Mutect2` is different and avoids this issue. It does model comparison to see if we can remove alt alleles one at a time, starting with the alt allele with the worst marginal likelihood. Thus, it drops one alt allele, because there is only a tiny likelihood cost since the other alt allele can explain the data, but does not drop a second alt allele since then half the reads wouldn't fit.

Testability,"@xysj1989 We primarily run this workflow using the WDL on Terra. In this case, each GermlineCNVCaller shard is run on a separate VM using the GATK Docker. Hopefully, we can always at least guarantee that this default mode of running the workflow is functional and covered by tests. However, if you'd like to instead run multiple instances of GermlineCNVCaller locally, you may need to make sure certain environment variables are set appropriate. For example, I think you can address (2) above (the location of the temporary theano directory) by either setting environment variables or modifying your Theano configuration (see http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/config.html) appropriately. You may also want to check the GermlineCNVCaller task in the WDL to see how other variables are set there.

Testability,"@yfarjoun for small arrays, `FastMath.log` is pretty much as fast as it gets. It is highly optimized. If you are dealing with giant arrays, however, an alternative is to cast the Java arrays into [NDArray](www.nd4j.org) and execute Nd4j native ops. Here's how the timings look:; ```N = 1, Apache = 0.001625 ms, Nd4j = 0.113038 ms; N = 10, Apache = 0.002112 ms, Nd4j = 0.029833 ms; N = 100, Apache = 0.011660 ms, Nd4j = 0.028464 ms; N = 1000, Apache = 0.049915 ms, Nd4j = 0.052455 ms; N = 10000, Apache = 0.348786 ms, Nd4j = 0.430606 ms; N = 100000, Apache = 3.572483 ms, Nd4j = 1.810641 ms; N = 10000000, Apache = 323.021844 ms, Nd4j = 175.421305 ms; ```; The nd4j times include the overhead of creating NDArrays and pulling back the results to JVM heap. The break even point is around N ~ 1000. If accuracy is not a concern, (1) a native implementation of log using half-precision floats or (2) caching, tabulation, and linear interpolation could help. ps> I just realized that the Nd4j call was using 4 threads. if you replace for loops in Java with parallel streams in Java with the same number of threads, Apache always beats Nd4j in this specific test:; ```N = 1, Apache = 0.073910 ms, Nd4j = 0.122488 ms; N = 10, Apache = 0.086508 ms, Nd4j = 0.056924 ms; N = 100, Apache = 0.067022 ms, Nd4j = 0.051674 ms; N = 1000, Apache = 0.081751 ms, Nd4j = 0.075098 ms; N = 10000, Apache = 0.202142 ms, Nd4j = 0.514030 ms; N = 100000, Apache = 1.190085 ms, Nd4j = 1.990945 ms; N = 10000000, Apache = 96.536308 ms, Nd4j = 210.331251 ms; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2577#issuecomment-292602609:38,log,log,38,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2577#issuecomment-292602609,3,"['log', 'test']","['log', 'test']"

Other packages are simply installed using `dependencies = ...`; -We should perhaps consider moving the R dependencies into the conda environment, see discussion in #4209.; -R dependencies are cached in a `site-library` folder in the Travis build to avoid intermittent connection issues with the aforementioned URLs.

Testability,"A few points:; 1. When we wrote the Java interface, the 'agreement' was that the sample names would be unique and consistent within the VCF headers. Hence, the assert statement in the Java code.; 1. Having said that, the sample name in the VCF header is ignored completely if checks are disabled (which are disabled by default). This includes the assert statement and a couple of other checks in the importer code. The sample name is taken from the name to reader map provided in the constructor call. This map is created from the tab delimited file.; 1. Would it be possible to provide a simple test case to replicate the bug? I couldn't replicate it. Here is what I did.; 1. Three VCF files - t0.vcf.gz, t1.vcf.gz, t0_dup.vcf.gz. t0 and t0_dup are identical except for the GT field in one location.

Testability,"A quick patch to help out the Variants team, which is struggling with a problematic callset. Note that a similar regularization to the effective number per component probably should have been applied to solve the issue in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6425. I'm not sure if the lack of this regularization will still lead to convergence issues, but I would hope that the fix that was implemented instead (treating vanishing components as a special case and skipping computation) suffices. As discussed there, we may also want to eventually remove the idiosyncratic finalize step; it’s likely this is the source of issues here, since the correct Bayesian M step is already regularized by the prior. The covariance regularization term added here is standard (c.f. e.g. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7e1e6d09bcc2eaeba98f7e737aac2ac782f0e5f1/sklearn/mixture/_gaussian_mixture.py#L154), but it may result in non-negligible changes to VQSLODs. As just discussed with the Variants team, we can probably use the WARP validation to convince ourselves that results are functionally equivalent. I updated the exact-match tests without much close examination (by simply forcing IntegrationTestSpec.assertEqualTextFiles to overwrite the old expected files), so someone may want to sanity check them.

This is a GATK3 issue, but I hope that GATK4 will incorporate the following suggestion. And while we are on the subject, what is the roadmap for FindCoveredIntervals, DiagnoseTargets, and DepthOfCoverage (or something even more awesome) in GATK4?. A common pattern is to use `FindCoveredIntervals --uncovered` to create an interval list that serves as input to `DiagnoseTargets`.

If you want to run whole genome, use -T DepthOfCoverage instead.; ```; and exit with a non-zero return code. It is certainly possible to trap the empty interval list and skip DiagnoseTargets, but it I think it would be better if DiagnoseTargets emitted the warning but then quit with empty output and a zero rc.

Based on manual review, this salvages ~600 variants that would be dropped by evaluation scripts that would simply ignore the CPX variants. ---; Tests will be added if this strategy is given the green light (so no merging yet).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4602:4805,Test,Tests,4805,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4602,1,['Test'],['Tests']

Testability,"Actually, I'm going to go ahead and add some exact match tests to guard against this sort of thing. Behavior for key somatic CNV tool modules (i.e., kernel segmentation and MCMC) is unit tested to within statistical noise (so, not exact match) on simulated data, but most integration tests just check for plumbing and not correctness. The idea was always that this sort of thing would be covered by what eventually became CARROT, since such tests would probably have to be long running and require more resources than are available in the repo to be useful. See the high priority but long dormant issues https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4122 and https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123, as well as https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4630. In fact, I think the original idea was that Lee's validation would be the first to go into CARROT. Note also that I did some work to set up transition of all existing CNV tests (also including the somatic CNV validation against TCGA SNP calls that I put together on Terra) before going on leave and moving off CNVs, but during all that, we managed to 1) lose TCGA access, 2) delete the test files on which Lee based his validation after he left, and 3) reassign at least one of the people that was going to help with the transition. Again, the resulting differences here are minor and it's unlikely that future non-CNV code changes will have similar effects, since the CNV code is relatively well encapsulated, but the exact-match checks will hopefully give us some peace of mind until CARROT tests are ready. @jonn-smith @KevinCLydon looping you in just in case you're not aware of all of this history.

Testability,"Adding a little more fuel to the fire on this one. Our workaround for this for the time being was going to be to run HC twice - once to output a gVCF and again to output a called VCF directly. While being a little wasteful of compute we figured this would give us correctly phased calls in a genotyped VCF while also giving us the reference confidence information in a gVCF. However, we just tried that and found that there is no phasing information in the genotyped VCF produced directly from HaplotypeCaller without any `-ERC` parameter. Looking at the logs i see:. ```; 09:00:09.140 INFO HaplotypeCallerEngine - Disabling physical phasing, which is supported only for reference-model confidence output; ```. Based on this I don't think there's a workaround. I can either generate a gVCF with `-ERC GVCF` or `-ERC BP_RESOLUTION`, but then running `GenotypeGVCFs` will mangle the phase information, _or_ run without `-ERC` but then get zero phasing information. Am I missing a potential workaround? Also, I'm curious why phasing is disabled for non-ERC mode as, at least to me, it's not immediately obvious why that would be.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5727#issuecomment-470610709:555,log,logs,555,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5727#issuecomment-470610709,1,['log'],['logs']

Testability,"Adding in the option for using a compressed representation of our reference data. The flag use_compressed_references needs to be passed into ingest and also export, and doing so causes us to use a different internal schema for the ref_ranges table that can save ~40% on space. On the VCF path, the packed data is expanded while we populate the prepare tables before extract. On the VDS path, the packed data is expanded while we extract from the tables to create the Avro files. I updated integration tests to take use_compressed_refs as an option, and saw what I needed. Integrations tests for the VCF and VDS paths go to completion and fail, but in the expected way. AssertIdenticalOutputs, the important part, passes. AssertTableSizesAreExpected fails because the ref_ranges table is so much smaller (255884464 vs 431805033 expected) and AssertCostIsTrackedAndExpected fails because the PrepareRangesCallsetTask.GvsPrepareRanges.BigQuery Query Scanned is similarly smaller (340787200 vs 515899392). Given the nature of the change and the fact that it is an optional flag that defaults to zero, updating the integration tests to cover this path did not seem sound at this time.

Testability,"Addresses #6242. Current behavior: when all the reads in a read group are filtered in the base recalibration step, the read group is not logged in the recal table. Then ApplyBQSR encounters these reads, can't find the read group in the recal table, and throws an error. New behavior: if `--allow-read-group` flag is set to true, then ApplyBQSR outputs the original quantities (after quantizing). . I avoided the alternative approach of collapsing (marginalizing) across the read groups, mostly because it would require a complete overhaul of the code. I also think that using recal data from other read groups might not be a good idea. In any case, using OQ should be good enough; I assume that these ""missing"" read groups are low enough quality to be filtered out and are likely to be thrown out by downstream tools. I also refactored the BQSR code, mostly to update the variable and class names to be more accurate and descriptive. For instance:.

Testability,"Adds a WDL that replaces the ""serial"" SnpThenIndel joint filtering workflow added in #7932. This simplified replacement only runs one iteration of the extract-train-score toolchain, rather than running one iteration for SNPs followed by another for INDELs. The original SnpThenIndel workflow (used for Ultima) will be updated and moved to the WARP repo. (EDIT: I was originally confused here, the WDL that was replaced in this PR simply ran SNPs and indels separately, rather than serially. Curious that things still tied out, but I’m not sure it’s worth looking into at this point.). Test files have also been subset to chr21-22 and slimmed down. A test for the positive-negative was also added, as well as tests of an empty shard. The first commit contains the original workflow (JointVcfFilteringOriginal.wdl), as well as a reimplementation (JointVcfFilteringSnpThenIndel.wdl) that calls the simplified workflow (JointVcfFiltering.wdl).

This tool is motivated by a specific artifact produced by Illumina DRAGEN v3.7.8 in which reads containing small indels are erroneously soft-clipped, often within mobile element contexts (LINE, SINE, ALU, SVA, etc). This is particularly problematic for mobile element insertion callers such as [Scramble](https://github.com/GeneDx/scramble) that rely on soft-clips for identifying potential insertion sites but do not perform a local assembly. In some cases, these soft-clipped reads are aligned to the incorrect region (confirmed by BLAT query and comparison to BWA alignments).

Note that the default threshold of zero for the tumor in matched-normal mode should ensure that the sites genotyped as het should always match in the tumor and the normal.

There was previously a check for this condition in the integration test; however, it wasn't actually activated by the test data.

Finally, I will also note that there is an implementation in bcftools. I have not checked it for correctness, but it appears to allow the calculation of both the one-sided p-value intended by ExcessHet, as well as what Wigginton calls P_{HWE}.

It's OK if the Spark methods throw NotImplemented on some calls that are not relevant to Spark. Then we can have RefApiSource be mostly empty, and we'd be using subclasses of it (or implementations, depending on whether we go the abstract class or interface route). . We still need some way to stub, because there are places deep in the code that call RefApiSource.getInstance(). We could have a getDataflowInstance() and a getSparkInstance() - the former would normally return the code formerly known as RefApiSource, except if tests set up the mock. getSparkInstance can return always the same thing apparently since you didn't see a need for a mock - but this way if we need it later, at least the code follows the same pattern.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/804#issuecomment-130793086:469,stub,stub,469,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/804#issuecomment-130793086,4,"['mock', 'stub', 'test']","['mock', 'stub', 'tests']"

Testability,"And probably other kinds of files too. The stack below results from handing it a .ADAM file in the MeanQualityByCycleSparkIntegrationTest.test_ADAM test.

It then happily creates a bogus SAMFileHeader from the .ADAM stream. All 3 layers should probably be more discriminating. This currently doesn't break any tests. I discovered it when running the HB tests against a local version of htsjdk with a strict setHeader implementation that attempts to resolve all reference names on every setHeader call.

I have a theory about what's going on, and I'm hoping someone who is more knowledgable can tell me if my theory is sensible or impossible, and if there's anything I can do to confirm it. My theory is this: that a) the one bad job got run on a compute instance that has a hardware issue that intermittently affects only AVX operations, b) that the Intel native PairHMM doesn't handle that situation gracefully but instead returns an empty likelihoods map and c) that's causing the warnings I'm seeing the discrepancies in the gVCFs.

Testability,"As determined by @davidadamsphd , the `Copyable` interface idea won't work:. The recommendation from the Dataflow team was to make a narrow API and do the copying part of the API. I started down this route, and I think it might be doable for things like the walker interface. The idea is to make a Copyable interface and have our interfaces extend that. . However, we have unsafe code already in the engine. I tried to make this SafeDoFn approach, however it became clear quickly that we'd have a combinatorial explosion of classes because we don't just have `DoFn<GATKRead,POut>`, but also `<Iterable<GATKRead>,POut>`, and many others. So, this approach will not work for the engine. I then tried to make a general purpose solution (using coders to write to bytes and then recreate a new class). This doesn't work for a few reasons, most critical is that the coder registry isn't Serializable, so that can't be passed down deep enough to get this to work. While working on this, I chatted with someone on the Dataflow team who is working on the verification on the direct runner. He has a PR out and likely going to get it approved soon. So, for the engine, we could always test using the direct runner and know for sure there are not issues (once we can use his code). However, there are two downsides:. 1) We will need to wait for a cut of the SDK (which looking at their previous clip is likely ~ two weeks away). . 2) I don't know if we want the direct runner test as our general purpose solution. Can we expect Comp Bios to always test with the direct runner first? Will they write anything more complex than functions that use the Walker interface?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/702#issuecomment-127403661:1175,test,test,1175,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/702#issuecomment-127403661,3,['test'],['test']

In #8083 I have checked that the code is hooked up manually, but its not clear to me what a proper test looks like for mutect without re-hashing the test samples that were being used in the bacterial project.

Testability,As part of #8083 we have added yet another heterogenous way of spitting out detailed debugging logs from yet another part of the HaplotypeCaller (namely in this case a toggle that prints to Stdout). This is in contrast to the existing (mostly assembly region position information) `--verbosity DEBUG` debug arguments and the various debug output stream arguments like `--debug-assembly-region-state`. These debug modes have proliferated and it has become difficult/confusing to know which ones are relevant if you are developing the code. . At some point it might be worth creating some sort of static debug manager class that manages the various specific output streams and saves us from having to pass debugger state to all of the various subclasses/utility methods of the HaplotypeCallerEngine. Importantly using `DEBUG` to stderr is not entirely useful as it jumbles all of the various debugger outputs into one output which quickly becomes large and difficult to read.

Testability,"As reported by @kachulis and confirmed by @epiercehoffman :. I run PrintReads over and over again, on the same input data, not doing anything, just read in, write out, ie gatk PrintRead -I input.bam -O output.bam. Mostly, I just get an identical 9GB bam over and over again (as confirmed by md5). However, sometimes (~10% of the time it seems), I get a MUCH larger “bam”, more like ~45GB. In runs where I get these larger output files, they are not always the same size, sometimes 45GB, sometimes 47GB (still always with the same input file, same commandline, same wdl task, etc). The runs that produce these larger bam also take much longer, with slower “reads per minute rate). They report exactly the same number of reads processed in the logs as the “normal” runs. Looking inside the large output “bams” with gsutil cat, I see the header suddenly transitioning from compressed looking jibberish to a plaintext header, and then after a bit back to compressed looking jibberish again. Additionally, if I run these large bams through samtools view to get samtools to write them as a bam (ie samtools view big.bam -o samtools_out.bam) the resulting bam is much smaller ~6GB. It kind of seems like sometimes gatk will just stop compressing the output, and then start back up again, seemingly randomly??. I suspect this may be an issue with all gatk tools, I first encountered this recently with PostProcessReadsForRSEM, and then confirmed the behavior in PrintReads as a minimal example.

Testability,"At some positions (such as 20:10001430 in src/test/resources/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/haplotypecaller/expected.testGVCFMode.gatk4.g.vcf) reads with mismatches or indels in the BWA-aligned pileup get realigned during local assembly (where they will get evaluated as variants in the active region). However, the flanking regions adjacent to the active region are evaluated using the original alignments. This can lead to het calls outside the active region that get capped to GQ0 homRef calls. The solution is not entirely trivial since we hard clip reads after we trim the active region and compute the likelihoods used for their realignments based on this clipped sequence. One relatively easy hack that would be a partial improvement would be to omit reads that had been realigned from the pileup in the flanking regions.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5171:46,test,test,46,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5171,2,['test'],"['test', 'testGVCFMode']"
Testability,"At the moment, all tests share a global Spark context. Once the test context is created, subsequent calls to `getTestSparkContext(Map<String, String> overridingProperties)` or `getSparkContext(...)` return the existing context and `overridingProperties` is ignored. This results in failure of integration tests of tools that need to override certain Spark configs (e.g. to register custom serializers). To make life a bit easier for gatk-protected devs, it is (at least) desirable to take a global set of overriding Spark config key-value pairs from within the gradle build script, and considering them when instantiating the global test Spark context. In particular, I would like to add a few comma-separated extra registrators to `spark.kryo.registrator`.

Testability,"Awaiting the Barclay snapshot with broadinstitute/barclay#33, which is ready, but I'll sanity check again in AM before I merge. NOTE: All of the GATK tests have passed locally with this branch. However, I had to make one temporary change because SelectVariants has a feature that clashes with the collection list file feature in https://github.com/broadinstitute/barclay/pull/28. SelectVariants currently has two arguments that are defined as `List<File>`, that are each intended to take a list of file names, each of which in turn contains a list of sample names. SelectVariants manually loads all of the samples from all of the files in the list, and creates a list of unique sample names. With the https://github.com/broadinstitute/barclay/pull/28, the CLP now loads the list directly, and hands SelectVariants a list of sample names rather than the list of file names, which breaks one test. I think both features are working as intended, but collide when a .list file is used. I temporarily renamed the test file to not have a .list extension (so it won't trigger the CLP file loading), but we'll have to decide how to properly reconcile these two features.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2388:150,test,tests,150,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2388,3,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

There's already test data (generated using Pyro) checked in and the results match the sklearn implementation to high precision, I just need to write numerical checks. There are also already unit tests for static utility methods. Future work:; - [ ] Expanding unit tests to cover more of the interface. These initial unit tests will almost certainly not completely cover the possibilities allowed by the interface, e.g. warm starts. Could be a good exercise for other developers.

Testability,"Below is probably too specific but I am not sure if this is desired (unlikely IMO) or actually another edge-case bug. Summary: `InsertSizeMetics.WIDTH_OF_99_PERCENT` potentially get larger than `InsertSizeMetrics.MAX_INSERT_SIZE - InserSizeMetrics.MIN_INSERT_SIZE`. Details:; Using the non-empty bam file, fragment length values of valid reads (13 reads) are; {36,36,36,38,38,40,41,41,41,41,44,44,45}, with median value 41.; However, the `CollectInsertSizeMetricsTest.java` unit test is yielding 11 as the value for `InsertSizeMetics.WIDTH_OF_99_PERCENT`, which is greater than 10 (that is, max-min+1).; Debugging step-by-step shows that the problem lies in function . `public void InsertSizeMetricsCollector::addMetricsToFile(final MetricsFile<InsertSizeMetrics,Integer>)` . In short, the logic in the implementation for finding the bin widths is to have two variables, `low` and `high`, that starts from `InsertSizeMetics.MEDIAN_INSERT_SIZE` and incremented and decremented by 1 gradually. The actual widths are calculated by `distance = (max - min)+1`.; In this particular edge case, during the last iteration, `max` was increased from the previous iteration to an out of bound value--46 (that is greater than 45, the actual max in the data). The increment and decrement of `low` and `high` are done at the bottom of the `while` block spanning form line 138 to line 162 in the function. This causes the culprit. In hypothetical scenario, when the distribution under investigation is extremely biased (max-median >> median-min, or the other way around), the `WIDTH_OF_99_PERCENT` could end up much higher than max-min. @akiezun @cwhelan please check.

Testability,"Both sound right, but it would be comforting to know for sure that the proposed changes will actually fix the problem. I ran a profiler on some of the existing test cases, but they're not substantial enough to make the profiling results interesting. My previous hacking branch is https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/cn_variant_eval_walker. The changes were basically exploratory - I was really just hacking to see what kinds of issues we'd run into. The branch is way behind master so it really needs a rebase. It would be great it you want to pursue this, but I'd strongly suggest trying to break it up into a series of incremental PRs as much as possible. I haven't looked at these classes for quite a while, but one proposal would be to start with a PR that just does #5441, then one that factors out the eval engine so it can be reused, and then another to change the VariantEval base class.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5439#issuecomment-720719517:160,test,test,160,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5439#issuecomment-720719517,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"BucketUtils was a solution before we had Filesystem providers. It's stuck around as a parallel set of code because we couldn't trust the providers at first. In the long run it should be removed and replaced entirely by `Files` operations. We need to test that all the functionality exists / works as expected though, and it hasn't been a high priority to do so.

Testability,Bug report recieved via email: . I am testing GATK4 walker version.

Testability,"By default we only support OSX and modernish linux on amd64. We don't have a plan to test or officially support aarch64. However, it's mostly java so it might mostly work? The things I can think of off the bat that won't work are the optimizations for intel hardware, i.e. the fast pairhmm and deflate/inflate optimizations will definitely not work. They **should** degrade to java implementations automatically though. . IBM has a fork that works on power8 which reimplements some of the optimizations for PairHMM, so it's definitely possible to implement the various native optimizations for other architectures although not a small project. . GenomicsDB won't work since we only bundle libs for amd64/osx. You could in theory compile it yourself and pass the library on the library path. Other things that will need special attention would any of the library wrappers, for bwa-mem, fermlite, and hdf5. Those will similarly need custom builds supplied to the gatk. .

Testability,"By modifying the test I was able to isolate the error in the `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.walkers.variantutils` package, which is strange because the PR did not modify the javadoc for any class in that package. The integration test runs `com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute` and asserts that the output code is zero, which does not yield a useful error message. In order to produce something more meaningful I hacked the test to output the entire `stdout` and `stderr` as follows:. ```; final StringWriter out = new StringWriter();; final PrintWriter err = new PrintWriter(out);. final int result = com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute(""program"", err, err, err, ""doclet"",docArgList.toArray(new String[] {}));; err.flush(); // probably not needed; String message = out.toString(); // message contains the entire stdout and stderr of the call to execute; Assert.assertEquals(result, 0, message);; ```.

Testability,"CTX events have CTX_PP/QQ or CTX_PQ/QP as CPX_TYPE values in GATK-SV VCFs. However, slashes are not allowed as part of enum values, so these are represented in the ComplexVariantSubtype enum as CTX_PP_QQ and CTX_PQ_QP. This caused the CTX subtypes to not be recognized and to be dropped during SVConcordance (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/issues/664). This representation may merit further discussion, as it's not ideal that the ComplexVariantSubtype values are not a 1:1 match with the VCF values. But as one possible solution without altering the VCF, I've implemented a workaround that replaces the slash with an underscore during getComplexSubtype.

Testability,"Can you give a bit more information here? If I'm understanding correctly, it's not clear that the same issue is at play here. The original issue was that duplicate/incomplete fragments were causing queries to the workspace to fail. . In this latest instance, it seems you are appending additional samples to the existing workspace. Is that right? If so,; - are you seeing the same/similar error? That is, it's a core dump? Can you share the error messages, any logs, core dump files etc?; - did you clean up the workspace before importing? That is, remove the incomplete fragment @nalinigans identified and the duplicated ones?. My first instinct is that even if the incomplete/duplicated fragments weren't cleaned up, the incremental import shouldn't have an issue -- at least not till it gets to the consolidate phase, which only happens after all batches are imported. Sounds like you were seeing an issue at batch 3 of 4, so might have something to do with the samples in that batch...or some other import issue. You mentioned that previous imports to this particular contig failed -- were those just transient failures that worked when rerun, or was there some configuration that you changed to get that to work?. For completeness, the way I identified duplicate fragments was to do an md5sum check on some of the internal files. If any pair of fragments have the same md5sum they are likely duplicates. So, from the workspace directory, something like:. ```; find . -name ""ALT.tdb"" -exec md5sum {} \;|sort; ```; That will highlight the fragments that are potentially duplicate. To confirm that the fragments are indeed duplicates, you'll then want to take that list of potentially duplicate fragments and check that all corresponding files within each pair of potentially duplicate fragments actually have the same md5sum. I have a crude bash script that I can share if you want.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6910#issuecomment-722541707:461,log,logs,461,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6910#issuecomment-722541707,1,['log'],['logs']

Currently, the PR is failing to even build on Travis because Travis is killing it during the part of the build where it creates the Docker image on which the tests will run. It appears to be producing so much progress output during the conda environment creation - right when its resolving tensorflow packages - that Travis terminates the whole build. My suggestion above was to see if we can (at least temporarily) get past that so we can see get the build to succeed; see how big the resulting Docker is; and whether the CNNScoreVariants tests pass with the new environment.
