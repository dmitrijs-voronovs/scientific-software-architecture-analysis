Deployability,"For the record the following issue is still left:; ```; Issues with 'interpreted' + load-file-first mode. Loading the file creates a TClass for the map. Additional code (eg accessing; the CollectionProxy) might also create a TClass for the pair. When the header file is loaded in the interpreter, unless there is explicit; uses of the map (or pair), there is no decl for the instantiation of thus; the TClass for the map and pair are not refreshed. When the pair or map are instantiated (eg. `gInterpreter->Declare(""pair<...> pl"")`),; the TClass for the pair is informed (via `TCling::UpdateClassInfoWithDecl`; and `TCling::RefreshClassInfo`). We could update `RefreshClassInfo` to refresh the `StreamerInfo` for the pair; but it would also need to also refresh the map's CollectionProxy (size,; hints, etc?) [and there is an arbitrary number because they are thread-local]. So at that point, it might actually be better to recreate the TClass for the; map ... But wait ... there is currently no support for generating a collection proxy for; an interpreted class ... so it is actually an emulated collection proxy ... That proxy does not match the interpreted (nor the compiled) version of the; map ... so there is no good point to match the pair either ....

Deployability,"For the record, I have done what I outlined above and updated the PR. I do see some drastic improvements for some of our workflows (250MB out of 1GB) where we have many processes initialising the interpreter. For others, where the usage of ROOT is limited to reading files in a single process, the improvement is not so obvious. Simply opening a file does show improvement as well (I am down to 49MB, when I also patch the FileInfo vector in the HeaderSearch). The PR somehow seems to die with some old memory corruption which I am pretty sure I fixed and I cannot reproduce anymore. Is there any need to clean some cache?.

Deployability,"For the record, one such discussion yield the following:. a) Update the merging operation (if not already done) to make sure that the output file is kept open during the length of the process (this is to avoid re-reading the output TTree from the output file) and the TTree is written to the output file only once at the end. b) CMSSW can detect when a 'merge' operation was requested by checking the return value of Fill and the number of entry: if Fill succeed and the TTree has zero entries afterwards then a merge operation was requested (the TTree was reset). c) We need to call a callback (std::function) provided at CMS when a merge operation is completed (i.e all its baskets are on the output file and the output TTree has been updated accordingly). d) When CMSSW noticed that a 'merge' operation has been requested, it will shutdown the CMSSW output module (make it unavailable to other modules). This guarantees that if CMSSW has N output modules, there will be at most N queued merge operations and while the merge are going on only 1 thread is used for it (and the other N-1 can be used for other CMSSW work). e) We need to implement a queuing of the merge operations tasks without relying on the ROOT global write lock. See for example the way something similar is done in CSMSW: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/FWCore/Concurrency/interface/SerialTaskQueue.h. f) CMSSW need to call a 'finalization' API to 'close-out' the output file (without this call the output file is useless).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1866#issuecomment-387769514:61,Update,Update,61,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1866#issuecomment-387769514,2,"['Update', 'update']","['Update', 'updated']"

Deployability,"Hello both of you!; Thank you so much for the quick reply!; I went through my text again and didn't notice it repeated itself...! Sorry for that!. Considering the suggestion from @dpiparo , I have checked all the dependencies. Some I had to install, but now they are all in the system. I have tried to go through the cmake again and got the same problems. You suggest me to try from scratch again. I can do this simply by deleting the folders I have created for the installation and redo the process in the page ""build from source""?. I have tried the workaround suggested by @ferdymercury ! Firstly I have tried the snap version and nothing happened. Same errors. Now I have downloaded the pre-compiled version and I can use it, open canvases and browsers with no problem. I will run some macros to compare with the outputs I had previously and check if everything is according to what I had. Eventhough it is already working, I am willing to try and build it from source if that can help you somehow figuring out some kind of challanges you would like to improve in further versions!

Deployability,"Hi @AlkaidCheng, thanks for reporting this. This is a known issue that I want to fix for the next release 6.28. All functions that return an owning pointer in C++ like `createNLL` and many others result in a memory leak in Python, because Python doesn't know it should delete the object. That means Python code with RooFit has leaks all over the place as it is now, and it's not worth to open an issue for all of them. But let's leave this one open because it's actually the first issue about this. The reason it is not so quickly fixed is that I'm still investigating how I might flag functions on the C++ side such that PyROOT automatically knows that it should take ownership, without having to make an explicit Pythonization. My WIP is in this PR: https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9392. But for now, you can circumvent the problem by telling PyROOT explicitly that it owns the returned NLL:; ```Python; def test(pdf, ds):; nll = pdf.createNLL(ds); ROOT.SetOwnership(nll, True); ```. This method works for all the objects that you would have to `delete` yourself in C++.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11397#issuecomment-1256350153:98,release,release,98,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11397#issuecomment-1256350153,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Hi @Axel-Naumann ,. >IEEE 754 brings defined behavior to ""degenerate"" (not in the IEEE 754 sense) cases. That is true. But does not help practically. It is better that a program (e.g. with complicated integration) fails with FPE in 30 minutes than ends successfully in a week and delivers a well-defined result '-NaN'. Or, even worse, produces a result that looks fine but is incorrect and then user (e.g. me) will spend some days to understand where the problem is. > as the optimizer might change fp operations. Yes, GCC tries to keep them ""fp-safe"" but that might change in any of the upcoming versions. As far as I understand, very formally clang did nothing wrong there, it is just GCC that tried to be a bit smarter -- in the code I've copied from TColor all the used constants should be in float and not in (standard) double. No FPE in this case. ; So one can blame the code, but because mixing floats and double constants is a common practice I would blame the compiler. . >is there something left to be clarified. Ok. As far as I understood, changing the flags for the release builds is not an option, right?; If so, would a patch that assures all constants in TColor::RGB2HLS are float an acceptable solution?

Deployability,"Hi @Harshalzzzzzzz ,; ROOT has a high-level data analysis interface called [RDataFrame](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html), you can take a look at the docs and try reading and running some of the tutorials [here](https://root.cern/doc/master/group__tutorial__dataframe.html). `RDataFrame` returns results wrapped in the [RResultPtr](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RResultPtr.html) type, through which we implement lazy execution (data processing is triggered when a user accesses the contents of a `RResultPtr`, _not_ when they request the result). RResultPtr has interface and semantics similar to [std::shared_ptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr), but currently it's missing a way to release ownership of its contents. `RResultPtr<T>::Release` is a simple method that would mimic the semantics of `std::shared_ptr::release`: it must return a `T*` and empty the `RResultPtr`. What needs to be done concretely:. - [x] add the `RResultPtr::Release` method in RResultPtr.hxx. It should be implemented in terms of `fObjPtr.release()` and it should also set `fActionPtr` and `fLoopManager` to null; - [x] add tests for the feature in `tree/dataframe/test/dataframe_resptr.cxx`, in particular making sure that `Release` and the ResultPtr's move-constructor have consistent behavior; - [x] add logic to the current method `RResultPtr::GetValue` to throw an exception if it's called on a null `RResultPtr`.

Deployability,"Hi @Zeff020, thanks for the PR! Yes, you resolved the merge conflicts correctly. But the problem is still tat you resolved them by merging `master` in your MR branch, meaning that your MR branch is now not a trivial fast-forward branch anymore. The ROOT repository settings only allow fast-forward branches to be merged, and also the CI can only deal with fast forward branches. IMO this is done for good reasons: if you first merge `master` into your branch and then your branch is merged back into master, with a potential merge commit that resolves conflicts in every step, the git history becomes some complicated zipped mess. This is also something you should keep in mind for development with git in general. That means you should not resolve merge conflicts by merging `master`, but by rebasing your PR branch on top of master with `git rebase`. Let's say you want to rebase the last 8 commits of your development branch `processtimer`, the command would be:; ```; git rebase --onto master HEAD~8 processtimer; ```; Where `master` is now a local branch that corresponds to the current `root-project/master`. And then you are by git to fix the conflicts in the rebasing process. Unfortunately, you can't do this anymore now because you have merged master into your branch, so your developments are not the last n commits of the branch anymore. I would maybe create a new branch form current `master`, cherry-pick your original commits on top of it with `git cherry-pick`, and then change the name of the new branch to `processtimer` again such that when you force push, the PR will be updated.

We can't merge non-fast forward branches (like branches where you merged `master` in between). Please rebase all your developments on top of the current `master` and update this PR. If can be done in a single commit, because the current commit history of your developments is not so informative anyway :) Once this is done, the CI can also tests the PR (the CI also has problems with non fast-forward branches).; 2. We try to have new C++ code formatted nicely with the [ROOT clang-format style](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/.clang-format) can you please iron over new `roofit/hs3` package with `clang-format`, using the linked style file?; 3.

These tests should be in `roofit/hs3/tests` (compare [`roofit/roofitcore/test`](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/roofit/roofitcore/test) directory structure).

Yes, there is probably even more breakage than before now that the `cppyy` in ROOT is synced more with `cppyy` upstream. More files are expected to collide.

So the question to @adriansev is really: what's your usecase for installing cppyy in two different ways in the same environment? What does cppyy standalone give you that you won't get with ROOT? And why is the recommended way of dealing with this (virtual environments) not an option for you?. Many Linux distributions even *force* you to use virtual environments and don't allow `pip install --user` outside of virtual environments anymore. E.g. Arch, NixOS, or Ubuntu:; * https://askubuntu.com/questions/1465218/pip-error-on-ubuntu-externally-managed-environment-%C3%97-this-environment-is-extern.

They are only there because the ROOT repo includes some copies of other repos like `cppyy` and `llvm-project`, but not all files from these repos are actually used.

Otherwise, I think the issue can be closed. I'm happy to hear that Arch moves forward to Python 3.12 by the way :+1:.

Deployability,"Hi @egpbos, thanks a lot for the updates and great that everything now passes with the CI! I can also build ROOT on my system successfully with the new `zeromq` and `cppzmq` builtins that you introduced. However, I still have problems builting without the builtins, taking zeromq from the system. I installed zeromq from the GitHub master on my system, to make sure I have `zmq_ppoll`. One problem is that the check for the `zmq_ppoll` symbol doesn't seem to work (see inline comment above), and then the configuration fails with the following error:; ```; CMake Error at cmake/modules/SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake:17 (_find_package):; By not providing ""Findcppzmq.cmake"" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has; asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by ""cppzmq"", but; CMake did not find one.

Maybe there are some specific subtleties on my system that cause the build configuration not to work. Let's see with the CI when we disable builtins but enable roofit_multiprocess.

Deployability,"Hi @etejedor, thanks for your comments!. Enric and I had a meeting that resulted in the following action items for me:. 1. Remove the `test_` prefix from the roofit pythonization test files; 2. Come up with a mechanism that uses all the functions defined in the RooFit pythonization proxy classes for the pythonization, not excluding magic functions (which are often pythonized); 3. Check if the pythonization abstraction in this PR also allows for pythonizations with the C API; 4. Introduce Doxygen documentation for RooFit pyROOT. In my recent updates, I addressed bullet points 1, 2, and 3. 1. Was trivial to address; 2. I use now a combination of `mro()` and `funcname in klass.__dict__` to check if a new member function was defined in the corresponding Python class or any of it's base classes (inspired by [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5253397/check-if-class-attribute-was-defined-or-derived-in-given-class)); 3.

Deployability,"Hi @hageboeck and @manolismih, thanks for you comments! Sorry for the late answer, it took me some time to come up with a better solution. Making the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` aware of the batchmode is the biggest challenge in this PR, as you have noticed.; Like Stephan suggested, I have tried no to pass as much information as possible in the constructors to hopefully avoid some of the new member variables I introduced here. In part I have succeeded, because now the cache optimization will now always be skipped in the construction in batch mode is enabled. So I don't need a `_originallyCacheOptimized` flag to remember if the optimization has to be reverted after the construction which was not the nicest hack anyway. Still, I could not do without a new `_batchMode` flag in `RooAbsTestStatistic` because the cache optimization can also happen after the construction via `RooAbsTestStatistic::constOptimizeTestStatistic`. Adding a batch mode flag to the constructor also required me to change all the constructor signatures of `RooAbsTestStatistic` and derived classes. I took that opportunity to revisit how the configuration parameters are passed such that if the future it will be much easier to add a new parameter.

Deployability,"Hi @kratsg, thanks a lot for the detailed issue report!. I see the problem, but I don't understand exactly from your post and the linked pyhf discussion what the expected behavior is. Do you expect the XML schema to be updated to allow for this initial `ShapeFactor` nuisance parameter values, or do you want to prohibit that such a `Measurement` object can even be instantiated?. Both solutions have problems in my opinion. Restricting the measurement class would break usecases, and expanding the XML schema is promoting the use of a software component (HistFactory XML) that we consider as legacy. Both changes affect code used in production and are not bugfixes (but extending the HistFactory schema), so they can't be done for ROOT patch releases. So if I fix this one way or the other, the patch would only reach users by ROOT 6.30 which is who knows how many months away. We are currently working on a new IO format to replace the HistFactory XML, which is based on JSON (in the context of the HEP statistics serialization standard), and we plan for it to be ready for general use in ROOT 6.30 too. In that case, we can make sure that the models of the user in the pyhf issue thread are supported, such that he can share his model with his ROOT-using colleague via JSON. Therefore, what I suggest is to not start working on this issue now, and *only* if it turns out late in the 6.30 development cycle that we probably will not support this usecase in the HS3 JSON for some unforeseen reason, we can extend the XML schema. This way, we're sure that this problem is solved in ROOT 6.30. Does this sound okay to you, or do you have other suggestions?

Run the tests and tutorials in the build folder. So while there is an installation directory, the installation command is never invoked thus *all* the libraries are never installed in the `install` directory. This means that while I would like to put `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH ${CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_LIBDIR}` in the builtin_xrootd call as it is done in the general ROOT build options, on the nodes it wouldn't work. So the hope was that writing `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib` in the builtin_xrootd cmake invokation would correctly point the `LC_RPATH` of the libraries in the `build/lib` folder to `build/lib` while the ROOT configuration for installation would overwrite that variable to `install/lib` in the event that a user actually calls the installation command, which is not what happens in the nodes.

Analysis release 21.2.139 uses XRootD 4.10.0. (As it happens we switched to XRootD 4.12.2 just with AnalysisBase-21.2.140.) We've used XRootD 4.10.0 (in sync with external versions from [LCG_96b](http://lcginfo.cern.ch/release/96b/)) from 21.2.115 before that. Could you check which version of the analysis release you were using before 21.2.139?

Deployability,"Hi @vepadulano,. I think I have to disagree on all counts. The application that writes the data to a file may have it's own memory management policy and it should not be required for it to always use `SetOwner` on its data. Memory management in the reading application should be responsibility of the reading application, not writing one. . Your examples of `sqlite3` or Python files are misplaced, none of those is leaking memory like ROOT. Again, my point is that whatever Python extension does, it is not supposed to leak memory or require some special code to avoid memory leak. I do understand how Python garbage collection works but that has nothing to do with the memory leak in this case.

Deployability,"Hi @virenvarma007, thanks for reaching out to us about this issue!. Fortunately, you don't necessarily have to compile and set up ROOT yourself to work on this issue :) All you need it a working ROOT installation on your system. Which Linux distribution are you using? Most likely root is available as a package for your distribution, for example on Ubuntu you can just do `sudo apt install root` to install it. For more information on how to install ROOT also on different platforms, please take a look also at https://root.cern/install/. Once you have ROOT installed, you can download one of the roostats tutorials that you want to translate (maybe pick a shorter one in the beginning, like [rs101_limitexample](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tutorials/roostats/rs101_limitexample.C). Remember you just need the tutorial file, not the whole ROOT repository. To try out the tutorial, you can run it with the root interpreter by typing `root rs101_limitexample.C` in the command line. You will get a graph as a result. To translate the tutorial, you need to create a `rs101_limitexample.py` file where you exactly recreate the tutorial in pyROOT, such that one can run it with `python rs101_limitexample.py` and get the same graph than with the C++ version. When you have translated your first tutorial, you can make a pull request here with the new python file in the same directory as the C++ tutorials. You can find more information of ROOT and especially pyROOT for your usecase in the ROOT users manual: https://root.cern/manual/.

The evaluation was [completely replaced in 6.32](https://root.cern/doc/master/release-notes.html#new-cpu-likelihood-evaluation-backend-by-default).

Deployability,"Hi Axel,. Thanks for following up with me. I am involved with 2 groups that still rely on v5.34 to run legacy code: the P-27 group at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the DRAGON group at TRIUMF. I have tried to be diligent with making sure that v5.34 builds properly with as many options enabled as possible on MacOS so that in the event our mac users are forced to upgrade to the latest MacOS version, they would still be able to install v5.34 and run the plethora of analysis codes written for v5 that both of these groups still work with. This patch is needed to build v5.34 on MacOS with the version of mysql installed with the homebrew package manager on MacOS Mojave. . It is also worth noting that the DRAGON DAQ machine is currently a mac, and will likely be replaced with a mac, so at some time in the foreseeable future, DRAGON will be forced to upgrade to the latest MacOS, and the inability to build v5.34 will prevent DRAGON from running its DAQ frontend and online analysis program.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3352#issuecomment-461240072:368,upgrade,upgrade,368,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3352#issuecomment-461240072,5,"['install', 'patch', 'upgrade']","['install', 'installed', 'patch', 'upgrade']"

Deployability,"Hi Enric, ; Thank you very much! ; Indeed it is a kind of problem; I rely on pickling in my project for two cases:. 1. implicitely, where I use the `parallel python`/`multiprocess`/`multiprocessing`/`pathos` to split the task into subtasks that can be executed in parallel in different processes or even on different nodes. Behind the scene such stuff relies on serialization/deserialization of objects via `pickle` or `dill`; 2. explicitely where I store my data into custom `shelve`-like database, that relies on serialization of objects via pickling. - for (1) I do not know if I can properly inject ""import ROOT"" into the code flow at all vital occurances. ; - for (2) of course I can pre-import `ROOT` for all manipulations with custom database, but it is rather unnatural solution. E.g. opening a (originally `ROOT`-blind) database I need to know that it contains some `ROOT`-objects, and in this case use `import ROOT` before accessing objects from the database. Currently I've added `import ROOT` just in the code of database, but it is not a perfect solution.

Deployability,"Hi Luca,. nice job. Some comments about aspects that need improving before merging, namely all of the following items with equal priority:; 1) Remove all variable names in Italian language; 2) The help of the individual switches for the command line is there to be helpful. Please take some time to write proper text there, for example avoiding contentless tautologies like ""inputFile is the input file""; 3) The script is missing a description to be prompted when the user requires help with the -h switch. This description does not need to be a long text but a short synopsis of the utility. Adding example invocations would greatly increase its usefulness.; 4) You do not need to parse the header. I saw you now have a dictionary for the class. The autoloating and autoparsing will kick in and provide the ROOT typesystem with the necessary info. The direct usage of RunSumpleAnalysis should be discarded in favour of an explicit instantiation of a TSimpleAnalysis object (ROOT cannot autoload based on free function names); 5) ""Invalid argument set"" shall be printed on stderr; 6) The script must be compatible python2 and python3, e.g. for what concerns the print function; 7) The deciding factor for invoking the constructor with only the configuration file or the separate arguments is the presence of the ""inputfile"". The rest of the checks are not useful. One should rather make very clear in the documentation of the switches that the priority is given to the config file and perhaps print in case both a config and other parameters are present a warning about the non-config parameters being ignored.

Deployability,"Hi Patrick, thanks a lot for these excellent developments! I will start the Jenkins tests to see if the CI can build it. To successfully integrate these developments, we should split the changes up into smaller PRs, as discussed in the RooFit weekly meeting. We could, for example, chunk it like this:. 1. First PR with changes to `math` only (`mathcore` and `minuit2`). Please ensure that no commit in this PR doesn't touch both math packages at the same time if not necessary. As far as I understood, the changes to `mathcore` and `minuit2` factorize, and you can make a commit for `mathcore` and then one or more for `minuit2`.; 2. Second PR with the new `roofit` packages `multiprocess` and `roofitZMQ`, again with separate commits for the individual packages. I guess you'd have to exclude the multiprocessing test that depends on roofit at that point, though. In this PR, we can also discuss in more detail how to manage the zero MQ dependency.; 3. Third PR with the rest, integrating the new `multiprocess` and `roofit/ZMQ` packages into RooFit. Feel free to split it up further if you think that's better. Some general things to consider in the new PRs:. * It seems unfeasible to rewrite the commit history in this PR to something that factorizes as proposed above. I guess you need to create new commits from the diff that only affect single packages.; * Please avoid mixing code formatting changes with actual changes in the same commit.; * Even better, avoid code formatting changes altogether. We want to eventually use a well-defined clang-format style (specified in [this file](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/.clang-format)), so changing the formatting in your PRs to something that is not compliant with the clang-format style is not meaningful.; * If your developments introduce new files (in particular the new `roofit` packages), please apply the ROOT clang-format style, so we don't have to touch these files again later just for the sake of reformatting.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294#issuecomment-854587983:137,integrat,integrate,137,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294#issuecomment-854587983,2,['integrat'],"['integrate', 'integrating']"

Deployability,"Hi Sergey, . The class `TJSON` is indeed similar to the library of _nlohmann_ except a whole lot more lean (_nlohmann_ is 14,748 lines of code, while `TJSON` is 962 lines of code - as per `sloccount`). _nhlohmann_ tries to be very general and in fact expands upon the JSON standard, while `TJSON` tries to be as simple as possible. . Also, for `TJSON` I tried to do a bit of ROOT integration. For example, one can get arrays as `TArrayD` or `TArrayI` if possible, or one can assign from `TParameter<T>`. This is simple to make life a little easier for people. . That said, I have no particular preference for either. However, you should consider in the build system to use system available installation of _nlohmann_ instead of using built-in copy.

Deployability,"Hi Vassil,. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can; use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is; necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time,; so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator),; so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator; to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested; symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you; should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each; library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using; JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll; walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should; prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in; precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider; a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor; that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a; circular reference).

Deployability,"Hi Vicenzo,. I agree building your own python is perhaps somewhat uncommon (and it is especially nonsensical to do it on Fedora, which has up to date distribution packages for both ROOT and python). I was testing an environment intended for clusters where users would not have admin privileges but may generally benefit from improvements in newer python than included, and cppyy must be built with the python you're using for it to work. . I don't think the assertions were necessarily meant to be enabled here, and disabling them does ""fix"" this issue (as the assertion isn't checked), but I think that's potentially somewhat besides the point. While it's very rare to run a python that has assertions enabled, presumably the assertions are there for a reason, even if they're not checked in release builds. The failing invariant could be harmless, or it may be causing subtly wrong behavior in the GC that could cause seemingly random problems down the road in a more complicated script. On the other hand, it also looks like things change again in python 3.12...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13694#issuecomment-1739495970:793,release,release,793,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13694#issuecomment-1739495970,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Hi! Thanks for opening the issue. I have first added the `priority-high` label because it appeared like a usecase that worked in 6.24 was broken in 6.26, but I don't this is the case. Yes, the normalization was not off in 6.24, but the fit gave nonsensical results anyway for different reasons also in 6.24. Or did you manage to make this shifted RooHistPdf work in any ROOT version?. To me, the result of your script looks like this both in ROOT 6.24 and in ROOT `master` (upcoming 6.28, where the normalization issue got fixed by the way):. ![plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6578603/203787998-2652e495-f6b6-4d54-a2fc-64c66a96ac8a.png). I modified your script a bit to have more events in the toy dataset, and fixed the plotting order (you got to plot the data always the very first, otherwise the PDFs will not be scaled correctly). I think the best we can do now to support your usecase is this:. 1. Since shifting a RooHistPdf doesn't work in any ROOT version, I implement a custom PDF class that can do that which you can readily use; 2. For the upcoming ROOT 6.28, we will also make sure that the actual RooHistPdf support the shift; 3. About this issue with the normalization in 6.26, I'm not sure if it's worth it to address this since the problem is gone in ROOT 6.28 which will be released soon. Anyway, the problem only appears for models where the fit result was also wrong before for other reasons, so that temporary regression in 6.26 probably didn't break any existing usecase.

Deployability,"Hi, @hahnjo are you still working on this? Can you share your ideas? So I think the problem is:; When we try to instantiate a class template like `TSeq`, we'll try to look up and load modules (https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Sema/SemaTemplate.cpp#L10053) for `type` (https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/core/cont/inc/ROOT/TSeq.hxx#L95). Because the identifier `type` lives in module `ROOTDataFrame`, ROOT will try to load that. However, some headers in module `ROOTDataFrame` includes `TSeq.hxx` (https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RLazyDSImpl.hxx#L16), so we found a Decl that already been instantiated. At last, Clang will try to update the previous declaration and merge the definition. But because we're still instantiating it and it's incomplete so they're not matched.

First, I can confirm that TBB 2021 (now it's oneTBB 2021) has CMake build system. Second, oneTBB integration to CMake project may be done in two major ways:; 1. Source integration (`add_subdirectory`) - oneTBB is just built from sources together with user project.; 2. Binary integration (`find_package`) - user project relies on pre-built oneTBB, it is supported through TBBConfig files inside oneTBB packages, for some distributions/versions it will work out-of-the-box, but for others it may require additional CMake variable to be set.

Deployability,"Hi, some update on this. First, let me try to clear a bit the context. I am not sure why `gc.collect` is being invoked here. Manually invoking the Python garbage collector is not going to give any guarantees on which objects are actually destroyed by the interpreter, it depends on the types and sometimes it's even undefined behaviour, as per the docs https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html#gc.collect. Second, even if we had that guarantee, the first and the second loops are doing two wildly different things.; ```; my_data = rvec; ```; Is doing a copy of an `RVec` to another `RVec`, with a thin Python proxy to present it to the user. The copy of an RVec is a well-defined operation in terms of memory management, i.e. it will call the copy-constructor of the `RVec`. Whereas; ```; my_data = numpy.asarray(rvec); ```; Is creating a new numpy array object in memory which is an owning view on the contents of the RVec. The management of the RVec in memory can be clearly seen with this simplified example; ```; process = psutil.Process(). ROOT.gInterpreter.Declare(""""""; auto create_rvec(unsigned int n) {; //return std::array<unsigned int, 3>({n, n, n});; return ROOT::RVec<unsigned int>({n, n, n});; }; """"""); df = ROOT.RDataFrame(100).Define(""my_rvecs"", ""create_rvec(rdfentry_)""); rvecs = df.AsNumpy([""my_rvecs""])[""my_rvecs""]. def get_mem_usage():; return process.memory_info().rss # in kbytes. mem0 = get_mem_usage(); print(mem0). for v2 in rvecs:; n = v2; mem2 = get_mem_usage(); print(mem2); ```.

Deployability,"Hi, thanks for the question!. The standard way of do this in ROOT is to use [TParameter](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v612/classTParameter.html) or an `std::` container, as also discussed here:; https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/writing-simple-variable-in-root-files/11094/5. For example:; ```C++; void write() {.

Deployability,"Hi, thanks for the reports! Okay, the problem with the `RooRealSumPdf` hinted me that this new optimization was part of the problem (look for ""binned likelihood fit optimization"").; https://root.cern/doc/v628/release-notes.html. This optimization was used inside ATLAS for a long time to great success (speedups), so I was enabling it by default. However, it seems to be problematic here, maybe it doesn't work with the RooBarlowBeestonLL. You should for now disable it when the demo is compiled with ROOT 6.28. So the line with `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` in `histfact_demo.cpp` would become:; ```C++; #if ROOT_VERSION_CODE < ROOT_VERSION(6,28,00); auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas);; #else; // Disable the binned fit optimization that was enabled by default in ROOT 6.28.; // This optimization skips the normalization of the RooRealSumPdf, because; // the unnormalized bin contents already represent the yields that can be; // used by the RooNLLVar to sum the Poisson terms. However, this optimization; // doesn't work for this demo, maybe because it's not compatible with the; // RooBarlowBeestonLL. See also https://root.cern/doc/v628/release-notes.html.; HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast::Configuration cfg;; cfg.binnedFitOptimization = false;; auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas, cfg);; #endif; ```.

Deployability,"Hi,. Thanks for trying to recreate it! I tried on my end as well, trying to recreate the code snippet the best I can in a standalone .cxx file. Unfortunately, I also couldn't obtain this ""Invalid write of size 1"" either. I have tried with the exact same pathways, same ROOT version, and same compiler. I copied quite a bit of code over to this standalone file from the project. My best guess is that it's a transient problem, and could be a side-effect of memory issues elsewhere in the code. My setup on lxplus while attempting to reproduce the problem; ```; > lsetup ""root 6.28.08-x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt""; > source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/contrib/gcc/13.1.0/x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt/setup.sh; > gcc --version; gcc (GCC) 13.1.0; > root -b -q; Welcome to ROOT 6.28/08; > g++ -o <output> <standalone_file>.cxx `root-config --cflags --glibs`; ```. My setup using setupATLAS when compiling the project ; (And tested with the standalone file as well); ```; setupATLAS; asetup AnalysisBase,24.2.27; ```. **Regarding the debug build**; I used the latest corresponding to `x86_64-el9-gcc13-dbg`; ```; source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/dev3/latest/x86_64-el9-gcc13-dbg/setup.sh; ```. However, this gives a ROOT version of ROOT 6.31/01, which is higher than what I compiled for (6.28/08). With this upgraded ROOT version, my project no longer compiles. (And since we don't plan on updating past the AnalysisBase release, I don't plan to fix the compilation error 🙂); If there's a way of obtaining a debug build of ROOT 6.28/08, I can try it. This coredump only started appearing when our compiler version changed from x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt to x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt, and we moved to AnalysisBase,24.2.27 from AnalysisBase,22.2.113.

Deployability,"Hi,. the LHCb point of view on the issue is that we must be able to know which code we executed, mostly for debugging purposes (understanding why the trigger application took a specific decision counts as debugging for me). When you have an application that can decide which version of a function to run depending on something you cannot control, like the specific CPU on the Grid node or the time of the day, makes the debugging much more tricky (at some point we started storing in each event the binary id and the CPU type used for that event), so we decided that we do not want this kind of automatic dispatching: an application compiled to run on a Nehalem equivalent CPU should run only instructions valid for Nehalem processors, even if the actual CPU can do better. Our approach is that we still have some functions that have different implementations for different instructions sets (basically scalar, sse4.2 and avx2), but we chose at compile time which one to use by adding something like `-mavx2` or `-march=haswell` to the compile flags. And yes, it should be a cmake flag, but you are most welcome to have also the `ARCH=dynamic` option. OTOH you are talking about RooFit and AFAIK we do not use it in trigger, reconstruction or simulation software, but it is only used for the analysis, and there we have less constraints, as it has become common practice to use Conda based installations, so builds and versions decoupled from our production software.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361#issuecomment-791253985:1390,install,installations,1390,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361#issuecomment-791253985,1,['install'],['installations']

Deployability,"I agree that it is an unfortunate circumstance to have the test not passing. However, I still urge you to consider the effect on debugability removing strict tests will have. I have wasted a lot of time trying to track down a subtle bug due to loose tests which left me unable to determine where the bug came from. Conversely, setting tests strictly and tracing discrepancies, I found a different bug in the Kahan sum: #11940. Unit tests especially should be as strict as possible. In absence of unit tests (which unfortunately is the case for the parts of RooFit I worked on), strict ""integration"" tests like these are the closest I could get. Note also that it was simply part of my original assignment: to ensure users can trust the new parallelized methods, I built them to be bit-wise exactly equal to the old methods. So, I know from experience how tedious it is to trace down these bit-wise differences to their actual concrete source, but also think that because we are dealing with scientific software, precision, robustness, reliability and interpretability (of components and hence the whole) are important. Of course, performance is an important factor too, but it's just one of the aspects. We want the end-results of experiments to be accurate and explainable, right? I personally at least don't like when I have to sell a ""because of floating point errors"", because I've been bitten by them a few times now. Now, I'm also well aware that the project only has a given amount of resources and I myself am currently more or less out of resources (I can spend only my free time), so my vote probably doesn't count strongly :) If I could be of more practical help in this, I would definitely be happy to, but I also don't have a non-x86 machine, so it's not feasible for me to do much right now.

Deployability,"I agree that there is a problem, and it comes from the fact that you cannot easily depend on Vdt via targets when Vdt is builtin. CMake complains about headers in the interface which are in the build directory in that case, so a lot of workarounds are needed and no workaround works reliably across CMake versions. When I last touched this, we decided to use variables and rely on the fact that vdt headers were installed into the same place as ROOT headers when Vdt was builtin. However, when Vdt and ROOT are installed separately and into different locations, this doesn't work so well indeed.

Deployability,I also found the culprit of the new CI failures. It's the Python [tblib](https://github.com/ionelmc/python-tblib) package (a dependency of Dask) that specifically treats the serialization/deserialization of exceptions.

Deployability,"I am looking for a hotfix for the upcoming llvm release. The patch would be in the [area](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/master/lib/Support/DynamicLibrary.cpp#L76-L92):; * I plan to remove the NDEBUG assert; * Make the `std::vector<void*>` a `std::vector<llvm::PointerIntPair<void*, 1, bool>>`; * Add a default flag to `addPermanentLibrary` saying if it was opened with RTLD_GLOBAL; * I will change the search order to search for first the one that are not marked RTLD_GLOBAL. A real solution I've discussed with Lang privately is that we should figure out a way how to pass the dlopened handle to the cling interpreter (before any parsing happens) and have a call to dlsym before calling the DynamicLibrary [here](https://github.com/root-project/cling/blob/master/lib/Interpreter/IncrementalJIT.cpp#L320). This would only happen after the next release of LLVM. I appreciate your proposed solutions but I do not really have a lot of bandwidth nowadays to investigate why they do not work for us.

I have been using ROOT for 10+ years, I want to see my plot in a canvas. Now the default canvas is the web canvas, so it will go through the only browser it can find on my machine, safari. That breaks functionality w.r.t. how I was using the canvas before. So, that's something we want to fix, right?. In general, I would imagine that at the very least for the three most commonly used browsers i.e. Chrome, Safari, Firefox (Edge even?) we should be able to provide exactly the same functionality to users. Writing in the documentation that they need to install google chrome on their machine in order to have a properly working canvas is not an option in my opinion.

Deployability,"I discovered 2 memory hoarding issues (which were seen from code paths that were not scaling as expected with the number of dlopen/dlclose cycles). However, the underlying problem is still present but is due glic itself. As seen in https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=tree;f=stdlib;h=b5a85b12ee3a72ea2a6df2be8bea9d0eba38eeb5;hb=refs/heads/release/2.28/master in the files `cxa_atexit.c` and `cxa_finalize.c. When a library is loaded, the atexit functions (including global object destructors) are added to a global linked list `__exit_funcs` (see [cxa_atexit](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blame;f=stdlib/cxa_atexit.c;h=6d65f7e615bd8e9b0bcdb4655945d7ddfc514f2b;hb=refs/heads/release/2.28/master) ). In `cxa_finalize.c` that list is looped over (see line [34+](https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=blame;f=stdlib/cxa_finalize.c;hb=c41041bc2f84eb8f44ff36c3d14e55944185e665#l34)). However, the `__exit_funcs` is never cleaned up (and apparently element are not reused at least in our case). The number of iterations in that loop increased with the number of dlopen/dlclose cycles square. (Indeed the output of callgrind (with `--dump-inst=yes`) confirms that this (and even worse the inner loop) exactly as `(N*(N-1)/2) N=number of dlopen/dlclose`. So the best we can do is to adjust the test length to fit within the timeout (the length is to increase the chances of multi-thread clash).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12863#issuecomment-1561881205:345,release,release,345,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12863#issuecomment-1561881205,2,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"I don't really understand your question. 😕. [tutorials/eve7/boxset.C](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tutorials/eve7/boxset.C) doesn't seem to need `nlohmann/json.hpp`, does it?. The nlohmann_json ""library"" is a pure header ""library"". It does not need to be distributed with the ROOT binaries for those binaries to be functional. All the symbols from `nlohmann/json.hpp` are compiled into the ROOT binaries themselves. 🤔. You ""only"" need `nlohmann/json.hpp` when using a ROOT header in your own build that itself publicly uses `nlohmann/json.hpp`. For that you do need that actual header. So I'm still pretty convinced that this is a relatively simple mistake. The machine on which 6.30 was built, probably had nlohmann_json installed on it recently. And people doing the ROOT binary builds didn't notice that their build now picked up nlohmann_json from the system. This does shine light on a deeper issue though. 😦 The ROOT CMake configuration is a bit too autonomous for my liking. 😦 It will too easily turn features on/off based on what it finds. Instead of asking the user explicitly to specify what they want to have on or off. If it was up to me, I'd remove most of the automation in how the build figures out what it should do, and rather introduce a bunch of [CMake presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) to ease the life of the users a little. For the latter, we're using those pretty happily in this project for instance:; - https://github.com/acts-project/algebra-plugins/; - https://github.com/acts-project/algebra-plugins/blob/main/CMakePresets.json.

For example, if you want to scan the `math` directory, you can do:; ```diff; diff --git a/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/CMakeLists.txt b/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/CMakeLists.txt; index 0b046717ba..b685291490 100644; --- a/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/CMakeLists.txt; +++ b/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/CMakeLists.txt; @@ -283,7 +283,7 @@ list(INSERT CMAKE_MODULE_PATH 0. # Generate a CompilationDatabase (compile_commands.json file) for our build,; # for use by clang_complete, YouCompleteMe, etc.; -set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS 1); +set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS 0). option(LLVM_INSTALL_BINUTILS_SYMLINKS; ""Install symlinks from the binutils tool names to the corresponding LLVM tools.""

UnZoom does not return to the previous zoom (SetRangeUser), it goes back to the full range of the axis. <img width=""917"" alt=""Screenshot 2022-01-28 at 08 26 30"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4697738/151505855-17ccfdfc-e4a1-47d3-9d4c-76225f2fb10f.png"">. The messing up you see on the unzoom picture are the two TGaxis defined on a zoomed view (SetRangeUser in the macro) ie: the coordinates you give in the zoomed view (the initial plot is already zoomed) are not correct in an unzoom one (see the TExec explanation I gave before) .

Deployability,"I guess the question is whether ROOT should interfere with what you installed in your system. Let's say you have something installed in `/usr/include/nlohmann`. Now you install ROOT, and for some reason it came with a builtin nlohmann_json (e.g. because of a different version). Now, everything in your system that was relying on the original nlohman_json version is broken.; I thought that as far as reasonably possible, ROOT should not interfere with what you install in your system (i.e. it should leave all headers and libraries untouched), unless they are ROOT's own headers/libraries?. You are correct that projects building against that installed ROOT would need to know about the include location, but I would think that this is ROOT's job (by exporting CMake targets such as ROOT::nlohmann). Maybe that's what users expect of ROOT, but I was at least surprised to have stuff installed that I didn't ask for. Let me rephrase this, maybe:; You install X from source.

Deployability,"I have in the mean time found the root cause why my patch fails:; - It is due to copy relocations of <iostream> symbols from libstdc++; - Crashes happen whenever cling wants to output text via cout / cerr / etc.; - The problem is that there are 2 instances of cout / cerr: The first created by the executable itself through copy relocation, when the executable prints something via cout. The second created by libCling loaded with RTLD_DEEPBIND. (By design, RTLD_DEEPBIND links to libstdc++ first before checking the global namespace, so it does not see the copy-relocated symbol.). The problem can be avoided if executables are compiled with -fPIC as well.; I just tried locally to compile the failing ROOT ctests with -fPIC and this fixed the segmentation faults.; The question is whether this is a proper solution, since it would require to compile all executables with -fPIC.

Deployability,"I have trouble compiling the ALICE O2 with ROOT and some other libraries, which come with LLVM.; For me, this is in particular:; - arrow with gandiva; - glfw with vulkan support; - several OpenCL runtimes, which use LLVM. I was getting the error `...please hide them or dlopen() them after the call to TROOT::InitInterpreter()` and a segmentation fault thereafter. Now, it is a bit complicated to require from all 3rd party libraries that they do not export LLVM symbols, so I was trying to solve the problem on the ROOT side. I fully agree that the problem is most likely due to just in time resolving of symbols. But I am wondering why my patch would break something in the ROOT ctests. Before my patch, the check would make sure that there are no other LLVM symbols present. But when there are no other symbols present, my patch shouldn't change anything.

Deployability,"I have updated the contents of the CERNBox link from the PR description with more memray graphs, it looks clear that the effect of this PR is to properly remove the artifacts generated during the distributed execution, there is no more TTreeCache leaking leftover after the analysis (see any file ending with `_patch` and compare it with the same file ending with `_master`). Now that the main source of memory usage is gone, I have noticed a much smaller contribute that still seems to make the memory increase in the flamegraphs. And it seems to have something to do with the increased number of files, at least on the surface. Let's take the following two files to compare:; * test_agc_9sample_1file_10task_patch.html; * test_agc_9sample_10file_10task_patch.html. They are running exactly the same script, with all 9 RDF samples. In the first case we have 1 file per sample, in the second case 10 files per sample. The memray flamegraph report a total of 253.5 MB used for the first case and 260.9 MB used for the first case (7.4 MB delta). There are two main parts of the graph: the one deriving from the `clone` of the Dask process, where the actual analysis code is run, and the one deriving from the `_start` function where most of the Python code around the analysis is (things like `import`ing packages or the Dask worker-scheduler communication). The difference between the two graphs in the `clone` part is of 0.6 MB, the difference between the two `_start` parts is 6.7 MB, so I focus on that from now on. This 6.7 MB difference is in turn split between a 0.1 MB difference deriving from `_PyObject_VectorcallTState` and 6.6 MB difference deriving from. Finally, the vast majority of these 6.6 MB comes from:; * The metrics gathered by profiling (i.e. memray itself); * Dask communication protocol.

Deployability,"I now understand what is going wrong: @Axel-Naumann pushed me into the right direction by noticing that the errors concern vtables and typeinfo symbols, which are subject to reemission on our side. Then our `WeakTypeinfoVTablePass` will mark them as `weak` to make sure the JIT infrastructure deduplicates the symbols as needed. Additionally, `ReuseExistingWeakSymbols` will entirely remove the definitions if the symbol can be found in the process, for example for compiled classes. Now the problem is that the symbols were originally marked as ""local to the shared library"" and relocations can take advantage of this. This is where `PreventLocalOptPass` comes in, but it ran before the two passes mentioned before and therefore doesn't consider these symbols. So tldr, we can fix the problems by reordering the passes.

The first commit is from https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16391 and changes compared to the original PR version are separate commits to ease review - I plan to eventually squash them before merging. > I think we should test suppressed columns with staged clusters. Done, and it was indeed broken... > I wonder if it wouldn't be better, after all, to make staged clusters part of the normal code path. We would then have `CommitCluster()` being a shorthand for `StageCluster(); CommitStagedClusters();`. As discussed, it would mean that in the code you have to use a different API of you want to use staging. But perhaps that's not such a big deal. After all, even now you have to add extra code to commit the staged clusters. Partially done:; * I propose to rename `RNTupleFillContext::CommitCluster()` to `FlushCluster()`. This conveys the user intent, but gives flexibility to the implementation. `CommitStagedClusters()` can always be called.; * The new sink methods are `StageCluster()` and `CommitStagedClusters()`, for which `CommitCluster()` is a shorthand. The exception is `RPageSinkBuf` where we should still implement it directly because we can do so more efficiently. It is also needed to guarantee sequential files, which might not be the case with two separate critical sections.

Also, if you install your own multiple versions of ROOT with `make install`, I recommend installing into an empty directory, not `/usr/local` where Homebrew may have installed it. Then you can just `rm -rf` if needed to uninstall. If you install into `/usr/local` with a package manager, just use the package manager to uninstall. Installing with `make install` a custom ROOT that overwrites another installation with a package manager is going to get you into trouble and `make uninstall` will not help much. With the uninstall target, if you change configuration before uninstalling, you may have half-uninstalled ROOT left over (e.g by enabling/disabling `pyroot_experimental` between make install/make uninstall), or may remove important files from other packages depending on what builtins you had enabled when you built ROOT.

Deployability,"I replied via email, but GitHub does not seem to have picked it up, so posting here for good measure:. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time, so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator), so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ ( ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so"" provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""... ; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382:949,install,install,949,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382,1,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"I said this in my original comments, I am not sure that adding a `ROOT::Libraries` target will help much. It goes against modern CMake usage, and now even things like dataframe can be disabled during configuration, so if someone links against `ROOT::Libraries` to get dataframe, it might not be there. ROOT library targets propagate C++ standard, include directories, and link dependencies now, so I think that it's best to use those when linking instead of a generic target that may or may not contain the libraries you need. We still have the old style `${ROOT_LIBRARIES}` that contains what `root-config --libs` contains if one wants to go that route.

Since all registered options are global statics, we would also remove all of the intended options.; 2. ~~`rootcling` uses the predefined help options~~. Since I don't think it's an option to rename the `-W` option, here's my proposal:. To solve first issue, we need to put these in a function such that the options are constructed at run time. This is a bit unfortunate as it will increase the startup time of `rootcling` a bit, but on the other hand I don't expect it to be much. ~~The second issue is easily fixed by adding those options by hand.~~.

Deployability,"I will probably state a few obvious things:; - Maintaining a single documentation (like the web pages and doxygen) is better than having several (partially overlapping, partially complementing) documentations around. For maintenance and for users to know where to look.; - If there is a man page it should be up to date (outdated information can be worse than missing man page, if there is no man page you look for other resources instead of wasting time with wrong information). Part of my motivation to make the update PR was that doing and merging the update is relatively straight forward and I can do part of the work for you. The possible deprecation and removal of the page is your business.; - What I like about man pages wrt the full online documentation is: works w/o internet (imagine bad hotel wifi or overloaded conference wifi) and changing from the shell to a browser and clicking through 4 links, just to look up if it was `root -e 'std::cout << ""hello world"";'` or `-c`, is a mildly annoying hazzle. Having a short cli doc at hand at the cli is convenient. (This also means that the man page doesn't need to go beyond documenting the cli behaviour).; - trying both `<command> --help` and `man <command>` to figure out which is available, is mildly frustrating. (That inconsistency is more a problem of all the software out there, and root can just catch that by having docs on both calls). So, my opinion: I'm fine if the man pages get removed for maintenance reasons (or possibly better get cut down to links to the forum and online doc). I would prefer if they stay (though tbh, I myself only use those for `root`, `root-config`, and `hadd`. And the one for `root-config` could even get shortened. e.g.: The ""how to use root in a cmake project"" is already findable on the web page, I haven't seen the same for bare make or autoconf as it's now in the man page).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1487#issuecomment-356994647:514,update,update,514,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1487#issuecomment-356994647,2,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"I would again prefer to have a run-time option and I think I have a solution that satisfies everyone. This is implemented in my latest patch https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705/commits/365bd46563c025a5341b48e6d199b2aa4be76c4e. I think we need to collect the prefix stack if we want to be able to filter out, for example, messages from MnLineSearch that happen inside MnMigrad, but not those that happen inside MnHesse. That's why I think the prefix stack should stay. It is also fast, since only a couple of pointers are copied around. However, there is no need to show the full stack of prefixes. By default, MnPrint could just show the prefix from the innermost scope. I added the static method `MnPrint::ShowPrefixStack(bool yes)` to toggle showing the full prefix or not. The default is off so that the messages are not too long. I also now implemented filtering of messages based on the value of the prefix stack. When no filters are set, all messages are shown. Once a filter is set, only messages that match the filter are shown. This is done with strings, using `MnPrint::AddFilter` and `MnPrint::ClearFilter` to reset the filters. Filtering works like `grep` on the full prefix, the message is shown if any of the filter strings match. To only see messages from `MnHesse`, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""MnHesse"");; ```; To only see messages from `MnHesse` called from VariableMetrixBuilder, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""VariableMetricBuilder:MnHesse"");; ```; To only match the beginning of the prefix string, use ""^"". For example,; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""^MnHesse"");; ```; only matches direct execution of MnHesse, but not MnHesse called by MnMigrad. It also works with substrings. To see all messages from any Gradient calculator, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""Gradient"");; ```; to match AnalyticalGradientCalculator, Numerical2PGradientCalculator, and InitialGradientCalculator. Filtering is not implemented in a very efficient way to keep ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-733046580:135,patch,patch,135,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-733046580,4,"['patch', 'toggle']","['patch', 'toggle']"

Deployability,"I've been able reproduce this on my desktop (CentOS7, gcc 8.3) when building ROOT from source. The parameter that makes it fail is `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17` (C++ 14 works fine). The reason is: when passing a Python callable as a parameter of a function (e.g. the `TF1` constructor in your example) cppyy automatically generates a C++ wrapper for it. As part of the wrapper generation, cppyy jits Python headers, some of which still use (in Python2) the `register` keyword, which causes an error in C++ 17. For example, when running your reproducer with dev3 these errors appear first:. ```; In file included from /cvmfs/sft-nightlies.cern.ch/lcg/nightlies/dev3python2/Thu/ROOT/HEAD/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/CPyCppyy/API.h:30:; In file included from /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/Python/2.7.16-3adfa/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/python2.7/Python.h:88:; /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/Python/2.7.16-3adfa/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/python2.7/unicodeobject.h:534:5: error: ISO C++17 does not allow 'register' storage class specifier [-Wregister]; register PyObject *obj, /* Object */; ^~~~~~~~~; ```. this is what ultimately causes the `TF1` constructor error, since the C++ wrapper for the Python callable can't be generated.

Deployability,"I've modified the system to require an explicit request to modify the source tree to build the standalone redistributable; it now builds in place with no copying if you just build inside the ROOT source tree. I've added a Travis test for the build (both copy and no copy versions) since the build is very fast. So the current version allows:; * Building directly from the `/math/minuit2` directory while inside ROOT. No copies or modifications to the source directory are made. `add_subdirectory`, `make install`, `make package` (binary), and `find_package`; * Building directly from the `/math/minuit2` directory with `-Dminuit2-standalone=ON` set. This will copy the needed files into the minuit2 source directory so that `make package_source` is supported - allowing stand-alone redistributable packages to be produced. `make purge` cleans the source directory.; * Building from stand-alone redistributable packages produced above. Using `add_subdirectory`, `make install`, `make package` (binary), and `find_package` are all supported.

If i set binary buffer (void* 'mem' variable) and set its size in bytes ('size' variable), what does the 'maxsize' variable mean? Isn't it obvious how much memory needs to be allocated if the 'size' parameter is specified?; 'maxsize' optional parameter may specify something else, but, unfortunately, i can't find meaning of the parameters in the current ROOT reference guide. Please, add this check, because the presence of the both 'size' and 'maxsize' variables is not obvious, at least, for me. So, i never used the 'maxsize' parameter. After the addition, i'll check one more. Other tests have passed well.; The fixes in older branches is not required (i can use own patches).

At this point, the integration with RooFitExtensions may have already broken subtly. `RooExpandedDataHist::get_wgt` was still virtual (_edit: actually doesn't matter that it was virtual, I guess, it was just shadowing_), so from this point it would be shadowing `RooDataHist::get_wgt`: it would no longer be relegated to from inside `RooDataHist` as it would before 155032e, but would only be called from inside RooFitExtensions, leading to two different `get_wgt` calls.

Deployability,It looks like that clang stores candidates for diagnostics and then does analysis on `clang::Sema::HandleEndOfTranslationUnit` call. When autoloading we call `TCling::RegisterModule` which in turn can call *many* times `clang::Sema::HandleEndOfTranslationUnit`. Second half of the `TCling::RegisterModule` body suppresses diagnostics this silences warnings coming from Sema and flushes the collected candidates. The case here is a little odd: the diagnostics fires only in ROOT built with release mode. The branches being taken by both release and debug mode seem identical. It looks like the debug mode somehow enters in silence diagnostics mode and release does not. This PR is not critical for the runtime cxxmodules development but it fixes the broken autoloading behavior of 'regular' ROOT.

Deployability,"Just updated according to your suggestion in another PR https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11948#discussion_r1054468412 . @lmoneta Thank you for your suggestion and reviewing. The behavior of the added `TH1::GetCumulativeIncExc` is equivalent to the original `TH1::GetCumulative` *only* for 1D histograms (`fDimension == 1`). The behavioral difference in higher-dimensional histograms is to ensure that the output is still sensible when calculating selection efficiencies. According to the [documentation](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTH1.html#a5709d315b774a89b1f7e6a71b0e9c380), the original implementation of `GetCumulative` method may not make sense for higher-dimensional use. This would be a good reason to replace the existing method with this one.

Deployability,"Looking for general direction here. This is the current patch:. * Add a new hidden option, `ROOT_PYTHON_NO_LINK`, that turns off linking to Python.; * This option also turns on a check when loading libraries, to manually attempt to load libpython for the user. The directory that libpython is in should be searched (it will be on package systems like conda); * The name of libpython is stored in RConfigure.h (since you need to know both the python version and the build flags to determine it). We could strip the final extension as it's not needed to load. Names, etc. can easily be changed if this looks like the right way to do it.

Deployability,"Looking into it a bit more, I think the right fix is indeed to move `CheckCompiler` above `RootBuildOptions`, and then fix the problem with Windows. That problem is a circular dependency:. 1. `RootBuildOptions.cmake` depends on `CheckCompiler.cmake`, because e.g. the default value of the `root7` option (set in `RootBuildOptions`) depends on the value of `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` (set in `CheckCompiler`); 2. however, `CheckCompiler.cmake` includes `SetUpWindows.cmake`, which uses `CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR` in a couple of install commands. `CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR` is set by `RootInstallDirs` which is included by `RootBuildOptions`, completing the circle. @amadio suggested moving the `install` commands Windows needs from `SetUpWindows` to `RootConfiguration`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6406#issuecomment-696701809:521,install,install,521,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6406#issuecomment-696701809,2,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"Maybe a few more notes to make the review easier, because this is a huge patch. * The previous code used macros to log things. I found that the macros are not needed, so I replaced all the macros with method calls to MnPrint::Error, MnPrint::Info, ....; * The old logging made a useful habit of prefixing messages with a string to indicate the origin, e.g. when you logged from MnHesse, messages would be prefixed with ""MnHesse:"". Inside ``MnHesse``, to stay with the example, you might have seen code like this; ```c++; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some foo happened"");; [...]; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; Setting the prefix by hand was error prone and repetetive and made the logging code more distractive from the actual code. Especially now, since all the debug messages should also have this prefix, I wanted to automate this. So I turned MnPrint into a class that one can instantiate with a prefix for a given scope.; ```c++; MnPrint print(""MnHesse""); // appears once at the beginning of a long method; [...]; print.Info(""Some foo happened"");; [...]; print.Info(""Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; print.Info(""Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; The method ``MnPrint::Info`` uses the prefix set in the MnPrint ctor. The ctor of MnPrint also has an optional argument to print with a local print level. If this is not set, the global print level is used. In the long run (not in this patch), we should get rid of the global print level, because global mutable variables are difficult to reason about and in particular do not play nice with multi-threading. This design prepares for that step.; * I generally made sure that the logging messages contain the same information as the previous ones, but I reduced excess whitespace and improved the formatting. Some debug messages added several empty lines to the output, which made the logs hard to read.; * In very few isolated cases I removed redundant messages.

According to this [forum post](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/compiling-error-conflicting-types-alpine-linux/28193/3), nothing from this file is in fact used and thus it should be possible to remove the include - based on the `fpu_control.h` [source code](https://code.woboq.org/userspace/glibc/sysdeps/x86/fpu_control.h.html) and a simple `grep`, this should hold for all ROOT components, except `math/mathcore/src/triangle.c`, which uses `_FPU_SETCW` at line 4888.

Deployability,"No, there is exactly one remaining usage of the global lock which still needs to be addressed. This happens when the TFile object is added or removed from the global list of UUIDs.

But this isn't safe in general as we previously discussed, since it could break the (maybe esoteric) case where a TRef points to a TFile object. One way out could be to add another static switch to TFile (a la ```TFIle::SetReadStreamerInfo(false)``) to disable this.

Deployability,"Note from the JIRA tickets:. Summary of discussion related to this ticket and https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9543. In the issue #9543, the unusual situation is the combination of:. * there is (intentionally) no dictionary for `std::map<int,std::vector<int>>`; * consequently we use an ""emulated collection proxy"" for that collection; * there is (unintentional due to external config) interpreter information/ClassInfo for `std::map<int,std::vector<int>>`. The crux of the issue #9543 is:. * TClass::fSizeof info prefers the information from the CollectionProxy; * TStreamerInfo::fSize is set to the value of TClass::fSizeOf; * TClass:New prefers the constructor from the interpreter; * TStreamerInfo::New was using TClass::New for that case; * On the failing platform, the `sizeof(std::map<int,std::vector<int>>)` is larger than the size of the emulated collection. Since the I/O and TStreamerInfo uses the TCollection proxy and all of TStreamerInfo needs to prefer the information from the collection proxy (including the 'sizeof'). To fix #9543 the solution is for; * TStremearInfo::New to prefer/use TCollectionProxy::New over TClass::New (i.e. the interpreted constructor in this particular case). Since we can access the emulated collection through the CollectionProxy, it makes sense to have `TClass` to be a way to access/use the interpreted instance. In order to be consistent (`TClass:New` already prefers the interpreted information), TClass::fSizeOf should be set the sizeof the interpreted instance. In addition to the patch mentioned at https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8273?focusedCommentId=76181&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-76181,; we also need the following changes:. * TClass::SetClassInfo needs to update `TClass::fSizeof` when a (new) ClassInfo is set.; * TStreamerInfo::fSize needs to prefer the value of `TCollectionProxy::SizeOf()` over the value of `TClass::fSizeof`",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9543#issuecomment-1013280108:1544,patch,patch,1544,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9543#issuecomment-1013280108,2,"['patch', 'update']","['patch', 'update']"

The really new thing (although maybe not a product, but side-effect) is the p. I understand that removing the default would break backward compatibility, so I am not advocating just removing the thing in the next release.

Deployability,"Ok yes, this is exactly the same underlying issue as ROOT-9487 mentioned above, but for single-thread runs this time, so the workaround mentioned in ROOT-9487 does not work (and indeed adding `ROOT.EnableImplicitMT()` at the top of the repro gets rid of the warnings). The issue: `Snapshot` adds the output tree as a clone of the input chain, because the output tree needs to be informed when the addresses of the input branches change (as it happens when the chain switches from one tree to the next). Now, when performing the address updates, the input chain might complain _once per active branch_ if it does not find a corresponding branch in the output tree. I don't know how to solve this elegantly.

Deployability,"Ok, we reached the first milestone: the upgrade builds on all platforms :tada: . The next step is to investigate the failures in ROOT's tests (but please don't look at the last test report from the new CI, it's incomplete because I messed up the paths when uploading the results; it was done properly in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13310). We have a couple of failures across all platforms, and the easiest to understand is that LLVM 16 prepends `class` or `struct` less often for C++ class types. Eventually this comes down to (on `master`):; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] A a; (A &) @0x7f8a3ca38000; root [2] struct A b; (struct A &) @0x7f8a33db2000; ```; whereas LLVM 16 now prints; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] A a; (A &) @0x7f025c5a6000; root [2] struct A b; (A &) @0x7f025c5a0000; ```. Similarly the following used to output (on `master`):; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] .Class A; ===========================================================================; struct A; SIZE: 1 FILE: ROOT_prompt_0 LINE: 1; List of member variables: -------------------------------------------------; List of member functions: -------------------------------------------------; filename line:size busy function type and name; (compiled) (NA):(NA) 0 public: struct A f();; ```; while with LLVM 16 we get; ```; (compiled) (NA):(NA) 0 public: A f();; ```; (funnily enough, `struct A { struct A f(); };` still outputs `public: struct A f();` for LLVM 16). This affects a couple of Cling tests and 3 ROOT tests: `roottest-cling-operator-runEqualTest`, `roottest-cling-template-separateDict-make`, and `roottest-cling-template-separateDictNamespace-make`. I propose we just update the expected reference output and be done with it.

Deployability,"Originally, I used https://github.com/GooFit/Minuit2 - that uses a python script to re-copy the changed files from the ROOT sources. Being a git repository, it also easily is included as a submodule in the `/extern` folder for GooFit, for example. After meeting and talking with @lmoneta a couple of days ago over a coffee, he outlined the procedure I initially implemented. He showed me the old ""build"" directory, with an old bash script that copied the necessary files out. He wanted me to make a new folder to eventually replace his build folder. The idea is that you could create source distributions that would be packaged and made available as downloads to continue the outdated ones available here: http://project-mathlibs.web.cern.ch/project-mathlibs/minuit/release/download.html. I added this though `make package_source`, and included `make package` for binary distributions as well. The integrated version does look a bit better, though it is a bit more invasive and not nearly as well separated. I do need to copy to `/inc/Math`, etc, since a source distribution needs to be in the source directory. Everything is copied to `INSTALL_PREFIX/include` when it's installed or packaged for a binary distribution. As for use, a git only solution really is not feasible, unfortunately, with any method that does not include git submodules. The current methods for a user are:. * Install beforehand from one of the downloadable packages, either building a source package or installing a binary package. This is the way some people will get it, but not ideal for a modern package that wants to have minimal dependencies.; * Have CMake download and build the package with `ExternalProject` - probably the best solution for now, still not as nice for something like GooFit that already has all dependencies as git submodules.; * Check out all of ROOT as a submodule, then `add_subdirectory(extern/root/math/minuit2)`. Much more disk space usage that needed, but otherwise also a decent solution.

Deployability,"Re-joining the discussion a bit late... Installing debug symbols for our analysis releases on CVMFS would be pretty difficult. Our builds do produce a separate RPM for the debug symbols of our own code. (Though we didn't even use that machinery for the analysis releases yet.) But when we build XRootD for our standalone analysis release, we don't bother with the ""RelWithDebInfo"" CMake build mode. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0/External/XRootD/CMakeLists.txt#L55-60. This is because every ""external project"" has a different implementation for this. And coding up how we would produce just one ""ATLAS RPM"" that contains just the debug symbol files for all the externals seemed way too much trouble. For such debugging we would use a full-on Debug build instead. But the more relevant thing: Does XRootD, or any of the I/O libraries that it uses, make use of OpenMP? Putting aside all the weird linking issue possibilities, the one unusual thing that RD's MCFM build does is that it sets the following environment variable for the jobs:. ```sh; export OMP_STACKSIZE=16000; ```. Since apparently MCFM does use OpenMP. (This I checked.) Though I don't know why this variable would need to be set manually. With a quick Google search I saw that for instance gfal, at least at one point, used OpenMP. So I wonder if maybe OpenMP is responsible for something here. It shouldn't interfere with ROOT's usage of TBB (at least I don't think so), but maybe with some I/O library?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6948#issuecomment-760888600:40,Install,Installing,40,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6948#issuecomment-760888600,4,"['Install', 'release']","['Installing', 'release', 'releases']"

Deployability,"Regarding the titular issue, I have been thinking about it for a bit and I don't think we can do much better than what @pieterdavid already implemented. Solutions considered:. 1. Implicitly converting `TClonesArrays` to `RVecs` would be a) backward-incompatible and b) a silent perf degradation, as it requires a copy. Moreover, if we did this I don't see a migration path that doesn't require that users revise all their TClonesArrays-related logic; 2. Adding a `TClonesArrays2RVec` helper function: it would require a copy (or it would have to return a clunky `RVec<T*>`). It is also trivial to implement for users that need it and don't mind the downsides.; 3. Adding a RDF toggle to tweak ""read TClonesArrays as RVecs"" or not: requires adding a bunch of extra logic to the column-reading mechanism for a feature that might end up being mostly unused (modern data models don't use TClonesArrays), and it would require the extra copy (i.e. silent performance degradation). The best seems to be 3, but feature toggles complicate internals and are typically not easy to discover (might end up mostly unused). It seems simpler to ask users to explicitly do the conversion in a `Redefine` if they need/want to. Sorry I could not come up with something nice :confused: .

It is currently disabled by setting ClassDef version to 0.; 2. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672509759 RooFit naming convention puts underscores in front of member names. This is discouraged, since underscore prefix is reserved for C++ implementations. I introduced some new members with underscore suffix instead, which is also common practice e.g. in the Google C++ guidelines. I think this is not something we should spend too much time on now, but maybe good to keep in mind for the future.; 3. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672519457 The configuration parameters (GlobalObservables etc.): should we unify them or keep like this?; 4. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672538377 This should be checked by Wouter. In addition, some other remaining questions:; 1. `testRooRealL.getValRooAddition` fails because it doesn't know `RooFormulaVar`... I'm not sure what this means, but I vaguely remember that (I think) @hageboeck and @cburgard were talking about this, so I was hoping you may be able to help me out with fixing that test.; 2. In an ideal world I would have liked to add a serial implementation of the `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` class. Probably, we can reuse a lot of `RooGradMinimizerFcn` for this and it should be rather straightforward. However, this will take time. The advantage would be that we could add a test to this PR that covers all that is added, basically by just running a minimization. Note that I do have such a full-coverage test, but only for the MultiProcess minimization, where I implemented `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` in the parallel `LikelihoodGradientJob` class. So this test will come in ""PR 7"" (see overview).

Deployability,"Results of today's investigations: The reason is that `LinkageComputer::getLVForNamespaceScopeDecl` assigns internal linkage to `const` qualified variables without external storage class, which then our `KeepLocalGVPass` changes to a weak symbol. If that happens in multiple transactions, the JIT infrastructure (?) merges the symbols into one memory location but constructors and destructors run multiple times on the same object (see above). We cannot disable `KeepLocalGVPass` because it also takes care of `static` variables in functions that are lazily initialized. Additionally, not merging the constant variables would mean that they have different addresses which could also cause problems (FWIW this is what you get upstream in `clang-repl`). Fun fact: it works by accident in the upgrade to LLVM 16 because I backported https://reviews.llvm.org/D156537, but not https://reviews.llvm.org/D156897 so if a variable `MustBeEmitted` it is actually not re-emitted and `KeepLocalGVPass` works correctly. Conclusion: What I think we should really do here is patch `LinkageComputer::getLVForNamespaceScopeDecl` to not assign internal linkage to `const` qualified variables under `IncrementalExtensions`. This seems to work in a few quick tests, but I need to investigate and think more on this...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13429#issuecomment-1690181013:790,upgrade,upgrade,790,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13429#issuecomment-1690181013,2,"['patch', 'upgrade']","['patch', 'upgrade']"

But woe onto the poor bugger that has such headers significantly different from Scientific Linux on their system (e.g. Python's manylinux docker image ...). An no, Windows does _not_ have a system compiler. *You* selected one that works for you. Windows applications are quite binary compatible (more so than e.g. Mac, and certainly easier than Linux varietals), so that's a choice. Neither has Mac for that matter: folks are free to update Xcode or not. Of course, you're saved here b/c even older Clang on Mac is pretty up-to-date with C++, but no such luck on Windows. On the other hand, modern MSVC is fine, but then Clang5 underpinning Cling can not parse the C++ library headers of MSVC 19 with C++17 enabled. So catch-22. Shipped PCMs also prevent developers from using OpenMP with Cling, but at least that can still be done in libraries, which can be linked without otherwise exposing OpenMP. However, the baked-in choice for _not_ having AVX means not only that Cling can not use it, but also causes binary incompatability with libraries that were compiled with AVX enabled (e.g. many/most Eigen-based codes). Then there is the version of C++ being fixed by the PCMs (and worse, in RConfig.h and the ""backported"" stringview classes, so it's not a simple matter of wiping the local PCMs and rebuilding), meaning C++11 is the only supported version unless you do a full recompile (and see the forum for how much fun that is). And if you look at the whole list of nightlies of the past couple of weeks, and not only at the carefully selected all-green one out of a sea of red that you posted above, you'll see that non-Linux platforms fail disproportionally o",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510:770,update,update,770,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510,2,['update'],['update']

That way, we can have `builtin_openui5=ON` and `fetch_openui5=ON` for automatic fetching, and `builtin_openui5=ON` and `fetch_openui5=OFF` when we provide openui5 ourselves.

If the `RelWithDebInfo` works, then I can consider the issue solved, since this is not strictly speaking a bug, but a runtime libraries incompatibility. If you really need a Debug build of ROOT, you'll have to build it yourself, but this is only needed if you need to debug also the C++ libraries. And note you will also need the Debug version of all the external libraries. Please let me know if that is good enough for you.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12540#issuecomment-1492887083:161,Release,Release,161,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12540#issuecomment-1492887083,1,['Release'],['Release']
