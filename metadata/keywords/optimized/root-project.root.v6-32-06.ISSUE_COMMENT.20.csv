Deployability,"Synopsis of the original error report:. Description. I had thought that our `art v3_09_01` based art passed all of our validation tests but I missed a single histogram that failed. I discovered it yesterday. I traced it back to the following. We have a file. `/pnfs/mu2e/scratch/users/brownd/workflow/default/outstage/44170899/00/00000/dig.brownd.CeEndpointMix.MDC2020b.001201_00000000.art`. It was written by `art v3_06_03`. One of the data products is of type `std::vector<StepPointMC>`, where `StepPointMC` is a class in our code base. The class contains 4 data members of type `CLHEP::Hep3Vector`:. https://github.com/Mu2e/Offline/blob/da4772bcb99f7b42bd401c3b15d56a211124553a/MCDataProducts/inc/StepPointMC.hh#L209. The `art::InputTag` is `""compressDigiMCs:virtualdetector""` . When I write a small job using `art v3_09_01` to read this data product and print out it's data members, all 4 of the `Hep3Vector` are `(0,0,0)`. When I run the same job using `art v3_06_03` all of the printout is correct. Remember that between `art v3_06_03` and `art v3_09_01` there was a schema change in `CLHEP::Hep3Vector`. You already fixed one bug related to that. I will prepare a stripped down example and add it to this issue. To reproduce. Unwind the following tar file on a machine that sees `/pnfs/mu2e and /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org`; ```; tar xzf /mu2e/app/users/kutschke/Bugs/Hep3Vector/artv3_09.tar.gz ; cd artv3_09; source /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/setupmu2e-art.sh; source setup.sh; scons -j 8; mu2e -c bug.fcl; ```; This prints most of the content of the the `StepPointMCs`. The bug is that the 4 `Hep3Vectors` are **all zero**. It's OK that the non-ionizing and visual energy depositions are zero; this data product captures steps in a virtual detector embedded inside a volume with a vacuum of `10^{-4} torr`. This uses the deprecated Mu2e ""Satellite release"" system to build on top of the Offline tag v10_00_00 on /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/Offline/v10_00_00/SLF7/prof/Offline .",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8428#issuecomment-875583779:1866,release,release,1866,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8428#issuecomment-875583779,1,['release'],['release']
Deployability,"T versions with python, also outside conda. That is always possible, but it requires setup scripts. I'm usually talking here about the situation in which you do `yum install root`, and it should work out of the box, without any extra setup. Same for other distributions. This is already the case in Fedora, but they have to go through hoops to make it work, like using alternatives for `libPyROOT.so` in `/etc/alternatives`. That's what I'd like to address. > we must not run setup.py as part of a ROOT installation. This makes it much harder to do the right thing during installation in order for things to work properly. PyROOT is a python package afterall, so what's the problem in using Python's native methods of installation as part of `make install`?. > It would be great if import ROOT can auto-detect which libPython (python2 or python3) to load; that would take care of the multi-python case after source thisroot.sh. At the moment, `libPyROOT.so` can only work with either Python 2.x or 3.x, not both. We need to change compile-time checks into runtime checks to make the same library work with both Python 2.x and 3.x (there are many `#ifdef`s on the Python version, for example). Finally, `thisroot.sh` is totally evil and should be deprecated. It messes up the environment when sourcing it, by potentially removing things from the path that should not be removed. It also assumes things about how ROOT was installed, so if ROOT's libraries are not in `$ROOTSYS/lib` (e.g., if they are in `$ROOTSYS/lib64`, or `$ROOTSYS/root/lib` with `gnuinstall=ON`) the script won't work. It also uses a colon for separator in `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, which is separated by semicolons, among other problems. My advice to people is to just stop using the script.

Deployability,"Templated constructors actually work since last week (except not yet on Mac due to a bug in TClingCallFunc; I needed them for shared_ptr), and yes they're a hack. Code is in repo, but not yet released. ADL will never work properly in full automatic mode, but is already covered most of the way. I'm having that discussion right now with a user who wants to turn Python tuples into std::tuples: the problem is underspecified on the Python side. So although it can be made to generally work, user-provided types are necessary to cover corner cases, e.g. by handing template arguments to std::make_tuple. Python's three-way comparison operator is only syntax, not semantics, so the spaceship would simply be broken down in Python's richcompare and the only real issue again is ROOT/meta giving wrong overloads. That said, I'm moving away from operator lookups: not only are the overloads often wrong, so I'm doing my own ADL, but also TClingCallFunc generates broken code on Mac and Windows. Rather, I want to use a generic comparison template and let SFINAE deal with it. The difference between removing std::, giving wrong overloads, etc. and string <-> decl is that the former is a problem b/c ROOT/meta gives the _wrong_ results. Strings are sometimes clunky, but perfectly fine if they are correct. Yes, letting clang parse names (as done for function template lookups already) is exactly what should happen. But the next step is to funnel the results to the Python mappings, not expose cppyy to decls or their intricate details. E.g. the converters and executor lookups should be a combination of strings and categories, just like it is now (except that the categories are derived from string parsing, like looking for ends_in('*')). Doing that selection based on decls as suggested here and in the e-mail thread with Gerhard makes no sense whatsoever: you'd have to maintain three times the same functionality. I would want something like this:. ```; opaque_handle h = what_is(parent, name); type_",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3579#issuecomment-478718847:192,release,released,192,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3579#issuecomment-478718847,2,['release'],['released']

Deployability,"Thank you for the reference. I have updated my JS scripts to use modules and my Web service works fine now with v7. May I ask one more question about axis labels for histograms. If a histogram is drawn as 2D image then I can adjust the color, size and offset of the axis labels using the context drop-down menu. However if I draw 2D histogram as 3D image using the ""lego2"" option then the axis labels drop-down menu still appears but makes no effect on the labels visualisation. None of the selected options works, neither color, not size or offset. The point is that sometimes the labels are so small that they are completely unreadable and it would have been nice to be able to increase the font size. It's also quite annoying that the labels are not aligned to the bins center, but instead are aligned to the bins edges. Is this behaviour expected? Attached image shows the issues. <img width=""1432"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29973760/173081896-841849be-48ca-4c01-84f0-ff3d6c04673e.png"">",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10727#issuecomment-1152393820:36,update,updated,36,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10727#issuecomment-1152393820,1,['update'],['updated']

New tests are still missing, but I would appreciate if you could take another look. In particular, these changes hopefully streamline the code a bit:; * `rdf_uuid`: this was previously not well named, since we need something that contains both an identifier for the current RDataFrame instance and also one for the current (distributed) execution of that RDataFrame (e.g. to separate to consecutive triggers of the computation graph). I have added the type `ExecutionIdentifier` that holds both. This class is now used everywhere (in Ranges.py, HeadNode.py) and should improve readability.; * I merged `CloneResultPtr` and `CloneResultMap` into `CloneResultAndAction`. This helps making the logic in DistRDF more simple (i.e. is what allows the usage of `singledispatch` to distinguish different ways of cloning actions of the distributed computation graph).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12363#issuecomment-1581162133:79,update,updated,79,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12363#issuecomment-1581162133,2,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"Thanks @amadio for the extensive input! Let me address it point by point:. First: the current choice for ""built-in only"". The built-in is there for two reasons: 1) as a dependency, obviously, but 2) also because the full source is needed to build `zmq::ppoll`. `ppoll` was written as an extension to libzmq itself. In the ideal world, I would have committed this back to libzmq (which they are open to, and which I'll do later, see https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/4220), but haven't had time yet. The interim solution is to just ship it with ROOT, but this requires (part of) the libzmq source to build against. We can do this in two ways: a) just include the necessary libzmq files or b) get them externally on the fly. I actually went with option a) first. However, when people started trying out this branch on their machines, it turned out that the `conda` libzmq build (which I was using in my dev setup) had a more favorable configuration than for instance most Linux native builds, especially because those native builds lack CMake configuration files. That latter fact made me decide to just make the built-in dependency the default; this way I wouldn't have to figure out how to best detect libzmq on each platform (or find / cobble together a good and freely licensed FindZeroMQ.cmake, but the general feeling around the ZeroMQ community is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Then about the RooFitZ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730:939,configurat,configuration,939,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730,4,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"Thanks Philippe. After further consideration, i think you're right. I had indeed been concerned about a possible deadlock, but i had thought; that it was probably ok because a similar change was working fine; in production. But (a), i had forgotten about the dlopen lock and (b),; they weren't exactly the same change. As i alluded to above, we didn't; want to have a custom patch to ROOT, so for production we address this; race by wrapping dlopen. But in that case, the core lock is acquired; _before_ the call to dlopen, not after. So, what is to be done?. There is probably only one code path in ATLAS that was giving us problems.; The Gaudi plugin manager was being used to load one of the POOL libraries; that happened to include ROOT dictionary information. I could; acquire the ROOT core lock around this (and one or two other places; where i known that Gaudi components may be loaded after event processing; starts). However, there are many other places where shared libraries; could potentially be loaded. While those probably don't matter...; the original bug here was quite opaque, taking several months; to completely track down. So i'm loathe to leave open any possibility; that it could bite us again. We could add locking within TClassTable. This is perhaps an attractive; way forward, as it should make it much easier to ensure that usages; of TClassTable are correct. A drawback is that is hard to then ensure; that we don't have something else that is also supposed to be protected; by the core mutex. Nevertheless, i could try to prepare a change; to do this if it sounds good. However, that's not the end of the problems. If this analysis is correct, then we _already_ have potential deadlock; problems, as there is nothing to prevent the initialization code of a; shared library (which can be arbitrary used code) from calling into ROOT; in a way that would acquire the core mutex. So code which would look; innocent to the user would have a chance of deadlocking.; I'm not sure ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071:375,patch,patch,375,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,Thanks for the PR. `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` seems to be a function and it has lexical scoping rules so I do not understand why resetting the `definitions` variable make things work. Why do we need another switch for `REFLEX_GENERATE_DICTIONARY`? We should be able to deduce the include paths from the target configurations. Passing different include paths using `USES` would mean that your dictionary has a different set of header files (compiled in a different way) than the library the dictionary is compiled in. That's quite dangerous as it can bring hard to diagnose inconsistencies. The direction ROOT has taken in the past is that it encourages single cmake call to produce library and its dictionaries. This is what `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` is. Maybe we should have something similar for reflex or even better (add a flag for ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` which calls `genreflex` instead of `rootcling`.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5019#issuecomment-587478295:310,configurat,configurations,310,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5019#issuecomment-587478295,1,['configurat'],['configurations']

It's essentially due to cmake often but not always failing to return any files on certain globs [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/7fa6bc530b386a185bb91b1aadf1a7ab22eab7b7/cmake/modules/RootMacros.cmake#L98) when the file itself doesn't exist yet, but again only in qemu/docker. It's suspicious, not very reproducible, hard to debug, but pretty sure it is not an issue with ROOT. I'll give the debug build a try today. I should have done that before reporting. Attaching debuggers inside a qemu emulated docker container is a bit limited unless one can run docker in privileged mode with cap ptrace added. Our usual build system doesn't have that capability so I'm used to this issue not resulting in any backtrace, but on my laptop I can enable that (as I did for this issue).

Deployability,"The fact that `wait_for_workers` waits forever looks to me like the Dask job is never actually started. You should double check that a simple Dask application with the same config but doing something else unrelated to RDF is working. Let's see, something like this should suffice (inspired by the dask [docs](https://examples.dask.org/delayed.html) and your reproducer):; ```python; import time; import random. from dask import delayed; from dask.distributed import Client; from dask_jobqueue import HTCondorCluster. cluster = HTCondorCluster(cores=1, processes=1, memory=""1GB"", disk=""0.1GB"", job_extra={""jobflavour"": ""espresso""}); cluster.scale(jobs=1); client = Client(cluster). # Try with and without this; client.wait_for_workers(1). def inc(x):; time.sleep(random.random()); return x + 1. def dec(x):; time.sleep(random.random()); return x - 1. def add(x, y):; time.sleep(random.random()); return x + y. inc = delayed(inc); dec = delayed(dec); add = delayed(add). x = inc(1); y = dec(2); z = add(x, y). print(f""Result is: {z.compute()}""); ```. Coming back to RDF, the `npartitions` parameter corresponds to how many distributed tasks will be sent to the Dask scheduler. Supposing you know something about how many resources you have or the layout of your ROOT dataset, you could set this manually in the RDataFrame constructor like; ```python; df = RDataFrame(""treename"",""filename.root"",daskclient=client,npartitions=NPARTITIONS); ``` ; A good parallelisation can often be obtained when the number of partitions is roughly 3x the amount of cores you can use.; UPDATE:. > in particular I'm interested in using Dask's adaptive worker management, so that the exact number of submitted jobs is not fixed a priori but automatically adapts to the workload... Sounds good, then the `npartitions` parameter could be adjusted based on how many TTree clusters you have in your dataset.

Deployability,"The idea was to have an executable that is linked statically against ROOT and other dependencies so that it can be used as the legacy version of a certain software package which is being retired in favour of new software. For example in order to run it using a gitlab runner for various cross-checks without the need to install root from source (multiple times even, for every testing stage) or ship it together with huge CentOS images. For the gitlab this just seems to be almost unfeasible, even with existing root docker containers from the docker hub. I understand that if ROOT was never meant to be used in this way, there just won't be resources to dedicate to this. So I will probably have to find a way to access such an exectuable from somewhere else while running those tests or run them offline.

Deployability,"The patch is straight-forward, but it is a shame that this requires new overloads in all inherited classes. I don't have a less intrusive alternative, but... Ideally, `MnApplication` should hold a smart pointer to `ModularFunctionMinimizer`, which is initialized with a concrete instance by each derived class. The method `Minimizer()` wouldn't be virtual and overloaded in each derived class. There could just be two normal methods in `MnApplication` for const and non-const access to the internal smart pointer. The `MnApplication` would get a modified constructor that accepts the raw pointer of `ModularFunctionMinimizer` created in each derived class.

Deployability,"The problem is that LLVM ships with zlib. Since recently, we meld the header files of the PCH in a zip in it (fa9a2eee8376a0d4c4393b8f94fa3f841455c32d). Clang uses zlib [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTReader.cpp#L1302) and [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTWriter.cpp#L2052) when building the PCH in `-fmodules-embed-all-files` mode. IIUC, the issue is the way the JIT resolves symbols. Currently, cling's JIT gives a preference to the local content to itself, i.e. resolves symbols from libCling.so first. This would mean that even if we link another version of zlib to libCore, cling will still find the symbols from llvm's library. And that's by design, because we want to resolve the embedded in ROOT LLVM symbols first. Otherwise cling will start picking up random LLVM symbols introducing a lot of compatibility and versioning issues. I'd propose we try to solve this in two steps. First we should try disabling LLVM's zlib from `interpreter/CMakeLists.txt` instead of the current patch. I suspect that LLVM will be able to find and use the system's zlib (in that case we should make sure LLVM links to the version of zlib we expect: @oshadura has a nice test case for it). If that doesn't work we should investigate how we can configure ROOT's LLVM with a custom zlib.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1149#issuecomment-335419847:1141,patch,patch,1141,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1149#issuecomment-335419847,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"The unittest works as intended, as do the requirements at `requirements.txt`. ROOT does not enforce any build-time Python dependencies (except for `numpy`) and the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. The unittest is merely checking that our test suite will find the packages it needs for the *optional*, *runtime* dependencies that we want to test ourselves. What happened is the following:; 1. There was the necessity to start testing a certain subset of TMVA, which was never tested before (see https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15197); 2. The packages were added to `requirements.txt` so that the docker images built for Linux runners of the new CI infrastructure could pick them up (the images are built nightly and they install in the virtual environment of the docker container all the packages in `requirements.txt` available in `master` at the time of building the image).; 3. Jenkins has been disabled since more than a week now so these packages were not manually installed on the Linux nodes of the old Jenkins instance. So I will close this issue as everything was working as intended. Jenkins builds should not longer appear for PRs as far as I am aware.

Deployability,"This PR duplicates one of the commits in PR #1520 (that PR in addition addresses two more issues in JsMVA not related to the d3 change). As written in the description of PR #1520:. > The code has not been updated to reflect changes in jsroot. The code still tries to load d3.v3.min.js from jsroot. In the current version of jsroot the d3 script has been updated to version 4 and the file is now called d3.min.js. The pull request changes the name of the file in the two places where it is referenced, so it should now find the file. However this change is incomplete since the d3 API changes between the versions and some porting is needed. This PR does not introduce any other changes than changing the name of the js file in the two places where it is referenced in the code, just as PR #1520 does. The API of d3 v4 is not fully backward compatible with d3 v3. Did you go through the code and check that nothing else needs to be changed? In jsroot itself there were many other changes to the code to adapt to the changed API when the d3.js file was updated to v4 as seen in the commit:. https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/commit/c156b8956f77d1aef4b70cd8609c4b1f2036f94f#diff-26681b69718507c05077030d69e5ba58.

Deployability,"This change is just for ROOT-5998, but I think that the build system for the Python stuff in `bindings/pyroot` needs a more thorough rework to fix the problem that it doesn't update if you update the source directory (reported to me by Massimiliano). The problem is with using `file(COPY ...)`, which has no notion it needs to be rerun if the file to be copied is newer. We need a custom target or (the better choice) to write a setup.py or equivalent Python native build, then use CMake to just call `python setup.py` or equivalent.

Deployability,"This patch was found by at least 3 different people. For example, I found it using the ""perf"" tool (if I remeber correctly, it was using gcc 4.8.4 back then and added -fno-omit-frame-pointer for compilation). The improvement of course depends on the settings. I don't understand why it takes so long to accept this patch. It is obviously correct - since if you use dynamic_cast and then do NOT check for nullptr and happily dereference the result, you can as well use a static_cast - if the old code was correct, the new one is correct as well. And the other cases, where you can simply remove the cast, are obvioulsly correct as well. By the way, I am still waiting for the invitation for a meeting in -1 month, as was announced here: https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=22880 - and please please consider my patches there as well. At least give feedback. This one with the casts is by far the easiest patch.

Deployability,"Those 2 classes may or may not be the only 2 that have this kind of pattern in the wild, so it might be interesting to solve the underlying issue which is likely to be that `BindCppObject` is trying to bind to a type which has no interpreter info. So a fix could be to have either `CPyCppyy::BindCppObject` or `Cppyy::GetActualClass` to check for the presence of interpreter info before attempting to automatically bind to the ""actual class/type"". (In theory this should be done by testing `TClass::HasInterpreterInfo` but in this case it is returning an incorrect information and thus we have to use `TClass::GetClassInfo`). The change in behavior is that after this modification, `PyROOT/Cppyy` would no longer warn if the actual return type is inadvertently missing its interpreter info. However semantically this seems to be the right behavior, for example in our cases we would:; * have no warning; * PyROOT will report the type of the pointer as `TList`; * Usage of the meta routines (`IsA` and co.) would still give accurate information (access to the `TClass` for `TViewPubFunctions`); * Interfaces to the objects are the same as the one available from the equivalent C++ code (I.e. `TList`) (unless the user does an explicit dynamic_cast to the underlying type). * In other cases (for user provided functions and classes) where the interpreter information from the underlying class is missing by mistake (bad/broken configuration of the user code/libraries), the error/warning reporting about the missing interpreter info will be delayed until the user actually want to access the underlying class.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820:1425,configurat,configuration,1425,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Others like kAquamarine have almost no contrast, it would be almost impossible to see sth there. So that would be a quick way to separate them. The idea is that the grayscale should be as proportional as possible, and monotonously increasing or decreasing. Unless it is symmetrical, then it is fine to have white in the borders and black in the centre (for example for example an axis that goes between -40 degrees and + 40 degrees, the 0 has a meaning).

As a side effect of this it will fix the module redefinition errors seen in the LCG builds and when ROOT is installed. IIUC the comments are reasonable and suggesting to move away from the ROOT static configuration for the essential directories such as the etcdir, libdir, incdir and so on.

Deployability,"Unfortunately this is the sort of issue that could have been easier to track/discuss on JIRA. But since ROOT doesn't use that anymore, here we go... My suspicion is that the grid nodes in question put some locally installed XRootD version high up in the library search path of the jobs.

ATLAS analysis releases using ROOT 6.18/04 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.65/External/ROOT/CMakeLists.txt) use XRootD 4.10.0 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.65/External/XRootD/CMakeLists.txt). While releases using ROOT 6.16/00 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.60/External/ROOT/CMakeLists.txt) used XRootD 4.8.4 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.60/External/XRootD/CMakeLists.txt). My educated guess is that the XRootD version force fed into your jobs @rdschaffer is binary compatible with XRootD 4.8.4, but not with 4.10.0 (or newer). However we definitely need some follow up from our grid experts on this. @rodwalker would it be possible to look at the problematic jobs / grid nodes for this?.

Deployability,"Update: I added the left-most column (`Entry`) to the whole fTable. Regarding the dashes (`---`) between the entries, I realized that the width of the table is not known before the full creation, since there is `EnsureWidth` method, which is called upon trying to fit an element into the table, and thus, it might happen that an element from the last row increases the total width of the fTable. And therefore, I find it expensive to go trough the whole table again just to add the dashes. I suggest that the `Print()` method includes the dashes, while `AsString()` does not. But still,`AsString()` shows the `Entry` column as it is part of the table. For example:; ```; Print():; Entry | S2 | ; ------------; 0 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; ------------; 1 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; ------------; 2 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; ------------; AsString(); Entry | S2 | ; 0 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; 1 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; 2 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; | |; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9116#issuecomment-949385614:0,Update,Update,0,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9116#issuecomment-949385614,1,['Update'],['Update']

The initial patch does not work since the `fOutputFile` member of `TFileMerger` is not a derivate of `TMemFile` and is the one that is getting changed in the process. The design of `TFileMerger` is of using `fOutputFile` as the file where all the data is merged, so of course it should never be deleted.

By *fiendly* I mean ""prevent damaging or changing the appearance of due to line break, especially when long strings are encountered"". In the original patch, it provided a general way (from `TVirtulaPS`) to specify different characters (aside from white spaces) to break the line at, and the option to drop the white space at which the line break happens to prevent additional white spaces from showing up in the image when cutting through a long sentence. In the updated patch, a customised `PrintFast` method is created inside `TSVG` that provides more customization (e.g. it's natural to cut between tags `><` in XML) in addition to features from the original patch, while keeping the `TVirtualPS` simple.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9518#issuecomment-1047616127:0,Update,Updated,0,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9518#issuecomment-1047616127,9,"['Update', 'patch', 'update']","['Updated', 'patch', 'updated']"

Deployability,"Updates of the day:. ### 1; @Axel-Naumann suggested creating targets for the builtin_xrootd libraries . This should in theory give us the possibility of changing target properties through something like; `set(TARGET libXrdSecpwd-4 PROPERTY INSTALL_RPATH ${CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_LIBDIR})`. We still want to keep all the building process in the `ExternalProject_Add` step, thus these new targets would be created as IMPORTED libraries. But unfortunately, CMake doesn't allow to install IMPORTED libraries as TARGETS ([SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41179630), [CMake developer citation](https://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=14311) ). ### 2; I tried to create a post install script that manually invokes `install_name_tool` to change the rpath from the build directory to the install directory. This would be called in `SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake` through something like; `install(SCRIPT ""${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/modules/XROOTDPostInstall.cmake"")`; and the script itself would work along these lines; ```; file(GLOB XROOTD_ALL_LIBRARIES; ""${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libXrd*""; ); find_program(INSTALL_NAME_TOOL install_name_tool). if(INSTALL_NAME_TOOL); foreach(XRD_LIB_PATH ${XROOTD_ALL_LIBRARIES}); set(OLD_RPATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib); set(NEW_RPATH ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib); execute_process(COMMAND ${INSTALL_NAME_TOOL} -rpath ${OLD_RPATH} ${NEW_RPATH} $$; endforeach(); endif(); ```; The problem with this idea, if not for its ad-hoc nature, is that `install_name_tool` would actually be called each time `cmake --install` is called causing errors from the second time since ${OLD_RPATH} is not set to the `build` folder anymore:; ```; error: install_name_tool: no LC_RPATH load command with path: /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib found in: /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/install/lib/libXrdClient.dylib (for architecture x86_64), required for specified option ""-rpath /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/install/lib""; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128#issuecomment-672083860:0,Update,Updates,0,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128#issuecomment-672083860,8,"['Update', 'install']","['Updates', 'install']"
Deployability,"Updates on the failing tests:; * Centos8/multicore: Failure because the same wrong mechanism of changing files happens in `FinalizeSlot` instead of `Finalize` in `SnapshotHelperMT`. Weirdly this didn't happen on my machine with 8 threads but it does on this node with 16 threads, still not sure what's the real difference there.; * MacOS: Both failures happen in the dataframe test, but in the **single threaded** Snapshot, that is in the `Finalize` method of the `SnapshotHelper` class. At first this PR wasn't even considering the single threaded case, that's also why `SnapshotHelper` wasn't modified. So there was this difference between the single threaded Snapshot that still used the weird ChangeFile behaviour (although it shouldn't have triggered a segfault anyway since it's using a plain TFile), and the multithreaded Snapshot that got its behaviour changed to avoid the issue. Considering both types of failures, and the fact that a coherent behaviour across the two Snapshot modes is desirable, I would refactor the usage of `TTree::SetMaxTreeSize` inside of RDF Snapshot in a single common point that both single-thread and multi-thread operations have to go through, if that exists. Or in alternative, the workaround should be done at construction time of both helpers and then removed at destruction time (or in `Initialize` and `Finalize` methods).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137:0,Update,Updates,0,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137,1,['Update'],['Updates']

For the rest I stayed with using arrays to stay similar to all other TGraph objects. I moved the functions GetPointX, GetPointY, SetPointX, SetPointY and GetObjectInfo to the TGraph class because they apply to any TGraph object and only were in my custom class cause I could not implement them in TGraph without using a custom Root installation. I replaced the funtion SetNErrorDimensions by the functions AddYError and DeleteYError as proposed by @lmoneta. Since I think the meaning of ""dimension"" might not be 100% clear, I exchanged it to a term claryfing that it corresponds to different y errors. Besides that I implemented some further features and fixed a memory leak in the function PaintGraphMultiErrors in the TGraphPainter class.

I wish there was a better or even feasible-to-implement way to solve this more elegantly. The underlying issue is that whenever there in unknown (to the interpreter) symbol it will ask the JIT to resolve it. It tries to resolve the symbol via the usual dynamic linker rules and as a last resort it gives the control to ROOT. ROOT, in turn, uses dlsym and dladdr (which have platform-specific bugs) to find the unknown symbol (https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/core/metacling/src/TCling.cxx#L6418). Unfortunately, we do not have enough information at that point to be able to distinguish between which symbol is supposed to come from libCling or not. Thus we have a conservative strategy in resolving as much as we can from libCling and if something slips through use later-dlopened libraries.

Deployability,[The way it is implemented](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/TF1_8cxx_source.html#l01408) makes it mandatory to have an active pad with the TF1 drawn in it. That's why you need to add these `gPad->Update()` if you really want to use this function (see my first example). My second reply does exactly the same thing as DrawIntegral without the `GetSelectedPad()`. That's the simpler/better way when you run compiled ROOT like you.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13708#issuecomment-1734857976:196,Update,Update,196,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13708#issuecomment-1734857976,1,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"ast top-level expression's value is printed if missing trailing semicolon) should be kept for consistency and simplicity reasons.; > ; > Let's hear some other opinions here, e.g. @SimeonEhrig @jalopezg-uc3m @pcanal ?. I do realize my post was terse. Here is more text as the discussion went in another direction. Since early days, as you already mentioned, the rule seems to be ""the last expression without a trailing semicolon should print"". If that is the rule, then it clearly does not handle short-hand operators. Namely, `if (x) expr`. That rule does not extend to your examples `do 1 while(true)` as `while` is not really an user-defined expression. `if (x) { expr }` does not fall there either as it is in a compound statement. It is pretty clear where we stop. The construct `if(x) expr`, as shown in the example, enables an interactive programming pattern wrt error handling where in case of an error we can just ask cling to print details. > I'd prefer to keep value printing simple. The implementation of what I propose requires 2-3 lines [here](https://github.com/vgvassilev/cling/blob/856f8e92f82f9037b3dbb27ae7f94add2ed6121f/lib/Utils/AST.cpp#L141-L152). And actually makes the value printing rule more comprehensible. It took me some time to realize what's wrong and I implemented it, so I'd say it would be less comprehensible to other people. > and instead invest where it's relevant: devtoolset, debug symbols, llvm upgrade (to llvm 11!), etc. This is a trade-off we should consciously do, and given that this is the first time I hear a request for value printing within nested blocks . We have had that in the past. I do not think having not user requests should be an argument against this bug. > I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the effort (and yes, that's an additional counter argument). And I'm not just talking dev time but also long-term maintenance: more code, more clang interfaces used.

Deployability,"ate your proposed solutions but I do not really have a lot of bandwidth nowadays to investigate why they do not work for us. You will probably see what's going wrong if you build this PR locally. I have built locally and don't see the issue (I don't even know what I'm looking for). Both you and @pcanal asked me to fix this and I spent actual time trying to figure out what you guys were after and implementing a solution that has little cost for both of us. I too suffer from lack time, so asking me to do work then walking away without even giving a single example of what is broken seems a bit rude.... Seriously, can I get one test that still fails with https://reviews.llvm.org/D33529 ?. If that cannot be done could @pcanal or @Axel-Naumann at least verify that after applying D33529 and setting `DynamicLibrary::SearchOrder = SO_LoadedFirst; // or SO_LoadedLast (don't know the problem)` 500+ tests are broken?. > I would appreciate if we can coordinate next time such breaking changes before asking for a llvm review and land patches in these particularly sensitive areas. I explicitly added you to the list of reviewers for the original patch, there is little more I can do than that. And more coordination is exactly what I am trying to do now.

Deployability,"bably see what's going wrong if you build this PR locally. I have built locally and don't see the issue (I don't even know what I'm looking for). Both you and @pcanal asked me to fix this and I spent actual time trying to figure out what you guys were after and implementing a solution that has little cost for both of us. I too suffer from lack time, so asking me to do work then walking away without even giving a single example of what is broken seems a bit rude.... Seriously, can I get one test that still fails with https://reviews.llvm.org/D33529 ?. If that cannot be done could @pcanal or @Axel-Naumann at least verify that after applying D33529 and setting `DynamicLibrary::SearchOrder = SO_LoadedFirst; // or SO_LoadedLast (don't know the problem)` 500+ tests are broken?. > I would appreciate if we can coordinate next time such breaking changes before asking for a llvm review and land patches in these particularly sensitive areas. I explicitly added you to the list of reviewers for the original patch, there is little more I can do than that. And more coordination is exactly what I am trying to do now. If we cannot reach a conclusion may I at least be added to review whatever your solution looks like?. > 1. I plan to remove the NDEBUG assert. Already done in D33529. > 2. Make the std::vector<void*> a std::vector<llvm::PointerIntPair<void*, 1, bool>>. How can you guarantee that the platform will deliver a pointer with proper alignment for that?. > 3. I will change the search order to search for first the one that are not marked RTLD_GLOBAL.

Deployability,"copy the changed files from the ROOT sources. Being a git repository, it also easily is included as a submodule in the `/extern` folder for GooFit, for example. After meeting and talking with @lmoneta a couple of days ago over a coffee, he outlined the procedure I initially implemented. He showed me the old ""build"" directory, with an old bash script that copied the necessary files out. He wanted me to make a new folder to eventually replace his build folder. The idea is that you could create source distributions that would be packaged and made available as downloads to continue the outdated ones available here: http://project-mathlibs.web.cern.ch/project-mathlibs/minuit/release/download.html. I added this though `make package_source`, and included `make package` for binary distributions as well. The integrated version does look a bit better, though it is a bit more invasive and not nearly as well separated. I do need to copy to `/inc/Math`, etc, since a source distribution needs to be in the source directory. Everything is copied to `INSTALL_PREFIX/include` when it's installed or packaged for a binary distribution. As for use, a git only solution really is not feasible, unfortunately, with any method that does not include git submodules. The current methods for a user are:. * Install beforehand from one of the downloadable packages, either building a source package or installing a binary package. This is the way some people will get it, but not ideal for a modern package that wants to have minimal dependencies.; * Have CMake download and build the package with `ExternalProject` - probably the best solution for now, still not as nice for something like GooFit that already has all dependencies as git submodules.; * Check out all of ROOT as a submodule, then `add_subdirectory(extern/root/math/minuit2)`. Much more disk space usage that needed, but otherwise also a decent solution. Might even be best. All three methods should be supported by this standalone build system.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1680#issuecomment-369601161:1171,install,installed,1171,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1680#issuecomment-369601161,3,"['Install', 'install']","['Install', 'installed', 'installing']"

Deployability,"ebug = 6``` to get the full output from clang. Maybe the defaults need to be reconsidered here. The optimal solution here for pyroot/cppyy in general is maybe a bit involved. What is probably desired is; 1) Don't print the clang output, but store any errors or warnings during template instantiation attempts e.g. using ```cling::utils::DiagnosticsStore```; 2) If no template is successfully instantiated then print the stored warnings and errors for each case; 3) If a template is successfully instantiated, but had warnings, at least print those for the successful case. I have some idea what's going wrong with the error detection as well, more news on that soon. \*; ```gdb; Thread 1 ""python"" hit Breakpoint 1, 0x00007ffff2df28e0 in clang::Sema::InstantiateFunctionDefinition(clang::SourceLocation, clang::FunctionDecl*, bool, bool, bool) () from /home/b/bendavid/rootdev28/install/lib/libCling.so; (gdb) bt; #0 0x00007ffff2df28e0 in clang::Sema::InstantiateFunctionDefinition(clang::SourceLocation, clang::FunctionDecl*, bool, bool, bool) (); from /home/b/bendavid/rootdev28/install/lib/libCling.so; #1 0x00007ffff1a30ff7 in cling::overloadFunctionSelector(clang::DeclContext*, bool, llvm::SmallVectorImpl<clang::Expr*> const&, clang::LookupResult&, clang::DeclarationNameInfo&, clang::TemplateArgumentListInfo const*, clang::ASTContext&, clang::Parser&, clang::Sema&, cling::LookupHelper::DiagSetting) () from /home/b/bendavid/rootdev28/install/lib/libCling.so; #2 0x00007ffff1a387f7 in clang::FunctionDecl const* cling::findFunction<clang::FunctionDecl const*>(clang::DeclContext*, llvm::StringRef, llvm::SmallVectorImpl<clang::Expr*> const&, bool, clang::ASTContext&, cling::Interpreter*, clang::FunctionDecl const* (*)(clang::DeclContext*, bool, llvm::SmallVectorImpl<clang::Expr*> const&, clang::LookupResult&, clang::DeclarationNameInfo&, clang::TemplateArgumentListInfo const*, clang::ASTContext&, clang::Parser&, clang::Sema&, cling::LookupHelper::DiagSetting), cling::LookupHelper::Diag",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11854#issuecomment-1455272493:1502,install,install,1502,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11854#issuecomment-1455272493,1,['install'],['install']

I simply wanted to add an explanation why Philippe suggests the inclusion of the actual diagnostic (and why I found it convincing and do it ever since he propose it to me). This issue exists on gcc11 and gcc12 (and I guess any gcc that made changes to libstdc++ and the experimental/string_view header file). I am not sure if pasting a diagnostic from a random system makes this clearer in any form. I agree with you this should have be 1 min review fixing an important failure that we introduced with the c++20 support and some of the new releases of maybe libstdc++. @pcanal I find pasting errors in the logs a bad practice, especially when it obfuscates the real fix. Can you suggest a commit message which adds enough information which makes me happy as well?.

I used `ctest --output-on-failure -R .*treefor.*` and `ctest -j12 --output-on-failure -R .*callfunc.*` to benchmark. I noticed around 20% slowdown and I decided to go with the enum implementation which I just pushed. Now with it we seem to be consistent with what we used to have but I am still looking how to make it faster. That benchmark runs more or less for the same time (0.16 +-2):. ```; root-callfunc-master/release $ /usr/bin/time -v root.exe -l -b -q /build/vvassilev/root-release-master/callfuncbench.C\(1000000\).

Deployability,"es.html. This optimization was used inside ATLAS for a long time to great success (speedups), so I was enabling it by default. However, it seems to be problematic here, maybe it doesn't work with the RooBarlowBeestonLL. You should for now disable it when the demo is compiled with ROOT 6.28. So the line with `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` in `histfact_demo.cpp` would become:; ```C++; #if ROOT_VERSION_CODE < ROOT_VERSION(6,28,00); auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas);; #else; // Disable the binned fit optimization that was enabled by default in ROOT 6.28.; // This optimization skips the normalization of the RooRealSumPdf, because; // the unnormalized bin contents already represent the yields that can be; // used by the RooNLLVar to sum the Poisson terms. However, this optimization; // doesn't work for this demo, maybe because it's not compatible with the; // RooBarlowBeestonLL. See also https://root.cern/doc/v628/release-notes.html.; HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast::Configuration cfg;; cfg.binnedFitOptimization = false;; auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas, cfg);; #endif; ```. With this, the results I get with 6.28 are already more comparable to 6.24.

When it crashes, `nbig` is `-1`, and resize() expects and unsigned int. The -1 becomes a very large unsigned number that exceeds the maximum allowed length of a `std::string`. To me that looks more like a problem with IO than with HistFactory (the memory layout of the `HistFactory::Measurement` classes hasn't changed from 6.26 to 6.28. Is that something that makes sense to you, @pcanal? What does this `nbig` stand for, and in which circumstances can this be `-1`?. Maybe in the best case, the fix would just be adding a simple `if(nbig >= 0)` before the call to `resize()`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12967#issuecomment-1581261520:7738,install,install,7738,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12967#issuecomment-1581261520,2,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"g.h and the ""backported"" stringview classes, so it's not a simple matter of wiping the local PCMs and rebuilding), meaning C++11 is the only supported version unless you do a full recompile (and see the forum for how much fun that is). And if you look at the whole list of nightlies of the past couple of weeks, and not only at the carefully selected all-green one out of a sea of red that you posted above, you'll see that non-Linux platforms fail disproportionally often. (In fact one of the recent ""green"" releases is only green b/c MacOS 10.15 and Windows10 are switched off.) That tells me that most of your developers work on Linux, and rely on the nightlies to catch any portability issues. That's a very poor approach b/c your matrix is necessarily limited given the enormous number of possible combinations. (That's another way of saying it's carefully selected.). I don't actually know if all those Linux systems are SLC, but did note for example that the build failed on SuSE Tumbleweed with gcc9, b/c SuSE does not install TBB by default to go with that compiler, and the build was missing headers as a consequence. So I do strongly suspects a lot of conformity in distros there. As-is, this approach of trying it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for example. This would never happen if code was written with portability in mind from the get-go. But your closer exemplifies that even better: given the choice between *potential* scaling problems and *guaranteed* portability problems, you choose to accept the latter. Clearly, portability isn't high on your list. Portability is, however, very important. By providing a portable solution that works well within other environments, cppyy is now being used on large code bases in mathematics, chemistry, and biology. That work uncovers errors even deep inside Cling, because it is pushed harder and used differently than in the CINT-tamed HEP world.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510:2560,install,install,2560,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510,2,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"ge_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-891036930): I didn't generalize TRangeDynCast and TRangeStaticCast. They are tied to TCollection and fulfill a different purpose because of that. They are also part of `ROOT::Internal`, while my new functions are supposed to be also used by the RooFit users. I would suggest we leave them as they are, but if you think the new `static_range_cast` and `dynamic_range_cast` are useful for everyone we can move the new file if you want. But where?. I was already expecting that it would be difficult to adapt those, but there will be ways to adapt them. I think it would be *better* if there's one good solution for all, but you have to decide how much time you want to invest. > 2. [[RF] New RangeCast file with dynamic_range_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#discussion_r680892053): I didn't add the `assert(dynamic_cast)` to the `static_range_cast` because the performance penalty it introduces in debug mode is not probably not expected by non-RooFit developers. There's not many loops out there in the world that will depend on this. If somebody uses it, they might be glad to have the extra safety. About the performance:; - When you run from the interpreter, you don't care about the performance of your loop as much.; - When you compile, you probably know what `NDEBUG` is.; - When you ACLIC-compile, I would have hoped that you get an automatic `NDEBUG` in release builds of ROOT, or when you `+O` a file. You don't, unfortunately. My preferred solution would have been to fix that and use the asserts, but it's your project now. > 3. [[RF] New RangeCast file with dynamic_range_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-890998817): I stuck with the detection of `dynamic_cast` vs. `static_cast` at compile time to also support non-polymorphic types.; > .

Deployability,"get rid of the error I run into a problem when checking them:. In the pairdict example I can run the following in the root prompt. ```; root [2] c = TClass::GetClass(""std::pair<int,MyClass::MyEnum>"");; root [3] b = c->GetListOfBases(); (TList *) nullptr; ```. So the list of base classes doesn't exist. While for a `std::pair<int,int>` I get the correct base class to `__pair_base<int,int>` and it does have a class pointer:. ```; root [1] c = TClass::GetClass(""std::pair<int,int>"");; root [2] b = c->GetListOfBases(); (TList *) @0x7ffd1c3fce98; root [3] TBaseClass* bc = (TBaseClass*) *(b->begin()); (TBaseClass *) 0x1a678d0; root [4] *bc; (TBaseClass &) Name: __pair_base<int,int> Title:; root [5] bc->GetClassPointer(); (TClass *) 0x1a3e5f0; ```. Now after adding `#pragma link C++ class std::pair<int, MyClass::MyEnum>+;` to the `linkdef.h` the error message is gone but I get the following. ```; root [1] c = TClass::GetClass(""std::pair<int,MyClass::MyEnum>"");; root [2] b = c->GetListOfBases(); (TList *) @0x7fff4c93b268; root [3] TBaseClass* bc = (TBaseClass*) *(b->begin()); (TBaseClass *) 0x19c4bd0; root [4] *bc; (TBaseClass &) Name: __pair_base<int,MyClass::MyEnum> Title:; root [5] bc->GetClassPointer(); (TClass *) nullptr; ```. I do have the proper hierarchy but the `__pair_base` base class doesn't have a valid ClassPointer so I'm not convinced this is all working as intended. Now I can solve this weirdness as well by requesting the `std::_pair_base<T1,T2>` dictionaries as well. But at this point I am a bit skeptical so I would like some confirmation that this is not just some stupidity on my side. .

As for the original CMake configuration error, my guess is that the CMake target ""host"" used to be part of the CMake project, but is no longer part of the CMake project, and that the error message in `interpreter/cling/CMakeLists.txt:196` was not updated to reflect this when the CMake target ""host"" was removed from the CMake project. As for the error on the final generation of `lib/modules.idx`, the issue seems to be with `root.exe` which is invoked with the following build step command: . ```shell; cd /usr/home/erik/devel/resources/root/build/lib && LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/home/erik/devel/resources/root/build/lib: ROOTIGNOREPREFIX=1 ROOT_HIST=0 /usr/home/erik/devel/resources/root/build/bin/root.exe -l -q -b; ```.

However, it seems to be problematic here, maybe it doesn't work with the RooBarlowBeestonLL. You should for now disable it when the demo is compiled with ROOT 6.28. So the line with `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` in `histfact_demo.cpp` would become:; ```C++; #if ROOT_VERSION_CODE < ROOT_VERSION(6,28,00); auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas);; #else; // Disable the binned fit optimization that was enabled by default in ROOT 6.28.; // This optimization skips the normalization of the RooRealSumPdf, because; // the unnormalized bin contents already represent the yields that can be; // used by the RooNLLVar to sum the Poisson terms. However, this optimization; // doesn't work for this demo, maybe because it's not compatible with the; // RooBarlowBeestonLL. See also https://root.cern/doc/v628/release-notes.html.; HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast::Configuration cfg;; cfg.binnedFitOptimization = false;; auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas, cfg);; #endif; ```.

Deployability,"king leftover after the analysis (see any file ending with `_patch` and compare it with the same file ending with `_master`). Now that the main source of memory usage is gone, I have noticed a much smaller contribute that still seems to make the memory increase in the flamegraphs. And it seems to have something to do with the increased number of files, at least on the surface. Let's take the following two files to compare:; * test_agc_9sample_1file_10task_patch.html; * test_agc_9sample_10file_10task_patch.html. They are running exactly the same script, with all 9 RDF samples. In the first case we have 1 file per sample, in the second case 10 files per sample. The memray flamegraph report a total of 253.5 MB used for the first case and 260.9 MB used for the first case (7.4 MB delta). There are two main parts of the graph: the one deriving from the `clone` of the Dask process, where the actual analysis code is run, and the one deriving from the `_start` function where most of the Python code around the analysis is (things like `import`ing packages or the Dask worker-scheduler communication). The difference between the two graphs in the `clone` part is of 0.6 MB, the difference between the two `_start` parts is 6.7 MB, so I focus on that from now on. This 6.7 MB difference is in turn split between a 0.1 MB difference deriving from `_PyObject_VectorcallTState` and 6.6 MB difference deriving from. Finally, the vast majority of these 6.6 MB comes from:; * The metrics gathered by profiling (i.e. memray itself); * Dask communication protocol. [Screencast from 2024-07-26 10-47-18.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a21ea3e-c130-42af-b50b-bb324b06eaaa). TL;DR: After this patch the leftover memory increase may be attributed mostly to Dask or memray itself. To confirm this, I have executed the full AGC benchmark on the SWAN platform with 64 workers of the CERN condor pools for 10 times in a row. At the end of the 10th run all the workers have a total RSS of < 1GB.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16094#issuecomment-2252273470:1954,patch,patch,1954,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16094#issuecomment-2252273470,2,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"ng binary ready to use.; > > ; > > ; > > The root PR does not solve my problem. I looked a little bit in the code with the gdb and found out, where the application crashes. In `IncrementalCUDADeviceCompiler::generatePTX()` the line `llvm::Module* module = m_PTX_interp->getLastTransaction()->getModule();` returns a `nullptr`. But this only happens, if I define a Cuda `__global__` kernel. If use a normal C++ statement, like `int i = 3;` or define a Cuda `__device__` function everything is fine. I'm not sure, if there more cases. @vgvassilev Do you have an idea? Maybe you saw something, which can help me, during your porting work. If not, it is not problem. Then, I simply have to spent more time.; > ; > I found the problem and a possible fix. The problem happens in the Interpreter instance for the device code. In the function `IncrementalExecutor::runStaticInitializersOnce()`, there is the line `llvm::orc::VModuleKey K = emitModule(T.takeModule(), T.getCompilationOpts().OptLevel);`, which removes the `llvm::Module` from the transaction. Because `generatePTX()` is called afterwards, `getLastTransaction->getModule` returns a `nullptr`. At the moment, I don't know, why the device compiler creates a static initializer on the device site. On the host site, it is necessary to register the CUDA kernel. At the moment, my solution is a if-guard in `Interpreter::executeTransaction()`:; > ; > ```c++; > if(!m_Opts.CompilerOpts.CUDADevice); > ExeRes = m_Executor->runStaticInitializersOnce(T);; > ```; > ; > I need to verify, if this is a good solution. That's what I was about to say, now the JIT takes the ownership of the `llvm::Module` and then, once it is done JITing, returns it back to the transaction. I think what your patch is doing is that, it forces the JIT to run on the `llvm::Module` and return the ownership to the transaction. Maybe not the best in terms of performance, but we should review the entire model where we have Transaction holding a pointer to a `llvm::Module`...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6385#issuecomment-777250984:4956,patch,patch,4956,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6385#issuecomment-777250984,2,['patch'],['patch']
