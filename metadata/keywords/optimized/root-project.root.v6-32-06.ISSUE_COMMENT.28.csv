This fixed it at least for many builtins. There still might be more builtins that have the same problem, but let's go one step at a time. I solved the VDT-related part a bit differently. If I rebased, the diff would approximately read (done manually, sorry for possible indentation errors):; ```diff; DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR} COMPONENT extra-headers); set(vdt ON CACHE BOOL ""Enabled because builtin_vdt enabled (${vdt_description})"" FORCE); set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY ROOT_BUILTIN_TARGETS VDT); - add_library(VDT::VDT STATIC IMPORTED GLOBAL); - set_target_properties(VDT::VDT; - PROPERTIES; - IMPORTED_LOCATION ""${VDT_LIBRARIES}""; - INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES ""${VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS}""; + add_library(VDT IMPORTED SHARED); + add_dependencies(VDT BUILTIN_VDT); + set_target_properties(VDT PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION ""${VDT_LIBRARIES}""); + target_include_directories(VDT INTERFACE $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${VDT_INCLUDE_DIR}> $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/>); ); endif(); endif(); ```; Whether the target is declared global, static or shared, I'm not sure if it makes a big difference. I'm happy to call it `VDT::VDT`, though. I think the important part was to switch the include directories via generator expressions, and to use **SYSTEM** includes instead of includes in `FindVDT`. #11844 is missing the usage of the `VDT::VDT` target in RooFit and in tmva, but that would come into effect after a rebase of #8709. I guess therefore that we could proceed with merging #11844 if it's green, and then I rebase #8709, so I have to do the rebase work only once.

Integrability,"I've been able reproduce this on my desktop (CentOS7, gcc 8.3) when building ROOT from source. The parameter that makes it fail is `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17` (C++ 14 works fine). The reason is: when passing a Python callable as a parameter of a function (e.g. the `TF1` constructor in your example) cppyy automatically generates a C++ wrapper for it. As part of the wrapper generation, cppyy jits Python headers, some of which still use (in Python2) the `register` keyword, which causes an error in C++ 17. For example, when running your reproducer with dev3 these errors appear first:. ```; In file included from /cvmfs/sft-nightlies.cern.ch/lcg/nightlies/dev3python2/Thu/ROOT/HEAD/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/CPyCppyy/API.h:30:; In file included from /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/Python/2.7.16-3adfa/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/python2.7/Python.h:88:; /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/Python/2.7.16-3adfa/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/python2.7/unicodeobject.h:534:5: error: ISO C++17 does not allow 'register' storage class specifier [-Wregister]; register PyObject *obj, /* Object */; ^~~~~~~~~; ```. this is what ultimately causes the `TF1` constructor error, since the C++ wrapper for the Python callable can't be generated.

There, the C++ object (a `std::vector` in your case) is read out and the `__array_interface__` dict is added to the Python object, which carries all information needed by numpy to adopt the memory (see [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.interface.html)). In short: You would need to cover the case of `vector.size() == 0` in `STLVectorArrayInterface` properly. Following code tells me, that the size field is already set properly, but it seems that numpy fails with the `""data"": (0, False)` set in the `__array_interface__`. ```python; >>> import ROOT; >>> x = ROOT.std.vector(""float"")(); >>> x.__array_interface__; {'shape': (0L,), 'version': 3, 'data': (0, False), 'typestr': '<f4'}; ```.

Integrability,"In my other computer, I get now a difference of 4 pixels using latest ROOT master. So it seems to me that this is not a small rounding error. - Interactive mode: 598x576 pixels; - Batch mode: 596x572 pixels. Could it be just an outdated calibration from many years ago? See this https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/c3de92f4d1ad4372febc81955a877345d4de3a9c. Check out this code below. It seems there is always the same offset on my current computer. Whenever I run in batch mode, I get 4 pixels difference wrt batch mode. My hypothesis is that this could solved if those numbers are adapted, potentially depending on Windows / Mac with an if.

At this point, the integration with RooFitExtensions may have already broken subtly. `RooExpandedDataHist::get_wgt` was still virtual (_edit: actually doesn't matter that it was virtual, I guess, it was just shadowing_), so from this point it would be shadowing `RooDataHist::get_wgt`: it would no longer be relegated to from inside `RooDataHist` as it would before 155032e, but would only be called from inside RooFitExtensions, leading to two different `get_wgt` calls.

In our case it was enough additional information to identify the origin of the error as being a bad input value and exclude troubles at the `libTTF` packages level such as missing package(s) or mismatching versions (or also in the `tsize` calculation or in `libTTF`, but these were anyway unlikely given the 20+ years of usage). It would probably be helpful to have in addition some info on the call stack, but I do not know enough of `ROOT` core methods to propose anything there.; As I could track the source of the bad values in our code with the old-school ""add temp printouts around calls from top to bottom"" method, I must confess I stopped my investigation here :sweat_smile:",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14592#issuecomment-1929667487:46,message,message,46,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14592#issuecomment-1929667487,1,['message'],['message']

Note that this branch retains the current race condition in `ROOT_ADD_BUILTIN_DEPENDENCIES`: the external build produces the header files, but the individual source files are not dependent on the outcome of the external build. For example, `TDavixFile.cxx.o` is in reality dependent on `TDavixFile.cxx` and `davix.hpp`; however, if `davix.hpp` is the output of the `DAVIX` external project, there's no CMake dependency forcing `DAVIX` to be built before `TDavixFile.cxx.o`.

Integrability,"Maybe a few more notes to make the review easier, because this is a huge patch. * The previous code used macros to log things. I found that the macros are not needed, so I replaced all the macros with method calls to MnPrint::Error, MnPrint::Info, ....; * The old logging made a useful habit of prefixing messages with a string to indicate the origin, e.g. when you logged from MnHesse, messages would be prefixed with ""MnHesse:"". Inside ``MnHesse``, to stay with the example, you might have seen code like this; ```c++; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some foo happened"");; [...]; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; Setting the prefix by hand was error prone and repetetive and made the logging code more distractive from the actual code. Especially now, since all the debug messages should also have this prefix, I wanted to automate this. So I turned MnPrint into a class that one can instantiate with a prefix for a given scope.; ```c++; MnPrint print(""MnHesse""); // appears once at the beginning of a long method; [...]; print.Info(""Some foo happened"");; [...]; print.Info(""Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; print.Info(""Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; The method ``MnPrint::Info`` uses the prefix set in the MnPrint ctor. The ctor of MnPrint also has an optional argument to print with a local print level. If this is not set, the global print level is used. In the long run (not in this patch), we should get rid of the global print level, because global mutable variables are difficult to reason about and in particular do not play nice with multi-threading. This design prepares for that step.; * I generally made sure that the logging messages contain the same information as the previous ones, but I reduced excess whitespace and improved the formatting. Some debug messages added several empty lines to the output, which made the logs hard to read.; * In very few isolated cases I removed redundant messages.

Integrability,"My 2 cents:. 1. It is extremly weird/ a bug that the webgui needs to depend on `TObject`.; 2. `RBrowserDataCleanup` derives from `TObject`, so it *must* have a `ClassDef` as per https://root.cern/manual/io_custom_classes/#the-classdef-macro . I am not sure about what using `ClassDefInline` as suggested by @pcanal would change; 2a. Can `RBrowserDataCleanup` just avoid inheriting from `TObject` completely? ; 3. `RBrowserData` has a dictionary and allows I/O, as it is defined in `LinkDef.h`, so it is only natural that its data members need a dictionary as well. As @hahnjo commented, the particular error coming from a `std::tuple` is due to the fact that the class uses ` std::unique_ptr<RBrowserDataCleanup>`. Bottom line, to me everything looks very clear and I don't understand the comments regarding looking for a deeper reason behind the error.

Integrability,"My reasoning for removing usage of `std::string_view` is that using `const std::string&` avoids copying memory and only requires C++11, while `std::string_view` requires C++17 or a backport. Moreover, along with the extra requirements of `std::string_view`, when it is passed by value it uses a pointer + length, which means possibly twice the size of just a reference. If we are not using the editing potential of `std::string_view`, or even worse, are just using it to actually make a copy of the data inside, then I see no real advantage in using it relative to just using a reference to `std::string` in the interface that basically does the same job better without adding the extra requirements of a higher C++ standard and/or a backport.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/804#issuecomment-318633601:612,interface,interface,612,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/804#issuecomment-318633601,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"My two cents. The root cause of the problem is understood and it is what you mentioned. However, the way this presents to users is that if they run the following code on a large-enough inputs:. ```python; >>> f = ROOT.TFile('DYJetsToLL.root'); >>> t = f.Get('Events'); >>> t.Draw('GenPart_pdgId'); ```. users _silently_ get a completely wrong histogram:. ![image](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/10999034/1d53b401-cf13-471c-bf6f-908835845b20). instead of the histogram they _should_ get:. ![image](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/10999034/4bfc1d5d-e7e6-450a-b3c0-783cfccbda3a). Even if you are lucky enough that the histogram is so wrong that you spot the problem immediately, it is then very difficult to go from ""my histogram is wrong"" to ""low floating point precision makes `Fill` effectively a no-op inside `TTree::Draw`"". So difficult that I do not think one can reasonably expect users to diagnose the issue themselves. With that said, new interfaces already moved to TH1D by default instead of TH1F, and TTree::Draw cannot be changed to produce a TH1D for the backward-compat issues Axel listed above, so the only remaining option, AFAICT, is to add a check after every `Fill` or deprecate `TTree::Draw`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6671#issuecomment-1861816430:970,interface,interfaces,970,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6671#issuecomment-1861816430,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

This leads to 15 new lines of code, which is not that much, but seems redundant (as names and titles of the uniform distribution on all x) and even more error-prone (because of very similar code). Maybe there must be a way to explicitly allow same pdfs, if you know that they are really identical ones with same parameters?

IMO the right steps are:; 1. get your extension into zmq; 2. *then* we integrate your PR where we require a minimal zmq version which offers your new functions.

First is that we *must* build a dictionary before we use a header file. We are likely missing a build dependency on `ROOTGpadv7`. I believe you are trying to fix the second problem. Namely, `TLine.hxx` includes `TPadPainter.hxx` which includes `TDisplayItem.hxx` and you end up with the cycle `ROOTGraphicsPrimitives -> ROOTGpadv7 -> ROOTGraphicsPrimitives`. It seems that `ROOTGraphicsPrimitives` is a foundational module. Its header `TLine.hxx` should not depend on headers in `ROOTGpadv7`. @Teemperor is right, `TLine.hxx` should not depend on `TPadPainter.hxx`. You can break that loop by introducing a forward declarations of `TPadPainter.hxx` entities where necessary if definitions are not required. This is how the current master's modulemap looks like (maybe this helps to see the cycle).; ```; module ""ROOTGraphicsPrimitives"" {; requires cplusplus; module ""ROOT/TColor.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TColor.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDisplayItem.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDisplayItem.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDrawingAttr.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDrawingAttr.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDrawingOpts",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2091#issuecomment-392598607:1979,depend,dependency,1979,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2091#issuecomment-392598607,1,['depend'],['dependency']

Integrability,"On the jenkins build node the error appears likely because of '-Dsoversion=""On""' and the following. One test that fails is 'runload.C' in roottest/root/treeformula/sync. There we have (essentially):; ```; {; gROOT->ProcessLine("".L loadcode.C+"");; ...; TTree *t; _file0->GetObject(""t"",t);; }; ```; The use of TTree means that before executing the script libTree is laoded.; During the execution of CompileMacro, the depend library are loaded (see for example the collection line [3363](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/f32d06e70ce357b53050a25eecd5186859021e30/core/base/src/TSystem.cxx#L3363) .; And in this case the result is:; ```; loadcode_C.so libTree.6.21.01.so libTree.so; ```; which coupled with the ***new*** feature that gSystem->Load first dlclose the library then reopen it means that libTree is dlclose 2 or 3 times (one for both the versioned and unversioned version). This behavior is a **very significant** departure from the existing behavior (where, because the libraries were added to the link line, the library were never reloaded). Reloading arbitrary depend library is never a good idea since they (are likely to) include static object that may do things that are **essential** to do only once (initialization, connection to db). Technically CompileMacro could (as it does elsewhere) first check if the library is loaded. But still several questions:. 1) Why is libTree listed twice in the list of depend library?. 2) When should gSystem->Load automatically reload a library, if ever?. @Axel-Naumann @vgvassilev opinions?. PS. Even-though the set of test would be fixed by updating gSystem->Load and/or CompileMacro, the PR is still likely necessary for the case where CompileMacro generates a pcm (and thus need to support reload) or the case where the user explicitly unload a library.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5420#issuecomment-618042721:415,depend,depend,415,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5420#issuecomment-618042721,3,['depend'],['depend']

Integrability,"Originally, I used https://github.com/GooFit/Minuit2 - that uses a python script to re-copy the changed files from the ROOT sources. Being a git repository, it also easily is included as a submodule in the `/extern` folder for GooFit, for example. After meeting and talking with @lmoneta a couple of days ago over a coffee, he outlined the procedure I initially implemented. He showed me the old ""build"" directory, with an old bash script that copied the necessary files out. He wanted me to make a new folder to eventually replace his build folder. The idea is that you could create source distributions that would be packaged and made available as downloads to continue the outdated ones available here: http://project-mathlibs.web.cern.ch/project-mathlibs/minuit/release/download.html. I added this though `make package_source`, and included `make package` for binary distributions as well. The integrated version does look a bit better, though it is a bit more invasive and not nearly as well separated. I do need to copy to `/inc/Math`, etc, since a source distribution needs to be in the source directory. Everything is copied to `INSTALL_PREFIX/include` when it's installed or packaged for a binary distribution. As for use, a git only solution really is not feasible, unfortunately, with any method that does not include git submodules. The current methods for a user are:. * Install beforehand from one of the downloadable packages, either building a source package or installing a binary package. This is the way some people will get it, but not ideal for a modern package that wants to have minimal dependencies.; * Have CMake download and build the package with `ExternalProject` - probably the best solution for now, still not as nice for something like GooFit that already has all dependencies as git submodules.; * Check out all of ROOT as a submodule, then `add_subdirectory(extern/root/math/minuit2)`.

Integrability,"Possible reason for the problem, in Cling (also Clang) some headers are included automatically at startup to simplify the operation. In the case of CUDA, the order of the headers is really important because CUDA has to annotate the `stl` functions to be available on CPU and GPU (e.g. `int std::abs(int n)` -> `__device__ __host__ std::abs(int n))`. If the order is not correct, various things can happen (no GPU version available, redefinition errors, error messages that have nothing to do with the actual problem ...). A good starting point for bug hunting is to compare the startup process of vanilla cling and ROOT cling.; * A good starting point for Cling the is the function [`CIFactory::createCIImpl()`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/de3514c2a88f653584108d2be64e28f50a2b29da/interpreter/cling/lib/Interpreter/CIFactory.cpp#L1214); * In ROOT, some extra headers are injected (before?) in the [TCling](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/a56901942dfefa6e7e2e7df397a60c9d1cda31a0/core/metacling/src/TCling.cxx#L1327) class",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7518#issuecomment-808738232:459,message,messages,459,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7518#issuecomment-808738232,2,"['inject', 'message']","['injected', 'messages']"

Integrability,"Removed the false comment and moved the `unique_ptr` declaration above `TextInputHolder`, in case `TextInputHolder::~TextInputHolder()` still access it (in the future). However, I am thinking about enhancing CLI completion support of cling. Such as tab completion. Currently cling only prints completion suggestion but does not complete the input buffer for the user when only single unambiguous completion exists. Also the completion does not recognize meta command like `.x`, `.L` so it does not try to complete its arguments (paths). And the path does not expand `~` to home dir.; @Axel-Naumann , do you think it is a good idea for cling to adopt `llvm::LineEditor` ? (https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1LineEditor.html) ; Or building cling's own readline/libedit wrapper? ; `core/textinput/src/textinput/doc/textinput.txt` states that `textinput` is created to avoid depending on readline/libedit in year 2011.; Is it still true today 2022? cling highly depends on llvm now so it should be fine to adopt `llvm::LineEditor` (created in 2013. `textinput` predates it).; I have a prototype cling with the above enhanced completion support based on libedit but I will only create PR if cling (and all root components currently using `textinput` ) are open to such changes and dependency. I can refactor to use `llvm::LineEditor` instead.

This suggests that the `TTreeReader` does strictly more work to get the same result, i.e. does unnecessary `TTree` / `TBranch` operations!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3216#issuecomment-455183145:279,interface,interfaces,279,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3216#issuecomment-455183145,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

During the development of POSIX.1-2017, it was decided to change all buffer lengths to size_t, which appears at face value to make sense. When dual mode 32/64-bit systems came along, this choice unnecessarily complicated system interfaces because size_t (with long) was a different size under ILP32 and LP64 models. Reverting to int would have happened except that some implementations had already shipped 64-bit-only interfaces. The compromise was a type which could be defined to be any size by the implementation: socklen_t. I am not sure how to approach this, because the standardization of `socklen_t` seems fairly recent, but in the long run, avoiding this whole types dance altogether and simply using explicit `socklen_t` seems to make most sense and will make for a simpler code.

I cannot judge everything since I'm not familiar enough with these details. One thing different to our hack which I don't see here is the name of the file. We set `fName` to a hardcoded constant (empty didn't work) so that we're not dependent on the name of the file on creation. (for example I can create a file with `mkstemp()`, write and then rename and I will get the same checksum as writing directly to the final name). At the very least it would be necessary to be able to construct the file with the same name in different directories and still obtain the checksum but I would prefer if the filename doesn't have any affect on the checksum. .

Integrability,"Thank you. So if I understand correctly : ; for n_s times RooHistPdf, it behaves as for the case RooHistPdf for the method : getVal() ; -> OK : it gives a result ""normalized to 1"". But if we decide *not to normalize* the RooDataHist used to create the RooHistPdf,; the RooHistPdf -> getVal() will return a value normalized to the number of events of the RooDataHist : so in this case it gives a *non-normalized result*. This is strange since it is stated : ""The histogram distribution is explicitly normalized by RooHistPdf and can have an arbitrary number of real or discrete dimensions. "". Indeed, with my minimum example where you may put the option option_normalize_hist=0 (with the fix that you kindly found of <=55 bins); we get :; value_pdf total=39.9713; which represents : pdf->getVal()*bin_width. so in this case, we don't need to multiply by the number of events to obtain a prediction !!; The value of the pdf is not inside [0, 1]. So, depending whether the RooDataHist that was used in order to construct the RooHistPdf, was normalized or not normalized, the RooHistPdf->getVal() returns a normalized or a not normalised result,; in contradiction with the sentence that roofit is expected to do it : the sentence : ""The histogram distribution is explicitly normalized by RooHistPdf and can have an arbitrary number of real or discrete dimensions.

Integrability,"Thanks @amadio for the extensive input! Let me address it point by point:. First: the current choice for ""built-in only"". The built-in is there for two reasons: 1) as a dependency, obviously, but 2) also because the full source is needed to build `zmq::ppoll`. `ppoll` was written as an extension to libzmq itself. In the ideal world, I would have committed this back to libzmq (which they are open to, and which I'll do later, see https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/4220), but haven't had time yet. The interim solution is to just ship it with ROOT, but this requires (part of) the libzmq source to build against. We can do this in two ways: a) just include the necessary libzmq files or b) get them externally on the fly. I actually went with option a) first. However, when people started trying out this branch on their machines, it turned out that the `conda` libzmq build (which I was using in my dev setup) had a more favorable configuration than for instance most Linux native builds, especially because those native builds lack CMake configuration files. That latter fact made me decide to just make the built-in dependency the default; this way I wouldn't have to figure out how to best detect libzmq on each platform (or find / cobble together a good and freely licensed FindZeroMQ.cmake, but the general feeling around the ZeroMQ community is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Then about the RooFitZ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730:169,depend,dependency,169,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730,1,['depend'],['dependency']

But in that case, the core lock is acquired; _before_ the call to dlopen, not after. So, what is to be done?. There is probably only one code path in ATLAS that was giving us problems.; The Gaudi plugin manager was being used to load one of the POOL libraries; that happened to include ROOT dictionary information. I could; acquire the ROOT core lock around this (and one or two other places; where i known that Gaudi components may be loaded after event processing; starts). However, there are many other places where shared libraries; could potentially be loaded. While those probably don't matter...; the original bug here was quite opaque, taking several months; to completely track down. So i'm loathe to leave open any possibility; that it could bite us again. We could add locking within TClassTable. This is perhaps an attractive; way forward, as it should make it much easier to ensure that usages; of TClassTable are correct. A drawback is that is hard to then ensure; that we don't have something else that is also supposed to be protected; by the core mutex. Nevertheless, i could try to prepare a change; to do this if it sounds good. However, that's not the end of the problems. If this analysis is correct, then we _already_ have potential deadlock; problems, as there is nothing to prevent the initialization code of a; shared library (which can be arbitrary used code) from calling into ROOT; in a way that would acquire the core mutex. So code which would look; innocent to the user would have a chance of deadlocking.; I'm not sure ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071:433,wrap,wrapping,433,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071,1,['wrap'],['wrapping']

Integrability,"Thanks for being willing to help here - I do understand the pain... We have thousands and thousands of user C++ files (macros) that rely on ROOT's `using namespace std`.

We can do ""The Right Thing"" and annoy the hell out of the vast majority of our users, or have those people who are annoyed by this (and thus by definition have some expertise in coding) work around this ""feature"" of ROOT. Both are bad options, but IMHO the first is worse. As I said, we're considering replacing it with a bunch of `using std::cout` etc - but that might not help you, if `std::any` is part of the list. ROOT's `using namespace std` is even required for some (at least old) files to be read, so its suppression has more consequences than just at the prompt. We don't have a feature to ""dump cling input"" - because much of cling's input is actually synthetic AST, and code that gets unloaded again, or code that is injected without proper code context, e.g. `std::vector<MyClass>` might be looked up by some part of cling, the I/O, or PyROOT, and that's not valid code by itself, yet has very visible effects on cling, triggering instantiation etc. If you have an idea of how to approximate this let me know!.

Integrability,"Thanks for the attention to it. Maybe I was too enthusiastic in the context of displayed objects and interactive root sessions. I'm not an expert, but still learning. Th RDirectory looks interesting. Subroutines leaving global objects lying around still seems funny. It could be convenient for casual scripting. As an example of a main routine, and a subroutine that ""makes"" a TCanvas that persists after a .x, I'd be inclined to skin the cat this way:. ```; // my_subroutines.C; void my_subroutine(unique_ptr<TCanvas> &x) {; x.reset() // TCanvas requires the extra step, see note below.; x.reset(new TCanvas());; // .. do something with it.; }; ```. ```; //make_canvas.C; namespace root_global { ; unique_ptr<TCanvas> c1;; }. void make_canvas() {; // we decide at the top level to use a global here:; my_subroutine(root_global::c1);. //This one doesn't use a global and will die, our choice; unique_ptr<TCanvas> local_canvas;; my_subroutine(local_canvas);; }; ```; or if being a little more lazy, I'd likely use static instead of the namespace, but the root interpreter doesn't respect translation unit boundaries well. Really I'd use a class though in case I need to add more global things easily:. ```; //display.h. class display {; private:; unique_ptr<TCanvas> c1;; public:; void make_canvas() {; c1.reset(); ; c1.reset(new TCanvas());; }; };; ```; And use it like:; ```; //make_display.C; #include ""display.h"". namespace root_global { ; display my_display;; }. // main routine:; void make_display() { ; // This one will stick around; root_global::my_display.make_canvas();. // This one wont. ; display local_display;; local_display.make_canvas();; }; ```. There are two main differences compared to the PR. 1) I'm not letting the subroutine allocate heap objects that aren't handled explicitly by the caller. 2) I'm using standard C++ that even works fine right now in root 6.

Integrability,"Thanks for the great comments @guitargeek! All the ones I didn't comment on I agree with, so will implement those soon. I agree that it has become quite a complex class. It would be nice if things could be refactored at some time. However, part of it is also inevitable, I fear, because `RooMinimizer` has to bridge between two rather different frameworks, that of Minuit2 and RooFit, and now due to all the parallel processing work will have to deal with even more stuff than before. By the way, just as a historical aside: at some point I had turned `RooMinimizer` into a fully templated class, which made it even more horrible to maintain and time consuming to develop (since the header had to be recompiled on every change). I managed to trim the template horror down to just the constructor by introducing `RooAbsMinimizerFcn`. That introduced its own complexity here and there, as we discussed above :) But it was better in the end, I think. Note that the sole reason the template parameter is still necessary in the constructor is that the `MinimizerFcn` needs the proper constructor inside the `RooMinimizer` constructor. I like your suggestion of also using the template class argument instead of the `dynamic_cast` using `std::is_same`, but this is not strictly necessary like using the proper constructor is. By the way, note also that in the upcoming TestStatistics PR, there will be yet another `RooMinimizer` constructor, also with template arguments, but different ones, namely the concrete calculator classes for the likelihood and gradient.

Integrability,"Thanks for you comments @lmoneta.; I'm sorry for my late reply but since nothing happened here for over a month, I stopped watching. The reason I used double pointers for the 2D arrays was to have the most low level datatype possible, have full felxibility and stay consistent with the other TGraph classes which are all using pointers for 1D arrays. Nevertheless I understand your concerns since double pointers for arrays are a rather dirty way of programming. I think it might be a good compromise to use the ROOT array wrapper class TArrayD. Then the two dimensional Arrays could be represented by an 1D array of TArrayD objects. The functions SetPointEY, SetPointEYL and SetPointEYH were implemented by me to keep full consistency with the TGraphAsymmErrors class. They are overloaded with one version taking the point and an array in which case the array cointains all errors of the named point for the different dimensions. My idea was to alter the TGraphAsymmErrors notation as little as possible so TGraphAsymmErrors::SetPointEY(i, el, eh) would translate to TGraphMultiErrors::SetPointEY(i, &el, &ey) in the case of only one error dimension which would be equal to a TGraphAsymmErrors. The idea of the function SetDimensionEY, SetDimensionEYL and SetDimensionEYH is basically the same. They set the errors of all points in the given dimension. My idea was to think of a way to convert from multiple TGraphAsymmErrors objects to one single TGraphMultiErrors object like in this small example:; ```; TGraphAsymmErrors* statisticErrors = ...; TGraphAsymmErrors* systematicErrors = ... TGraphMultiErrors* theGraph = new TGraphMultiErrors(statisticErrors->GetN(), 2, statisticErrors->GetX(), statisticErrors->GetY(), statisticErrors->GetEXlow(), statisticErrors->GetEXhigh());; theGraph->SetDimensionEY(0, statisticErrors->GetEYlow(), statisticErrors->GetEYhigh());; theGraph->SetDimensionEY(1, systematicErrors->GetEYlow(), systematicErrors->GetEYhigh());; ```.

Integrability,"Thanks. I've had a quick look -- so your approach is to say that the global observables get added to the dataset in the same way you would list your observables, but then you have a way to flag which of the observables are the global ones?.

As for testing, checking the caching works with IMT on needs to be done. The extra mile would consist in checking statically that T does not have a copy constructor and react.

Integrability,"The idea was to have an executable that is linked statically against ROOT and other dependencies so that it can be used as the legacy version of a certain software package which is being retired in favour of new software. For example in order to run it using a gitlab runner for various cross-checks without the need to install root from source (multiple times even, for every testing stage) or ship it together with huge CentOS images. For the gitlab this just seems to be almost unfeasible, even with existing root docker containers from the docker hub. I understand that if ROOT was never meant to be used in this way, there just won't be resources to dedicate to this.

Integrability,"The only thing I see fixable (and not breaking existing use cases) is the case for returning integer types. Details:; - Unloading a transaction also unloads its generated code, AST, etc - that's violating a contract that existing uses rely on.; - `Calc` etc return whatever cast to long, since CINT, return a reference (cast to long) for ""objects"". As you know that means the temporary must be stored until the end of the process. Bad interface, but it is what it is, and breaking the interface contract is out of question.; - Memory allocated by `MachineFunctionPass` is likely the object code output of the JIT. It's a common use case to `Declare()` something and then `Calc()` say the address of a template instantiation - unloading the binary code after `Calc()` would again violate the usage contract. I believe much of this issue comes from a misunderstanding, as you point out:. > they are in fact not insulated one-offs of evaluating the code in some context. Would you like us to improve the documentation on those?. So what we're left with is adding new interfaces.

Integrability,"The reason for this behaviour seems to be that all the Python classes in the reproducer (`B`, `C` and `D`) get a `Dispatcher` wrapper class automatically created (`Dispatcher1`, `Dispatcher2` and `Dispatcher3`, respectively) that inherits from `A`. Since for `B` and `C` `fun1` is overridden in Python, `Dispatcher1` and `Dispatcher2` define a `fun1` implementation that redirects the call to the Python `fun1` of `B` and `C`, respectively. That is not the case of `D`, whose `Dispatcher3` defines no `fun1`. What I described above explains the behaviour reported in this ticket. When calling `d.fun2()`, which in turn calls `fun1`, the latter will be resolved to `A::fun1`, whereas one would expect that it is the `fun1` defined in Python by `B` that is called instead. This issue does not exist in upstream cppyy: `Dispatcher3` inherits from `Dispatcher1` (`B`'s dispatcher) and not from `A` directly, which means that the call to `fun1` from `fun2` will be resolved to `Dispatcher1::fun1`, which will redirect the call to Python (`B`'s `fun1`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166:126,wrap,wrapper,126,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']
Integrability,"The reason for using an environment variable is the following:. It is a common occurrence in the root code to use initialization classes that perform configuration in its constructor, and then have a static instance of this class declared in a library so that this initialization happens automatically when the library is loaded.

Since the initialization of the static instances in the libraries an application links to happens before the main program starts, the behaviour of these initialization routines can not be modified by command line options, since these options are parsed by the main program.

Integrability,"This PR duplicates one of the commits in PR #1520 (that PR in addition addresses two more issues in JsMVA not related to the d3 change). As written in the description of PR #1520:. > The code has not been updated to reflect changes in jsroot. The code still tries to load d3.v3.min.js from jsroot. In the current version of jsroot the d3 script has been updated to version 4 and the file is now called d3.min.js. The pull request changes the name of the file in the two places where it is referenced, so it should now find the file. However this change is incomplete since the d3 API changes between the versions and some porting is needed. This PR does not introduce any other changes than changing the name of the js file in the two places where it is referenced in the code, just as PR #1520 does. The API of d3 v4 is not fully backward compatible with d3 v3. Did you go through the code and check that nothing else needs to be changed? In jsroot itself there were many other changes to the code to adapt to the changed API when the d3.js file was updated to v4 as seen in the commit:. https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/commit/c156b8956f77d1aef4b70cd8609c4b1f2036f94f#diff-26681b69718507c05077030d69e5ba58.

Integrability,"This issue is very case-dependent.; When trying to calculate memory usage, normally the actual free memory on the system is `free + buffer + cached `. If shared memory usage is high (e.g mmaping a big cache) the calculation is slightly different:; `(free + buffer/cache) - shared`. The author of **htop** mentions on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55090900/how-can-i-calculate-memory-utilisation-of-a-linux-server-using-sar-report) question that htop uses this convention(in 2016):. - Total used memory = MemTotal - MemFree; - Non cache/buffer memory = Total used memory - (Buffers + Cached memory). Now htop (managed by htop-dev) uses this (on https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/blob/main/linux/LinuxMachine.c#L210):. ```; const memory_t usedDiff = freeMem + cachedMem + sreclaimableMem + buffersMem;; host->usedMem = (totalMem >= usedDiff) ? totalMem - usedDiff : totalMem - freeMem;; ```. This issue intends to merge the total used memory to include cached instead of just free which isn't strictly a correct solution. I have implemented the current approach utilised by **htop** which includes the following fields to calculate `MemUsed`, `MemAvailable` and `SwapUsed`:. ```; Int_t fMemAvailable; // available RAM in MB; Int_t fMemCached; // cached RAM in MB; Int_t fMemBuffer; // buffer RAM in MB; Int_t fMemShared; // shared RAM in MB; Int_t fSwapCached; // cached swap in MB; Int_t fSReclaimable // slab that might be reclaimed; ```; Fixed in ; - https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14695",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7196#issuecomment-1941955488:24,depend,dependent,24,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7196#issuecomment-1941955488,1,['depend'],['dependent']

It is obviously correct - since if you use dynamic_cast and then do NOT check for nullptr and happily dereference the result, you can as well use a static_cast - if the old code was correct, the new one is correct as well. And the other cases, where you can simply remove the cast, are obvioulsly correct as well.

Integrability,"Those 2 classes may or may not be the only 2 that have this kind of pattern in the wild, so it might be interesting to solve the underlying issue which is likely to be that `BindCppObject` is trying to bind to a type which has no interpreter info. So a fix could be to have either `CPyCppyy::BindCppObject` or `Cppyy::GetActualClass` to check for the presence of interpreter info before attempting to automatically bind to the ""actual class/type"". (In theory this should be done by testing `TClass::HasInterpreterInfo` but in this case it is returning an incorrect information and thus we have to use `TClass::GetClassInfo`). The change in behavior is that after this modification, `PyROOT/Cppyy` would no longer warn if the actual return type is inadvertently missing its interpreter info. However semantically this seems to be the right behavior, for example in our cases we would:; * have no warning; * PyROOT will report the type of the pointer as `TList`; * Usage of the meta routines (`IsA` and co.) would still give accurate information (access to the `TClass` for `TViewPubFunctions`); * Interfaces to the objects are the same as the one available from the equivalent C++ code (I.e. `TList`) (unless the user does an explicit dynamic_cast to the underlying type). * In other cases (for user provided functions and classes) where the interpreter information from the underlying class is missing by mistake (bad/broken configuration of the user code/libraries), the error/warning reporting about the missing interpreter info will be delayed until the user actually want to access the underlying class.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820:981,rout,routines,981,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820,2,"['Interface', 'rout']","['Interfaces', 'routines']"

Integrability,"What can be done here is rather simple. The bottleneck last time I checked is rootcling (dictionary generation). There are two reasons:; * cmake -- dictionary generation depends on LinkDef and header files and both artifacts are available from the beginning. However, the cmake build system does not have separate targets for dictionary generation and library generation. That leads to forcing rootcling to wait for the expensive linking step of each library. For example, instead of building `Y.pcm` once we are done with building `X.pcm` we wait for the linker to link `X.so`.; * rootcling is unnecessary slow -- the tool has grown organically and in many cases we make many iterations over the AST where we don't need them. Some of the larger scale ideas have been outlined here since years: https://github.com/root-project/root-evolution/pull/5 In fact, we don't need to get so much into the refactoring rootcling, attaching a profiler and seeing the bottlenecks should be easy.

Verify if the same happens with LLVM 11/12 (whatever Cling will move to next), and possibly fix the underlying issue in LLVM upstream's `main`. LLVM 11.1.0 does not show the problem with `lli -O0` by default due to https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/366ab0d086a457b085e3c9ba1c987d5499079cd6, but forcing `--global-isel=1` still fails. The commit message is light on details, but I'd say this confirms it's a framework problem of GlobalISel.

But it's Philippe's review, I let him comment / deal with this if you still prefer to keep your current commit log.

Integrability,"You are adding it to the target, the dependency is explicit in the fact that you need to have a target to pass as argument. You don't need to add the include that the dictionary needs to the executable, you could just add it to the directory includes, but adding to the target is better as it avoids leaking it to subdirectories. You only have to do it before because of Axel's changes that force a manual header search for the dictionary header, so the search paths need to be ready for you to actually find it. In earlier versions of ROOT, not finding this header would not cause a failure, but may have picked up the wrong header and injected a bunch of absolute paths to the dictionary which in turn would end up breaking things. For example, if you know the dictionary header will always just be in the current source directory, you could just set `CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR` to `True` instead, and not add the current directory to the target includes.; ```; $ cmake --help-variable CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR; CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR; -------------------------.

Integrability,"`DistancetoPrimitive` is the base method to be overridden by visual primitives attached to the pad. In `geom` we attach several different objects. Among these, shapes implement this function directly, while for volumes there is some traversal logic in the geometry painter, dispatching eventually to the shapes methods. Composite Boolean shapes are special and need an extra internal specialized dispatching for union, intersection, and subtraction. The intention was to do this dispatching by avoiding the TObject interface (Boolean nodes are never added directly to the pad), and this is why the upper case `T`. However, due to the complexity, these functions are not implemented, so now they are not even connected to `TGeoCompositeShape::DistancetoPrimitive`. . Sorry for this long explanation, this is only to say there is nothing to worry about, the functions are placeholders to remember that this functionality could be added at some point.

For `RMergeableVariations<T>`, the data member `fValues` is a `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<RMergeableValue<T>>>` (due to the way we need to retrieve the various mergeables of the variations in the call chain). So it seemed quite natural to me to have a ; ```cpp; const std::vector<std::unique_ptr<RMergeableValue<T>>> &GetValue() const { return fValues; }; ```; method in this class to me (albeit I failed to mark the method itself `const`). Having a ; ```cpp; const T &GetValue(const std::string &variation) const;; ```; method is also possible.

Integrability,"al read is modeled as an error. This would require `ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()` to force the ""immediate exception"" state to a certain value and reset it later - which is error prone and awkward; it shows that we use a global state that needs local knowledge. If ""immediate exception"" is false and `ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()` captures the error and returns it, same for all subsequent frames but `ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++()` (which cannot return a `RStatus`), then only `ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++()` will throw. This would shorten the stack trace shown by a potential crash to; ```; ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++(); UserCode::modelBackground(); ```; - we would not know the stack trace that actually triggered the exception. We would likely have some info captured in the error message (e.g. ""ROOT::ReadFromNetwork() failed to call linux_read_from_network()""), but we'd miss the connection, i.e. `ROOT::RNetFile::Read()`. One way of handling that is by injecting state:; ```; RStatus ROOT::RNetFile::Read() {; RStatus res(ROOT::ReadFromNetwork());; ...; return R__STATUS_PASSTHROUGH(res); // registers res to have passed through ""ROOT::RNetFile::Read()"" by emplacing a frame string *if* in error state.; ```; That's similar to [`llvm::PrettyStackTraceEntry`](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1PrettyStackTraceEntry.html), see usage [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/df494f7512b0ecebdf3d7be97695a1b6278c0336/clang/lib/CodeGen/BackendUtil.cpp#L909). FYI, there has been a multi-hundred email discussion on exactly this topic on the C++ committee mailing list, with pretty much two camps: allow error code handling (with potential exceptions) versus just always throw in case of errors, and if that's slow, go fix the compiler / runtime library implementations (but ABI break). **TL;DR**:; I agree that exceptions instead of error codes allow for nicer code.

Integrability,"appen) In other words a portion of the new/delete problem has just been hidden under new with a different name. This is exactly what I mean by modern ownership models. In example 1 the top level code asked for memory that it owns. In my class version it made an instance that it owns. Objects are scoped only as far as requested. When that scope dies, or the container is reset, it's cleaned up where it is made. That's what smart pointers are all about. The PR as-is won't leak, but only because it's not flexible enough to create different things. It's a fragile grammar and in the end I'd rather worry about adding top-level ""keep"" statements than top level ""deletes"". In the C++ global version of example 2, to get the serial loop over 3 parallel histograms, you'd need the global to be a vector and you'd have to push_back() onto it, but you're in the same (bad) place then. I wrote a script just like that this week exactly to fit a number of peaks determined by a file read inside one routine, and looped over outside, and I used example 1, not example 2, and future use of the base routine will never cause leaks. . The code structure is problematic to me. RDirectory itself isn't terrible, but I just don't see what it solves other than more syntax to remember. A final point, the shared pointers supposedly perform worse than unique pointers. I don't know how much it matters, but when you're fitting millions of waveforms maybe it does. Of course then you shouldn't be using RDirectory, but you can still use my_subroutines.C to do your fit if you're looping the million without RDirectory or to examining one of those fits with RDirectory, without rewriting the routine. I'm going to skip the point about empty root objects just to limit the scope for now. ### How to skip globals entirely. Of course you can just let the top level code return an object or structure. The downside is just that you have to .L the code and call it with auto ret=make_th1().

Really I'd use a class though in case I need to add more global things easily:. ```; //display.h. class display {; private:; unique_ptr<TCanvas> c1;; public:; void make_canvas() {; c1.reset(); ; c1.reset(new TCanvas());; }; };; ```; And use it like:; ```; //make_display.C; #include ""display.h"". namespace root_global { ; display my_display;; }. // main routine:; void make_display() { ; // This one will stick around; root_global::my_display.make_canvas();. // This one wont. ; display local_display;; local_display.make_canvas();; }; ```. There are two main differences compared to the PR. 1) I'm not letting the subroutine allocate heap objects that aren't handled explicitly by the caller. 2) I'm using standard C++ that even works fine right now in root 6. That's nice because it's easier to learn, recognize, understand, and apply elsewhere. Maybe it's a bonus that syntax for creating the TCanvas is always the same and separated from syntax for keeping it. Maybe (1) can be done with RDirectory, and just isn't done in the PR example. I don't know enough about it. If the root objects all had some kind of empty non-displayed initial state, and their own reset() re-initializer, we wouldn't even need the unique_ptr. . Of course you could still end up calling make_display() as a subtroutine from another file, and if you do then it's still become a subroutine allocating ""its own"" heap",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7305#issuecomment-787621241:1475,rout,routine,1475,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7305#issuecomment-787621241,1,['rout'],['routine']

I do realize my post was terse. Here is more text as the discussion went in another direction. Since early days, as you already mentioned, the rule seems to be ""the last expression without a trailing semicolon should print"". If that is the rule, then it clearly does not handle short-hand operators. Namely, `if (x) expr`. That rule does not extend to your examples `do 1 while(true)` as `while` is not really an user-defined expression. `if (x) { expr }` does not fall there either as it is in a compound statement. It is pretty clear where we stop. The construct `if(x) expr`, as shown in the example, enables an interactive programming pattern wrt error handling where in case of an error we can just ask cling to print details. > I'd prefer to keep value printing simple.

That seems as bad as preloading a set of llvm dependent libraries, IMO.

The change would only be for exectuables, which usually do not have -fPIC by default. But then actually other libraries have similar requirements, e.g. Qt5 (with -reduce-relocation flag, which is the default) requires all executables to link against Qt to be compiled with -fPIC.

Sorry that it took me a while to look at this. I had to create an Ubuntu 16.04 virtual machine for testing. . @lmoneta, unfortunately, this error happens because Ubuntu 16.04 ships GSL version 2.1, which hasn't gsl_ran_multivariate_gaussian. The multivariate Gaussian random number generation in GSL was only introduced in version 2.2.1. I bypass this with an `#ifdef` that will define the function if the GSL version is < 2.2 by simply copying it from a higher version of GSL. Hopefully, this doesn't break the GPL license under which GSL is distributed. I think that I could also replace the function call to `gsl_ran_multivariate_gaussian` with the wrapper's full implementation. I am open to comments.

Integrability,"ay. So, to your points:. No, it does not need to be instantiated first. For example, if I know that a _potential_ match has a signature of `T*`, then I'm not going to ask it to match `T&`, so even before instantiation, the lookup has useful information. Right now, CPyCppyy loops over each, so will eventually match if all types are by-pointer or all are by reference, but that fails combinations. Another good case is knowing which arguments are based on template parameters and which are not, so that the non-template ones need not be varied. No, on the Python side it is fair game to provide the template arguments, and thus non-ADL happens, too. E.g. all int types are equivalent as far as Python is concerned, and although CPyCppyy will increase the template int argument if it has an argument value larger than will fit, it is not uncommon for Python users to simply fill in `int64_t` or whatever. In fact, as-is, if the prototype lookup, ie. argument dependent, fails, CPyCppyy will assume that we're dealing with the common case where all argument types are template parameters. (It's a human thing to make that order consistent, which is why it works quite often, but it is not a language requirement/guarantee.) It then asks for the full name in a non-ADL manner. ROOT/meta (lookupHelper, I think) does not even support friends, so no worries there. Whether you think it is ""eeew"" or not is irrelevant. That's highly a technical term. What is relevant is that just before the lookupHelper does a `BestViableFunction()` it has a `OverloadCandidateSet` and I can do a much better job finding my own match than can do Sema, b/c the rules to apply aren't exactly the C++ ones (the only ones that Sema knows). Unfortunately, I can't just return the set, as it's deep in the bowels of lookupHelper, whose bowels are very deep if you ever looked, and AFAICT, there is a current transaction that needs to be returned with it and maybe more. Plus if returned, there also needs to be a cleanupHelper.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696817778:1182,depend,dependent,1182,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696817778,1,['depend'],['dependent']
Integrability,"bal. The RDirectory is more self-documenting than ""new"", but C++ one makes the file self documenting, not just the line of code. And, all else equal, vanilla is better. But by far the more important point is that I don't like example 2 or the PR. Regarding point 2, example 1 is surely more scalable. I already scaled it more than is possible with the PR. Of course you can edit the PR to make new key names on each call so that the RDirectory call can create more things. But scalable means I did it without needing to modify the underlying implementation or interface (which someone else might maintain) to get three plots instead of one. Furthermore, coming back to issue 1, **if you do edit the PR to have flexible (sequential or passed) RDirectory names, you also (edit: might) need to add explicit deletes (more lines of code) somewhere if you run it all in a batch loop, or you'll have a leak.**(**edit**: depending on exactly how the looping and naming is done, but it can easily happen) In other words a portion of the new/delete problem has just been hidden under new with a different name. This is exactly what I mean by modern ownership models. In example 1 the top level code asked for memory that it owns. In my class version it made an instance that it owns. Objects are scoped only as far as requested. When that scope dies, or the container is reset, it's cleaned up where it is made. That's what smart pointers are all about. The PR as-is won't leak, but only because it's not flexible enough to create different things. It's a fragile grammar and in the end I'd rather worry about adding top-level ""keep"" statements than top level ""deletes"". In the C++ global version of example 2, to get the serial loop over 3 parallel histograms, you'd need the global to be a vector and you'd have to push_back() onto it, but you're in the same (bad) place then. I wrote a script just like that this week exactly to fit a number of peaks determined by a file read inside one routine, and looped",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7305#issuecomment-791104038:4430,depend,depending,4430,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7305#issuecomment-791104038,1,['depend'],['depending']

First is that we *must* build a dictionary before we use a header file. We are likely missing a build dependency on `ROOTGpadv7`. I believe you are trying to fix the second problem. Namely, `TLine.hxx` includes `TPadPainter.hxx` which includes `TDisplayItem.hxx` and you end up with the cycle `ROOTGraphicsPrimitives -> ROOTGpadv7 -> ROOTGraphicsPrimitives`. It seems that `ROOTGraphicsPrimitives` is a foundational module. Its header `TLine.hxx` should not depend on headers in `ROOTGpadv7`. @Teemperor is right, `TLine.hxx` should not depend on `TPadPainter.hxx`. You can break that loop by introducing a forward declarations of `TPadPainter.hxx` entities where necessary if definitions are not required. This is how the current master's modulemap looks like (maybe this helps to see the cycle).; ```; module ""ROOTGraphicsPrimitives"" {; requires cplusplus; module ""ROOT/TColor.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TColor.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDisplayItem.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDisplayItem.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDrawingAttr.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDrawingAttr.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDrawingOptsBase.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDrawingOptsBase.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TLine.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TLine.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TMarker.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TMarker.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TPalette.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TPalette.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TStringEnumAttr.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TStringEnumAttr.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TStyle.hxx"" { hea",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2091#issuecomment-392598607:2335,depend,depend,2335,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2091#issuecomment-392598607,1,['depend'],['depend']

Integrability,"bviously, but 2) also because the full source is needed to build `zmq::ppoll`. `ppoll` was written as an extension to libzmq itself. In the ideal world, I would have committed this back to libzmq (which they are open to, and which I'll do later, see https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/4220), but haven't had time yet. The interim solution is to just ship it with ROOT, but this requires (part of) the libzmq source to build against. We can do this in two ways: a) just include the necessary libzmq files or b) get them externally on the fly. I actually went with option a) first. However, when people started trying out this branch on their machines, it turned out that the `conda` libzmq build (which I was using in my dev setup) had a more favorable configuration than for instance most Linux native builds, especially because those native builds lack CMake configuration files. That latter fact made me decide to just make the built-in dependency the default; this way I wouldn't have to figure out how to best detect libzmq on each platform (or find / cobble together a good and freely licensed FindZeroMQ.cmake, but the general feeling around the ZeroMQ community is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is Roo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730:1126,depend,dependency,1126,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730,1,['depend'],['dependency']

The idea is that you could create source distributions that would be packaged and made available as downloads to continue the outdated ones available here: http://project-mathlibs.web.cern.ch/project-mathlibs/minuit/release/download.html. I added this though `make package_source`, and included `make package` for binary distributions as well. The integrated version does look a bit better, though it is a bit more invasive and not nearly as well separated. I do need to copy to `/inc/Math`, etc, since a source distribution needs to be in the source directory. Everything is copied to `INSTALL_PREFIX/include` when it's installed or packaged for a binary distribution. As for use, a git only solution really is not feasible, unfortunately, with any method that does not include git submodules. The current methods for a user are:. * Install beforehand from one of the downloadable packages, either building a source package or installing a binary package. This is the way some people will get it, but not ideal for a modern package that wants to have minimal dependencies.; * Have CMake download and build the package with `ExternalProject` - probably the best solution for now, still not as nice for something like GooFit that already has all dependencies as git submodules.; * Check out all of ROOT as a submodule, then `add_subdirectory(extern/root/math/minuit2)`. Much more disk space usage that needed, but otherwise also a decent solution. Might even be best. All three methods should be supported by this standalone build system.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1680#issuecomment-369601161:1610,depend,dependencies,1610,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1680#issuecomment-369601161,2,['depend'],['dependencies']

Integrability,"dentify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ ( ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so"" provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""... ; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1. The lookup for ""f"" finds and runs the materializer for ""f"".; 2.2.2. The materializer for ""f"" reaches JITLink, which tries to resolve symbol ""x"". There is no work to trigger (we started materializing it already in (2.1)), so the link is suspended pending resolution of ""x"". Critically, the dlopen cannot complete until the link completes.; 2.2. MU would dlsym ""x"", but it's blocked waiting on the dlopen to finish. And we're deadlocked again. The root cause of the problem is that ld.so and the JIT don't communicate immediately about symbol resolutions. What we really wanted was for the dlopen to registe",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382:1649,depend,depending,1649,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"doing more complex analyses with RDF. the first line of the [RDF docs](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html) says `ROOT's RDataFrame offers a high level interface for analyses of data stored in TTree, CSV's and other data formats. `. Just by the fact that I can read and process other formats than TTree I would say that in general RDF is not meant to be treated like a TTree. Otherwise I would also have to say that RDF is meant to be treated like a CSV file or something similar. I did not refer to the documentation but to how people would actually use this class. 99% of people do not read CSV files with ROOT and `RDataFrame` will be mostly used to interact in a simple and quick way with trees. > ; > > there should be a function that allows us to merge them; > ; > If I have to think about this function you propose, I don't see it going much further than the example you already have above. Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; > ; > ```python; > # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; > df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); > df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2); > ; > # creating new columns in the datasets; > df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); > df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'); > ; > # Merging the datasets in memory; > df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); > # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927331768:1375,interface,interface,1375,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927331768,1,['interface'],['interface']

With that unique identifier per tree you can build another tree that serves as a lookup table between id and index. It will have two branches, `id` and `index`, with the first taking the values of the ids of each tree and the second being an index from 0 to nTrees-1. Then you can use `TTree::BuildIndex` and `TChain::AddFriend` to add that lookup table tree as a friend of the original chain and thanks to `BuildIndex` the correct value of `index` will be returned for each event depending on the value of `id` in the original chain. More info at https://root.cern/manual/trees/#indexing-trees. We would have to run again all the jobs in the grid to store a unique ID. However the name of the file identifies it, so we deduce the index with the filename. The rest of the solution is close to what I did below.; ; > * do a pass on each input tree to calculate whatever other quantities you need to calculate (let's call these trees `aux1`, `aux2` etc.), then make a TChain out of the original trees, another TChain out of the `aux` trees, and then add the second chain as a friend of the first (effectively creating a single large ""virtual"" TTree with everything in it).

Integrability,"e issue is a bit silly and it has to do with how we compute a reasonable default value for the `npartitions` attribute if the user doesn't provide one. The idea, for the moment at least, is to get information about how many cores are available in the distributed cluster to the user application and submit one task per core. In the case of Dask, this is done by accessing the `client.scheduler_info()` dictionary, which in turn contains a `worker` key which value is another dictionary of information about the workers. [The current approach](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/adf9ea8131ce786f58ff2d9446449f9680063292/bindings/experimental/distrdf/python/DistRDF/Backends/Dask/Backend.py#L45) assumed that if this key was present than it must mean that the Dask client has the information about how many cores are available. Unfortunately, as you just demonstrated, this is not the case. In particular, the `dask-jobqueue` interface has a rather annoying quirk, that is whenever you have already called the code to setup the `cluster` and the `client` objects, nothing is really ""ready to run"" yet. Instead, your Dask application will still be waiting for the batch system (HTCondor in this case) to actually give it resources. This has the side-effect that the dictionary I mentioned above contains the key `workers`, but that is an empty dictionary. You can check this by adding a ; ```python; print(client.scheduler_info()); ```; call after you create your `client` in the application. This effect can be mitigated if you first call `client.wait_for_workers(N_WORKERS)` before calling anything else RDF related. This will supposedly make sure that HTCondor has released resources to the Dask cluster (according to [the docs](http://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/api.html#distributed.Client.wait_for_workers)). With that being said, the `optimize_npartitions` function in the Dask backend should not be sensitive to this kind of effect, so in the linked PR I made the check a bit stronger s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9429#issuecomment-992489655:1003,interface,interface,1003,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9429#issuecomment-992489655,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"e possible, have full felxibility and stay consistent with the other TGraph classes which are all using pointers for 1D arrays. Nevertheless I understand your concerns since double pointers for arrays are a rather dirty way of programming. I think it might be a good compromise to use the ROOT array wrapper class TArrayD. Then the two dimensional Arrays could be represented by an 1D array of TArrayD objects. The functions SetPointEY, SetPointEYL and SetPointEYH were implemented by me to keep full consistency with the TGraphAsymmErrors class. They are overloaded with one version taking the point and an array in which case the array cointains all errors of the named point for the different dimensions. My idea was to alter the TGraphAsymmErrors notation as little as possible so TGraphAsymmErrors::SetPointEY(i, el, eh) would translate to TGraphMultiErrors::SetPointEY(i, &el, &ey) in the case of only one error dimension which would be equal to a TGraphAsymmErrors. The idea of the function SetDimensionEY, SetDimensionEYL and SetDimensionEYH is basically the same. They set the errors of all points in the given dimension. My idea was to think of a way to convert from multiple TGraphAsymmErrors objects to one single TGraphMultiErrors object like in this small example:; ```; TGraphAsymmErrors* statisticErrors = ...; TGraphAsymmErrors* systematicErrors = ... TGraphMultiErrors* theGraph = new TGraphMultiErrors(statisticErrors->GetN(), 2, statisticErrors->GetX(), statisticErrors->GetY(), statisticErrors->GetEXlow(), statisticErrors->GetEXhigh());; theGraph->SetDimensionEY(0, statisticErrors->GetEYlow(), statisticErrors->GetEYhigh());; theGraph->SetDimensionEY(1, systematicErrors->GetEYlow(), systematicErrors->GetEYhigh());; ```. But again I see your point since there is no check whether the passed array has a sufficient size.

Integrability,"ect description of standard mixing in GCC documents, but it seems that they do not point out that changing standards will lead to changes in ABI compatibility (If so, it means that the backward compatibility of the C++ standard is violated, which seems serious). I tend to think that this compatibility is guaranteed, but it does require more evidence. > I also don't understand how `cxx20::span` would solve anything: we want users to be able to use the stdlib `span` with ROOT, if their stdlib provides it. In fact, if the user uses the same standard as ROOT, the current situation is very good. I propose to change the name on the premise that users are allowed to link to ROOT with different standards. Typically, if the user is using a higher standard, the `std::span` in the std library will be exposed and conflict with the ROOT version `std::(inline)__ROOT::span`. In order to resolve the conflict, we have to take the second place: if we use `cxx20::span` and provide an interface to convert from/to standard `std::span`, then even if there are differences in standards, the two sides will not interfere with each other. If users have `std::span`, they can use it; If not, they should not get an implementation from ROOT in the std namespace (which affects their subsequent upgrade to a higher version of the C++ standard). All in all, it provides an implementation independent of std when the true `std::span` is not available, and prevents name conflict when mixing the standard.; Of course, if want ROOT to use `std::span` of the standard library when feasible (e.g. complie with C++20), we can just use `cxx20::span` as the alias of `std::span`. However, after then the user cannot be allowed to go back to a standard lower than C++20, otherwise `span` will missing in the header file, and the ROOT internal implementation of `span` should not be use as the fallback - if so, there may be a compatibility problem, caused by the so-called ODR violation. > To come back to my question: shou",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11311#issuecomment-1254659106:1875,interface,interface,1875,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11311#issuecomment-1254659106,1,['interface'],['interface']

However, when people started trying out this branch on their machines, it turned out that the `conda` libzmq build (which I was using in my dev setup) had a more favorable configuration than for instance most Linux native builds, especially because those native builds lack CMake configuration files. That latter fact made me decide to just make the built-in dependency the default; this way I wouldn't have to figure out how to best detect libzmq on each platform (or find / cobble together a good and freely licensed FindZeroMQ.cmake, but the general feeling around the ZeroMQ community is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is RooFit::MultiProcess, so I wanted to wait with such an option until that PR (hopefully I'll be able to submit that one today). In this PR, RooFitZMQ is not used for anything and later on it will just be a library for RooFit::MultiProcess as well, so there would typically not really be a point for a user to want to build RooFitZMQ but not RooFit::MultiProcess. Do you think in this situation it makes sense to add the option for RooFitZMQ already or should I just do it for RooFit::MultiProcess? So, this option (say `-Droof",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730:1691,depend,dependency,1691,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730,1,['depend'],['dependency']

Integrability,"g the underlying implementation to get three instances. But this RDirectory version shown here and the C++ global version here are certainly not different in that respect. The C++ globals actually win on line count here if you like this code structure better (I do). I'd argue if one needs the extern header declarations to pass things around in compiled code, he should ask if he's doing it wrong, and that's not an usual sentiment. The whole point is I think to make things visible from the interpreter or other things spawned from it. That's surely why we got here, and if C++ globals makes it tedious to access them everywhere in compiled code, I call that a bonus. . On the other hand I don't like this ; example2: ; ```cpp; {; // my_subroutines.C; unique_ptr<TH1> x // used in my_subroutine. void my_subroutine() {; x.reset(); ; x.reset(new TH1F());; // .. do something with it.; }; ```; except for maybe quick temporary scripts. So we have about 2.5 issues. ; 1) The global command,; 2) the interface and ownership model, and; 2.5) with the way it's done in the PR also the non-castable syntax issue. Issue 2.5 is already covered. I do still like C++ globals better even in example 2. It separates how to make a TH1 from how to make it global. The RDirectory is more self-documenting than ""new"", but C++ one makes the file self documenting, not just the line of code. And, all else equal, vanilla is better. But by far the more important point is that I don't like example 2 or the PR. Regarding point 2, example 1 is surely more scalable. I already scaled it more than is possible with the PR. Of course you can edit the PR to make new key names on each call so that the RDirectory call can create more things. But scalable means I did it without needing to modify the underlying implementation or interface (which someone else might maintain) to get three plots instead of one. Furthermore, coming back to issue 1, **if you do edit the PR to have flexible (sequential or passed) RDirectory n",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7305#issuecomment-791104038:3269,interface,interface,3269,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7305#issuecomment-791104038,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"ge_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-891036930): I didn't generalize TRangeDynCast and TRangeStaticCast. They are tied to TCollection and fulfill a different purpose because of that. They are also part of `ROOT::Internal`, while my new functions are supposed to be also used by the RooFit users. I would suggest we leave them as they are, but if you think the new `static_range_cast` and `dynamic_range_cast` are useful for everyone we can move the new file if you want. But where?. I was already expecting that it would be difficult to adapt those, but there will be ways to adapt them. I think it would be *better* if there's one good solution for all, but you have to decide how much time you want to invest. > 2. [[RF] New RangeCast file with dynamic_range_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#discussion_r680892053): I didn't add the `assert(dynamic_cast)` to the `static_range_cast` because the performance penalty it introduces in debug mode is not probably not expected by non-RooFit developers. There's not many loops out there in the world that will depend on this. If somebody uses it, they might be glad to have the extra safety. About the performance:; - When you run from the interpreter, you don't care about the performance of your loop as much.; - When you compile, you probably know what `NDEBUG` is.; - When you ACLIC-compile, I would have hoped that you get an automatic `NDEBUG` in release builds of ROOT, or when you `+O` a file. You don't, unfortunately. My preferred solution would have been to fix that and use the asserts, but it's your project now. > 3. [[RF] New RangeCast file with dynamic_range_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-890998817): I stuck with the detection of `dynamic_cast` vs. `static_cast` at compile time to also support non-polymorphic types.; > .

First is that we *must* build a dictionary before we use a header file. We are likely missing a build dependency on `ROOTGpadv7`. I believe you are trying to fix the second problem. Namely, `TLine.hxx` includes `TPadPainter.hxx` which includes `TDisplayItem.hxx` and you end up with the cycle `ROOTGraphicsPrimitives -> ROOTGpadv7 -> ROOTGraphicsPrimitives`. It seems that `ROOTGraphicsPrimitives` is a foundational module. Its header `TLine.hxx` should not depend on headers in `ROOTGpadv7`. @Teemperor is right, `TLine.hxx` should not depend on `TPadPainter.hxx`. You can break that loop by introducing a forward declarations of `TPadPainter.hxx` entities where necessary if definitions are not required. This is how the current master's modulemap looks like (maybe this helps to see the cycle).; ```; module ""ROOTGraphicsPrimitives"" {; requires cplusplus; module ""ROOT/TColor.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TColor.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDisplayItem.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDisplayItem.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDrawingAttr.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDrawingAttr.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDrawingOptsBase.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDrawingOptsBase.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TLine.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TLine.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TMarker.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TMarker.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TPalette.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TPalette.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TStringEnumAttr.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TStringEnumAttr.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TStyle.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TStyle.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TText.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/T",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2091#issuecomment-392598607:2414,depend,depend,2414,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2091#issuecomment-392598607,1,['depend'],['depend']

As for the original CMake configuration error, my guess is that the CMake target ""host"" used to be part of the CMake project, but is no longer part of the CMake project, and that the error message in `interpreter/cling/CMakeLists.txt:196` was not updated to reflect this when the CMake target ""host"" was removed from the CMake project. As for the error on the final generation of `lib/modules.idx`, the issue seems to be with `root.exe` which is invoked with the following build step command: . ```shell; cd /usr/home/erik/devel/resources/root/build/lib && LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/home/erik/devel/resources/root/build/lib: ROOTIGNOREPREFIX=1 ROOT_HIST=0 /usr/home/erik/devel/resources/root/build/bin/root.exe -l -q -b; ```.

Initially I thought these errors were just a by-product of the errors coming from `TInterpreter` that were leaving the dask worker in a bad state and thus breaking the scheduler too. But then, I updated to `distributed==2022.8.1` and they were not present. So I went on and I used `git bisect` starting from `2022.8.0` going onwards. . I was able to identify the following scenarios, depending on a combination of the status of ROOT and the version of dask `distributed` module:. * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: errors like shown shown above, both those coming from `TInterepreter::Calc` from RDF and those coming from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` that I mentioned in this comment.; * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No more errors about futures after shutdown**. The errors from `TInterpreter::Calc` remain; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: **No more errors from `TInterpreter::Calc`**, but still errors from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` **and also the segfaults with Python-only stacktrace** that I wrote in a previous comment; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No errors at all!**. So it seems that a mix of adding the fix suggested by Philippe (a `R_LOCKGUARD` in `TClingClassInfo::IsEnum`) plus updating to `distributed==2022.8.1` fixes all our problems. ## More details ab",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11515#issuecomment-1272186236:1710,depend,depending,1710,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11515#issuecomment-1272186236,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"ith RTLD_DEEPBIND. (By design, RTLD_DEEPBIND links to libstdc++ first before checking the global namespace, so it does not see the copy-relocated symbol.). I am not a huge fan of the `RTLD_DEEPBIND` approach because it is not portable and it essentially overrides the dynamic linker behavior yet one more time. I am not sure how this would translate to Windows for example. > ; > ; > The problem can be avoided if executables are compiled with -fPIC as well.; > I just tried locally to compile the failing ROOT ctests with -fPIC and this fixed the segmentation faults.; > The question is whether this is a proper solution, since it would require to compile all executables with -fPIC. On the other hand, I don't know how to fix this in another way. Perhaps this could be enabled via a special CMake option for ROOT, which enables RTLD_DEEPBIND for libCling and -fPIC for all executables. IIUC, `RTLD_DEEPBIND` alters the search order of the dynamic linker and using -fPIC intends to deduplicate. That seems as bad as preloading a set of llvm dependent libraries, IMO. Do we need `libgandiva.so` to be compiled with -fPIC or just the executables which 'use' ROOT?. > @vgvassilev : I do not see how I could control this.; > https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/core/base/src/TROOT.cxx#L2037 states that InitInterpreter() should be called after main(). Therefore, as we link to libgandiva, which links to llvm libs, the system LLVM symbols will always be in the global namespace by design. They are loaded before main(), while InitInterpreter() loads libCling only after main(). This check is to protect the subsequent `dlsyms` in TCling to resolve symbols from the wrong place.

We can identify at least three distinct problems here. 1. First, this code is stupid. It's trying to get the TClass for a pyroot; object. It does this by calling repr on the object (which could result; in something very large) and then trying to extract the class name; and looking it up with TClass. In fact, it looks like this hasn't; actually been working for a while now, because the format of the repr; string changed --- and now doesn't include the 'object' string.; If i change this to instead use Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name, then everything; works (and much faster too!). 2. I originally added this code here, but from the comments, it was copied; from the pyroot of the time. The reason why we're doing this in this; roundabout way to begin with is because the TPython interface doesn't; supply any way to get the TClass from a pyroot object. If it would; add a call for that, than this could be streamlined. 3. Finally, there seems to have been a regression with finding the repr; string for a pyroot object between 6.26.10 and dev4. If i have a loop; just calling repr for a vector<float> instance, it runs very slowly; and eventually starts printing memory errors from cling. But with 6.26.10,; it runs much faster and does not start crashing. It sounds sort of like; code is now being repeatedly jitted each time with dev4, but i have; not tried to verify that. Anyway, this change gets at least the unit tests working. Will try to get; that merged soon, and will try to report the repr issue separately.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12406#issuecomment-1547118274:1449,interface,interface,1449,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12406#issuecomment-1547118274,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"king leftover after the analysis (see any file ending with `_patch` and compare it with the same file ending with `_master`). Now that the main source of memory usage is gone, I have noticed a much smaller contribute that still seems to make the memory increase in the flamegraphs. And it seems to have something to do with the increased number of files, at least on the surface. Let's take the following two files to compare:; * test_agc_9sample_1file_10task_patch.html; * test_agc_9sample_10file_10task_patch.html. They are running exactly the same script, with all 9 RDF samples. In the first case we have 1 file per sample, in the second case 10 files per sample. The memray flamegraph report a total of 253.5 MB used for the first case and 260.9 MB used for the first case (7.4 MB delta). There are two main parts of the graph: the one deriving from the `clone` of the Dask process, where the actual analysis code is run, and the one deriving from the `_start` function where most of the Python code around the analysis is (things like `import`ing packages or the Dask worker-scheduler communication). The difference between the two graphs in the `clone` part is of 0.6 MB, the difference between the two `_start` parts is 6.7 MB, so I focus on that from now on. This 6.7 MB difference is in turn split between a 0.1 MB difference deriving from `_PyObject_VectorcallTState` and 6.6 MB difference deriving from. Finally, the vast majority of these 6.6 MB comes from:; * The metrics gathered by profiling (i.e. memray itself); * Dask communication protocol. [Screencast from 2024-07-26 10-47-18.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a21ea3e-c130-42af-b50b-bb324b06eaaa). TL;DR: After this patch the leftover memory increase may be attributed mostly to Dask or memray itself. To confirm this, I have executed the full AGC benchmark on the SWAN platform with 64 workers of the CERN condor pools for 10 times in a row. At the end of the 10th run all the workers have a total RSS of < 1GB.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16094#issuecomment-2252273470:1801,protocol,protocol,1801,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16094#issuecomment-2252273470,1,['protocol'],['protocol']

Integrability,"l obstacles, the main one being that we don't have a single, coherent code path for all data sources. Crucially, `TTree` is handled differently from any other data format (i.e. it doesn't use the `RDataSource` mechanism). This practically means that I cannot create a lazy `RDataSource` to handle them all. But in first approximation this could have been solved with one extra branching; 2. It is not straightforward to know where exactly to trigger the inferring of the data source. Practically, this is needed at the very latest in `RLoopManager::Run`, i.e. right before the start of the event loop. But it can also be needed before that, namely whenever a node of the computation graph is created it might need to know about the column names it uses, so the dataset schema must be gathered thus the data source type must be inferred. Admittedly, this is also another fixable problem with a better documentation or cleaner code to explain exactly at what point of any RDataFrame application the loop manager would need the dataset schema in place; 3. Probably the greatest obstacle posed by this idea is that it indeed fixes one backwards-incompatible change, but introduces another one. RDataFrame allows some operations to run without triggering the computation graph, actually without even needing to populate the computation graph at all. Specifically, `Describe` produces a string description of some metadata of the dataset wrapped by the RDataFrame, e.g. the name of the TTree and the file it is stored in. This info doesn't need file opening (at least with `TChain`). The lazy data source would effectively change the behaviour of `Describe` as it would hide the type of the data source even if in principle it could be known (supposing the same workflow with TChain as before). Bottom line, it was worth to investigate this idea as it also gave more insights on some of the not-immediately-evident parts of the machinery. Given the insights listed above, I decide to merge the PR as it is.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13090#issuecomment-1889018672:1663,wrap,wrapped,1663,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13090#issuecomment-1889018672,1,['wrap'],['wrapped']

Integrability,"n == 1`. This fixes `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.SubEventSections` on `mac13arm`, but makes it fail on x86 (didn't investigate why). It also makes `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` fail (both on `mac13arm` and x86) - this test looks even worse in terms of floating point arithmetic, since it expects summing up two partitions individually and then adding the result being bitwise identical to summing up the whole range at once. From what I can see, this is only working by chance right now. > Or is the problem that the FMA operation on the different parts of the sum (the likelihood is calculated over multiple event ranges in the test that is failing, which are summed afterwards) has higher rounding errors on non-x86 so that in the end the result indeed differs?. See above; the additional problem is that the (optimizing) compiler will insert FMA operations if it sees fit (and is allowed to do so). So depending on how the code and the arithmetic operations are formulated, you may get different results depending on platform, software versions, optimization level, hardware, etc. > Or, even more problematically, could such FMA operations also cause similar rounding errors on x86 so that EXPECT_EQ indeed becomes impossible (and I just got lucky with the current parameters on x86)?. On x86, you are saved by the fact that, as far as I can tell, FMA instructions only come from some SIMD extension that the compiler cannot use unconditionally. This is different on AArch64 (and apparently also PPC64LE) where it appears it is in the base ISA and always available. But yes, if in the future FMA is always available on x86 or you compile (parts of) the code with vector instructions (`RooBatchCompute`, hint hint), you can potentially run into the same problem. For another point regarding ""lucky"", see above that adding the `extendedTerm` to the last partition already makes one other test fail... In conclusion, I urge you to reconsider expecting bit-wise identical results.

Integrability,"n prefer to have a run-time option and I think I have a solution that satisfies everyone. This is implemented in my latest patch https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705/commits/365bd46563c025a5341b48e6d199b2aa4be76c4e. I think we need to collect the prefix stack if we want to be able to filter out, for example, messages from MnLineSearch that happen inside MnMigrad, but not those that happen inside MnHesse. That's why I think the prefix stack should stay. It is also fast, since only a couple of pointers are copied around. However, there is no need to show the full stack of prefixes. By default, MnPrint could just show the prefix from the innermost scope. I added the static method `MnPrint::ShowPrefixStack(bool yes)` to toggle showing the full prefix or not. The default is off so that the messages are not too long. I also now implemented filtering of messages based on the value of the prefix stack. When no filters are set, all messages are shown. Once a filter is set, only messages that match the filter are shown. This is done with strings, using `MnPrint::AddFilter` and `MnPrint::ClearFilter` to reset the filters. Filtering works like `grep` on the full prefix, the message is shown if any of the filter strings match. To only see messages from `MnHesse`, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""MnHesse"");; ```; To only see messages from `MnHesse` called from VariableMetrixBuilder, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""VariableMetricBuilder:MnHesse"");; ```; To only match the beginning of the prefix string, use ""^"". For example,; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""^MnHesse"");; ```; only matches direct execution of MnHesse, but not MnHesse called by MnMigrad. It also works with substrings. To see all messages from any Gradient calculator, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""Gradient"");; ```; to match AnalyticalGradientCalculator, Numerical2PGradientCalculator, and InitialGradientCalculator.

Integrability,"n the 2nd run). The issue here (well there https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10743) does not seems to be the 2nd running of EndOfProcessCleanups but rather that there is a bad interaction between the 'early' running of the cleanups and that something in RDataFrame is not properly informed that something is delete early. The early cleanups is necessary because of the following issue. * The python code (directly or indirectly) can load libraries (Ls); * The python code (directly or indirectly) can open TFile (Fs) and can elect to never delete them; * The python code (directly or indirectly) can attach objects based on the Libraries on to the TFile. Then the order of execution at tear down will be. (1) tear down python; (2) unload the loaded libraries (Ls); (3) execute the atexit registered by TROOT, ; (4) this includes EndOfProcessCleanups; (5) this includes flushing and closing the TFiles. During (5) the object attached the TFile (usually just histogram and `TTree` but can also be object from the user libraries. However if the libraries for the user objects are already unloaded, their code (including a Streamer function or even their dictionary) are gone and this result in crash at best or worse in data loss. In order to prevent that we introduced (in https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/7a592f5d62dda6c76f230bfa6fd879e5fa80582a and friends), running the `EndOfProcessCleanups` of cleanups as soon as possible (i.e. as soon as we can detect the process is starting to tear down). (i.e. make it part of (1)). More likely that not this means than rather than removing early this call to `EndOfProcessCleanups`, the solution is to inform `RDataFrame` of those early deletion (depending whether the things that are deleted that are annoying `RDataFrame`, they may or may not be having the trouble described above, so another solution might be to insure that the things that bother `RDataFrame` are not included in the list of things deleted by `EndOfProcessCleanups`)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10753#issuecomment-1155610874:1835,depend,depending,1835,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10753#issuecomment-1155610874,1,['depend'],['depending']

There, by commenting the template declaration of the move constructor, one can see the corresponding AST definition data being filled, i.e. from; > ; > ```; > | | |-MoveConstructor; > ```; > ; > to; > ; > ```; > | | |-MoveConstructor exists non_trivial user_declared; > ```; > ; > I am surely not expert enough in this area, but I noticed that when the constructor is templated the corresponding `CXXConstructorDecl` is nested inside a `FunctionTemplateDecl`, so that may be ""hiding"" it somehow?. I suppose that with a template move constructor is not the ""canonical form"" of a move constructor (or whatever the right standardese is). I was hoping that it's reported once the template is instantiated, but that doesn't seem the case either. In any case, what you really want to ask Clang is ""can you copy-construct this thing"" and ""can you move-construct this thing"". That logic is implemented in `EvaluateBooleanTypeTrait` of `SemaExprCXX.cpp` and is indeed a bit hairy because it actually has to run through all the machinery of template instantiation and overload resolution. You can invoke that machinery via `Sema::BuildTypeTrait` with `Kind = clang::TT_IsConstructible`. Alternatively, you can try using the `__is_constructible` builtin in the generated wrapper code, but I'm not sure how that would work because it's not available in the preprocessor... Final remark: A better heuristic could be to check for [`defaultedCopyConstructorIsDeleted()`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1CXXRecordDecl.html#a6cd5ebd1006eab239a19413c2886dab3) and then just try the `std::move`. I think that heuristic still has false-negatives and false-positives, but I think it gets the one case right where the explicit intent is to `delete` the copy constructor...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14426#issuecomment-1918556597:2892,wrap,wrapper,2892,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14426#issuecomment-1918556597,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

Integrability,"next 10 years. I see this can be an issue if we start shipping module files (`bmi`s or equivalent) instead of header files. However, in practice that won't be the case in near future because the compiler vendors cannot agree on a common file format and make it standard. Until then, there will be always some sort of a textual header file which can be processed with our clang-based rootcling and build a pcm file as basis for our dictionaries. . > My request is for the upcoming ROOT with Clang 16 to be able to accommodate the generation and use of PCM dictionaries where dependencies thereof are or use C++20 modules. Clang has at least 5 different ""flavors"" of modules. One of them is the C++20 modules as described by the C++ standard. At the moment you start using C++ 20 you could use the `import`/`export` constructs and you will be able to use that feature for encapsulation purposes. There is not enough project transitions which are bigger than toy examples. One of the challenges is how we discover module dependencies. That is, we need extra tooling to decide how to split the source files into modules. In practice we need to pre-lex all of the content before the build system can start processing project files. The community is discussing scanners (such as clang scan-deps), daemons (the gcc implementation), protocols, etc. There is increasing amount of papers trying to address how we put C++ modules at scale (https://wg21.link/p2656, https://wg21.link/P2409, https://youtu.be/_LGR0U5Opdg?si=AbLazREvyl5PXVFG). Some papers/talks are more radical claiming that we cannot even roll out modules (as written in the standard) at such scale. . For modules to be useful and work reliably we know that we need to apply modularization bottom up. That means that before modularizing cmssw/art we need everything below starting from libc and libxml to become modular. That's something we observed during our modularization efforts in cmssw (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/15248).

Make the std::vector<void*> a std::vector<llvm::PointerIntPair<void*, 1, bool>>. How can you guarantee that the platform will deliver a pointer with proper alignment for that?. > 3.

Integrability,"of prefixing messages with a string to indicate the origin, e.g. when you logged from MnHesse, messages would be prefixed with ""MnHesse:"". Inside ``MnHesse``, to stay with the example, you might have seen code like this; ```c++; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some foo happened"");; [...]; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; Setting the prefix by hand was error prone and repetetive and made the logging code more distractive from the actual code. Especially now, since all the debug messages should also have this prefix, I wanted to automate this. So I turned MnPrint into a class that one can instantiate with a prefix for a given scope.; ```c++; MnPrint print(""MnHesse""); // appears once at the beginning of a long method; [...]; print.Info(""Some foo happened"");; [...]; print.Info(""Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; print.Info(""Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; The method ``MnPrint::Info`` uses the prefix set in the MnPrint ctor. The ctor of MnPrint also has an optional argument to print with a local print level. If this is not set, the global print level is used. In the long run (not in this patch), we should get rid of the global print level, because global mutable variables are difficult to reason about and in particular do not play nice with multi-threading. This design prepares for that step.; * I generally made sure that the logging messages contain the same information as the previous ones, but I reduced excess whitespace and improved the formatting. Some debug messages added several empty lines to the output, which made the logs hard to read.; * In very few isolated cases I removed redundant messages.

Integrability,"oofit/roofitcore/src/RooAddPdf.cxx#L825-L840; where Clang now optimizes the inlined `RooArgList::at`:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/e8ba1328693f89af8299904ce3db7bdc8f57c535/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h#L109-L116; and removes the `return nullptr` in case of range errors. The reasoning is that `RooAddPdf::checkObservables` calls a member function on `pdf`, so it being `nullptr` is UB and can be optimized out, and dereferences `coef`, which is also UB on a `nullptr` (although it works because `RooAbsArg::observableOverlaps` takes a reference, ie no pointer dereference actually takes place). If I remove the `return nullptr` statically in the code like; ```diff; diff --git a/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h b/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h; index c5a49bd1b6..bb4afbd12d 100644; --- a/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h; +++ b/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h; @@ -109,9 +109,6 @@ public:; /// Return object at given index, or nullptr if index is out of range; inline RooAbsArg* at(Int_t idx) const {. - if (idx >= static_cast<Int_t>(_list.size())); - return nullptr;; -; return _list[idx];; }. ```; I see the same crash happening with GCC. What I see with a debugger is that `_pdfList` has size 2 while `_coefList` has size 1, so the second iteration of the loop passes `nullptr` for `coef`. This is ""filtered out"" later in `RooAbsArg::dependsOn` where `ignoreArg` is also `nullptr` and things magically work. So, @guitargeek, there are a number of possibilities:; 1. Modify the loop to only run until `std::min(_pdfList.size(), _coefList.size()`.; 2. Add explicit `nullptr` checks for `pdf` and `coef` before calling `observableOverlaps` so the compiler cannot optimize them out.; 3. Make `observableOverlaps` take a pointer that can be `nullptr` and deal with it later on. However, is it actually valid that there are fewer coefficients than pdfs? As far as I understand `RooAddPdf` as a sum of pdfs, that sounds wrong and points to some other code having a problem!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9547#issuecomment-1011927535:1658,depend,dependsOn,1658,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9547#issuecomment-1011927535,1,['depend'],['dependsOn']

Integrability,"ou can then adapt RooFitZMQ to that in a new pull request.; ; > Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is RooFit::MultiProcess, so I wanted to wait with such an option until that PR (hopefully I'll be able to submit that one today). In this PR, RooFitZMQ is not used for anything and later on it will just be a library for RooFit::MultiProcess as well, so there would typically not really be a point for a user to want to build RooFitZMQ but not RooFit::MultiProcess. Do you think in this situation it makes sense to add the option for RooFitZMQ already or should I just do it for RooFit::MultiProcess? So, this option (say `-Droofit_multiprocess=ON`) would activate both RooFit::MultiProcess and RooFitZMQ, and also builtin_zeromq. If RooFitZMQ only makes sense as a support library for RooFit::MultiProcess, it's better to put them together in a single pull request. It will be much easier to ensure everything works together that way.; ; > I think that fail-on-missing is only relevant in case there would be a non built-in option as well, right?. That is not what users generally think. They want `fail-on-missing` to work reliably and make configuration fail if a dependency cannot be met with system packages. The only exceptions to this rule should be LLVM/Clang.; ; > Finally, about git history: makes sense. I can do some reordering before merging. Otherwise, just squashing everything would make sense to me as well. The two independent things here are basically 1) the zmq builtin and 2) RooFitZMQ itself. These could indeed just be two commits, but since nothing really depends on RooFitZMQ at this point, including it with the libzmq builtin in one commit I think would give a clean history as well.

This issue exists on gcc11 and gcc12 (and I guess any gcc that made changes to libstdc++ and the experimental/string_view header file). I am not sure if pasting a diagnostic from a random system makes this clearer in any form. I agree with you this should have be 1 min review fixing an important failure that we introduced with the c++20 support and some of the new releases of maybe libstdc++. @pcanal I find pasting errors in the logs a bad practice, especially when it obfuscates the real fix. Can you suggest a commit message which adds enough information which makes me happy as well?. In general it is a bit unfortunate how the whole review went for this PR.

Integrability,"pe propose the names, and then I can rename the classes accordingly. I have no strong opinion on what to name them. > We need to check if the inheritance from TObject is always needed. You are right, it's probably not needed. I left them as they were in the imported code. If not inheriting from TObject is desirable, I would prefer to avoid it too. > We need to put the public interface in the ROOT::Experimental namespace. Done in my last push. I still need to move the appropriate things into Internal and Detail, though. > We need to return shtd_ptr to the clients bookkept by the server as weak_ptr by the server. In order to use either unique_ptr or shared_ptr, the constructor/destructor for the client needs to be public. What I did was to return a raw pointer, and only the server is able to create/destroy clients.; That way we have full control. If others have a different preference, I can change the details of the implementation. > We need to check in the dtor of the server if all clients are alive, if not throw. This is done now. Since only the server can create/destroy clients, there is no need to throw. The server just destroys the clients before itself gets destroyed. > We need to put the helper components (e.g. structs not intended to be used by the user) in ROOT::Internal if they do not appear in the interface, in ROOT::Detail otherwise. Yes, I will do that and push again soon. Only the ClientInfo and ThreadFileMerger classes have to be moved. I may fuse ThreadFileMerger into the server class if I can instead, so that we will have no need for either the ThreadFileMerger or ClientInfo anymore. > We need to hide all the methods which are not necessary for the user, e.g. the ctor of the client; In general, new headers are put in the inc/ROOT directory and have the hxx extension (see TThreadedObject, TThreadedExecutor, TDataFrame....). After I either fuse the classes as mentioned above, or move them into the Internal/Detail namespaces, this will be solved as well.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/533#issuecomment-299445910:1580,interface,interface,1580,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/533#issuecomment-299445910,1,['interface'],['interface']

We would likely have some info captured in the error message (e.g. ""ROOT::ReadFromNetwork() failed to call linux_read_from_network()""), but we'd miss the connection, i.e. `ROOT::RNetFile::Read()`. One way of handling that is by injecting state:; ```; RStatus ROOT::RNetFile::Read() {; RStatus res(ROOT::ReadFromNetwork());; ...; return R__STATUS_PASSTHROUGH(res); // registers res to have passed through ""ROOT::RNetFile::Read()"" by emplacing a frame string *if* in error state.; ```; That's similar to [`llvm::PrettyStackTraceEntry`](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1PrettyStackTraceEntry.html), see usage [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/df494f7512b0ecebdf3d7be97695a1b6278c0336/clang/lib/CodeGen/BackendUtil.cpp#L909). FYI, there has been a multi-hundred email discussion on exactly this topic on the C++ committee mailing list, with pretty much two camps: allow error code handling (with potential exceptions) versus just always throw in case of errors, and if that's slow, go fix the compiler / runtime library implementations (but ABI break). **TL;DR**:; I agree that exceptions instead of error codes allow for nicer code. I don't think that we can have that nice code when we introduce `RStatus`, because the developer of that code must not assume a state for ""immediate exceptions"". In the end, we cannot use exceptions (across frames returning `RStatus`) and need to handle the error state, *always*. That leaves missing stack frames versus manipulation of a global (with developers dangerously and tacitly assuming a default state) - where IMHO it's more robust to have a mechanism to supply the missing stack frames (which can then - even better! - include user-facing diagnostic messages rather than just function names).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4683#issuecomment-564972730:3082,message,messages,3082,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4683#issuecomment-564972730,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"raries that could be loaded to provide the requested; symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you; should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each; library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using; JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll; walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should; prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in; precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider; a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor; that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a; circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock; (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like; this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so""; provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and; resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""...; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in; the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1. The lookup for ""f"" finds and runs the materializer for ""f"".; 2.2.2. The materializer for ""f"" reaches JITLink, which tries to resolve; symbol ""x"". There is no work to trigger (we started materializing it; already in (2.1)), so the link is suspended pending resolution of ""x"".; Critically, the dlopen cannot complete until the link completes.; 2.2. MU *would* dlsym ""x"", but it's blocked waiting on the dlopen to finish. And we're deadlocked again. The root cause of the problem is that ld.so and the JIT don't communicate; immediately about symbol resolutions.

Integrability,"replace the calling site (in `flexibleInterp`) with. ```; // return total * std::exp(interpolate6thDegree(x, std::log(low), std::log(high), std::log(nominal), boundary));; return total * interpolate6thDegree(x, low, high, nominal, boundary);; ```. This (together with using the old code as commented out above) indeed gets rid of the `nan`!. **I think the crucial part is that the old code checks for `high <= 0` and also `low <= 0`.**. Indeed, I traced the `nan` there: the sequence of events in this failing example is that `high` is zero, so that `std::log(high)` is `-inf`. Then `eps_plus` is also `-inf` and so `S` and `A` too, so you `-inf` times something negative (`t` happens to be negative in this example) so the term becomes `+inf` and eventually you get a `-inf + inf` and that equals `nan`. So, there's at least two options to fix this, both will need some conditionals added in again. 1. Going back to the original algorithm. If I understand the commit message of that change correctly, it was mostly removed because it required cached variables. As I rewrote the algorithm above, no more cached variables are necessary. Of course, it does involve more temporary values than the new algorithm, so perhaps this is another reason to pick the new algorithm.; 2. Adding similar `<= 0` checks to the new algorithm. I think this should take place at the call site, because it doesn't make sense for the other `interpolate6thDegree` usecase where no weird values are expected from logarithms. By the way, why is the interpolation taking place in logarithmic space instead of regular linear space and then transformed back into linear space after interpolation? Doesn't this also mean that the two interpolation schemes (FlexibleInterpVar and PiecewiseInterpolation) are again inconsistent? If the logarithm can be eliminated, I think we can do without introducing conditionals, no? That is, assuming the high and low vectors are filled sensibly, which is not checked anywhere as far as I can s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427:1030,message,message,1030,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"rotocols, etc. There is increasing amount of papers trying to address how we put C++ modules at scale (https://wg21.link/p2656, https://wg21.link/P2409, https://youtu.be/_LGR0U5Opdg?si=AbLazREvyl5PXVFG). Some papers/talks are more radical claiming that we cannot even roll out modules (as written in the standard) at such scale. . For modules to be useful and work reliably we know that we need to apply modularization bottom up. That means that before modularizing cmssw/art we need everything below starting from libc and libxml to become modular. That's something we observed during our modularization efforts in cmssw (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/15248). The reasons we cannot make it yet default is discussed here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/41810#issuecomment-1578982627 and here https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13000 Not surprisingly we have observed similar comments coming from modularization efforts in gcc and msvc. . Let's assume we live in an platonic world where all of the above is resolved. It still seems we will be able to use our dictionary system as it is because we will in the end have a build system that processes textual files to build them. There we could use any custom flavor of modules (or something better) that makes our I/O work. We can go one step further and claim that, even if we introduce strict interface encapsulation via C++ 20 modules, our I/O system would require to know more about the non-exported entities so that we can serialize and deserialize the private dependencies of the exported entities. That is, we will probably end up with a very similar system that we have today. I would personally like to tackle the engineering challenge as you have described. However I believe we are not there yet and any efforts into trying to adapt to a still volatile area would probably cause disturbances in our user base for not yet clear final goal. Does that address/answer the concerns you had when you opened that request?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13536#issuecomment-1693395998:3153,interface,interface,3153,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13536#issuecomment-1693395998,2,"['depend', 'interface']","['dependencies', 'interface']"

Integrability,"says ""Add **a** module for experimental/string_view""; The commit says:. That should fix a recent nightly failure with gcc11 avoiding to require; module ""bits/ranges_base.h"" in C++20 context. The code says:; ```; module ""experimental/string_view"" {; export *; header ""experimental/algorithm""; }; ```; ; The commit content as-is seems completely unrelated to the commit log as far as I could tell (without doing research on the relationship between `range_base`, `string_view` and `algorithm`.; ; So I pondered whether the fix was the right fix for a problem I did not know anything about ... ; ; The right thing to do would have probably be have been to request a complete explanation of what the original problem was, what was the mechanism leading to the error and why this solution was the best solution. This was obviously much more than this seemingly simple fix required. So instead I thought to ask for a very low cost, straight forward solution: simply copy/pasting the error with no additional effort to explain in detail. > Can you suggest a commit message which adds enough information which makes me happy as well?. That requires to paraphrase the error and add a few more details. ```; That should fix a recent nightly failure with gcc11. The failure presented during dictionary generation in a C++14 and C++17 build and incorrectly complained about needing the 'cplusplus20' feature for the 'std.bits/ranges_base.h' module. The issue was triggered by an inclusion of `<bits/ranges_base.h>` from `string_view`. This issue exists on gcc11 and gcc12 (and I guess any gcc that made changes to libstdc++ and the experimental/string_view header file). . It seems the issue is solved by exporting `algorithm` as part of the `string_view` module.; ```. Actually, I still don't know why adding `algorithm` fixes a problem with `range_base.h`, so I can't add that to the commit ... maybe it is something like ""... by avoiding to use the module maps provided by the standard library in those case""?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12276#issuecomment-1430326540:1111,message,message,1111,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12276#issuecomment-1430326540,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"so .... in short your right and the patch does not go far enough. historically TTreeProcessor[MT] was (one of) the first to use multi-threading on TFile. TFile::ReadProcessID was found to be performance/scaling critical so much so that it lead to the introduction of the SpinLocks and the ReadWrite locks ... and at the time there was no point in having the lock taken when that code was not active ... Obviously this is no longer the case. The extension of the use case means that actually we need to protect TFile::ReadProcessID from other use of the TProcessID interfaces (the only other direct user of the collection ```TProcessID::GetPIDs```. This means that we should probably no longer rely on ```TFile::ReadProcessID``` using its own lock. . Also related, we ought to actually leverage the ReadWrite lock in TProcessID.cxx where some of the write section are currently too long, some are missing and some items likely need to become atomic.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5288#issuecomment-608729545:564,interface,interfaces,564,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5288#issuecomment-608729545,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Integrability,"state would allow us to throw an exception in `ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()`. But `ROOT::RNetFile::Read()` might want/need to handle the error state, e.g. by retrying, or by accessing alternative sources. It might even be that a partial read is modeled as an error. This would require `ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()` to force the ""immediate exception"" state to a certain value and reset it later - which is error prone and awkward; it shows that we use a global state that needs local knowledge. If ""immediate exception"" is false and `ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()` captures the error and returns it, same for all subsequent frames but `ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++()` (which cannot return a `RStatus`), then only `ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++()` will throw. This would shorten the stack trace shown by a potential crash to; ```; ROOT::RNTupleIterator::operator++(); UserCode::modelBackground(); ```; - we would not know the stack trace that actually triggered the exception. We would likely have some info captured in the error message (e.g. ""ROOT::ReadFromNetwork() failed to call linux_read_from_network()""), but we'd miss the connection, i.e. `ROOT::RNetFile::Read()`. One way of handling that is by injecting state:; ```; RStatus ROOT::RNetFile::Read() {; RStatus res(ROOT::ReadFromNetwork());; ...; return R__STATUS_PASSTHROUGH(res); // registers res to have passed through ""ROOT::RNetFile::Read()"" by emplacing a frame string *if* in error state.; ```; That's similar to [`llvm::PrettyStackTraceEntry`](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1PrettyStackTraceEntry.html), see usage [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/df494f7512b0ecebdf3d7be97695a1b6278c0336/clang/lib/CodeGen/BackendUtil.cpp#L909). FYI, there has been a multi-hundred email discussion on exactly this topic on the C++ committee mailing list, with pretty much two camps: allow error code handling (with potential exceptions) versus just always throw in case of errors, and if that's slow, go fix the compiler / runtime libr",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4683#issuecomment-564972730:1423,message,message,1423,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4683#issuecomment-564972730,1,['message'],['message']

In user's machine, I think it is unlikely that LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset because if ROOT is successfully installed in the machine, they should be set.

Integrability,"tead I have a tuple or list on the Python side and the template expects some STL container? Then it can not just be that STL container of say `T*`, but also the STL container of pointer any of the base classes, or worse, a mix thereof. And what if the tuple isn't actually targeting a container, but is an initalizer_list? There is often no (relevant) type information available at that point in Python, but many cases can still be resolved b/c the C++ side has some hints. For example `template<typename T, int N> void func(const std::array<T, N>&)` being given a Python tuple `(1, 2, 3)`. Absolutely clear what needs to be done for the conversion to work, but otherwise yet another case to add to the combinatorics. The above, current, situation is very much ""eeew"" and ""might not like the result."" It has also reached its breaking point, as you can see from the open bug reports and the constant hacking on workarounds. I appreciate that for the old PyROOT no-one actually seriously used templates, as folks avoided it in their interfaces b/c of non-support in the CINT world. The only client with moderately interesting templates would be RDataFrame. But in the real world, folks write modern C++ and template usage is much more pervasive. Just last week, I was looking at a massive series of variadically templated constructors: each peeled of an argument to eventually initialize a grand total of 3 data members. It was just a struct with an `unsigned int`, a `double`, and an `std::array<double, 3>`. The point of the whole set of constructors being that you can use initializer syntax with the data member in every order, either the ""naked"" types or with casts of explicitly named typedefs. Oh, it works _now_, with yet another workaround, but it actually crashed `lookupHelper` (segfault and die; and it's not the only one; I have a few more for Vassil, e.g. lookup in an unnamed namespace also crashes deep, deep inside Cling/Clang). So, I consider that another strong argument against ""tryi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696889449:2491,interface,interfaces,2491,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696889449,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

Integrability,"ter (similar to how `TApplication` ignores `argc` and `argv` if `numOptions==-1`), but that is certainly not a design pattern leading to modern, readable code, so better not spread it more ;-). ; `failOnUnknownArgs` sounds like a great choice of name, it clarifies the intent clearly. . > It would be wonderful to have that as unit test in `core/rint/test` [...]. It seems this does already exist, and has a unit test checking that errors are producted by `TRint` if unrecognitzed options are encountered ;-). Still, it seems I lack sufficient experience with `gtest`, since I don't understand why (for example) `TRint` with unsupported arguments does not `Terminate()` the test — so it's unclear to me how to write a test checking that it does not actually try to `Terminate()` when provided with a to-be-added `failOnUnknownArgs = false`. . In pseudo-steps, I think possible changes / additions to the existing test in `core/rint/test/TRintTests.cxx` to cover the use case as completely as possible could be:; 1. The existing test should be changed to set `failOnUnknownArgs = true` (after that is implemented). ; 2. A second test could be added, not setting `failOnUnknownArgs` (i.e. the default of `false` is used). This test then needs to check that no `stderr` is produced, and `Terminate()` is not called (here I'm unsure how to do these with `gtest`). ; 3. A third test could try to do the following, for complete coverage of the use case:; i. Create a `TRint (let's name it `myApp for simplicity here)`, passing in supported and unsupported options. ; ii. Check the unsupported options are accessible via `myApp->Argv()`. ; iii. Call `myApp`->Run(kTRUE)`, inject `.q` via `stdin` and test that the execution flow returns to after that line. .

Integrability,"the Google C++ guidelines. I think this is not something we should spend too much time on now, but maybe good to keep in mind for the future.; 3. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672519457 The configuration parameters (GlobalObservables etc.): should we unify them or keep like this?; 4. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672538377 This should be checked by Wouter. In addition, some other remaining questions:; 1. `testRooRealL.getValRooAddition` fails because it doesn't know `RooFormulaVar`... I'm not sure what this means, but I vaguely remember that (I think) @hageboeck and @cburgard were talking about this, so I was hoping you may be able to help me out with fixing that test.; 2. In an ideal world I would have liked to add a serial implementation of the `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` class. Probably, we can reuse a lot of `RooGradMinimizerFcn` for this and it should be rather straightforward. However, this will take time. The advantage would be that we could add a test to this PR that covers all that is added, basically by just running a minimization. Note that I do have such a full-coverage test, but only for the MultiProcess minimization, where I implemented `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` in the parallel `LikelihoodGradientJob` class. So this test will come in ""PR 7"" (see overview). So, up for discussion, two choices: A: add (probably mostly useless except for testing this PR) ""LikelihoodGradientSerial"" class (based on RooGradMinimizerFcn) so we can add an integration test in this PR; B: wait for the integration test in PR 7.; 3. Does everybody like the RooNLLVar statics?; 4. Offset in the new TestStatistics classes can easily include the RooSubsidiaryL term as well, unlike with RooAbsTestStatistic, where the RooConstraintSum was a separate class that would not be included in the offset. I have now implemented a legacy mode to get bit-wise equal results, but is the new ""full"" mode a good idea at all?

Integrability,"there will be always some sort of a textual header file which can be processed with our clang-based rootcling and build a pcm file as basis for our dictionaries. . > My request is for the upcoming ROOT with Clang 16 to be able to accommodate the generation and use of PCM dictionaries where dependencies thereof are or use C++20 modules. Clang has at least 5 different ""flavors"" of modules. One of them is the C++20 modules as described by the C++ standard. At the moment you start using C++ 20 you could use the `import`/`export` constructs and you will be able to use that feature for encapsulation purposes. There is not enough project transitions which are bigger than toy examples. One of the challenges is how we discover module dependencies. That is, we need extra tooling to decide how to split the source files into modules. In practice we need to pre-lex all of the content before the build system can start processing project files. The community is discussing scanners (such as clang scan-deps), daemons (the gcc implementation), protocols, etc. There is increasing amount of papers trying to address how we put C++ modules at scale (https://wg21.link/p2656, https://wg21.link/P2409, https://youtu.be/_LGR0U5Opdg?si=AbLazREvyl5PXVFG). Some papers/talks are more radical claiming that we cannot even roll out modules (as written in the standard) at such scale. . For modules to be useful and work reliably we know that we need to apply modularization bottom up. That means that before modularizing cmssw/art we need everything below starting from libc and libxml to become modular. That's something we observed during our modularization efforts in cmssw (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/15248). The reasons we cannot make it yet default is discussed here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/41810#issuecomment-1578982627 and here https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13000 Not surprisingly we have observed similar comments coming from modularization efforts in gcc and",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13536#issuecomment-1693395998:1782,protocol,protocols,1782,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13536#issuecomment-1693395998,1,['protocol'],['protocols']

Integrability,"unity is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is RooFit::MultiProcess, so I wanted to wait with such an option until that PR (hopefully I'll be able to submit that one today). In this PR, RooFitZMQ is not used for anything and later on it will just be a library for RooFit::MultiProcess as well, so there would typically not really be a point for a user to want to build RooFitZMQ but not RooFit::MultiProcess. Do you think in this situation it makes sense to add the option for RooFitZMQ already or should I just do it for RooFit::MultiProcess? So, this option (say `-Droofit_multiprocess=ON`) would activate both RooFit::MultiProcess and RooFitZMQ, and also builtin_zeromq. I think that fail-on-missing is only relevant in case there would be a non built-in option as well, right?. Finally, about git history: makes sense. I can do some reordering before merging. Otherwise, just squashing everything would make sense to me as well. The two independent things here are basically 1) the zmq builtin and 2) RooFitZMQ itself. These could indeed just be two commits, but since nothing really depends on RooFitZMQ at this point, including it with the libzmq builtin in one commit I think would give a clean history as well.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730:3220,depend,depends,3220,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730,1,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"ut adding top-level ""keep"" statements than top level ""deletes"". In the C++ global version of example 2, to get the serial loop over 3 parallel histograms, you'd need the global to be a vector and you'd have to push_back() onto it, but you're in the same (bad) place then. I wrote a script just like that this week exactly to fit a number of peaks determined by a file read inside one routine, and looped over outside, and I used example 1, not example 2, and future use of the base routine will never cause leaks. . The code structure is problematic to me. RDirectory itself isn't terrible, but I just don't see what it solves other than more syntax to remember. A final point, the shared pointers supposedly perform worse than unique pointers. I don't know how much it matters, but when you're fitting millions of waveforms maybe it does. Of course then you shouldn't be using RDirectory, but you can still use my_subroutines.C to do your fit if you're looping the million without RDirectory or to examining one of those fits with RDirectory, without rewriting the routine. I'm going to skip the point about empty root objects just to limit the scope for now. ### How to skip globals entirely. Of course you can just let the top level code return an object or structure. The downside is just that you have to .L the code and call it with auto ret=make_th1(). It can't be a complied main(), but that's no big deal. It violates the spirit of ""scripting"" but is of course very clean:. example 3: ; ```cpp; //subroutine.C. // my_subroutines.C; void my_subroutine(unique_ptr<TH1> &x) {; x.reset(); // not needed for TH1F, but safer in general.; x.reset(new TH1F());; // .. do something with it.; }; ```; ```cpp; //make_th1.C. vector<unique_ptr<TH1>> make_th1() { //edit: changed to TH1's here; vector<unique_ptr<TH1>> retvec(3); // and here, as intended.; for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {; my_subroutine(retvec[i]);; }; return retvec;; }; ```. But the end-user can decide. Again, the subroutine works regardless.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7305#issuecomment-791104038:6180,rout,routine,6180,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7305#issuecomment-791104038,1,['rout'],['routine']

Integrability,"we should try to fix that, so that each TBranch is a single zlib stream when compressed with zlib. Yes and the chunking of the generation is determining the clusters size. We wanted to increase the number of tasks based on that idea, but the TTree clusters are not actually set by this. It is set by the auto-save option<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_root-2Dproject_root_blob_master_tree_dataframe_inc_ROOT_RSnapshotOptions.hxx-23L35&d=DwMFaQ&c=gRgGjJ3BkIsb5y6s49QqsA&r=UWfwI6PGOKY1hmtnuMh4_A&m=xs3jkKpmLeMypw1lXllSZjdULkrCzzEkzX8vpGMM9yc&s=txfsLH9Ss0Rd1-_XgaCU94eGPUrmNZ7w20xQN3AMsyw&e=> in RSnapshotOptions. The problem is that the default is to not auto-save, but save only when calling Write(), which then happens only at the end of a full task that may generate lots of data that will stay in memory until the end. It's probably enough to make auto-save default to save at every 5-10% of generated data. We already call Write() depending on this setting, so in principle there's no need to increase the number of tasks. This is a bit surprising. The TTree is supposed to be re-using as much as possible the memory chunk (both the compression buffer and the TBuffer) as much as possible. The TTree is reusing memory chunks for the baskets, but the TBB task arenas that are created for each TTree:Fill() are not. They are created by a TBranchIMTHelper that is created on the stack<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_root-2Dproject_root_blob_master_tree_tree_src_TTree.cxx-23L4406&d=DwMFaQ&c=gRgGjJ3BkIsb5y6s49QqsA&r=UWfwI6PGOKY1hmtnuMh4_A&m=xs3jkKpmLeMypw1lXllSZjdULkrCzzEkzX8vpGMM9yc&s=9vBGU4V_H1c-CBOJQ2AX0dDxhzuNM6Jn0jE9OHzgqgk&e=> in TTree::Fill().

Modifiability," see https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/4220), but haven't had time yet. The interim solution is to just ship it with ROOT, but this requires (part of) the libzmq source to build against. We can do this in two ways: a) just include the necessary libzmq files or b) get them externally on the fly. I actually went with option a) first. However, when people started trying out this branch on their machines, it turned out that the `conda` libzmq build (which I was using in my dev setup) had a more favorable configuration than for instance most Linux native builds, especially because those native builds lack CMake configuration files. That latter fact made me decide to just make the built-in dependency the default; this way I wouldn't have to figure out how to best detect libzmq on each platform (or find / cobble together a good and freely licensed FindZeroMQ.cmake, but the general feeling around the ZeroMQ community is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is RooFit::MultiProcess, so I wanted to wait with such an option until that PR (hopefully I'll be able to submit that one today). In this PR, RooFitZMQ is not used for anything and later on it will just be a library for RooFit::MultiProcess as well, so",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730:1409,config,config,1409,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870411730,1,['config'],['config']
Modifiability," should provide real implementation ; > ```; > TSQLStatement::SetTimestamp(Int_t, const TTimeStamp&); > TSQLStatement::GetTimestamp(Int_t, TTimeStamp&); > ```; > Otherwise these methods will be non-usable for other SQL plugins; > In principle, `TPgSQLStatement::GetTimestamp` could be just copy into `TSQLStatement`; > And same approach used for `SetTimestamp`. Unfortunately, it is impossible to implement these functions directly in TSQLStatement for all cases (database management systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle...) because of the following important reasons:; 1. The one possible function with fractions of a second which can be used in TSQLStatement to set and get TTimeStamp; `virtual Bool_t GetTimestamp(Int_t npar, Int_t& year, Int_t& month, Int_t& day, Int_t& hour, Int_t& min, Int_t& sec, Int_t& frac)`; has the last parameter defined everywhere as a fraction of a second without strict specification what fraction means: milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds...; For example, PostgreSQL returns microseconds, but MySQL supports and can return nanoseconds in timestamp value, So, if i don't know what a fraction i get via the function, i can't set TTimeStamp with nanoseconds.; 2. TTimeStamp class has timezone value (opposed to TDatime) and i must specify whether it is in UTC in the TTimeStamp constructor:; `TTimeStamp (UInt_t year, UInt_t month, UInt_t day, UInt_t hour, UInt_t min, UInt_t sec, UInt_t nsec=0, Bool_t isUTC=kTRUE, Int_t secOffset=0)`; But I don't know what timezone returns from the function above (in 1.). In PostgreSQL - TPgSQLStatement it is in UTC, in MySQL - TMySQLStatement it is not UTC. If it is specified that ""virtual Bool_t GetTimestamp(Int_t npar, Int_t& year, Int_t& month, Int_t& day, Int_t& hour, Int_t& min, Int_t& sec, Int_t& frac)"" function always returns microseconds in the last field (indeed, it is better in nanoseconds) and always in UTC format for all plugins/DBMS, new functions could be copied to TSQLStatement.

Modifiability," this would require some changes to our software. And also this problem is not specific to libgandiva only, but it would affect any library that uses LLVM. Unfortunately, those should be carefully attended because of ROOT. I would feel more comfortable if my stack knows which libraries depend on LLVM to avoid pain debugging ROOT. > I have in the mean time found the root cause why my patch fails:; > ; > * It is due to copy relocations of symbols from libstdc++; > ; > * Crashes happen whenever cling wants to output text via cout / cerr / etc.; > ; > * The problem is that there are 2 instances of cout / cerr: The first created by the executable itself through copy relocation, when the executable prints something via cout. The second created by libCling loaded with RTLD_DEEPBIND. (By design, RTLD_DEEPBIND links to libstdc++ first before checking the global namespace, so it does not see the copy-relocated symbol.). I am not a huge fan of the `RTLD_DEEPBIND` approach because it is not portable and it essentially overrides the dynamic linker behavior yet one more time. I am not sure how this would translate to Windows for example. > ; > ; > The problem can be avoided if executables are compiled with -fPIC as well.; > I just tried locally to compile the failing ROOT ctests with -fPIC and this fixed the segmentation faults.; > The question is whether this is a proper solution, since it would require to compile all executables with -fPIC. On the other hand, I don't know how to fix this in another way. Perhaps this could be enabled via a special CMake option for ROOT, which enables RTLD_DEEPBIND for libCling and -fPIC for all executables. IIUC, `RTLD_DEEPBIND` alters the search order of the dynamic linker and using -fPIC intends to deduplicate. That seems as bad as preloading a set of llvm dependent libraries, IMO. Do we need `libgandiva.so` to be compiled with -fPIC or just the executables which 'use' ROOT?. > @vgvassilev : I do not see how I could control this.; > https://git",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4668#issuecomment-564015399:1399,portab,portable,1399,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4668#issuecomment-564015399,1,['portab'],['portable']

Modifiability,"""RooArgList created with the constructor where you pass multiple elements are non-owning collections"" - it looks like a not very good behaviour. Why can't it be consistent between all constructors?. ""It is also possible to have an owning RooArgList/Set, but in this case it would own all the elements"" - maybe it would be better than to completely prohibit owning? I think it may be used more often than a mixture of owned/not-owned elements. However, it would still require some code. I would also add about RooArgList, that it would be great to handle an arbitrary number of elements. Is it possible? I have 10 pdfs, and I have to add the last one after the RooArgList constructor using the *add* method (because the constructor supports at maximum 9 args).; If one rewrites the constructor, maybe the owning issues might be re-implemented as well.; RooArgList/Set looks like a very general container, so it would benefit from being even more general.

Modifiability,"""Templated ctors cannot be called on Windows because demangling of the constructor template (!) fails"". No ... it fails b/c either ROOT/meta or the Cling lookupHelper is not capable of recognizing constructor names with provided template parameters. The demangling hack was just a quick & easy way around that, esp. the lookupHelper being a very brittle piece of code that is hard to modify. However, since the demangling by definition does not allow anything except an exact match (the lookupHelper being a tad more flexible, albeit not by enough), it's a very poor option. But cppyy handles templated constructors just fine on Windows, so there is probably some truth in this patch:; https://bitbucket.org/wlav/cppyy-backend/src/master/cling/patches/win64s2.diff. This patch removes the Clang internal marker for Windows mangled symbols. This marker is (mostly) gone in Clang master, too. There are other reasons for this patch, such as lookup of global variables, which is what started the initial discussion with Bertrand that grew into this patch. However, I re-emphasize that it is better to fix the actual problem than muck with the workaround.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696260432:517,flexible,flexible,517,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696260432,2,"['flexible', 'variab']","['flexible', 'variables']"

I also see that this PR has some changes that your cling doesn't have, which is what my test is based on. So, my next step is to test the CUDA mode with the root version.

Modifiability,"-5f9cbb24787c); In newer ROOT versions, the Chi2 are more consistent with the likelihood fits. Meaning that if you have an extendible pdf, it will automatically do an extended fit (i.e., a Poisson term to constrain the number of predicted events is added). However, if you have weights this is not meaningful anymore. I guess you don't even want to do an extended fit in your case. You can explicitly pass `RooFit::Extended(false)` to get back the old behavior:; ```c++; using namespace RooFit;. TFile file{""test.root""};; auto workspace = file.Get<RooWorkspace>(""w_test"");. auto hist = static_cast<RooDataHist *>(workspace->data(""jpsi_ppbar_mass""));; auto x = workspace->var(""Jpsi_m_fitted"");; auto pdf = workspace->pdf(""model_Low"");. auto result = pdf->chi2FitTo(*hist, Save(), Extended(false));; result->Print();; ```. But your fit has also has a different problem (any status other than `MINIMIZE=0` means an error in Minuit). You use a [RooAddPdf](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAddPdf.html) for the model. This class inherits from RooAbsPdf, and a pdf in RooFit is forced to be positive everywhere. Therefore, you can't fit the your data with the negative bin contents at all. You need to create a RooAbsReal-derived function, maybe a [RooRealSumFunc](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooRealSumFunc.html). Or maybe can you avoid the negative bin content all together? Where does it even come from, from subtracting a background? IN this case this is the wrong thing do do for statistical analysis. I would rather keep the background in the data and add a component to the model, maybe a fixed [RooHistPdf](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooHistPdf.html) for that part that exactly corresponds to the background estimation. I'll close this issue because it's not a bug in RooFit, or an improvement of feature request. If you have further questions about your RooFit analysis, please open a thread on the forum to follow up:; https://root-forum.cern.ch/c/roofit-and-roostats/12",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15196#issuecomment-2105738221:1203,inherit,inherits,1203,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15196#issuecomment-2105738221,1,['inherit'],['inherits']

Regarding building the method with **CUDA 7.5 on Ubuntu 16.04:**. Here the CMake config:. ```; cmake .. \; -Dalien=OFF -Dcuda=ON \; -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-7.5 \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++-4.9 \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc-4.9; ```. The error message:. ```; /usr/include/string.h: In function ‘void* __mempcpy_inline(void*, const void*, size_t)’:; /usr/include/string.h:652:42: error: ‘memcpy’ was not declared in this scope; return (char *) memcpy (__dest, __src, __n) + __n;; ```. And yes, it is fixed, if you append `-DCUDA_NVCC_FLAGS=""-D_FORCE_INLINES""` to CMake! As well, CUDA 8.0 does not break with this flag. So we could append this flag permanently, though I don't like this idea because it clutters the build system.

Let me know if you need so. Now, this behaviour (leaking just linking) should make it not too difficult to locate the issue. Do you do something [with globals or static variables](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8353892/14967071)? Or do you have [a `_init` and/or `_fini` function](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6412445/14967071)?.

If it did not, why? If it is just a matter of typing less awkward strings for an extremely custom use case, then your patch cannot be accepted and I suggest replacing it with some good documentation for the end user :-). So no, the approach as it is does not work for us as :. a) we rarely stage full archives (that’s for sure); b) out of my head right now I cannot find back why but I kind of remember the proto://xxx?filter_aliversion#…. syntax did cause an issue somewhere. > As an alternative, you can provide them with a macro that generates the Query= part for you, if it is less awkward for them.; > ; > Ah, I also see that between your patches there is an option to ""stat"" the file if filtered. I can see the point there: stating a file which is not there would trigger a download on a specifically configured xrootd storage. This specific patch cannot be accepted by any means as it goes against a concept we have been trying to establish since a long time: ROOT's dataset manager is about managing lists of files. Staging files is a job that must be done elsewhere, for instance by a storage system or by a mechanism interacting with it.; > ; > Well, the intent of this part of the patch was to get a correct feed back (for the user) about the actual size of the file (as the size in the collection is the alien catalog size, i.e. before filtering). What you say here is that I cannot do that with a stat as this would trigger a download (in case the file is not there), do I get it correctly ?

Modifiability,"2 observations. If I understood correctly, fASTProperty is only set via the TClass construction in a dictionary file. One consequence is that the improvement does not apply to purely interpreted class (at the moment this is a minor concern but might the issue might not be re-noticed when we increase support for I/O of interpreted classes). fASTProperty is very similar to fProperty and even more to fClassProperty (where the fASTProperty might actually belong *if* there is space there). Currently fProperty and fClassProperty are set via the TProtoClass (for all classes except the Core/IO classes). So a few question to answer before merging. a) Should fASTProperty be inside fClassProperty, (and if not why)?; b) Should fASTProperty be set via TProtoClass? (for consistency); or; c) Should fProperty and fClassProperty be set through the TClass constructor? (to benefit from the same ""all classes"" speed-up?; d) Shouldn't this multiple-inheritance flag be set via/in TClass::Property (via ClassInfo_ClassProperty for example)?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2319#issuecomment-405634503:941,inherit,inheritance,941,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2319#issuecomment-405634503,1,['inherit'],['inheritance']

Modifiability,"705/commits/365bd46563c025a5341b48e6d199b2aa4be76c4e. I think we need to collect the prefix stack if we want to be able to filter out, for example, messages from MnLineSearch that happen inside MnMigrad, but not those that happen inside MnHesse. That's why I think the prefix stack should stay. It is also fast, since only a couple of pointers are copied around. However, there is no need to show the full stack of prefixes. By default, MnPrint could just show the prefix from the innermost scope. I added the static method `MnPrint::ShowPrefixStack(bool yes)` to toggle showing the full prefix or not. The default is off so that the messages are not too long. I also now implemented filtering of messages based on the value of the prefix stack. When no filters are set, all messages are shown. Once a filter is set, only messages that match the filter are shown. This is done with strings, using `MnPrint::AddFilter` and `MnPrint::ClearFilter` to reset the filters. Filtering works like `grep` on the full prefix, the message is shown if any of the filter strings match. To only see messages from `MnHesse`, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""MnHesse"");; ```; To only see messages from `MnHesse` called from VariableMetrixBuilder, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""VariableMetricBuilder:MnHesse"");; ```; To only match the beginning of the prefix string, use ""^"". For example,; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""^MnHesse"");; ```; only matches direct execution of MnHesse, but not MnHesse called by MnMigrad. It also works with substrings. To see all messages from any Gradient calculator, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""Gradient"");; ```; to match AnalyticalGradientCalculator, Numerical2PGradientCalculator, and InitialGradientCalculator. Filtering is not implemented in a very efficient way to keep the code simple, but the performance drop is opt-in. If no filters are used, then there is no performance loss. The filters work correctly whether or not the full prefix is displayed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-733046580:1399,Variab,VariableMetrixBuilder,1399,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-733046580,2,['Variab'],"['VariableMetricBuilder', 'VariableMetrixBuilder']"

Modifiability,":thinking: My approach here may be wrong... Looking more at the `CMakeCache.txt` file generated for my build on ARM, I see these values when I set up the build of ROOT 6.18/04 with the system's GCC 6.3:. ```cmake; //Test HAVE_CXX_ATOMICS64_WITHOUT_LIB; HAVE_CXX_ATOMICS64_WITHOUT_LIB:INTERNAL=1; //Test HAVE_CXX_ATOMICS_WITHOUT_LIB; HAVE_CXX_ATOMICS_WITHOUT_LIB:INTERNAL=1; ```. While in my GCC 8 build of the master branch I see this:. ```cmake; //Test HAVE_CXX_ATOMICS64_WITHOUT_LIB; HAVE_CXX_ATOMICS64_WITHOUT_LIB:INTERNAL=; //Test HAVE_CXX_ATOMICS64_WITH_LIB; HAVE_CXX_ATOMICS64_WITH_LIB:INTERNAL=1; //Test HAVE_CXX_ATOMICS_WITHOUT_LIB; HAVE_CXX_ATOMICS_WITHOUT_LIB:INTERNAL=1; //Have library atomic; HAVE_CXX_LIBATOMICS64:INTERNAL=1; ```. The number of internal CMake variables actually differs between the two cases. In the first case, with the system's GCC 6.3 it does seem to detect things correctly. Since there is no `libatomic.so` file anywhere under `/usr/lib`. But in the second case, with GCC 8, CMake seems to falter. It seems that since only for the 64-bit atomic operations is a library needed, CMake gets confused about how to compile the code. Mind you, I'm pretty sure that the Raspberry Pi has a 32-bit ARM CPU. So I have no clue what the 64-bit atomic operations are doing. :confused:. I also tried to google these cache variables, but surprisingly I didn't find much useful. Still, I can't help but think now that this linking issue in ROOT should rather be attacked by fixing CMake somehow, and not by linking against `libatomic` ourselves.

Currently this test fails for runtime_cxxmodules even though the change seems unrelated. It seems to me that failure is the right behavior.

My suspicion is that the for the non-modules case we somehow fail to unload the definition of `SiStripCluster`. @pcanal, can you remember what exactly we were testing there?.

Modifiability,"> > I am almost certain that non-critical changes won’t make it back upstream.; > ; > I think all of us appreciate the time and brain power Vincenzo invests in improving the code. I bet it's useful to propose changes coming out of this upstream where relevant, @sudo-panda ?. Hi @Axel-Naumann ,. I am really grateful to @vepadulano for investing his precious time in reviewing this PR and suggesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ). So unless ""we should never use `global`"" is a new convention being followed in ROOT, I believe it doesn't seem to track. 4.

Modifiability,"> > I think llvm discourages that setup generally; > ; > Discourage what setup? If you mean `-DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON` and `-DCLANG_LINK_CLANG_DYLIB=ON`, these are the recommended switches for a shared library build of LLVM/Clang (see: https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html). It's used by most distributions nowadays (e.g. on Arch Linux: https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/llvm/-/blob/main/PKGBUILD?ref_type=heads#L82, Debian (see: https://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs//main/l/llvm-toolchain-13/llvm-toolchain-13_13.0.1-11_changelog), nixpkgs (see: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/compilers/llvm/common/llvm/default.nix#L326), etc.).; > . No, relying on the llvm-config binary. . > I haven't tried `-DLLVM_EXTERNAL_PROJECTS=""cling"" -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_CLING_SOURCE_DIR=/src/cling`, but this suggests I'd need to combine the build of of both cling and llvm as part of the same build, which in Guix we try to avoid as a policy (so that build units are smaller, can be patched individually, and offer more visibility in terms of dependencies, etc.). In that case we should use find_package instead. You can see how that is done in the clad project https://github.com/vgvassilev/clad. Unfortunately, I do not understand how the current changes help our project. I can claim they make our cmake more complicated and unreadable. I can see how this helps your package manager but this is the first time I hear about it. . To move forward here, I propose to replace the llvm-config part with find_package for clang and llvm.

They are kind of doing the same thing, but #5938 is dumb. It only checks if it can `import <package>` at all, and then runs the tutorial or fails all that need e.g. `numpy`. It doesn't care for versions. I guess I can rewrite the `${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_DevMain} -c ""import <package>""` from the other PR to simply use the test from this PR.
