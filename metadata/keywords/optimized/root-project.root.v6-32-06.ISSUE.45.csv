Performance,"What can be done here is rather simple. The bottleneck last time I checked is rootcling (dictionary generation). There are two reasons:; * cmake -- dictionary generation depends on LinkDef and header files and both artifacts are available from the beginning. However, the cmake build system does not have separate targets for dictionary generation and library generation. That leads to forcing rootcling to wait for the expensive linking step of each library. For example, instead of building `Y.pcm` once we are done with building `X.pcm` we wait for the linker to link `X.so`.; * rootcling is unnecessary slow -- the tool has grown organically and in many cases we make many iterations over the AST where we don't need them. Some of the larger scale ideas have been outlined here since years: https://github.com/root-project/root-evolution/pull/5 In fact, we don't need to get so much into the refactoring rootcling, attaching a profiler and seeing the bottlenecks should be easy.

Performance,"When integrating the discretely-sampled RooCurves, the algorithm; implemented in RooCurve::average() was unnecessarily complicated. The existing midpoints were only considered for the trapezoidal rule if; they are away from the interval limits with an arbitrary tolerance,; which seems like a premature optimization to me. In particular, the logic was not correct if all midpoints were close to; the limits without this tolerance, resulting in issue https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9838. Instead of making that case work correctly by implementing more code; branches, this commit suggests to simply don't do this tolerace check; and use all available midpoints for the trapezoidal integration rule. A unit test with the reproducer from https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9838 is also implemented. Closes https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9838.

Performance,"When performing multi-thread reads of ROOT files, we need to pick the number; of TBB tasks among which we will divide the dataset. Our heuristic is ""try to produce around `T = N/ntrees` tasks per tree per; worker thread"": we don't know the number of clusters in each tree before; we open the files, so we don't know the total number of clusters upfront.; Instead we set a ""desired value"" of T tasks per tree and per thread, and; then when each thread opens a file it tries to make T tasks out of it (if; the file turns out to be too small, it might end up producing _less_ tasks than; desired. If we are processing `M > N` small files, we might end up producing; _more_ tasks per worker than N). N is a free parameter, and it represents the desired total number of; tasks per worker. If N is too low, parallelism will be too coarse-grained; and we might get imbalance/tails with bad parallelization.; The higher N is, the more CPU time we spend in task setup/teardown. Empirically, I believe we have set N too high (before this patch we set; it to 24).

Performance,"When using `RooGenericPdf` to implement custom PDF's, fitting becomes quite slow due to the use of numerical integration. This becomes a big problem when one needs to be perform several fits on the PDF (such as when studying systematical errors or statistical significances).

As concrete example, if one needed to implement a PDF such as `f(x) = a/x + b*x + c`, it feels like we should be able to do; ```c; // Define custom pdf; RooGenericPdf my_pdf(""my_pdf"", ""x[1]/x[0] + x[2]*x[0] + x[3]"", RooArgList(x, a, b, c));; // Set formula for analytical integral; my_pdf.SetAnalyticalIntegralFormula(""x[1]*TMath::Log(x[0]) + x[2]*x[0]*x[0]/2 + x[0]*x[3]"");; ```.

Performance,"While profiling the AGC running on local dask, we found that TChain::GetListOfBranches() allocated a large amount of memory. The reason is that when the function is called, TChain does a LoadTree(0), which results in the tree allocating a new TTreeCache. This piles up during the execution of the python tasks and results in a large memory overhead.; Since we don't really need the cache when only querying the branch list, this commit introduces a new private LoadTreeWithOptions() function that allows the TChain to internally disable the tree's cache (setting the cache size to 0) before performing the LoadTree.

Performance,"With multiple concurrent `RNTupleFillContext`s, the order of clusters is generally indeterminate and entries are only partially ordered. With staged cluster committing, this restriction can be partially lifted by splitting a cluster commit into two phases:; 1. Once full, or when manually triggered, all fields are committed which triggers flushing of all columns. All pages are compressed and staged via the page sink. The result is a `RStagedCluster` that records all information for the second phase. This step can be repeated multiple times as entries are filled into the context.; 2. When appropriate for the application, all staged clusters can be committed, which logically appends them to the RNTuple. This is implemented in a single critical section, which guarantees that the clusters and their entries are consecutive. Moreover, by synchronizing the second phase between multiple contexts, the application can enforce a total ordering of all contained entries at reasonable resource consumption: During the first phase, all write buffers are flushed and will be reused for the following cluster. The metadata stored in `RStagedCluster` should require only minimal memory, which will accumulate while staging more clusters. Staged cluster committing is expected to be slightly slower than the default mode, but should still scale well as the second phase only updates the metadata which is a lightweight operation compared to preparing and filling entries, compressing pages, and writing them to disk. A noteworthy disadvantage is that staged cluster committing will lead to non-linear files, where sequentially iterating over clusters may require seeking to distant file offsets. The impact resulting from this will depend on the storage technology and the read pattern.

Performance,"With the function `RooDataHist::interpolateQuadratic()` it is now possible to; use `RooDataHist::weights()` (implemented in #11171) to evaluate weights for; one dimensional histograms with up to second order interpolation.

Performance,"With this change, fields are only added to the `REntry` and read when they are referenced in the processor loop. This prevents unecessary reads of unused fields. It also makes the REntry completely transparent from an interface perspective. Pointers to values can be obtained through the processor interface itself *before* the iteration starts, or alternatively via the iterator returned by the processor. Important to note that during iteration, the pointer returned by `RNTupleProcessor::GetPtr` will **not** contain the value for the current entry. The reason for this is that from the `RNTupleProcessor` interface there is (with the current implementation) no way to know what the current entry index is. For now, `RNTupleProcessor::GetPtr` contains a warning and a recommendation to get the pointer through the iterator instead. Alternative solutions could be:; 1. Remove `RNTupleProcessor::GetPtr` altogether and only allow access to the field value pointers through the iterator.; 2.

Performance,"You're right! I misunderstood, I thought `std::rotate` rotated the whole iterable (e.g. like https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.roll.html), but I see now it only puts the selected part in front and shoves the rest aside to make room. But then apparently there are still situations that we are not catching. I think probably sometimes there will be yet another task executed before all tasks are in the queue. This is of course always possible, because the OS can delay processes and IPC in any way it sees fit. I can up the sleep time to compensate for this so it happens less often, but it is by the nature of the algorithm unavoidable that some statistical failures will still happen (given slow enough OS'es). What we can do to make sure that the test never fails is to iteratively go through all received tasks and modify the expected order until it matches, but of course in the extreme case that every step is reordered this would then defeat the purpose of the test. A more robust approach would be to wait with taking work off the queue until all tasks have been submitted, but this is not actually desirable functionality, because that would mean workers would be doing nothing when they could already be working. Introducing such functionality just for testing purposes seems silly. So not sure how to ""fix"" this.

Performance,"Your understanding is correct, you can go ahead with v6.24/00. For the compile time pinning, from the discussion we had yesterday, we can have architecture specific builds, so that, for example, `x86_64-centos7-gcc9-opt` will stick to the basic `x86-64` instructions, while `haswell-centos7-gcc9-opt` will do its best using AVX2 and all other goodies you get on that platform (we can also use the microarchitecture levels like `x86-64-v2` which will be available as of GCC 11 and Clang 12).

Let's see from somebody in ATLAS what they think. I anyway (as a matter of principle) would prefer if you can have dynamic architecture dispatching that I can turn off in specific builds. @oshadura also mention possible optimizations in compression algorithms, but, again, that's a case that does not worry me, as they only deal with integers, so you do not get incompatible/incorrect results by changing the order of operations (unless there's a bug). The bottom line is that I'm worried about numerical instabilities due to the change of order of floating point operations in trigger and reconstruction code. It doesn't matter if scalar or avx2 versions produce slightly different results, as long as I know that running the scalar version of the application will always give me the same result.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361#issuecomment-793617647:893,optimiz,optimizations,893,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361#issuecomment-793617647,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']
Performance,"[ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each; library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using; JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll; walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should; prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in; precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider; a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor; that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a; circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock; (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like; this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so""; provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and; resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""...; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in; the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1. The lookup for ""f"" finds and runs the materializer for ""f"".; 2.2.2. The materializer for ""f"" reaches JITLink, which tries to resolve; symbol ""x"". There is no work to trigger (we started materializing it; already in (2.1)), so the link is suspended pending resolution of ""x"".; Critically, the dlopen cannot complete until the link completes.; 2.2. MU *would* dlsym ""x"", but it's blocked waiting on the dlopen to finish. And we're deadlocked again. The root cause of the problem is that ld.so and the JIT don't communicate; immediately about symbol resolutions. What we really wanted was for the; dlopen to register the library symbols with the JIT before it ran the; initializers, but that's just not the way dlopen works today. I think this is solvable though. We can probably hack up a custom ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1274280300:1786,load,load,1786,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1274280300,1,['load'],['load']

Before that commit, the above snippet was valid code, and there is no simple alternative.

Performance,"[skip-ci]. # This Pull request:. Makes the CI load OpenStack object-store credentials from files on runners instead of using GitHub secrets. When `pull_request` is a workflow trigger, the job can't access secrets, which means that the S3 secret token is unavailable. Adding S3 credentials to the runners themselves solves this issue. The OpenStack credentials are defined [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/ai/it-puppet-hostgroup-lcgapp/-/blob/rootci_test/code/manifests/build/root.pp#L43) (using [teigi](https://configdocs.web.cern.ch/secrets/adding.html)). If a malicious actor makes a PR with a job to print the credentials, or to upload a malicious artifact, it would still have to be approved by a maintainer. A safer alternative is not allowing pull request jobs to upload artifacts at all but then we can't run tests in a separate job. It would also cause builds to take more time on average because the object storage will be less populated. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12201:46,load,load,46,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12201,1,['load'],['load']

It can now only read repository (when PR commenting is getting implemented it has to run in a separate workflow anyways); - Re-enables output buffering to improve performance, at the cost of stderr being redirected to stdout.

Performance,"_ changing the `return` statement as follows; ```diff; - return histograms;; + return {h};; ```. ### To Reproduce; The issue can be reproduced with the following code in ArchLinux x86_64 with ROOT master:; ```c++; vector<ROOT::RDF::RResultPtr<TH1D>> pointer_not_allocated_error(){; // Create a data frame with 100 rows; ROOT::RDataFrame rdf(100);. // Define a new column `x` that contains random numbers and create a histogram; ROOT::RDF::RResultPtr<TH1D> h = rdf.Define(""x"", [](){ return gRandom->Rndm(); }).Histo1D(""x"");. // Add the histogram to a vector; vector<ROOT::RDF::RResultPtr<TH1D>> histograms;; histograms.push_back(h);. // Attempt to throw an error; throw std::runtime_error(""intended error throw for debugging"");. return histograms;; }; ```. ### Additional context; For additional context see https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/pointer-not-allocated-when-adding-rresultptr-to-vector/51831/2.

The total number of entries in the chain/tentrylist is larget than `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`. With the first call to `GetEntryAndTree`, I give as input exactly the int limit, and the output is correct (index of the tree = 100, index of the entry in that tree = 47). With the next call, the input is the int limit + 1, from which one would expect the same tree and just one entry beyond the previous one, i.e. 48. Instead the result is tree index = -1 and entry index = -1. This is a bug resulting from a wrong signature in `TEntryList::GetEntryAndTree`:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/8323e504ae187954dcb9bcdfd5df2f9a5ed2abca/tree/tree/src/TEntryList.cxx#L831.

Performance,"`TCling.cxx`’s `RegisterCxxModules` loads explicitly several modules including `Core`, `Rint` and `RIO`. When executing rootcling (for example for G__Net.cxx) *before* `G__Rint.cxx` was created and thus before `lib/Rint.pcm` was properly created, a default `lib/Rint.pcm` is auto-generated and registered as one of the dependencies. Later the real `lib/Rint.pcm` is created is creation date is later than other `pcm` than depends-on/uses it’s creation time. For example:. ```; $ ls -lart lib/Net.pcm lib/MultiProc.pcm lib/Imt.pcm lib/MathCore.pcm lib/Rint.pcm; -rw-r--r-- 1 pcanal pcanal 1158548 Nov 10 20:26 lib/Net.pcm; -rw-r--r-- 1 pcanal pcanal 1278392 Nov 10 20:27 lib/MultiProc.pcm; -rw-r--r-- 1 pcanal pcanal 2032752 Nov 10 20:27 lib/Imt.pcm; -rw-r--r-- 1 pcanal pcanal 12911448 Nov 10 20:27 lib/MathCore.pcm; -rw-r--r-- 1 pcanal pcanal 444724 Nov 10 20:35 lib/Rint.pcm; ```. then later uses of those `pcm` leads to the (mis-worded) error message:. ```; <<< cling interactive line includer >>>: fatal error: module file '/home/neel/Desktop/Root/build/lib/Rint.pcm' is out of date and needs to be rebuilt: could not read module signature; <<< cling interactive line includer >>>: note: imported by module 'MathCore' in '/home/neel/Desktop/Root/build/lib/MathCore.pcm'; Error: Module 'MathCore.pcm' failed to load.; Error: Error loading the default rootcling header files.; make[2]: *** [math/mathmore/CMakeFiles/G__MathMore.dir/build.make:130: math/mathmore/G__MathMore.cxx] Error 1; ```.

Performance,"`gInterpreter::ProcessLine` has an important run-time cost.; Instead of calling it everytime the jitting of an action is required, we now store all the strings that are to jit in TLoopManager and do a single call to `gInterpreter::ProcessLine` before running the event-loop. A couple of life-time issues had to be resolved for this to work properly: in order to let result proxies and action helpers share ownership of the result object, I introduced (simple) manual lifetime management of a shared_ptr (weird, I know). In order to deal with deferred jitting of an action that hangs from a node whose `TInterface` has already been destroyed (can happen due to the deferral of jitting) all `BuildAndBook` functions have been made independent of `TInterface`. In the long term it might be possible to refactor the jitting mechanism so that the `TAction` (and the `TTreeReaderValue/Array`s that it contains) is jitted but the action helpers are not, lifting the requirement of manual lifetime management of a shared_ptr. Although this should be possible in principle, I currently don't see how we could integrate it with the existing logic, so I decided for this much less invasive solution. Before/after runtimes for two extreme scenarios:. `test_inference.cxx` (which performs a lot of jitting).; compile time: ~8s -> ~9s; run time: ~40s -> ~7s. 50 jitted Histo1D calls in a loop (thanks to Attila for the use-case):; run time: ~35s -> <2s.

I am not sure what you mean (i.e a straight replacement would not have 'large' performance improvement).

Simplest implementation is to have Cartesian coordinates as private attributes;. 2. The users find that they most often use radius and azimuth, hence decide to store spherical coordinates instead of (x,y,z);. 3. Actually, colliders use eta more often than theta, so that the internal state is now given by (r, phi, eta). * In parallel and independently, Hit also evolves:. a. Simplest implementation is to have only the energy as private member;. b. Because the number of requests for the transverse energy is very high, the users want to optimize the speed by keeping Et as private member;. c. Well, it happens that disk space is short and e() is rarely called, so that it makes sense to reduce the size of the Hit class by dropping the energy member and computing the energy just when calling the method e(). They also found that the detector parameters used to store data in version b are wrong, so that one needs to scale the energy by 1.3 only for version b (a and c are correct).

Performance,"aces, and I wanted to understand why this was leaking a lot of memory. This is in 6.22/08 but I think the problems persist in master. Thankfully the biggest leak is easy to fix and I'll make a PR for that soon (workspace not cleaning up all its RooLinkedLists). But the next biggest one has taken me a while to understand....; <br>Valgrind reported lots of leaking of RooObjCacheManager instances. I believe a way to evidence this is with a minimal reproducer (see above).; <br>If you track how many times a RooObjCacheManager is constructed with these lines, the first line constructs one of them (the `_normMgr` of the RooAbsPdf class). But when the file is read back in on the second line, I see two RooObjCacheManagers get constructed. The first one comes from the constructor of the RooAbsPdf (via the gaussian), but the second comes from streaming of the RooAbsArg base class which contains a `std::deque<RooAbsCache*> _cacheList`. ; <br>So what I'm seeing is that in the first line where the pdf is first created, the `_normMgr` (which is declared as `RooObjCacheManager _normMgr` in `RooAbsPdf`) is the same as the one in the `_cacheList`. But when you read back the pdf in the second line, the `_normMgr` no longer is the same as the one in the `_cacheList` -- both caches (the one in the `_cacheList` and the `_normMgr`) have the gaus as its owner, but they are distinct objects and when the gaus is deleted I assume the one in the `_cacheList` doesnt get destroyed, causing the leak. ; <br>If my diagnosis is correct, then I dunno what would be the correct way to fix this, the best way I can think of so far would be making `RooObjCacheManager` always be a pointer rather than an instance data member. Do others have thoughts?; <br>Worth acknowledging the problem probably isn't just a memory leak when we have an inconsistency between the list of caches in the `RooAbsArg` base class vs the actual caches the derived classes might be interacting with directly, but i havent studied that.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8764:3316,cache,caches,3316,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8764,3,['cache'],['caches']

Will error if any of the branches are not found.; --branches-regex bregex1 [bregex2 ...]; Reads any branches with a name matching the provided regex.

Will automatically cap to the number of available threads on the machine.; --tasks-per-worker ntasks; The number of tasks to generate for each worker thread when using multithreading. Description:. rootreadspeed is a tool used to help identify bottlenecks in ROOT analysis programs by providing an idea of what throughput you can expect when reading ROOT files in certain configurations. It does this by providing information about the number of bytes read from your files, how long this takes, and the different throughputs in MB/s, both in total and per thread. Compressed vs Uncompressed Throughput:. Throughput speeds are provided as compressed and uncompressed - ROOT files are usually saved in compressed format, so these will often differ. Compressed bytes is the total number of bytes read from TFiles during the readspeed test (possibly including meta-data). Uncompressed bytes is the number of bytes processed by reading the branch values in the TTree. Throughput is calculated as the total number of bytes over the total runtime (including decompression time) in the uncompressed and compressed cases. Interpreting results:. There are three possible scenarios when using rootreadspeed, namely:. 1. The 'Real Time' is significantly lower than your own analysis runtime.; This would imply your actual application code is dominating the runtime of your analysis, ie. your analysis logic or framework is taking up the time. The best way to decrease the runtime would be to optimize your code, attempt to parallelize it onto multiple threads if possible, or use a machine with ",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039:2171,Throughput,Throughput,2171,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039,1,['Throughput'],['Throughput']
Performance,"and caches the polynomial; coefficients. This has serveral disadvantages:. * High cost in memory (the big ATLAS models can have thousands of; `FlexibleInterpVars`. * It's inconsistent with the `PiecewiseInterpolation`, which should be; equivalent. * Most importantly, and this was the motivation for this PR now:; when we do the code generation for AD, we can't pre-compute cached; coefficients because it would bloat the generated code with constant; arrays. Computing on the fly is much more AD-friendly. Validation of the new `FlexibleInterpVar` values for `low=0.9` and; `high=1.2` that shows the interpolated values are agreeing to the 5e-4; level. This is completely accepatable for such an ad-hoc polynomial; motivation, where the shape is not given by any physical meaning anyway; but just by the continuity condition at the boundaries. And at the; boundaries (and `param=0`), the difference between both implementations; goes to zero.

Performance,"anslation/rotation is applied to a TGeoVolumeAssembly through the `MakePhysicalNode > Align` sequence, the BoundingBox of this TGeoVolumeAssembly may end up with 0 size (GetDX, GetDY and GetDZ returning 0).; This is not expected as it means there are other effects on the Volume aside from the translation/rotation, even when shifting something without leaving its parent volume. Something similar happens if a translation/rotation is applied to a Node which is part of a TGeoVolumeAssembly, but there it probably happens only if the changes leads to part of the assembly exceeding the original boundaries.; We (me and @fuhlig1) suspect that this may partially be recursive (affecting the parent of the aligned volume). This can be cured by forcing the recomputation of the BoundingBox of the affected Volume. ### Expected behavior; After alignment of the nodes, all volumes/nodes are offset/rotated with their other properties valid.; Or if not possible due to performance, a warning should be printout with hint of the proper way to restore/recompute these values. A temporary fix was introduced for now in FairRoot, which is to simply do the recompute for all TGeoVolumeAssembly in the geometry tree, which seems to be fast enough that we do not have to try to track affected Volumes to be more selective. ; This may however not be the case later when applied to complete geometries for experiments like CBM. ### To Reproduce; Steps to reproduce the behavior with the attached files (includes ""ROOT-only"" examples both for problem and for macro-level fix):; 1. Compile a copy of ROOT 6.22.08 (done with FairSoft apr21p2 and FairRoot v18.6.7, should work with any older versions of each and with recent versions of FairRoot, as well as with a standalone version of ROOT); 1.

Performance,"are currently only available when the compiler flag DEBUG is defined. In my experience, trouble with minimizing some function is common so it would be a great asset to enable more debug output at anytime by just increasing the print level without recompiling ROOT. The DEBUG messages are particularly problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). ### Possible negative side-effects. #### Breaking changes?. This proposal does not change the output for print level 0, but there is a minor change for print level 1. It changes the output of scripts/software that uses print level 1, because previously level 1 meant ""print errors and info"" while in the new hierarchy it means ""print errors and warnings"". I think this is a minor effect, which has to be documented in the next changelog but it cannot cause backward incompatibilities or breakage. #### Reduced performance?. The impact on performance is expected to be negligible. I propose to place additional calls into the compiled code for everyone, but these calls are not executed unless the user picks a high print level. For a low print level, there is just the minor additional cost of a branch, which moreover can be predicted very well by the CPU, so the added cost should be almost zero. Furthermore, these branches do not happen in hot code paths. Hot paths are inside the cost function (which are unaffected) and in the linear algebra routines that Minuit2 uses (which are not instrumented with debug messages). ### Positive side-effects for wrappers and frontends. An important positive side effect for wrappers like iminuit is that we could show our users debug messages, too. Right now, we cannot, because DEBUG messages can only be enabled at compile-time, not at run-time. The DEBUG messages are also problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421:3172,perform,performance,3172,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421,1,['perform'],['performance']

By running inside a debugger, we can see that there is an issue at exit time (which **does not** depend on the version of xgboost); ```; (ROOT-CI) [root@663cf5af2db5 tmva]# gdb --args python tmva102_Testing.py ; [...]; Thread 1 ""python"" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.; 0x00007f1251f78110 in __do_global_dtors_aux () from /lib64/libopenblaso.so.0; (gdb) ; (gdb) bt; #0 0x00007f1251f78110 in __do_global_dtors_aux () from /lib64/libopenblaso.so.0; #1 0x00007f1279ebef9e in _dl_fini () at dl-fini.c:142; #2 0x00007f12796574dd in __run_exit_handlers (status=0, listp=0x7f12797fa838 <__exit_funcs>, run_list_atexit=run_list_atexit@entry=true, ; run_dtors=run_dtors@entry=true) at exit.c:116; #3 0x00007f1279657620 in __GI_exit (status=<optimized out>) at exit.c:146; #4 0x00007f127963feb7 in __libc_start_call_main (main=main@entry=0x557932280160 <main>, argc=argc@entry=2, argv=argv@entry=0x7ffe94d9b838); at ../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:74; #5 0x00007f127963ff60 in __libc_start_main_impl (main=0x557932280160 <main>, argc=2, argv=0x7ffe94d9b838, init=<optimized out>, fini=<optimized out>, ; rtld_fini=<optimized out>, stack_end=0x7ffe94d9b828) at ../csu/libc-start.c:389; #6 0x0000557932280095 in _start (); ```. And the same stacktrace is produced for all three tests. This may or may not be linked to https://github.com/wlav/cppyy/issues/227 and the fact that complex Python packages (in this case it's xgboost, but also pytorch is notorious for this behaviour) seem to not handle well C++ symbols.

This 'simulates' the CMSSW framework running to ROOT output modules concurrently (represented by the `group.run(activity)` calls ). Within each of those 'modules' 10 new identical TBB tasks are launched and the waited upon. If a task from one 'module' ever is run on the thread of the other module (i.e. the thread doing the `group.wait()`) the program prints ""WRONG THREAD"". The program can be built with the options to; - Turn off task_arena isolation (-DNO_ISOLATE) at the 'module' level (this would represent removing such isolate calls in CMSSW); - Add another task arena (-DOTHER) which represents the global ROOT arena.; - Add task_arena isolate within the other arena (-DOTHER_ISOLATE) which would represent what would happen if ROOT internally called isolate within your own arena. The results are; - with only -DNO_ISOLATE see 'WRONG THREAD' message every time the program is run. This shows why CMS added the isolate; - with no other option, 'WRONG THREAD' is never seen; - with -DOTHER, see 'WRONG THREAD' every time >>> this is the case for ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14807#issuecomment-1971612644:2470,concurren,concurrently,2470,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14807#issuecomment-1971612644,1,['concurren'],['concurrently']

This reproducer should work on any machine with docker once you replace `PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING` with a suitable folder on your system. (The build includes LLVM+Clang debug information so it requires ~20GB of space and benefits from fast storage.). 1. Start a docker container with a directory mounted from the host (to make switching between CentOS 7 and 8 easier):. ```bash; PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING=/scratch2/root-debug2; mkdir -p ""$PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING""; docker run --rm -it -v ""$PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING"":""$PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING"" -w ""$PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING"" centos:7 bash; ```. 2.

Performance,"back port of https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12863. This problem appears ""only"" in newer OS/compiler (as seen in the original reports leading to #12715) the dependent library are now dlclose'd when the 'main' library is dlclose'd. In the example a cmake generated library is linked against `libHist` and `libHist` is then loaded and unloaded when the example's library is (intentionally) loaded and unloaded. `libHist` happens to share a STL collection's dictionary (`std::vector<TString>`) with `libCore` (and this collection is used for the reading of rootpcm files and thus during the loading of the example's library). . Details:. Unload only the TClass actually generated by the unloaded library. The TGenericClassInfo's destructor now passes the TClass that they actually generated in; addition to the name so that only that TClass is destroyed. This avoid the problem (seen in #12715) where 2 librares (`A` and `B`) have a dictionary for the same; STL collection (this is supported) and we have the following sequence of operation:. 1. load library A; 2. load library B (dictionary registration is ignored as intended); 3. request TClass for STL collection.; 4. unload (dclose) library B; 5. use TClass for STL collection. With the previous code, step 4. would lead to the TClass for STL; collection to be marked as ""unloaded"" even though it library (A); was still actually loaded. Fix reloading of library with a module. Prior to this fix, the in-memory rootpcm loaded as part of the module was removed; from memory on first use and thus if the library was closed and re-opened/loaded; we no longer had the information needed to restore the TClass object corresponding; to that library. This 2 changes fix #12715.

Performance,"ck with `readelf` reveals the runpath of the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` is the reason for this problem. ```; $ readelf -a /usr/local/lib/root/libcppyy3_10.so | grep -i runpath; 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../lib/root]; ```. ```; $ readelf -a /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/libcppyy3_10.so | grep -i runpath; 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../lib/root]; ```. As you can see above, the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` have the same runpath as the ones installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, which shouldn't be the case if the two are different directories. ### Expected behavior; The libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` should have the runpath set to the correct relative location of `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` (`$ORIGIN/../../../lib/root` in the previous example). ### To Reproduce; 1. Configure the build with `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` different from `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` and with rpath enabled.; 2. Compile and install as usual.; 3. Try to use the python modules installed by ROOT, such as by running `rootbrowse`. ### Setup; - ROOT version 6.26/06; - Ubuntu 22.04 running on WSL2; - ROOT installed from source with the build config command `CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda-11.7/bin/nvcc cmake -C config.cmake .. -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES='86' -Dgnuinstall=ON -Dcuda=ON -Dcudnn=ON -Dtmva-gpu=ON -Dsoversion=ON -Dfortran=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python -Drpath=ON`, where the file `config.cmake` contains; ```; set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR ""lib/python3.10/dist-packages"" CACHE PATH ""python libraries and modules (same as LIBDIR)""); set(CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR ""/etc/root"" CACHE PATH ""read-only single-machine data (etc/root)""); ```. ### Additional context; A temporary workaround while this issue is not resolved is to manually modify the runpath of the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR`, e.g. using `chrpath` or [`patchelf`](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431:3384,CACHE,CACHE,3384,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431,2,['CACHE'],['CACHE']

Performance,"ckaging Guidelines some time ago added a section on packaging javascript files. This section says that minified scripts should be treated as compiled code. And like for programs written in other languages, pre-compiled code that is part of the sources must not be used in packaging, but must be regenerated from sources during the package build. I recently implemented these guidelines in the root package and found some issues. This pull request has three commits. 1) The word ""default"" is a reserved word in the language, and when used as a key in a dictionary it must be quoted. The yuicompressor minifier complains about this:; ```; $ yuicompressor etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/DecisionTree.js ; [ERROR] in etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/DecisionTree.js; 57:24:invalid property id; ```; 2. In one place (and one place only) in the script a construct from a very new version of the javascript standard is used for defining default values to function parameters. This unnecessarily makes the code incompatible with old browsers. It also makes it hard to run the minification during the package build as both yuicompressor and uglufyjs choke on it.; ```; $ yuicompressor etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/NeuralNetwork.js ; [ERROR] in etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/NeuralNetwork.js; 509:75:missing ) after formal parameters; ```; ```; $ uglifyjs etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/NeuralNetwork.js -c -m; Parse error at etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/NeuralNetwork.js:509,73; = function (divid, netobj, oldStructure=false) {; ^; SyntaxError: Unexpected token operator «=», expected punc «,»; ```; 3. The code has not been updated to reflect changes in jsroot. The code still tries to load d3.v3.min.js from jsroot. In the current version of jsroot the d3 script has been updated to version 4 and the file is now called d3.min.js. The pull request changes the name of the file in the two places where it is referenced, so it should now find the file. However this change is incomplete since the d3 API changes between the versions and some porting is needed.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1520:1640,load,load,1640,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1520,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"clang might need to find a definition, that ""we"" might have.; But we need to find it based on a type name from clang, from a fwd decl;; or (as in ROOT-10804) based on a typename-from-typeid operation.; So register that as an alias!. The normalized-name-as-known-to-ROOT and typeid-name can be different,; for instance for inline namespaces: stripped by ROOT, kept by typeid. ROOT-10804 has a complex case where a lookup of a template argument failed; because it involves an inline namespace, and LHCb uses typeid demangling.; LHCb's case needed a nested name from a type (`LHCb::Event::v1::Track`); that failed to load because `v1` is an inline namespace, thus failing; instantiation of `KeyedContainer<LHCb::Event::v1::Track,Containers::KeyedObjectManager<Containers::hashmap> >` and making it invalid.; The transaction unloading then fails to completely remove this instantiation; (an unrelated bug), such that the remainders of the invalid decl are picked; up by a subsequent template instantiation which then asserts because of the; incomplete (invalid) declaration. We use the mangle/demangle trick from rootcling.; Now that multiple locations need it, just store it with the AnnotatedRecordDecl.; It will be needed for most classes; the overhead should be bearable.

So I think it makes sense to reduce top-level global variables, #includes and eagerly deserializations. 1. Global variables; If we break at emitModule, we can get a list of global variables and functions which are actually deserialized. These include functions, variables, STL classes and all the functions derives from them. I tried to change them to for example constexpr, so that it's processed at compile time.; 2. Eagerly Deserialized decls; Thanks to @Axel 's hint and tip, we could minimize eagerly deserialized decls deserialized in ASTReader::PassInterestingDeclsToConsumer. We already removed most of eagerly deserialized decls (Some are remaining to be removed, some are hard to remove and some don't cost a lot). So far, we got 9.2% of cpu time improvement, 15% real time improvement and 8.8% of memory improvement at start up time in release build.

Performance,"concatenation of pages from the same page-group can achieve.; - `RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl()` maps pages from the same page-group to the same attribute key, thus concatenating them on the DAOS-side (i.e. relies on scatter-gathered I/O) until the cage limit is reached. The cage sizes can vary due to page compression and the length of page-groups, thus it is calculated and stored to be referenced when reading back.; - `RWOperation` is generalized to allow many IOVs associated with one attribute key in a request, enabling the non-contiguous buffers of sealed pages to be aggregated into a cage under the same position ID in the object store. ; - `RNTupleLocator`: leverages the changes introduced by PR #11828; all DAOS locators use the type `kDaos` and payload format `RNTupleLocatorObject64`. To locate pages within a cage, the 64-bit payload encodes the cage index in the LS half and the offset in the MS half. If caging is disabled, the offset remains zero, and each 'cage' is trivially the sealed page.; - Currently, there are no plans to enable support for page-wise reading without cluster caching if the desired page is caged, as that use-case is not performant and thus not recommended. Caged pages in DAOS should be accessed with the page buffering read option turned on. By disallowing the reading of a single caged page when the wrapping cage size is unknown, the cage sizes - or upper bounds for them - do not need to be passed to `RPageSourceDaos`; they are trivially devised in `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()` by accessing all page locators in a buffered page-group. ; - `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()` and `RPageSourceDaos::PopulatePageFromCluster()` extract the cage position and offset-in-cage from each sealed page's `RNTupleLocator::fPosition`. The former function has been changed to coalesce the page locators by cage index and perform a single read operation per cage. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally + HPE `delphi` cluster; - [x] updated the docs",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11466:2553,perform,performant,2553,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11466,4,"['Load', 'perform']","['LoadClusters', 'perform', 'performant']"

Performance,"d in RClusterPool. To this end, an `RPageSink` is created at the beginning of the pipeline with the same header as the RNTuple being read. After the compressed cluster is retrieved in memory, its columns and pages are traversed and saved to the cached RNTuple. For now this feature can be reproduced with a very limited example, divided in three pieces; ### 1. Write an RNTuple; ```cpp; void write_ntuple(); {; auto model = RNTupleModel::Create();; auto myintfield = model->MakeField<int>(""myintfield"");; auto myintfieldsquared = model->MakeField<int>(""myintfieldsquared"");. std::string_view ntuplename{""myntuple""};; std::string_view filename{""myntuple.root""};; auto ntuple = RNTupleWriter::Recreate(std::move(model), ntuplename, filename);. constexpr int nentries = 10;; for (int i = 0; i < nentries; i++) {; *myintfield = i;; *myintfieldsquared = i*i;; ntuple->Fill();; // Create a cluster every 5 entries; if (i == 4 || i == 9) ntuple->CommitCluster();; }; }; ```; ### 2. Read the RNTuple (this will create a `cachedntuple.root` file); ```cpp; void read_ntuple(); {; std::string_view ntuplename{""myntuple""};; std::string_view filename{""myntuple.root""};; auto ntuple = RNTupleReader::Open(ntuplename, filename);. for (auto entryid: *ntuple){; ntuple->LoadEntry(entryid);; }; }; ```; ### 3. Print info of the cached RNTuple; ```cpp; void read_cache(); {; std::string_view ntuplename{""myntuple""};; std::string_view filename{""cachedntuple.root""};. auto model = RNTupleModel::Create();; auto myintfield = model->MakeField<int>(""myintfield"");; auto myintfieldsquared = model->MakeField<int>(""myintfieldsquared"");; auto ntuple = RNTupleReader::Open(std::move(model), ntuplename, filename);; ntuple->PrintInfo();. for (auto entryid: *ntuple){; ntuple->LoadEntry(entryid);; std::cout << ""Read entry "" << entryid << "" with value "" << *myintfield << ""\n"";; std::cout << ""Read entry "" << entryid << "" with value "" << *myintfieldsquared << ""\n"";; }; }; ```. ## TODOS. 1.

Currently only one can be used at a time. --all-branches; Reads every branch from the specified files and TTrees.; --branches bname1 [bname2...]; Reads the branches with matching names. Will error if any of the branches are not found.; --branches-regex bregex1 [bregex2 ...]; Reads any branches with a name matching the provided regex. Will error if any provided regex does not match at least one branch. Meta arguments:; --threads nthreads; The number of threads to use for file reading. Will automatically cap to the number of available threads on the machine.; --tasks-per-worker ntasks; The number of tasks to generate for each worker thread when using multithreading. Description:. rootreadspeed is a tool used to help identify bottlenecks in ROOT analysis programs by providing an idea of what throughput you can expect when reading ROOT files in certain configurations. It does this by providing information about the number of bytes read from your files, how long this takes, and the different throughputs in MB/s, both in total and per thread. Compressed vs Uncompressed Throughput:. Throughput speeds are provided as compressed and uncompressed - ROOT files are usually saved in compressed format, so these will often differ. Compressed bytes is the total number of bytes read from TFiles during the readspeed test (possibly including meta-data). Uncompressed bytes is the number of bytes processed by reading the branch values in the TTree. Throughput is calculated as the total number of bytes over the total runtime (including decompression time) in the uncompressed and compressed cases. Interpreting results:. There are three possible scenarios when using rootreadspeed, namely:. 1. The 'Real Time' is significantly lower than your own analysis runtime.; This would imply your actual application code is dominating the runtime of your analysis, ie. your analysis logic or framework is taking up the time. The best way to decrease the runtime would b",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039:2093,throughput,throughputs,2093,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039,1,['throughput'],['throughputs']

So it seems to likely have something to do with #12857. Oddly, it does not seem to affect my system ROOT version (packaged by Fedora) which is also ROOT 6.28.06 and presumably built with Python 3.11, suggesting that there may be something complicated going on (I was only building my own ROOT in hopes of reproducing @clark2668's problem). None of the patches Fedora applies seem to be relevant, but probably there are differences in compilation flags. .

The memory management of such objects is handled in the subsequent call to `ROOT::Internal::RDF::Jit*Helper` functions. The code to invoke is booked with the RLoopManager via [`lm->ToJitExec`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/e83e0e94a5e10f2cb97a5ff9cb57d5de0d25b9e5/tree/dataframe/src/RDFInterfaceUtils.cxx#L686) but is not compiled and executed right away. The cling invokation only happens in [`RLoopManager::Jit`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/e83e0e94a5e10f2cb97a5ff9cb57d5de0d25b9e5/tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx#L804), which gets all the code previously declared by *any* RDataFrame within the same application via the singleton returned by [`GetCodeToJit`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/e83e0e94a5e10f2cb97a5ff9cb57d5de0d25b9e5/tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx#L67). The fact that all the code from all the RDatFrame objects is JITted at the same time is an optimization, but it has a fragility. In case an RDataFrame books some JITted operation but the computation graph is never triggered, it will leak memory of those objects that were created on the heap but never freed by the corresponding helper functions. Furthermore, those objects in turn are connected to their respective RDataFrame object, which meanwhile can already be gone out of scope. ### Reproducer. ```cpp; #include <ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx>; #include <iostream>; #include <TFile.h>; #include <TTree.h>; #include <ROOT/RLogger.hxx>. auto verbosity = ROOT::Experimental::RLogScopedVerbosity(ROOT::Detail::RDF::RDFLogChannel(), ROOT::Experimental::ELogLevel::kDebug + 10);. int main(); {. {; std::cout << ""Begin scope\n"";; ROOT::RDataFrame rdf(1);; auto df1 = rdf.Define(""x"", ""42"");; std::cout << ""End scope\n"";; }; }; ```.

Performance,"dd the following code:. ```.diff; + TDirectory::TContext context;; currentFile_.reset(TFile::Open(filename.c_str()));; ```. Although this fixes the problem for us, Philippe encouraged me to open up an issue to address this limitation. A slightly adjusted history of the relevant email correspondence is below. ----. Hi Kyle,. On the first user TFile destruction, the destructors is executed (in my case) on Thread 3 (see gdb output below) but the file is the current directory in Thread 1. The point where the file is opened and Thread 1's gDirectory is set is described in the stack trace below. It is likely that the problem is solved by adding:. TDirectory::TContext ctxt;. at the start of `art::RootIOPolicy::openAndReadMetaData`. This will insure that the new created file pointer is 'forgotten' by Thread 1's gDirectory and thus it should solve the problem. Cheers,; Philippe. ```; === gdb output.

Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; > ; > ```python; > # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; > df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); > df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2); > ; > # creating new columns in the datasets; > df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); > df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'); > ; > # Merging the datasets in memory; > df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); > # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; > df_3.Snapshot('tree', 'file.root'); > ```; > ; > I admit that I might not be able to see some internal optimizations that RDF might do while merging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. No, the approaches are different. In the approach without `RDataFrame::Merge` I save twice the modified trees with the new column added, so the whole thing is slower than the second approach where the looping and saving can be done only once. . > ; > ## Current possible approaches; > If you need to process a dataset with RDF and need t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927331768:2026,load,loading,2026,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927331768,1,['load'],['loading']
Performance,"e in ALICE, in which the parallel world ""scene"" can be very large (~100K volumes). In this case, TGeoVoxelFinder takes very long; to construct and consumes a very large amount of memory (GBs). In addition, the evaluation of the Safety function dominates the Geant simulation time. The improvements in this commit are mainly achieved through:. * The use of a boundary volume hierarchy (BVH) as the base acceleration entity, replacing TGeoVoxelFinder.; BVH are the standard in industry/computer-graphics, for what concerns ray-object intersection tasks. The BVH is constructed from axis-aligned bounding boxes and employed in the FindBoundary/FindNode implementations. * The use of a 3D voxel grid (TGeoVoxelGrid) structure, able to store properties ""local"" or in the vicinity of a cartesian coordinate P. This structure allows to reduce the (typical) algorithmic complexity for ""Safety"" queries to ~O(1) (with a constant factor determined by the voxel size). Filling of the 3D voxel grid cache for Safety is done on-the-fly (using the BVH once). * (Optional) Additional caching of ""last-call"" safety values for really quick return when the value is still valid at the next call. Ideas for these improvements come from prior work in related libraries such as VecGeom. -----. Implementation details:. * The implementation is, for now (until fully tested), provided in a backward compatible manner:. - By default, nothing changes; - Users have to activate the BVH mode by setting an environment variable TGEO_PW_USEBVH; - Users may hence compare the 2 modes. * Functions for Safety, FindNode, FindBoundary dispatch to some internal implementation. This causes an extra lookup/jump, which can be removed once BVH is fully validated. * For the BVH, a well known open source implementation is included in header-only form. The headers are copied from https://github.com/madmann91/bvh commit 66e445b92f68801a6dd8ef943fe3038976ecb4ff. * A new class, TGeoVoxelGrid is provided for the cartesian VoxelGrid contai",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442:1359,cache,cache,1359,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442,1,['cache'],['cache']

Performance,"e it back upstream.; > ; > I think all of us appreciate the time and brain power Vincenzo invests in improving the code. I bet it's useful to propose changes coming out of this upstream where relevant, @sudo-panda ?. Hi @Axel-Naumann ,. I am really grateful to @vepadulano for investing his precious time in reviewing this PR and suggesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ).

Performance,"e result of the RDataFrame execution should know how to merge itself with another result of the same type and the result of the merge operation should still know how to merge again. To this end, a new function called `GetMergeableValue` takes as input an RResultPtr<T> , e.g. the last action node of the graph, and returns an `RMergeableValue<T>*`, a new class that satisfies the previous requirements. The choice of creating a new class instead of, for example, returning the standard return value plus a function to merge two values of that type, has to do with the second requirement above.; In fact, while this could be feasible with the return value of a `Count` operation (the merge function would just be the sum of the two count values), it would not be enough for all operations.; Notably, to merge results of two `Mean` operations we would need also the counts of each mean to merge them as a weighted mean, so the function would take 4 parameters of which at most 2 are known beforehand (the mean and the counts of the action that is currently being examined by the GetMergeableValue function), while the other 2 parameters wouldn't be known until the user tries to perform the Merge on the two values. RMergeableValue is created after the execution of the computation graph from the information contained in the various action helpers in ""tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/ActionHelpers.hxx"".; RMergeableValue itself is a base class, with RMergeableGenericAction as the derived class that is mostly used to get the right information from the helpers, e.g. the value of the action and a function to merge two of those values. For specific actions that require more information, e.g. `Mean`, more derived classes can be created, e.g. `RMergeableMean`. The class instances are passed as void* up the call chain: ActionHelper-->RAction-->RActionBase-->ROOT::Detail::RDF::GetMergeableValue(); In the function they are `static_cast`ed back to their correct RMergeableValue<T>* type.

If the dot is _not_ at the; start of a path component (e.g., `LIBDIR=foo.libs`), then all is; fine. . So it seems that somewhere deep in the ROOT code, there is some; assumption about a dot (`.`) as the leading character of a; sub-directory name which shouldn't be there. As far as I can tell,; the dot makes the code think that the library loaded is the ROOT; executable (`<ROOTSYS>/bin/root.exe`) rather than the actual shared; library. The reason seems to be that, because of some bad stripping; of path components, the shared library isn't found by Cling and then; the binary image falls back to the executable binary image. . ## Why this is problematic . Many build tools (e.g., Autotools) uses temporary directories that; start with a dot (`.`), including for building examples and tests. The; current behaviour of ROOT prevents building production level packages; with these tools that has rigorous test suites and rich examples. .

Performance,"eInterpVar` and the `PiecewiseInterpolation` classes in; HistFactory can both interpolate asymmetric up-and-down variations; between the +/- one standard deviation such that both the first and; second derivatives of the scale factors are smooth. The `PiecewiseInterpolation` class is more general, because instead of; taking constant interpolation parameters, it takes other `RooAbsReals`.; That means it makes no sense for that class to cache the polynomial; coefficients that have to re recomputed anyway each time the input; changes. It uses an optimized formula to do the interpolation on the; fly. The `FlexibleInterpVar` however precomputes and caches the polynomial; coefficients. This has serveral disadvantages:. * High cost in memory (the big ATLAS models can have thousands of; `FlexibleInterpVars`. * It's inconsistent with the `PiecewiseInterpolation`, which should be; equivalent. * Most importantly, and this was the motivation for this PR now:; when we do the code generation for AD, we can't pre-compute cached; coefficients because it would bloat the generated code with constant; arrays. Computing on the fly is much more AD-friendly. Validation of the new `FlexibleInterpVar` values for `low=0.9` and; `high=1.2` that shows the interpolated values are agreeing to the 5e-4; level. This is completely accepatable for such an ad-hoc polynomial; motivation, where the shape is not given by any physical meaning anyway; but just by the continuity condition at the boundaries. And at the; boundaries (and `param=0`), the difference between both implementations; goes to zero. It was also checked that this change has no performance; effect on fitting the full ATLAS Higgs combination modes. ```txt; param ref new diff_abs diff_rel; 0 -1.00 0.9000000000 0.9000000000 0.0000000000 0.00E+00; 1 -0.95 0.9047424331 0.9047437816 0.0000013485 1.49E-06; 2 -0.85 0.9140836603 0.9141118876 0.0000282273 3.09E-05; 3 -0.75 0.9230659064 0.9231653329 0.0000994265 1.08E-04; 4 -0.65 0.9317147727 0.93",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13067:1033,cache,cached,1033,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13067,1,['cache'],['cached']

Performance,"eant to be treated like a TTree. Otherwise I would also have to say that RDF is meant to be treated like a CSV file or something similar. > there should be a function that allows us to merge them. If I have to think about this function you propose, I don't see it going much further than the example you already have above. Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; ```python; # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2). # creating new columns in the datasets; df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'). # Merging the datasets in memory; df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; df_3.Snapshot('tree', 'file.root'); ```. I admit that I might not be able to see some internal optimizations that RDF might do while merging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. ## Current possible approaches. If you need to process a dataset with RDF and need to concatenate parts of it, the current best approach is to use the `RDataFrame(TTree &tree)` constructor after having created the correct tree with all the information you need. If for example you need to concatenate vertically 2 or more TTrees (i.e. if all have the same schema with column",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927091065:1727,load,loading,1727,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927091065,1,['load'],['loading']

Performance,"ecks; the .gnu.hash section in ELF which is the GNU implementation of a bloom; filter and uses it. If the symbol is not in the bloom filter, the; implementation builds its own and uses it. The measured performance of the; bloom filter is 30% speed up for 2mb more memory. The custom bloom filter on; top of the .gnu.hash filter gives 1-2% better performance.; The advantage for the custom bloom filter is that it works on all; implementations which do not support .gnu.hash (windows and osx). It is also; customizable if we want to further reduce the false positive rates; (currently at p=2%).; * Hash table optimization -- we build a hash table which contains all symbols; for a given library. This allows us to avoid the fallback symbol iteration; if multiple symbols from the same library are requested.

Performance,"ed as integers.; Every state index also has a state name attached, but instead of storing; it in each row of the dataset, the mapping from state index to; state name is now stored in the category class. **For reviewers**:; Although there is a lot of noise, that's mostly getting rid of unnecessary classes. The user-facing interfaces are stable (to be proven by the fact that all the rest of RooFit still compiles, and that tutorials run).; This is the chance to modernise/improve the `RooCategory` interface. It would be nice if you could specifically look at `RooCategory.h`, maybe in conjunction with the modernised tutorial on how they can be used in the future:; https://github.com/hageboeck/root/blob/cleanupCategories/tutorials/roofit/rf404_categories.C. More details what happened:; - Replace RooCatType by an integer.; - Replace names saved in each instance of RooCatType by a map in; RooAbsCategory that maps state numbers to strings. This saves 64 bytes; + the size of TObject for each event, and makes loading strings in each; event unnecessary.; - Convert RooVectorDataStore from saving RooCatType to integers of; category states.; - With this, also reduce the amount of unnecessary members in RooVectorDataStore. - Provide new interfaces for categories to work without RooCatType.; - Prevent clearing of shapeDirty in RooAbsCategory::evaluate(), since; derived category classes might need to recompute their shapes if one; of their input categories change.; - Add function to define multiple category states at once with; initialiser lists. - Mark legacy interfaces exposing RooCatType as deprecated in doxygen.; - Stop including RooCatType when R__LESS_INCLUDES is set.; - Flag legacy interface with R__SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE.; - Create RooCatType instances on-demand in case users continue to use; the legacy interface. - Consolidate RooMultiCategory and RooSuperCategory. These share almost; all the code, so RooSuperCategory will now use a RooMultiCategory for; state definition and ret",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5219:1358,load,loading,1358,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5219,1,['load'],['loading']

The enum-based optimization which I introduced in commit [""Improve performance by allowing most of cling::Value to inline""](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11252/commits/fa74b5419c3120ab4b5130e53a1844c54dc467c4). Unfortunately it did not show any improvement for callfunc. It helps with inlining the `castAs` operation but that does not bring benefits. That's why I decided to revert it but keep it in the history if we want to apply it. I can further spend time in trying to optimize this but that might be at the cost of making it harder to understand and maintain. If that performance info is acceptable, I will play a bit with a couple of ideas I have and move forward as that's blocking lowering parts of CallFunc to cling standalone. fyi @Axel-Naumann",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11252#issuecomment-1252723800:7690,optimiz,optimization,7690,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11252#issuecomment-1252723800,4,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimization', 'optimize', 'performance']"

Performance,"eighted samples. It should be clarified both in the code documentation and in the user guide, if the implementation can handle weighted templates in the asymptotic limit, by applying the SPD approximation discussed by Bohm and Zech, 2014. This is possible (as we show in our paper https://inspirehep.net/literature/2512593), but only if the implementations handles this special case. Conway's paper does not discuss weighted templates and does not explain how to use the SPD approximation in this context. Long version:. The code documentation of RooBarlowBeestonLL on the master is incorrect. It is stated that this class implements the Barlow-Beeston likelihood computation, but it actually implements an approximation introduced by Conway in 2011. The approximation is only asymptotically equivalent to Barlow-Beeston, for small samples it is inferior. We recently published a paper about a new approximation to Barlow-Beeston (https://inspirehep.net/literature/2512593), which is fast to compute and can be used with weighted templates and weighted data. In this paper, we compare the performance of Barlow-Beeston and several approximations including ours. It is shown there, that Conway's approximation is inferior to the exact computation by Barlow-Beeston. I was pointed to this class by the LHCb collaboration. There is uncertainty in the community what this class actually computes and whether it is asymptotically correct for weighted templates. I kindly ask to correct and extend the documentation. **I think the best solution is to revert the implementation of BarlowBeestonLL to actually implement the original BarlowBeeston.** Then make a new class called ConwayLL which implements Conway's approximation. I am happy to provide another class which implements our method in ROOT. So far, the reference implementation is in the iminuit Python package. ### ROOT version.

Performance,"el 3 would enable the debug messages that are currently only available when the compiler flag DEBUG is defined. In my experience, trouble with minimizing some function is common so it would be a great asset to enable more debug output at anytime by just increasing the print level without recompiling ROOT. The DEBUG messages are particularly problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). ### Possible negative side-effects. #### Breaking changes?. This proposal does not change the output for print level 0, but there is a minor change for print level 1. It changes the output of scripts/software that uses print level 1, because previously level 1 meant ""print errors and info"" while in the new hierarchy it means ""print errors and warnings"". I think this is a minor effect, which has to be documented in the next changelog but it cannot cause backward incompatibilities or breakage. #### Reduced performance?. The impact on performance is expected to be negligible. I propose to place additional calls into the compiled code for everyone, but these calls are not executed unless the user picks a high print level. For a low print level, there is just the minor additional cost of a branch, which moreover can be predicted very well by the CPU, so the added cost should be almost zero. Furthermore, these branches do not happen in hot code paths. Hot paths are inside the cost function (which are unaffected) and in the linear algebra routines that Minuit2 uses (which are not instrumented with debug messages). ### Positive side-effects for wrappers and frontends. An important positive side effect for wrappers like iminuit is that we could show our users debug messages, too. Right now, we cannot, because DEBUG messages can only be enabled at compile-time, not at run-time. The DEBUG messages are also problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compil",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421:3144,perform,performance,3144,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"elevant, @sudo-panda ?. Hi @Axel-Naumann ,. I am really grateful to @vepadulano for investing his precious time in reviewing this PR and suggesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ). So unless ""we should never use `global`"" is a new convention being followed in ROOT, I believe it doesn't seem to track. 4. As seen in this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693392), Python used to differentiate between having a global statement or not. And even though the answer is more than ten years old, I experienced this firsthand when I started using Python (about four years b",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912:1242,cache,cache,1242,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912,1,['cache'],['cache']

I suspect the reason is because #785 in the following function:. https://github.com/zzxuanyuan/root/blob/15cceff19b48dfe4a4b0c69c1ec07ea75bd1ccb5/tree/tree/src/TTreeCacheUnzip.cxx#L708. CreateTasks() explicitly creates 2 tasks (empty_task and MappingTask; and set_ref_count(2) means 2 tasks in total). The scheduler might make a better decision here since it knows there will be only one task except empty_task running in future. On the other hand, TTaskGroup uses tbb::task_group which calls the following function:. https://github.com/01org/tbb/blob/b9805bacadd4d0474fd3358cf0c7153042ce50c3/include/tbb/task_group.h#L108. task_group_base() also first creates a empty_task. However, it only creates 1 task(itself) by setting reference count as 1 (set_ref_count(1)). When it invoke another task by calling . https://github.com/01org/tbb/blob/b9805bacadd4d0474fd3358cf0c7153042ce50c3/include/tbb/task_group.h#L103. allocate_additional_child() will create a new task as child and increment reference count by 1. I guess accumulating tasks on-the-fly might degrade the performance since the tbb scheduler could spend more time on finding tasks to work on. In a short, I think explicitly defining the total number of tasks and task graph should have better performance (more efficient for scheduler I guess) than adding more tasks to task_group as the program runs. There are two alternative approaches that might improve the performance. ; 1. Since we have already know we will only have one task (except empty_task) to add into the task_group, we could revise TTaskGroup interface and notify it what task is going to run in advance.; 2. We could get rid of TTaskGroup in my current implemention and synchronously map baskets to different tasks. If we do not mind a little performance drops, the current implementation should be fine.

Performance,"entation of; the full path to shared objects allowing search at constant time O(1). This; also fixes issues when resolving symbols from OSX where the system libraries; contain multiple levels of symlinks.; * Bloom filter optimization -- it uses a stohastic data structure which gives; a definitive answer if a symbol is not in the set. The implementation checks; the .gnu.hash section in ELF which is the GNU implementation of a bloom; filter and uses it. If the symbol is not in the bloom filter, the; implementation builds its own and uses it. The measured performance of the; bloom filter is 30% speed up for 2mb more memory. The custom bloom filter on; top of the .gnu.hash filter gives 1-2% better performance.; The advantage for the custom bloom filter is that it works on all; implementations which do not support .gnu.hash (windows and osx). It is also; customizable if we want to further reduce the false positive rates; (currently at p=2%).; * Hash table optimization -- we build a hash table which contains all symbols; for a given library. This allows us to avoid the fallback symbol iteration; if multiple symbols from the same library are requested. The hash table; optimization targets to optimize the case where the bloom filter tells us; the symbol is *maybe* in the library. Patch by Alexander Penev (@alexander-penev) and me!.

Performance,"er. I have made a new commit, which addresses your and @hageboeck's review comments as much as possible. Point by point, let me quickly explain what changed:. - ""Upgraded"" comments on new functionality to doxygen. I did not doxygen document everything, because most functionality was copy-pasted from the old RooMinimizerFcn. The new things are now documented though.; - Renamed snake_case to dromedary.; - Use unique_ptr for parameter lists, as suggested by Stephan.; - Remove a few obsolete __ROOFIT_NOROOMINIMIZER flags (I guess these are part of the merge conflicts).; - I realized that part of what I changed in PR #8596 could (and imho should) have been introduced here already. I moved functionality to RooAbsMinimizerFcn, namely storage of the to-be-minimized function and constant term optimization information, but did not yet remove it (in this PR) from RooMinimizer. Now it has been removed.; - While going over the above, I realized I had actually *completely* forgot to add back in a backwards compatible way of enabling offsetting for numerical precision! This has now been correctly added back in. Then, about what I did not change:. - I did not have time for doing the include reordering/optimization that @hageboeck suggested. I tried to quickly figure it out, but I couldn't change things fast enough and still be able to guarantee that everything will still work in the later PRs that build on this one. I agree it would be nice, but I hope we can postpone this to some future PR, perhaps after the other additions have been merged.; - As mentioned earlier, RooAbsMinimizerFcn is basically a way to reduce code duplication. This should be seen in light of RooGradMinimizerFcn as well (see again PR #8596) and will also be used for a later addition. I think removing all data members and also the protected vs private suggestion would complicate this goal. I think it's good to merge like this (after fixing the conflict of course), but let me know if you have further suggestions!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8569#issuecomment-875559598:1262,optimiz,optimization,1262,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8569#issuecomment-875559598,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

The snapshot test has 2 steps:. 1. Do the work, including a call to SnapshotImpl which contains the problem line, with only compiled code; 2. Do the same work relying on interpreted code, in which case SnapshotImpl is called via the interpreter. The symptoms of the failure is that **if** the snapshot test is compiled with optimization then. a. The compiled version works fine; b. In the interpreted version the constructor of the RInterface is wrong because the shared_ptr its constructor sees is **not** initialized. If the snapshot test is compiled without optimization then both steps succeeds.

Performance,"es/5286101/mwe.tar.gz). The gist is that the event here is a simple class: ; ```. #ifndef _mwe_event_h; #define _mwe_event_h. #include ""TObject.h"" ; #include <array>. class MWEEvent ; {. public: ; MWEEvent() { iev =-1; bar=-1; foo[0] =-1; foo[1]=-1; } . // workaround for not being able to access foo directly ; double get_foo(int i) const { return foo[i]; } . int iev; ; double bar; ; double foo[2]; ; virtual ~MWEEvent() { ; } . ClassDef(MWEEvent,1);; }; ; ```. A tree of these objects can be read with PyROOT fine if only the scalar members are touched, or the getter is used:. ```; import ROOT . ROOT.gSystem.Load(""build/libmwe.so"") . f = ROOT.TFile(""out.root""); ; t = f.Get(""tree""); . ev = ROOT.MWEEvent() . t.SetBranchAddress(""event"",ev) . for i in range(10): ; t.GetEntry(i); ; print (ev.iev) ; print (ev.bar) ; print (ev.get_foo(0)); print (ev.get_foo(1)); ```. But if you try to access the array member directly (as used to work), it does not work:; ```; import ROOT . ROOT.gSystem.Load(""build/libmwe.so"") . f = ROOT.TFile(""out.root""); ; t = f.Get(""tree""); . ev = ROOT.MWEEvent() . t.SetBranchAddress(""event"",ev) . for i in range(10): ; t.GetEntry(i); ; print (ev.iev) ; print (ev.bar) ; print (ev.foo[0]); print (ev.foo[1]). ```.

Performance,"estore/recompute these values. A temporary fix was introduced for now in FairRoot, which is to simply do the recompute for all TGeoVolumeAssembly in the geometry tree, which seems to be fast enough that we do not have to try to track affected Volumes to be more selective. ; This may however not be the case later when applied to complete geometries for experiments like CBM. ### To Reproduce; Steps to reproduce the behavior with the attached files (includes ""ROOT-only"" examples both for problem and for macro-level fix):; 1. Compile a copy of ROOT 6.22.08 (done with FairSoft apr21p2 and FairRoot v18.6.7, should work with any older versions of each and with recent versions of FairRoot, as well as with a standalone version of ROOT); 1. Download [BboxAlignPb_example_2023_02_07.zip](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/10674368/BboxAlignPb_example_2023_02_07.zip) and unzip the macro, the standard container dictionary header and the two root files in a folder; 1. Go to this folder, load your ROOT environment; 1. Run; ```; root -l -b; root [0] .L alignment_map_def.h+; root [1] .x BboxAlignBug.C(""mcbm_beam_2022_05_23_nickel.geo.root"", ""AlignmentMatrices_mcbm_beam_2022_05_23_nickel.root""); ```; Of the 3 transformations visible in the printout; - Two are applied to TGeoVolumeAssembly objects and lead to these assembly having zero size bounding boxes (`/cave_1/sts_v22e_mcbm_0` and `/cave_1/sts_v22e_mcbm_0/Station01_1`); - One is applied to a Node and leads to 2 TGeoVolumeAssembly higher in the hierarchy to have zero size bounding boxes (`/cave_1/sts_v22e_mcbm_0/Station02_2/Ladder10_2/HalfLadder10d_2/HalfLadder10d_Module04_2`); <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1.

Performance,"f your local storage.; N.B. If no '--threads' argument was provided this is 1, otherwise it is the minimum of the value provided and the number of threads your CPU can run in parallel. It is worth noting that - on shared systems or if running other heavy applications - the number of your own threads running at any time may be lower than the limit due to demand on the CPU. 3. The 'Real Time' is similar to 'CPU Time / number of threads' AND 'Compressed Throughput' is lower than expected for your storage medium:; This would imply that your CPU threads aren't decompressing data as fast as your storage medium can provide it, and so decompression is the bottleneck. The best way to decrease your runtime would be to utilise a system with a faster CPU, or make use use of more threads when running, or use a compression algorithm with a higher decompression rate such as LZ4, possibly at the cost of some extra file size. A note on caching:. If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache - consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed. On Linux this can be done by running `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` as a superuser or a specific file can be dropped from the cache with `dd of=<FILENAME> oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0 > /dev/null 2>&1`. Known overhead of TTreeReader, RDataFrame:. rootreadspeed is designed to read all data present in the specified branches, trees and files at the highest possible speed. When the application bottleneck is not in the computations performed by analysis logic, higher-level interfaces built on top of TTree such as TTreeReader and RDataFrame are known to add a significant runtime overhead with respect to the runtimes reported by rootreadspeed (up to a factor 2).

When it crashes, `nbig` is `-1`, and resize() expects and unsigned int. The -1 becomes a very large unsigned number that exceeds the maximum allowed length of a `std::string`. To me that looks more like a problem with IO than with HistFactory (the memory layout of the `HistFactory::Measurement` classes hasn't changed from 6.26 to 6.28. Is that something that makes sense to you, @pcanal? What does this `nbig` stand for, and in which circumstances can this be `-1`?.

Performance,"finally working. This patch enables ROOT to preload all modules at startup time. In my; environment, this patch fixes 14 tests for runtime cxxmodules. Preloading all the modules has several advantages. 1. We do not have to; rely on rootmap files which don't support some features (namespaces and; templates) 2. Lookup would be faster because we don't have to do; trampoline via rootmap files. The only disadvantage of preloading all the modules is the startup time performance.; `root.exe -q -l memory.C`; This is a release build without modules:; ```; cpu time = 0.091694 seconds; sys time = 0.026187 seconds; res memory = 133.008 Mbytes; vir memory = 217.742 Mbytes; ```; This is a release build with modules, with this patch:; ```; cpu time = 0.234134 seconds; sys time = 0.066774 seconds; res memory = 275.301 Mbytes; vir memory = 491.832 Mbytes; ```; As you can see, preloading all the modules makes both time and memory 2; to 3 times worse **at a startup time**. **Edit** : With hsimple.C; `root.exe -l -b tutorials/hsimple.C -q ~/CERN/ROOT/memory.C`; Release build without modules:; ```; Processing tutorials/hsimple.C... ; hsimple : Real Time = 0.04 seconds Cpu Time = 0.05 seconds ; (TFile *) 0x555ae2a9d560 ; Processing /home/yuka/CERN/ROOT/memory.C... ; cpu time = 0.173591 seconds ; sys time = 0.011835 seconds ; res memory = 135.32 Mbytes ; vir memory = 209.664 Mbytes ; ```; Release build with modules, with this patch:; ```; Processing tutorials/hsimple.C...; hsimple : Real Time = 0.04 seconds Cpu Time = 0.04 seconds; (TFile *) 0x55d1b036d230; Processing /home/yuka/CERN/ROOT/memory.C...; cpu time = 0.290742 seconds; sys time = 0.043851 seconds; res memory = 256.844 Mbytes; vir memory = 438.484 Mbytes; ```. However, it is a matter of course that we get slower startup time if we; try to load all the modules at startup time, not on-demand. I haven't had a good benchmark for this but, in theory, it reduces execution time instead as we're anyway loading modules after the startup.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1814:2019,load,load,2019,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1814,2,['load'],"['load', 'loading']"

I don't understand why though, the annotations inside the functions make no sense to me (showing more than 50% on a ` mov %ebx,%r8d` without something obvious around it). yeah, this is a bit tricky, the profiler is useful if you built in debug mode. What usually works is removing the `DynamicLibraryManagerSymbol.cpp.o` and copying the build command, changing it to clang and adding [a variation of] `-Rpass=inline -Rpass-missed=.*` (https://godbolt.org/z/xGEsGhf97). Then you can compare old and the new version for missed optimization opportunities.

Performance,"fixes #7584 . This PR shows a possible refactor of the logic that finally creates the ranges to send to the distributed resources. It works in the following steps:; 1. Split the big HeadNode class in differente head node types according to the original data source (e.g. EntriesHeadNode, TreeHeadNode, in the future also RNTupleHeadNode). Use a factory to get the correct head node type according to user provided arguments to the RDataFrame constructor; 2. Create a different Range type per each head node type. This makes the passing of information more modular, allowing sending only a couple of integers in the case of empty RDF , or adding info about friend trees in the case of a tree based RDF; 3. Better support friends with the recently introduced `ROOT::Internal::TreeUtils` functions; 4. NEW: Cache the created `Range`s for reuse in the same python session. This still doesn't improve the initial startup time discussed in #8232",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8391:804,Cache,Cache,804,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8391,1,['Cache'],['Cache']

Performance,"for good measure:. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time, so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator), so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ ( ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so"" provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""... ; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1. The lookup for ""f"" finds and runs the materia",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382:1124,load,load,1124,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"g at any time may be lower than the limit due to demand on the CPU. 3. The 'Real Time' is similar to 'CPU Time / number of threads' AND 'Compressed Throughput' is lower than expected for your storage medium:; This would imply that your CPU threads aren't decompressing data as fast as your storage medium can provide it, and so decompression is the bottleneck. The best way to decrease your runtime would be to utilise a system with a faster CPU, or make use use of more threads when running, or use a compression algorithm with a higher decompression rate such as LZ4, possibly at the cost of some extra file size. A note on caching:. If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache - consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed. On Linux this can be done by running `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` as a superuser or a specific file can be dropped from the cache with `dd of=<FILENAME> oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0 > /dev/null 2>&1`. Known overhead of TTreeReader, RDataFrame:. rootreadspeed is designed to read all data present in the specified branches, trees and files at the highest possible speed. When the application bottleneck is not in the computations performed by analysis logic, higher-level interfaces built on top of TTree such as TTreeReader and RDataFrame are known to add a significant runtime overhead with respect to the runtimes reported by rootreadspeed (up to a factor 2). In realistic analysis applications it has been observed that a large part of that overhead is compensated by the ability of TTreeReader and RDataFrame to read branch values selectively, based on event cuts, and this overhead will be reduced significantly when using RDataFrame in conjunction with RNTuple.; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039:5664,cache,cache,5664,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039,3,"['bottleneck', 'cache', 'perform']","['bottleneck', 'cache', 'performed']"

Performance,"g two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; ```python; # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2). # creating new columns in the datasets; df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'). # Merging the datasets in memory; df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; df_3.Snapshot('tree', 'file.root'); ```. I admit that I might not be able to see some internal optimizations that RDF might do while merging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. ## Current possible approaches. If you need to process a dataset with RDF and need to concatenate parts of it, the current best approach is to use the `RDataFrame(TTree &tree)` constructor after having created the correct tree with all the information you need. If for example you need to concatenate vertically 2 or more TTrees (i.e. if all have the same schema with column `a` and you want to append values of the same column into a single entity), than you can create a TChain and add all the trees to it. If you need horizontal concatenation (i.e. the trees have different schema but same number of entries) you can use friends pattern (e.g. `tree.AddFriend`). This has the big advantage that you don't need to merge any of the files/trees together and thus you also don't need to save them again before creating the RDF object. At the same time, once you do create the",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927091065:2178,optimiz,optimizations,2178,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927091065,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

Performance,"ge_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-891036930): I didn't generalize TRangeDynCast and TRangeStaticCast. They are tied to TCollection and fulfill a different purpose because of that. They are also part of `ROOT::Internal`, while my new functions are supposed to be also used by the RooFit users. I would suggest we leave them as they are, but if you think the new `static_range_cast` and `dynamic_range_cast` are useful for everyone we can move the new file if you want. But where?. I was already expecting that it would be difficult to adapt those, but there will be ways to adapt them. I think it would be *better* if there's one good solution for all, but you have to decide how much time you want to invest. > 2. [[RF] New RangeCast file with dynamic_range_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#discussion_r680892053): I didn't add the `assert(dynamic_cast)` to the `static_range_cast` because the performance penalty it introduces in debug mode is not probably not expected by non-RooFit developers. There's not many loops out there in the world that will depend on this. If somebody uses it, they might be glad to have the extra safety. About the performance:; - When you run from the interpreter, you don't care about the performance of your loop as much.; - When you compile, you probably know what `NDEBUG` is.; - When you ACLIC-compile, I would have hoped that you get an automatic `NDEBUG` in release builds of ROOT, or when you `+O` a file. You don't, unfortunately. My preferred solution would have been to fix that and use the asserts, but it's your project now. > 3.

Performance,"gesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ). So unless ""we should never use `global`"" is a new convention being followed in ROOT, I believe it doesn't seem to track. 4. As seen in this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693392), Python used to differentiate between having a global statement or not. And even though the answer is more than ten years old, I experienced this firsthand when I started using Python (about four years back). So even though Python changed how it treats the variable binding in the newer versions, I would say it doesn't harm us by keeping them",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912:1356,cache,cache,1356,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912,1,['cache'],['cache']

Performance,"guess the behavior of TTaskGroup should mimic what TThreadExecutor does, e.g. it should use the task arena if it exists, and it should construct one if it doesn't. What's the rationale for doing things independently of ROOT's task arena? Does this mean users might see more cores used than they expect in some cases?. I believe this change only removes an unnecessary restriction on when `TTaskGroup` can be used (i.e. after looking through the implementation, I don't think having IMT globally enabled is a precondition for the use of `TTaskGroup` and test benchmarks using this implementation seem to perform the same). > 2. Are you ok with silently do nothing if R__IMT is undefined? Would it be better to print a warning?. Thank you, yes, a warning would probably be better. > 3. Can we also have a way to disable RNTuple's multi-threading even if implicit MT is enabled, like TTree has?. Yes, this makes sense to me. It will probably need a big warning in the docs about when to call it and/or some graceful shutdown logic. Even if this PR doesn't make it that method might be valuable by itself. > the rationale behind my question is that we should not have N different multi-threading behaviors for N components. I completely agree, it is very nice to be able to say ""if you want multithreading, call `EnableImplicitMT` and you're done"". > and we should play well with the TBB settings of frameworks such as CMSSW, but it's not clear to me how we do that now, actually.

Performance,"hDegree(x, std::log(low), std::log(high), std::log(nominal), boundary));; return total * interpolate6thDegree(x, low, high, nominal, boundary);; ```. This (together with using the old code as commented out above) indeed gets rid of the `nan`!. **I think the crucial part is that the old code checks for `high <= 0` and also `low <= 0`.**. Indeed, I traced the `nan` there: the sequence of events in this failing example is that `high` is zero, so that `std::log(high)` is `-inf`. Then `eps_plus` is also `-inf` and so `S` and `A` too, so you `-inf` times something negative (`t` happens to be negative in this example) so the term becomes `+inf` and eventually you get a `-inf + inf` and that equals `nan`. So, there's at least two options to fix this, both will need some conditionals added in again. 1. Going back to the original algorithm. If I understand the commit message of that change correctly, it was mostly removed because it required cached variables. As I rewrote the algorithm above, no more cached variables are necessary. Of course, it does involve more temporary values than the new algorithm, so perhaps this is another reason to pick the new algorithm.; 2. Adding similar `<= 0` checks to the new algorithm. I think this should take place at the call site, because it doesn't make sense for the other `interpolate6thDegree` usecase where no weird values are expected from logarithms. By the way, why is the interpolation taking place in logarithmic space instead of regular linear space and then transformed back into linear space after interpolation? Doesn't this also mean that the two interpolation schemes (FlexibleInterpVar and PiecewiseInterpolation) are again inconsistent? If the logarithm can be eliminated, I think we can do without introducing conditionals, no? That is, assuming the high and low vectors are filled sensibly, which is not checked anywhere as far as I can see, so that's still a minor weakness, but I guess that could easily be added in the documentation",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427:1166,cache,cached,1166,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427,1,['cache'],['cached']

Performance,"hine with a more performant CPU. The best way to decrease the runtime would be to optimize your code (or the framework's), parallelize it onto multiple threads if possible (for example with RDataFrame and EnableImplicitMT) or switch to a machine with a more performant CPU. 2. The 'Real Time' is significantly higher than 'CPU Time / number of threads'.; If the real time is higher than the CPU time per core it implies the reading of data is the bottleneck, as the CPU cores are wasting time waiting for data to arrive from your disk/drive or network connection in order to decompress it. The best way to decrease your runtime would be transferring the data you need onto a faster storage medium (i.e. a faster disk/drive such as an SSD, or connecting to a faster network for remote file access), or to use a compression algorithm with a higher compression ratio, possibly at the cost of the decompression rate. Changing the number of threads is unlikely to help, and in fact using too many threads may degrade performance if they make requests to different regions of your local storage.; N.B. If no '--threads' argument was provided this is 1, otherwise it is the minimum of the value provided and the number of threads your CPU can run in parallel. It is worth noting that - on shared systems or if running other heavy applications - the number of your own threads running at any time may be lower than the limit due to demand on the CPU. 3. The 'Real Time' is similar to 'CPU Time / number of threads' AND 'Compressed Throughput' is lower than expected for your storage medium:; This would imply that your CPU threads aren't decompressing data as fast as your storage medium can provide it, and so decompression is the bottleneck. The best way to decrease your runtime would be to utilise a system with a faster CPU, or make use use of more threads when running, or use a compression algorithm with a higher decompression rate such as LZ4, possibly at the cost of some extra file size.

This kind of warning is apparently common in Python unittests that use socket, both with [pyspark](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49361286/unittesting-with-pyspark-unclosed-socket-warnings) and [others](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14938716/socket-resourcewarning-using-urllib-in-python-3). The reason they are shown is that in Python3 the unittest module has been updated to use the ""default"" level of warnings filters, as mentioned [in the docs](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/warnings.html#updating-code-for-new-versions-of-python). For the particular case of `pyspark`, these warnings are actually present in any application that uses the same ""default"" level:; ```py; $: cat sparktest.py ; import pyspark; import warnings. warnings.simplefilter(""default"", ResourceWarning). sc = pyspark.SparkContext.getOrCreate(). sc.parallelize([1,2,3,4,5]).map(lambda x: 1).reduce(lambda x,y: x+y); ```. ```bash; $: python sparktest.py ; 21/08/30 11:04:59 WARN NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable; Using Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j-defaults.properties; Setting default log level to ""WARN"".; To adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).

Upstream Clang has supported this scenario (with a suppressible warning) since Clang 10.0.0 shipped on 2020-03-24. Example on Compiler Explorer: https://godbolt.org/z/a75ooK6cz. The comment in `CIFactory.cpp` indicates that this was a known issue (although I was unable to find anything filed in GitHub or Jira) - is ROOT planning to upgrade its Clang/LLVM dependency, which would resolve this?. ### To Reproduce; Build ROOT with the latest MSVC STL from https://github.com/microsoft/STL, or wait for VS 2022 17.4 Preview 1 to ship (we can't provide an ETA yet, but it'll be some time). ### Setup; 1. ROOT version: `master`; 2. Operating system: Windows 11; 3. How you obtained ROOT: Built it ourselves (or tried to). ### Additional context; Su",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10875:1836,load,loading,1836,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10875,1,['load'],['loading']

Performance,"ike a TTree. Otherwise I would also have to say that RDF is meant to be treated like a CSV file or something similar. I did not refer to the documentation but to how people would actually use this class. 99% of people do not read CSV files with ROOT and `RDataFrame` will be mostly used to interact in a simple and quick way with trees. > ; > > there should be a function that allows us to merge them; > ; > If I have to think about this function you propose, I don't see it going much further than the example you already have above. Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; > ; > ```python; > # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; > df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); > df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2); > ; > # creating new columns in the datasets; > df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); > df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'); > ; > # Merging the datasets in memory; > df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); > # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; > df_3.Snapshot('tree', 'file.root'); > ```; > ; > I admit that I might not be able to see some internal optimizations that RDF might do while merging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. No, the approaches are different. In the approach without `RDataFrame::Merge` I save twice the modified trees with the new",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927331768:1655,load,loading,1655,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927331768,1,['load'],['loading']

Performance,"in Defines and Filters.; When dealing with very large computation graphs with many Define/Filter; transformations defined with jitted strings, the time for matching; column names to strings was non negligible. The previous mechanism to discover the columns present in the strings; to be jitted was based on regular expressions. The new approach is based; on a lexer, lexertk. The idea is to extract identifiers from; the string and then compare them with the column names available; in the DF.; This pr is an extreme version of this performance improvement: https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3320.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3324:533,perform,performance,533,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3324,1,['perform'],['performance']

To validate the performance, I ran the [Python tests in roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest/tree/master/python) and the [PyROOT pythonization tests](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/pyroot/pythonizations/test) and compared runtimes with and without the cppyy upgrade. The total runtime of these tests reduced by about 4 % from 208 s to 287 s, so the performance impact of this PR is marginal. The runtime comparison for each test can be found in [cppyy_upgrade_test_runtimes.txt](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/14623432/cppyy_upgrade_test_runtimes.txt).; The worst observed performance penalty is 24 %. However, significant speedups are observed in some of the longer tests.

Performance,"itZMQ_HWM; 4. test_RooFitZMQ_load_balancing; 4. RooFitCore:; 1. testRooGradMinimizer; 2. testBidirMMapPipe; 3. testMPFEnll. From my side (and that of the NL eScience Center), the project has ended and time has run out to make any further major contributions to it, except, of course finishing this PR and providing help to get it working and to possibly hand over further development :). Here are some notes for possible future work:; - RooFitZMQ includes an extension of ZeroMQ itself: a ppoll function. This function should ideally be contributed to ZeroMQ, but I have had no time for this. The motivation behind ppoll is given in this [blog post](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/combining-zeromq-posix-signals-b754f6f29cd6).; - At the last moment, I decided to reimplement part of the Queue functionality. The task distribution and parameter updating functionalities are now done directly using appropriate ZeroMQ sockets instead of indirectly through the Queue. The old-style Queue functionality, however, has not been cleaned up yet. Doing so will clean up the ""plumbing"" of the MultiProcess functions quite a bit.; - Benchmarking and optimization still has to be done for this version as well. The scaling results of the proof of concept (see references above) should be reproducible with this reimplementation, but this possibly still needs some tuning.; - After the most recent merging in of master, the RooGradMinimizer tests no longer pass, because the numbers are no longer floating point exactly the same. We have not looked into why, but one possible source is the reworked Kahan summation class. This was applied in RooMinimizerFcn, but not yet in our external-gradient classes.; - The proof-of-concept version classes are also still present in the source tree (`roofitcore/MultiProcess`), but have only been partially maintained since we started with the final version.

Performance,"ith RTLD_DEEPBIND. (By design, RTLD_DEEPBIND links to libstdc++ first before checking the global namespace, so it does not see the copy-relocated symbol.). I am not a huge fan of the `RTLD_DEEPBIND` approach because it is not portable and it essentially overrides the dynamic linker behavior yet one more time. I am not sure how this would translate to Windows for example. > ; > ; > The problem can be avoided if executables are compiled with -fPIC as well.; > I just tried locally to compile the failing ROOT ctests with -fPIC and this fixed the segmentation faults.; > The question is whether this is a proper solution, since it would require to compile all executables with -fPIC. On the other hand, I don't know how to fix this in another way. Perhaps this could be enabled via a special CMake option for ROOT, which enables RTLD_DEEPBIND for libCling and -fPIC for all executables. IIUC, `RTLD_DEEPBIND` alters the search order of the dynamic linker and using -fPIC intends to deduplicate. That seems as bad as preloading a set of llvm dependent libraries, IMO. Do we need `libgandiva.so` to be compiled with -fPIC or just the executables which 'use' ROOT?. > @vgvassilev : I do not see how I could control this.; > https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/core/base/src/TROOT.cxx#L2037 states that InitInterpreter() should be called after main(). Therefore, as we link to libgandiva, which links to llvm libs, the system LLVM symbols will always be in the global namespace by design. They are loaded before main(), while InitInterpreter() loads libCling only after main(). This check is to protect the subsequent `dlsyms` in TCling to resolve symbols from the wrong place. We can fix the check and play with the JIT resolution logic by playing with the search order here: https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/39630b7530771be3e4643048361886dcfb057f07/interpreter/cling/lib/Interpreter/IncrementalJIT.cpp#L299-L302.

Performance,"iz/libcmaes), a novel high performance C++11 (with Python bindings) library for blackbox optimization. The new minimizer yields better results than Minuit2 for most problems, though for an higher computation cost on average. See below for links to relevant benchmarks backing up these claims. This implementation is on behalf of [Inria Saclay Research group TAO](http://www.inria.fr/en/teams/tao), [Laboratoire de l'Accelerateur Lineaire, group AppStat](http://appstat.lal.in2p3.fr/) and [University Paris-Sud LRI](https://www.lri.fr/index_en.php?lang=EN). ===Features===; - Seamless replacement for Minuit, Minuit2 and Fumili; - Seamless support for RooFit; - Relying on libcmaes allows for best performances known for CMA-ES + access to several flavors of the original algorithm, yielding best results with a trade off for computational cost, as needed; - Compilation support for both Autotools and CMake; - Included tutorial files, tests, and a special benchmark vs Minuit2. ===Documentation===; - Main documentation for building and using the new minimizer is here: https://github.com/beniz/libcmaes/wiki/using-CMA-ES-in-CERN's-ROOT. ===Performances===; - On-par with Minuit2 on low dimensional problems (< 10-D), consistently beats Minuit2 in higher dimension, leading to better fits. These claims are backed by two benchmarks and two experiments on real world data (we are still waiting from some results from usage at CERN); - Benchmark CMA-ES vs Minuit on [BBOB](http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=bbob-2013) available here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3J1vWYhta9ibktXc2JLRUExUTA&authuser=0; - In-ROOT benchmark vs Minuit2 on low-dimensional problems, results available here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3J1vWYhta9iTmR0T0hnN21lSGM&authuser=0; - Beats out Minuit2 up to 98% of the time on some experiments (data + code available on demand from Auger group, ask me).

Performance,"ked for duplicates. ### Description. [df106_HiggsToFourLeptons.C](https://root.cern/doc/master/df106__HiggsToFourLeptons_8C.html) crashes when it is compiled and run (it runs fine if interpreted).; This is due to jitted code in some filters that call user-defined functions whose signature is unknown to Cling. This is a general problem with functions that evaluate code at runtime and, while it might not be possible to fix in all cases, it should at least be better documented. The tutorials themselves should be written to work both when compiled and when interpreted, or specify why they cannot be run as-is if compiled. There is also a more general discussion to be made about RDF and the kind of guarantees that it should provide to its users. Ideally there should be a way to use RDF such that it will be guaranteed to run correctly regardless of being compiled or interpreted. Finally, the documentation of RDF should be updated to better clarify the caveats and limitations of passing C++ expressions as strings, both in terms of performance and, especially, in terms of compatibility with compiled code (i.e. it should be clear to a user that a filter using an interpreted string containing a user-defined function may not work when AOT-compiled without additional efforts on the user side - like manually passing the signatures to cling beforehand). ### Bullet point recap; - [ ] fix the tutorials so they run properly when compiled AOT; - [ ] update the doc of RDF to include caveats and limitations of using jitted expressions; - [ ] (to be discussed) introduce an opt-in ""strict mode"" for RDF (C++ only) that checks and rejects all cases when jitting is required. This would allow a user to catch code that may incur in performance penalties and may not work properly when AOT-compiled. . ### Reproducer. 1. download the source code of [this tutorial](https://root.cern/doc/master/df106__HiggsToFourLeptons_8C.html); 2. compile it; 3. run it. ### ROOT version. 6.33.01. ### Installation",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15638:1077,perform,performance,1077,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15638,1,['perform'],['performance']

If you find one, you are very welcome to add to the existing report, for instance ""issue still exists in today's master"".; -->. ### Describe the bug. This issue report follows my post in the ROOT forums https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/gdml-multiple-files-error-with-define/48581. Please refer to the forum post for additional details. In summary, when using the GDML modules feature as described on the manual (or so I think), the `<define/>` section of the child file is not being accessed correctly when the volume is a tessellated solid. This does not happen with a simple volume such as a box. On top of that I have managed to load the problematic GDML into Geant4 without problems, so that lead me to believe it is a ROOT bug. ### Expected behavior. Geometry should load without throwing an exception. ### To Reproduce.

Performance,"l (allowing a ""builtin_lz4"" option in CMake analogous to ""builtin_lzma""). I am unable to test this on Windows currently. The LZ4 algorithm focuses on decompression speed while sacrificing compression ratio. Compression level < 4 uses the ""LZ4 compression"" algorithm while compression level >= 4 uses ""LZ4HC"" (HC = high compression) variant. LZ4HC is comparable to zlib in speeds, but has approximately 20% larger file size. To evaluate, I use the Event executable in the test/ directory. I extend this to allow the compression algorithm be specified via CLI. Example invocation:. time ./Event 4000 6 99 1 1000 4; time ./Event 4000 4 99 0 1000 4. Here, the CLI arguments are:; - 1: Number of events (4000); - 2: Compression ratio (6); - 3: Split level (99); - 4: 1 for write, 0 for read.; - 5: Number of tracks per event (1000).; - 6: Compression algorithm (1 = zlib, 2 = lzma, 4 = lz4. 3 is the deprecated zlib-like algorithm). I extended MainEvent.cxx to include TTreePerfStats information, which gives us access to the compression-time-only rates. Performance results (testing on a 2.6GHz Intel Westmere E56xx-based VM) summary:. LZ4HC compression:; - File size: 231MB; - 14.7MB/s CPU time for writing. ZLIB level-6 compression:; - File size: 189MB; - 10.5MB/s CPU time for writing.; Summary: LZ4HC compression resulted in a file 20% larger. Compression time was 44% faster. LZMA level-6 compression:; - File size: 163MB; - .62MB/s CPU time for writing.; Summary: LZMA compression resulted in a file 13% smaller. Compression time was 16x slower than ZLIB level-6. LZ4 decompression:; - 233MB/s CPU time for decompression only.; - 189MB/s CPU time for reading. ZLIB decompression:; - 118MB/s CPU time for decompression only; - 104MB/s CPU time for reading.; Summary: LZ4 decompression was 97% faster, resulting in 81% faster reading for this case. LZMA decompression:; - 15.4MB/s CPU time for decompression only; - 14.7MB/s CPU time for reading.; Summary: LZMA decompression was 7x slower than zlib.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/59:1216,Perform,Performance,1216,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/59,1,['Perform'],['Performance']

The fit converges. ### To Reproduce. We have our demo fitter publicly available at: https://github.com/umd-lhcb/histfactory-fitter-demo/tree/dev. The `dev` branch contains our latest development. The baseline fit was performed with `make fit-noshapes` so all shape variations are turned off. ### Setup. 1. ROOT version: 6.28.02; 2. Operating system: NixOS (Linux) with `gcc12`; 3. How you obtained ROOT, such as `dnf install` / binary download / you built it yourself. We build our self with the help of `nix`. ### Additional information. We noticed that newer ROOT started to use `RooBinWidthFunction` to support histogram templates with arbitrary binning scheme:. https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/dc65afe00ec72d18ebc5d31e7b2d6b50c6a20423#diff-42ea09980f1ed2bacde4381f212c35d78be6ddedccf746953dc99d6455525d8aL1256-R1221. Maybe there's a bug when introducing `RooBinWidthFunction`?.

Performance,"lly grateful to @vepadulano for investing his precious time in reviewing this PR and suggesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ). So unless ""we should never use `global`"" is a new convention being followed in ROOT, I believe it doesn't seem to track. 4. As seen in this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693392), Python used to differentiate between having a global statement or not. And even though the answer is more than ten years old, I experienced this firsthand when I started using Python (about four years back). So even though Python changed how it treats the",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912:1329,cache,cache,1329,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912,1,['cache'],['cache']

Right now, `ESysConstants::kItimerResolution` is not assignable at runtime, and `TThreadTimer` timeout is not configurable by the user, thus the only solution is a fork and recompile. ### To Reproduce. 1. cd /opt/ && git clone https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11; 2.

Performance,"luding decompression time) in the uncompressed and compressed cases. Interpreting results:. There are three possible scenarios when using rootreadspeed, namely:. 1. The 'Real Time' is significantly lower than your own analysis runtime.; This would imply your actual application code is dominating the runtime of your analysis, ie. your analysis logic or framework is taking up the time. The best way to decrease the runtime would be to optimize your code, attempt to parallelize it onto multiple threads if possible, or use a machine with a more performant CPU. The best way to decrease the runtime would be to optimize your code (or the framework's), parallelize it onto multiple threads if possible (for example with RDataFrame and EnableImplicitMT) or switch to a machine with a more performant CPU. 2. The 'Real Time' is significantly higher than 'CPU Time / number of threads'.; If the real time is higher than the CPU time per core it implies the reading of data is the bottleneck, as the CPU cores are wasting time waiting for data to arrive from your disk/drive or network connection in order to decompress it. The best way to decrease your runtime would be transferring the data you need onto a faster storage medium (i.e. a faster disk/drive such as an SSD, or connecting to a faster network for remote file access), or to use a compression algorithm with a higher compression ratio, possibly at the cost of the decompression rate. Changing the number of threads is unlikely to help, and in fact using too many threads may degrade performance if they make requests to different regions of your local storage.; N.B. If no '--threads' argument was provided this is 1, otherwise it is the minimum of the value provided and the number of threads your CPU can run in parallel. It is worth noting that - on shared systems or if running other heavy applications - the number of your own threads running at any time may be lower than the limit due to demand on the CPU. 3.

Performance,"ly, there is no safeguard to prevent new commits from introducing new errors, which is prone to happen, as not everyone is familiar with the doxygen syntax. To maintain in a sustainable way the 'clean status' of the reference guide and online documentation, it would be helpful to add an automation script that compiles the documentation only with the files modified in the Pull Request to be merged, in the same way that a bot checks now about clang-format, etc. Because Doxygen can be configured to have only one input file, this extra check will not involve much time as compared to building the whole documentation. Then, it could be checked whether no warnings are produced by the 'touched' files. ### Optional: share how it could be improved; - [ ] The Github action or CI script should modify the -DDOCU_INPUT CMake flag to only add those touched by the Pull Request; - [x] The INCLUDE_PATH in the Doxyfile should be extended (for good, not just in the script) to all possible include folders, as you might touch a 'source file', but would get a bunch of warnings if Doxygen does not find the corresponding include path. (This is not the case in the full build, as the include files are also part of the INPUT, but wouldn't be the case if we just 'touch' the sources in the PR).; - [ ] The WARN_LOGFILE (-DDOCU_LOGFILE in cmake) should be set by the CI script to a useful filename. If the file is empty after running doxygen, the Test passes.; - [ ] Optional: HAVE_DOT, listLibs, etc. could be set to NO in case a speedup is wanted.; - [ ] Potentially hook it also up with spell-checking checks, see https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell; - [ ] Alternative approach suggested by albert-github to avoid missing references: use the overnight tag file from https://root.cern/reference/ with the pull request update test; - [ ] https://github.com/root-project/jenkins-pipelines/issues/10 jenkins parsing log fine-tune. ### Additional context; See https://root.cern/for_developers/doxygen/",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9953:2155,tune,tune,2155,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9953,1,['tune'],['tune']

This allows us to run Python code in wrapped C++ workflow, e.g. for `RDataFrame`:. ```python; import ROOT; import numpy. @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""unsigned int""], ""float""); def func(x):; return numpy.power(x, 2). df = ROOT.RDataFrame(4).Define(""x"", ""rdfentry_"").Define(""y"", ""PyROOT::func(x)""); npy = df.AsNumpy(); print(npy[""x""]) # Prints [0, 1, 2, 3]; print(npy[""y""]) # Prints [0.0, 1.0, 4.0, 9.0]; ```. Finally, the approach is fully compatible with any custom C++ types you may have. ```python; import ROOT. ROOT.gInterpreter.Declare(""""""; struct Foo {; static const int foo = 42;; };; """"""). @ROOT.DeclareCppCallable([""Foo""], """"); def func(x):; print(x.foo). ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine(""Foo x; PyROOT::func(x);"") # Prints 42; ```; There are still some things to check before merging:. - [ ] Double check reference counting; - [ ] C++ wrapper takes (lvalue) references, what happens with rvalues? What is the universal thingy?; - [ ] We put the C++ callable in the `PyROOT::` namespace. This is fine? It can be everything, even the global namespace. What is a sane solution here?; - [ ] How many copies we are doing finally? What is the performance?; - [ ] What happens in MT scenarios? Put in a test case!; - [ ] We have to ship the public cppyy interface with the ROOT headers.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3488:4210,perform,performance,4210,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3488,1,['perform'],['performance']

To validate the performance, I ran the [Python tests in roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest/tree/master/python) and the [PyROOT pythonization tests](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/pyroot/pythonizations/test) and compared runtimes with and without the cppyy upgrade. The total runtime of these tests reduced by about 4 % from 208 s to 287 s, so the performance impact of this PR is marginal. The runtime comparison for each test can be found in [cppyy_upgrade_test_runtimes.txt](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/14623432/cppyy_upgrade_test_runtimes.txt).; The worst observed performance penalty is 24 %. However, significant speedups are observed in some of the longer tests.

Performance,macOS has introduced feature named System Integrity Protection which prevents DYLD_* and LD_* environment variables to be propageted to a ROOT process.; We must disable the feature to use multiple versions of ROOT with AliBuild. There are two solution for this:. - Fix gSystem->Load() to allow dynamic loading using another environment variable; Pros: It just works (possibly) without out of tree modifications. Easy to relocate.; Cons: It's dirty. Unexpected load paths may be used even if they they have low priority. - Change all macros ever made so that they call gSystem->Load() with the full path or call AddDynamicPath in advance; Pros: It's neat. One can control load path precisely.; Cons: Too many macros to fix. We should fix the macros after relocation of libraries.

I don't understand why though, the annotations inside the functions make no sense to me (showing more than 50% on a ` mov %ebx,%r8d` without something obvious around it). yeah, this is a bit tricky, the profiler is useful if you built in debug mode. What usually works is removing the `DynamicLibraryManagerSymbol.cpp.o` and copying the build command, changing it to clang and adding [a variation of] `-Rpass=inline -Rpass-missed=.*` (https://godbolt.org/z/xGEsGhf97).

Performance,"n == 1`. This fixes `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.SubEventSections` on `mac13arm`, but makes it fail on x86 (didn't investigate why). It also makes `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` fail (both on `mac13arm` and x86) - this test looks even worse in terms of floating point arithmetic, since it expects summing up two partitions individually and then adding the result being bitwise identical to summing up the whole range at once. From what I can see, this is only working by chance right now. > Or is the problem that the FMA operation on the different parts of the sum (the likelihood is calculated over multiple event ranges in the test that is failing, which are summed afterwards) has higher rounding errors on non-x86 so that in the end the result indeed differs?. See above; the additional problem is that the (optimizing) compiler will insert FMA operations if it sees fit (and is allowed to do so). So depending on how the code and the arithmetic operations are formulated, you may get different results depending on platform, software versions, optimization level, hardware, etc. > Or, even more problematically, could such FMA operations also cause similar rounding errors on x86 so that EXPECT_EQ indeed becomes impossible (and I just got lucky with the current parameters on x86)?. On x86, you are saved by the fact that, as far as I can tell, FMA instructions only come from some SIMD extension that the compiler cannot use unconditionally. This is different on AArch64 (and apparently also PPC64LE) where it appears it is in the base ISA and always available. But yes, if in the future FMA is always available on x86 or you compile (parts of) the code with vector instructions (`RooBatchCompute`, hint hint), you can potentially run into the same problem. For another point regarding ""lucky"", see above that adding the `extendedTerm` to the last partition already makes one other test fail... In conclusion, I urge you to reconsider expecting bit-wise identical results.

Performance,"n::LoadTree`, while for #16804 `TChain::LoadTree` is the sole culprit. As in #16804, the root cause of the issue is that the following code is not invoked often enough:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2cc4b70d2e2bd89d9b639c894b4e0558be47c22b/tree/tree/src/TChain.cxx#L1407-L1434; I will call the operation above an ""address refresh"". TChain has code triggering an address refresh when needed for friends of the current tree:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2cc4b70d2e2bd89d9b639c894b4e0558be47c22b/tree/tree/src/TChain.cxx#L1384-L1393. Unfortunately this doesn't work for two reasons:; 1. The code cannot possibly be reached unless `c2` itself has friends because of the following condition:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2cc4b70d2e2bd89d9b639c894b4e0558be47c22b/tree/tree/src/TChain.cxx#L1370; In our case `c2` doesn't have friends, but the `fTree` does. This is easy to fix (or work around).; 2. Even if `fFriends` is made non-null, `fetree->IsUpdated()` always returns `false` because `TTree::LoadTree` resets it:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/18b4f317b389fa7931d7eb8e00525f4dca44be0f/tree/tree/src/TTree.cxx#L6512; Fixing this is much more annoying. For [my application](https://gitlab.cern.ch/Proto/Darwin/-/merge_requests/44), I ended up subscribing to the `Notify` signal and calling `TFriendElement::MarkUpdated` again. This is only a partial solution because when `c2` loads a new file, it doesn't reset friend elements that were marked updated, which would happen somewhere along this line:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/2cc4b70d2e2bd89d9b639c894b4e0558be47c22b/tree/tree/src/TChain.cxx#L1666. ### Reproducer. Rename to `recursiveBugDemo.C` and run the following macro: [recursiveBugDemo.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17593622/recursiveBugDemo.txt). It works similarly to #16804 and should only print `true`. ### ROOT version. Seen in:. * ROOT 6.30/04 (anaconda); * ROOT 6.28/04 (LCG 104).
