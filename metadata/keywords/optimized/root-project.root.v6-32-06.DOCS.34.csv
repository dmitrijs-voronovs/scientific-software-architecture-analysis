AMDGPU optimized code may spill vector registers to non-global address space; memory, and this spilling may be done only for SIMT lanes that are active on; entry to the subprogram. To support this the CFI rule for the partially spilled; register needs to use an expression that uses the EXEC register as a bit mask to; select between the register (for inactive lanes) and the stack spill location; (for active lanes that are spilled). This needs to evaluate to a location; description, and not a value, as a debugger needs to change the value if the; user assigns to the variable. Another usage is to create an expression that evaluates to provide a vector of; logical PCs for active and inactive lanes in a SIMT execution model. Again the; EXEC register is used to select between active and inactive PC values. In order; to represent a vector of PC values, a way to create a composite location; description that is a vector of a single location is used. It may be possible to use existing DWARF to incrementally build the composite; location description, possibly using the DWARF operations for control flow to; create a loop. However, for the AMDGPU that would require loop iteration of 64.; A concern is that the resulting DWARF would have a significant size and would be; reasonably common as it is needed for every vector register that is spilled in a; function. AMDGPU can have up to 512 vector registers. Another concern is the; time taken to evaluate such non-trivial expressions repeatedly. To avoid these issues, a composite location description that can be created as a; masked select is proposed.

Testability,"ss provides reference-counted memory; management. The implementation maps the type as written and the Clang Type to be able to use; the preprocessor to synthesize the relevant cast operations. For example,; ``X(char, Char_S)``, where ``char`` is the type from the language's type system; and ``Char_S`` is the Clang builtin type which represents it. This mapping helps; to import execution results from the interpreter in a compiled program and vice; versa. The ``Value.h`` header file can be included at runtime and this is why it; has a very low token count and was developed with strict constraints in mind. This also enables the user to receive the computed 'type' back in their code; and then transform the type into something else (e.g., re-cast a double into; a float). Normally, the compiler can handle these conversions transparently,; but in interpreter mode, the compiler cannot see all the 'from' and 'to' types,; so it cannot implicitly do the conversions. So this logic enables providing; these conversions on request. On-request conversions can help improve the user experience, by allowing; conversion to a desired 'to' type, when the 'from' type is unknown or unclear. Significance of this Feature; ----------------------------. The 'Value' object enables wrapping a memory region that comes from the; JIT, and bringing it back to the compiled code (and vice versa).; This is a very useful functionality when:. - connecting an interpreter to the compiled code, or; - connecting an interpreter in another language. For example, this feature helps transport values across boundaries. A notable; example is the cppyy project code makes use of this feature to enable running C++; within Python. It enables transporting values/information between C++; and Python. Note: `cppyy <https://github.com/wlav/cppyy/>`_ is an automatic, run-time,; Python-to-C++ bindings generator, for calling C++ from Python and Python from C++.; It uses LLVM along with a C++ interpreter (e.g., Cling) to enable",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangRepl.rst:10081,log,logic,10081,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangRepl.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangRepl.rst,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"ssion tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory. Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory. For example, it can be a small; piece of LLVM IR distilled from an actual application or benchmark. Testing Analysis; ----------------. An analysis is a pass that infer properties on some part of the IR and not; transforming it. They are tested in general using the same infrastructure as the; regression tests, by creating a separate ""Printer"" pass to consume the analysis; result and print it on the standard output in a textual format suitable for; FileCheck.; See `llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll>`_; for an example of such test. ``test-suite``; --------------.

These programs are compiled using a user specified compiler and set of; flags, and then executed to capture the program output and timing; information. The output of these programs is compared to a reference; output to ensure that the program is being compiled correctly.

If you have `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_ checked out and built, you; can run the LLVM and Clang tests simultaneously using:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-all. To run the tests with Valgrind (Memcheck by default), use the ``LIT_ARGS`` make; variable to pass the required options to lit. For example, you can use:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check LIT_ARGS=""-v --vg --vg-leak"". to enable testing with valgrind and with leak checking enabled. To run individual tests or subsets of tests, you can use the ``llvm-lit``; script which is built as part of LLVM. For example, to run the; ``Integer/BitPacked.ll`` test by itself you can run:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/Integer/BitPacked.ll. or to run all of the ARM CodeGen tests:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/CodeGen/ARM.

Step 3.5: More Complicated Matchers; ===================================. Our simple matcher is capable of discovering for loops, but we would; still need to filter out many more ourselves. We can do a good portion; of the remaining work with some cleverly chosen matchers, but first we; need to decide exactly which properties we want to allow. How can we characterize for loops over arrays which would be eligible; for translation to range-based syntax? Range based loops over arrays of; size ``N`` that:. - start at index ``0``; - iterate consecutively; - end at index ``N-1``. We already check for (1), so all we need to add is a check to the loop's; condition to ensure that the loop's index variable is compared against; ``N`` and another check to ensure that the increment step just; increments this same variable. The matcher for (2) is straightforward:; require a pre- or post-increment of the same variable declared in the; init portion.

Note that this does not refer to padding introduced by the; type's storage representation. .. _nofpclass:. ``nofpclass(<test mask>)``; This attribute applies to parameters and return values with; floating-point and vector of floating-point types, as well as; arrays of such types. The test mask has the same format as the; second argument to the :ref:`llvm.is.fpclass <llvm.is.fpclass>`,; and indicates which classes of floating-point values are not; permitted for the value. For example a bitmask of 3 indicates; the parameter may not be a NaN. If the value is a floating-point class indicated by the; ``nofpclass`` test mask, a :ref:`poison value <poisonvalues>` is; passed or returned instead. .. code-block:: text; :caption: The following invariants hold. @llvm.is.fpclass(nofpclass(test_mask) %x, test_mask) => false; @llvm.is.fpclass(nofpclass(test_mask) %x, ~test_mask) => true; nofpclass(all) => poison; .. In textual IR, various string names are supported for readability; and can be combined. For example ``nofpclass(nan pinf nzero)``; evaluates to a mask of 547. This does not depend on the floating-point environment. For; example, a function parameter marked ``nofpclass(zero)`` indicates; no zero inputs. If this is applied to an argument in a function; marked with :ref:`\""denormal-fp-math\"" <denormal_fp_math>`; indicating zero treatment of input denormals, it does not imply the; value cannot be a denormal value which would compare equal to 0. .. table:: Recognized test mask names. +-------+----------------------+---------------+; | Name | floating-point class | Bitmask value |; +=======+============",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:65370,test,test,65370,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['test'],['test']

In many cases it makes sense to build a special fuzzing-friendly build; with certain fuzzing-unfriendly features disabled. We propose to use a common build macro; for all such cases for consistency: ``FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION``. .. code-block:: c++. void MyInitPRNG() {; #ifdef FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION; // In fuzzing mode the behavior of the code should be deterministic.; srand(0);; #else; srand(time(0));; #endif; }.

Periodically restart both fuzzers so that they can use each other's findings.; Currently, there is no simple way to run both fuzzing engines in parallel while sharing the same corpus dir.

How good is my fuzzer?; ----------------------. Once you implement your target function ``LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`` and fuzz it to death,; you will want to know whether the function or the corpus can be improved further.; One easy to use metric is, of course, code coverage.

If your test requires extra files besides the file containing the ``RUN:`` lines; and the extra files are small, consider specifying them in the same file and; using ``split-file`` to extract them. For example,. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: split-file %s %t; ; RUN: llvm-link -S %t/a.ll %t/b.ll | FileCheck %s. ; CHECK: ... ;--- a.ll; ...; ;--- b.ll; ...

If you want to test relative line numbers like ``[[#@LINE+1]]``, specify; ``--leading-lines`` to add leading empty lines to preserve line numbers. If the extra files are large, the idiomatic place to put them is in a subdirectory ``Inputs``.; You can then refer to the extra files as ``%S/Inputs/foo.bar``. For example, consider ``test/Linker/ident.ll``. The directory structure is; as follows::. test/; Linker/; ident.ll; Inputs/; ident.a.ll; ident.b.ll.

Verifying Diagnostics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Clang ``-cc1`` supports the ``-verify`` command line option as a way to; validate diagnostic behavior. This option will use special comments within the; test file to verify that expected diagnostics appear in the correct source; locations. If all of the expected diagnostics match the actual output of Clang,; then the invocation will return normally. If there are discrepancies between; the expected and actual output, Clang will emit detailed information about; which expected diagnostics were not seen or which unexpected diagnostics were; seen, etc. A complete example is:. .. code-block: c++. // RUN: %clang_cc1 -verify %s; int A = B; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}. If the test is run and the expected error is emitted on the expected line, the; diagnostic verifier will pass. However, if the expected error does not appear; or appears in a different location than expected, or if additional diagnostics; appear, the diagnostic verifier will fail and emit information as to why. The ``-verify`` command optionally accepts a comma-delimited list of one or; more verification prefixes that can be used to craft those special comments.; Each prefix must start with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters,; hyphens, and underscores. ``-verify`` by itself is equivalent to; ``-verify=expected``, meaning that special comments will start with; ``expected``. Using different prefixes makes it easier to have separate; ``RUN:`` lines in the same test file which result in differing diagnostic; behavior. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // RUN: %clang_cc1 -verify=foo,bar %s. int A = B; // foo-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}; int C = D; // bar-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'D'}}; int E = F; // ex",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:155276,test,test,155276,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Optimization can also be activated through the minimizer, which may be more familiar to most users.; Given the `RooMinimizer` object `m` as defined in the example above, we can do:; ``` {.cpp}; m.optimizeConst(2);; ```. For the adventurous user, it is also possible to apply constant term optimization to a pdf and dataset directly without needing a likelihood object, e.g. given some `RooArgSet` set of observables `normSet`:; ``` {.cpp}; bool applyTrackingOpt = true;; ConstantTermsOptimizer::enableConstantTermsOptimization(&pdf, &normSet, dataset, applyTrackingOpt);; ```; We refer to RooFit documentation for more about ""tracking optimization"" which can be enabled or disabled using the final boolean parameter. ## Caveats; This package is still under development.; Some functionality that users of `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` or `RooAbsPdf::createNLL` were used to has not yet been ported to this namespace.; However, the functionality that is implemented has been tested thoroughly for a set of common usage patterns and should work as expected. The classes implemented here will give the exact same numerical results for most fits.; One notable exception is fitting _simultaneous_ pdfs with a _constrained_ term _when using offsetting_.; Because offsetting is handled differently in the `TestStatistics` classes compared to the way it was done in the object returned from `RooAbsPdf::createNLL` (a `RooAddition` of an offset `RooNLLVar` and a non-offset `RooConstraintSum`, whereas `RooSumL` applies the offset to the; total sum of its binned, unbinned and constraint components), we cannot always expect exactly equal results for fits with likelihood offsetting enabled.

Testability,"stdin. Platform-Specific Tests; -----------------------. Whenever adding tests that require the knowledge of a specific platform,; either related to code generated, specific output or back-end features,; you must make sure to isolate the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True. Other platform-specific tests are those that depend on a specific feature; of a specific sub-architecture, for example only to Intel chips that support ``AVX2``. For instance, ``test/CodeGen/X86/psubus.ll`` tests three sub-architecture; variants:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=SSE2; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=corei7-avx < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX1; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core-avx2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX2. And the checks are different:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; SSE2: @test1; ; SSE2: psubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0; ; AVX1: @test1; ; AVX1: vpsubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0; ; AVX2: @test1; ; AVX2: vpsubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0.

Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with; ""``-O0 -g``"" and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify; the program as it executes from a debugger. Compiling a program with; ""``-O3 -g``"" gives you full debug information that is always available and; accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call; elimination and inlining), but you might lose the ability to modify the program; and call functions which were optimized out of the program, or inlined away; completely. The :doc:`LLVM test-suite <TestSuiteMakefileGuide>` provides a framework to; test the optimizer's handling of debugging information. It can be run like; this:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd llvm/projects/test-suite/MultiSource/Benchmarks # or some other level; % make TEST=dbgopt. This will test impact of debugging information on optimization passes. If; debugging information influences optimization passes then it will be reported; as a failure.

LLVM debugging information has been carefully designed to make it possible for; the optimizer to optimize the program and debugging information without; necessarily having to know anything about debugging information. In; particular, the use of metadata avoids duplicated debugging information from; the beginning, and the global dead code elimination pass automatically deletes; debugging information for a function if it decides to delete the function.

Each item in the list is a tuple; consisting of a pattern and its replacement, which lit applies using python's; ``re.sub`` function.; - To define substitutions within a single test file, lit supports the; ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directives, described in detail below. So that; they have no effect on other test files, these directives modify a copy of the; substitution list that is produced by lit configuration files. For example, the following directives can be inserted into a test file to define; ``%{cflags}`` and ``%{fcflags}`` substitutions with empty initial values, which; serve as the parameters of another newly defined ``%{check}`` substitution:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; DEFINE: %{cflags} =; ; DEFINE: %{fcflags} =. ; DEFINE: %{check} = \; ; DEFINE: %clang_cc1 -verify -fopenmp -fopenmp-version=51 %{cflags} \; ; DEFINE: -emit-llvm -o - %s | \; ; DEFINE: FileCheck %{fcflags} %s.

An empty/undef/poison; address means the address component has been killed (the memory address is no; longer a valid location). LLVM currently encodes variable fragment information; in `DIExpression`s, so as an implementation quirk the `FragmentInfo` for; `Variable` is contained within `ValueExpression` only. The formal LLVM-IR signature is:; ```; void @llvm.dbg.assign(metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata); ```. ### Instruction link: `DIAssignID`. `DIAssignID` metadata is the mechanism that is currently used to encode the; store<->marker link. The metadata node has no operands and all instances are; `distinct`; equality is checked for by comparing addresses. `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics use a `DIAssignID` metadata node instance as an; operand. This way it refers to any store-like instruction that has the same; `DIAssignID` attachment. E.g.

We think; that such an expression would be problematic once both column and row major; matrixes are supported: depending on the memory layout, either accessing columns; or rows can be done efficiently, but not both. Instead, we propose to provide; builtins to extract rows and columns from a matrix. This makes the operations; more explicit. Matrix Type Binary Operators; ----------------------------. Given two matrixes, the ``+`` and ``-`` operators perform element-wise addition; and subtraction, while the ``*`` operator performs matrix multiplication.; ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, and ``/`` can also be used with a matrix and a scalar; value, applying the operation to each element of the matrix.

If `gPad->SetLogz()` has been set, the log scale on Z-axis is set; automatically, i.e. there is no need for using the `zs()` operator.; Note that the X and Y axis are always linear. The operator ""`ci(r,g,b`)"" defines the colors increments (`r`, `g`; and `b` are floats). For sophisticated shading (Light, Height and; LightHeight Display Modes Groups) the color palette starts from the; basic pen color (see `pa()` function). There is a predefined number of; color levels (256). Color in every level is calculated by adding the; increments of the `r` , `g` , `b` components to the previous level.; Using this function one can change the color increments between two; neighboring color levels. The function does not apply on the Simple; Display Modes Group. The default values are: (1,1,1). The operator ""`ca(color_algorithm)`"" allows to choose the Color; Algorithm.

This section describes the :program:`lit` testing architecture for users interested in; creating a new :program:`lit` testing implementation, or extending an existing one. :program:`lit` proper is primarily an infrastructure for discovering and running; arbitrary tests, and to expose a single convenient interface to these; tests. :program:`lit` itself doesn't know how to run tests, rather this logic is; defined by *test suites*. TEST SUITES; ~~~~~~~~~~~. As described in :ref:`test-discovery`, tests are always located inside a *test; suite*. Test suites serve to define the format of the tests they contain, the; logic for finding those tests, and any additional information to run the tests. :program:`lit` identifies test suites as directories containing ``lit.cfg`` or; ``lit.site.cfg`` files (see also :option:`--config-prefix`). Test suites are; initially discovered by recursively searching up the directory hierarchy for; all the input files passed on the command line. You can use; :option:`--show-suites` to display the discovered test suites at startup. Once a test suite is discovered, its config file is loaded. Config files; themselves are Python modules which will be executed. When the config file is; executed, two important global variables are predefined:. **lit_config**. The global **lit** configuration object (a *LitConfig* instance), which defines; the builtin test formats, global configuration parameters, and other",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst:14146,TEST,TEST,14146,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,1,['TEST'],['TEST']

Creating the binary distribution requires following the instructions; :doc:`here <ReleaseProcess>`. That process will perform both Release+Asserts and Release builds but only; pack the Release build for upload. You should use the Release+Asserts sysroot,; normally under ``final/Phase3/Release+Asserts/llvmCore-3.8.1-RCn.install/``,; for test-suite and run-time benchmarks, to make sure nothing serious has; passed through the net. For compile-time benchmarks, use the Release version. The minimum required version of the tools you'll need are :doc:`here <GettingStarted>`. Release Qualification Criteria; ------------------------------. There are no official release qualification criteria. It is up to the; the release manager to determine when a release is ready. The release manager; should pay attention to the results of community testing, the number of outstanding; bugs, and then number of regressions when determining whether or not to make a; release. The community values time based releases, so releases should not be delayed for; too long unless there are critical issues remaining. In most cases, the only; kind of bugs that are critical enough to block a release would be a major regression; from a previous release. Official Testing; ----------------. A few developers in the community have dedicated time to validate the release; candidates and volunteered to be the official release testers for each; architecture. These will be the ones testing, generating and uploading the official binaries; to the server, and will be the minimum tests *necessary* for the release to; proceed. This will obviously not cover all OSs and distributions, so additional community; validation is important. However, if community input is not reached before the; release is out, all bugs reported will have to go on the next stable release.

Testability,"t care about block livein lists. - The (global) `liveins:` list is typically only interesting for early; instruction selection passes and can be removed when testing later passes.; The per-block `liveins:` on the other hand are necessary if; `tracksRegLiveness` is true. - Branch probability data in block `successors:` lists can be dropped if the; test doesn't depend on it. Example:; `successors: %bb.1(0x40000000), %bb.2(0x40000000)` can be replaced with; `successors: %bb.1, %bb.2`. - MIR code contains a whole IR module. This is necessary because there are; no equivalents in MIR for global variables, references to external functions,; function attributes, metadata, debug info. Instead some MIR data references; the IR constructs. You can often remove them if the test doesn't depend on; them. - Alias Analysis is performed on IR values. These are referenced by memory; operands in MIR. Example: `:: (load 8 from %ir.foobar, !alias.scope !9)`.; If the test doesn't depend on (good) alias analysis the references can be; dropped: `:: (load 8)`. - MIR blocks can reference IR blocks for debug printing, profile information; or debug locations. Example: `bb.42.myblock` in MIR references the IR block; `myblock`. It is usually possible to drop the `.myblock` reference and simply; use `bb.42`. - If there are no memory operands or blocks referencing the IR then the; IR function can be replaced by a parameterless dummy function like; `define @func() { ret void }`. - It is possible to drop the whole IR section of the MIR file if it only; contains dummy functions (see above). The .mir loader will create the; IR functions automatically in this case. .. _limitations:. Limitations; -----------. Currently the MIR format has several limitations in terms of which state it; can serialize:. - The target-specific state in the target-specific ``MachineFunctionInfo``; subclasses isn't serialized at the moment. - The target-specific ``MachineConstantPoolValue`` subclasses (in the ARM and; SystemZ b",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst:4559,test,test,4559,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"t comes with the; XRay runtime and/or control when/how the XRay instrumentation runs, you may use; the XRay APIs directly for doing so. To do this, you'll need to include the; ``xray_log_interface.h`` from the compiler-rt ``xray`` directory. The important API; functions we list below:. - ``__xray_log_register_mode(...)``: Register a logging implementation against; a string Mode identifier. The implementation is an instance of; ``XRayLogImpl`` defined in ``xray/xray_log_interface.h``.; - ``__xray_log_select_mode(...)``: Select the mode to install, associated with; a string Mode identifier. Only implementations registered with; ``__xray_log_register_mode(...)`` can be chosen with this function.; - ``__xray_log_init_mode(...)``: This function allows for initializing and; re-initializing an installed logging implementation. See; ``xray/xray_log_interface.h`` for details, part of the XRay compiler-rt; installation. Once a logging implementation has been initialized, it can be ""stopped"" by; finalizing the implementation through the ``__xray_log_finalize()`` function.; The finalization routine is the opposite of the initialization. When finalized,; an implementation's data can be cleared out through the; ``__xray_log_flushLog()`` function. For implementations that support in-memory; processing, these should register an iterator function to provide access to the; data via the ``__xray_log_set_buffer_iterator(...)`` which allows code calling; the ``__xray_log_process_buffers(...)`` function to deal with the data in; memory. All of this is better explained in the ``xray/xray_log_interface.h`` header. Basic Mode; ----------. XRay supports a basic logging mode which will trace the application's; execution, and periodically append to a single log. This mode can be; installed/enabled by setting ``xray_mode=xray-basic`` in the ``XRAY_OPTIONS``; environment variable. Combined with ``patch_premain=true`` this can allow for; tracing applications from start to end.

This is done by calling the ; CheckerContext::generateSink function; this function is the same as the; addTransition function, but marks the state as a sink node. Like; addTransition, this returns an ExplodedNode with the updated; state, which can then be passed to the BugReport constructor. After a BugReport is created, it should be passed to the analyzer core; by calling CheckerContext::emitReport. AST Visitors; Some checks might not require path-sensitivity to be effective. Simple AST walk; might be sufficient. If that is the case, consider implementing a Clang; compiler warning. On the other hand, a check might not be acceptable as a compiler; warning; for example, because of a relatively high false positive rate. In this; situation, AST callbacks checkASTDecl and; checkASTCodeBody are your best friends. Testing; Every patch should be well tested with Clang regression tests.

If a call occurs within an inlined function, prints TRUE or FALSE according to; the value of its argument. If a call occurs outside an inlined function,; nothing is printed. The intended use of this checker is to assert that a function is inlined at; least once (by passing 'true' and expecting a warning), or to assert that a; function is never inlined (by passing 'false' and expecting no warning). The; argument is technically unnecessary but is intended to clarify intent. You might wonder why we can't print TRUE if a function is ever inlined and; FALSE if it is not. The problem is that any inlined function could conceivably; also be analyzed as a top-level function (in which case both TRUE and FALSE; would be printed), depending on the value of the -analyzer-inlining option. In C, the argument can be typed as 'int' or as '_Bool'. Example usage::. int inlined() {; clang_analyzer_checkInlined(true); // expected-warning{{TRUE}}; return 42;; }. void topLevel() {; clang_analyzer_checkInlined(false); // no-warning (not inlined); int value = inlined();; // This assertion will not be valid if the previous call was not inlined.; clang_analyzer_eval(value == 42); // expected-warning{{TRUE}}; }. - ``void clang_analyzer_warnIfReached();``.

Testability,"t it is common for; the same (and often large) header files to be included by multiple; source files. Consequently, compile times can often be greatly improved; by caching some of the (redundant) work done by a compiler to process; headers. Precompiled header files, which represent one of many ways to; implement this optimization, are literally files that represent an; on-disk cache that contains the vital information necessary to reduce; some of the work needed to process a corresponding header file. While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``.

To use the mechanism, a client creates metadata nodes with two elements:. 1. a byte offset into the global (generally zero for functions); 2. a metadata object representing an identifier for the type. These metadata nodes are associated with globals by using global object; metadata attachments with the ``!type`` metadata kind. Each type identifier must exclusively identify either global variables; or functions. .. admonition:: Limitation.

This is the `TTree::MakeClass` method. We will now go through the steps; of using `MakeClass` with a simplified example. The methods used here; obviously work for complex event loop calculations. These are our assumptions: we would like to do selective plotting and; loop through each entry of the tree and tracks. We chose a simple; example: we want to plot `fPx` of the first 100 tracks of each entry. We; have a ROOT tree with a branch for each data member in the ""`Event`""; object. To build this file and tree follow the instructions on how to; build the examples in `$ROOTSYS/test`. Execute `Event` and instruct it; to split the object with this command (from the UNIX command line). ``` {.cpp}; > $ROOTSYS/test/Event 400 1 2 1; ```. This creates an `Event.root` file with 400 events, compressed, split,; and filled. See `$ROOTSYS/test/MainEvent.cxx` for more info. The person who designed the tree makes a shared library available to; you, which defines the classes needed. In this case, the classes are; Event, `EventHeader`, and Track and they are defined in the shared; library `libEvent.so`. The designer also gives you the `Event.h` file to; see the definition of the classes. You can locate `Event.h` in; `$ROOTSYS/test`, and if you have not yet built `libEvent.so`, please see; the instructions of how to build it (typing make in \$ROOTSYS/test is; enough).

However, destructors cannot be overloaded. Using a Different Class on Host/Device; --------------------------------------. Occasionally you may want to have a class with different host/device versions. If all of the class's members are the same on the host and device, you can just; provide overloads for the class's member functions. However, if you want your class to have different members on host/device, you; won't be able to provide working H and D overloads in both classes. In this; case, clang is likely to be unhappy with you. .. code-block:: c++. #ifdef __CUDA_ARCH__; struct S {; __device__ void foo() { /* use device_only */ }; int device_only;; };; #else; struct S {; __host__ void foo() { /* use host_only */ }; double host_only;; };. __device__ void test() {; S s;; // clang generates an error here, because during host compilation, we; // have ifdef'ed away the __device__ overload of S::foo(). The __device__; // overload must be present *even during host compilation*.; S.foo();; }; #endif. We posit that you don't really want to have classes with different members on H; and D. For example, if you were to pass one of these as a parameter to a; kernel, it would have a different layout on H and D, so would not work; properly. To make code like this compatible with clang, we recommend you separate it out; into two classes. If you need to write code that works on both host and; device, consider writing an overloaded wrapper function that returns different; types on host and device. .. code-block:: c++. struct HostS { ... };; struct DeviceS { ... };. __host__ HostS MakeStruct() { return HostS(); }; __device__ DeviceS MakeStruct() { return DeviceS(); }. // Now host and device code can call MakeStruct().

Depending on the test format tests may produce additional information about; their status (generally only for failures). See the :ref:`output-options`; section for more information. .. _lit-infrastructure:. LIT INFRASTRUCTURE; ------------------. This section describes the :program:`lit` testing architecture for users interested in; creating a new :program:`lit` testing implementation, or extending an existing one. :program:`lit` proper is primarily an infrastructure for discovering and running; arbitrary tests, and to expose a single convenient interface to these; tests. :program:`lit` itself doesn't know how to run tests, rather this logic is; defined by *test suites*. TEST SUITES; ~~~~~~~~~~~. As described in :ref:`test-discovery`, tests are always located inside a *test; suite*. Test suites serve to define the format of the tests they contain, the; logic for finding those tests, and any additional information to run the tests. :program:`lit` identifies test suites as directories containing ``lit.cfg`` or; ``lit.site.cfg`` files (see also :option:`--config-prefix`). Test suites are; initially discovered by recursively searching up the directory hierarchy for; all the input files passed on the command line. You can use; :option:`--show-suites` to display the discovered test suites at startup. Once a test suite is discovered, its config file is loaded. Config files; themselves are Python modules which will be executed. When the config file is; executed, two important global variables are predefined:. **lit_config**. The global **lit** configuration object (a *LitConfig* instance), which defines; the builtin test formats, global configuration parameters, and other helper; routines for implementing test configurations. **config**. This is the config object (a *TestingConfig* instance) for the test suite,; which the config file is expected",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst:14260,Test,Test,14260,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,5,"['Test', 'log', 'test']","['Test', 'logic', 'tests']"
Testability,"t uses information available; in LLVM to measure host machine instruction characteristics like latency,; throughput, or port decomposition. Given an LLVM opcode name and a benchmarking mode, :program:`llvm-exegesis`; generates a code snippet that makes execution as serial (resp. as parallel) as; possible so that we can measure the latency (resp. inverse throughput/uop decomposition); of the instruction.; The code snippet is jitted and, unless requested not to, executed on the; host subtarget. The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured using; hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML; to the standard output. The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM's TableDef; scheduling models. To that end, we also provide analysis of the results. :program:`llvm-exegesis` can also benchmark arbitrary user-provided code; snippets. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` currently only supports X86 (64-bit only), ARM (AArch64; only), MIPS, and PowerPC (PowerPC64LE only) on Linux for benchmarking. Not all; benchmarking functionality is guaranteed to work on every platform.; :program:`llvm-exegesis` also has a separate analysis mode that is supported; on every platform that LLVM is. SNIPPET ANNOTATIONS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` supports benchmarking arbitrary snippets of assembly.; However, benchmarking these snippets often requires some setup so that they; can execute properly. :program:`llvm-exegesis` has five annotations and some; additional utilities to help with setup so that snippets can be benchmarked; properly. * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <register name>` - Adding this annotation to the text; assembly snippet to be benchmarked marks the register as requiring a definition.; A value will automatically be provided unless a second parameter, a hex value,; is passed in. This is done with the `LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <register name> <hex value>`; format. `<hex value>` is a bit pattern use",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:1331,benchmark,benchmarking,1331,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarking']

In ROOT, almost all classes inherit from a common base class called; **`TObject`**. This kind of architecture is also used in the Java; language. The **`TObject`** class provides default behavior and; protocol for all objects in the ROOT system. The main advantage of; this approach is that it enforces the common behavior of the derived; classes and consequently it ensures the consistency of the whole; system. See ""The Role of TObject"". **`TObject`** provides protocol, i.e. (abstract) member functions,; for:. - Object I/O (`Read()`, `Write())`. - Error handling (`Warning()`, `Error()`, `SysError()`, `Fatal())`. - Sorting (`IsSortable()`, `Compare()`, `IsEqual()`, `Hash())`. - Inspection (`Dump()`, `Inspect()`). - Printing (`Print())`. - Drawing (`Draw()`, `Paint()`, `ExecuteEvent())`. - Bit handling (`SetBit()`, `TestBit()`). - Memory allocation (operator` new and delete`, `IsOnHeap())`. - Access to meta information (`IsA()`, `InheritsFrom())`. - Object browsing (`Browse()`, `IsFolder())`. ## Global Variables. ROOT has a set of global variables that apply to the session. For; example,; ***`gDirectory`*** always holds the current directory, and; ***`gStyle`*** holds the current style. All global variables begin with ""*g*"" followed by a capital letter. ### gROOT. The single instance of **`TROOT`** is accessible via the global; ***`gROOT`*** and holds information relative to the current session.; By using the ***`gROOT`*** pointer, you get the access to every object; created in a ROOT program. The **`TROOT`** object has several lists; pointing to the main ROOT objects. During a ROOT session, the; ***`gROOT`*** keeps a series of collections to manage objects. They; can be accessed via ***`gROOT`***`::GetListOf...` methods. ``` {.cpp}; gROOT->GetListOfClasses(); gROOT->GetListOfColors(); gR",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/GettingStarted.md:31965,Test,TestBit,31965,documentation/users-guide/GettingStarted.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/GettingStarted.md,1,['Test'],['TestBit']

This option prevents; the execution of these two scripts. - it is also possible to execute a script without entering a ROOT; session. One simply adds the name of the script(s) after the ROOT; command. Be warned: after finishing the execution of the script,; ROOT will normally enter a new session. - -q process command line script files and exit. For example if you would like to run a script `myMacro.C` in the; background, redirect the output into a file `myMacro.log`, and exit; after the script execution, use the following syntax:. ```; root -b -q myMacro.C > myMacro.log; ```. If you need to pass a parameter to the script use:. ```; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(3)' > myMacro.log; ```. Be mindful of the quotes, i.e. if you need to pass a string as a; parameter, the syntax is:. ```; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(""text"")' > myMacro.log; ```. You can build a shared library with ACLiC and then use this shared; library on the command line for a quicker execution (i.e. the compiled; speed rather than the interpreted speed). See also ""Cling the C++; Interpreter"". ```; root -b -q myMacro.so > myMacro.log; ```. ROOT has a powerful C/C++ interpreter giving you access to all available; ROOT classes, global variables, and functions via the command line. By; typing C++ statements at the prompt, you can create objects, call; functions, execute scripts, etc. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] 1+sqrt(9); (const double)4.00000000000000000e+00; root[] for (int i = 0; i<4; i++) cout << ""Hello"" << i << endl; Hello 0; Hello 1; Hello 2; Hello 3; root[] .q; ```. To exit the ROOT session, type `.q`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .q; ```. ## Using the GUI. The basic whiteboard on which an object is drawn in ROOT is called a; canvas (defined by the class **`TCanvas`**).

Example usage::. void foo() {; int x = 1;; clang_analyzer_hashDump(x); // expected-warning{{hashed string for x}}; }. - ``void clang_analyzer_denote(int, const char *);``.

Testability,"t-status-results:. TEST STATUS RESULTS; -------------------. Each test ultimately produces one of the following eight results:. **PASS**. The test succeeded. **FLAKYPASS**. The test succeeded after being re-run more than once. This only applies to; tests containing an ``ALLOW_RETRIES:`` annotation. **XFAIL**. The test failed, but that is expected. This is used for test formats which allow; specifying that a test does not currently work, but wish to leave it in the test; suite. **XPASS**. The test succeeded, but it was expected to fail. This is used for tests which; were specified as expected to fail, but are now succeeding (generally because; the feature they test was broken and has been fixed). **FAIL**. The test failed. **UNRESOLVED**. The test result could not be determined. For example, this occurs when the test; could not be run, the test itself is invalid, or the test was interrupted. **UNSUPPORTED**. The test is not supported in this environment. This is used by test formats; which can report unsupported tests. **TIMEOUT**. The test was run, but it timed out before it was able to complete. This is; considered a failure. Depending on the test format tests may produce additional information about; their status (generally only for failures).

If you are familiar with the; ROOT community, it may be beneficial to add a suggested reviewer to the PR in order to get quicker attention.; Please ping people :wave: should you not get timely feedback, for instance with `@root-project/core ping!`. ## Tests. As you contribute code, this code will likely fix an issue or add a feature.; Whatever it is: this requires you to add a new test, or to extend an existing test. Depending on the size and complexity; of this test, it exists either in the `test/` subdirectory of each part of ROOT (see for instance; [`tree/dataframe/test`](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/tree/dataframe/test)), or in; [roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest.git). Tests in `test/` subdirectories are unit tests, mostly based on; [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) and easily extended. Tests in; [roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest.git) are more involved (e.g., tests requiring custom dictionaries or; data files). When you create a branch in the main ROOT repository (i.e., this repository) and add a test to `roottest`,; make sure to do this under the same branch name (and open a PR for it). Our CI infrastructure automatically picks up the; changes defined in the `roottest` PR based on this branch name, and uses that for testing your PR here. ## Continuous Integration.

Testability,"t. As we will see in the paragraph ""Fill Attributes"", a fill style (type of; hatching) may be set for a pad. ``` {.cpp}; root[] pad1->SetFillStyle(istyle); ```. This is done with the `SetFillStyle` method where `istyle` is a style; number, defined in ""Fill Attributes"". A special set of styles allows; handling of various levels of transparency. These are styles number 4000; to 4100, 4000 being fully transparent and 4100 fully opaque. So, suppose; you have an existing canvas with several pads. You create a new pad; (transparent) covering for example the entire canvas. Then you draw your; primitives in this pad. The same can be achieved with the graphics; editor. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .x tutorials/hist/h1draw.C; root[] TPad *newpad=new TPad(""newpad"",""Transparent pad"",0,0,1,1);; root[] newpad->SetFillStyle(4000);; root[] newpad->Draw();; root[] newpad->cd();; root[] // create some primitives, etc; ```. ### Setting the Log Scale. Setting the scale to logarithmic or linear is an attribute of the pad,; not the axis or the histogram. The scale is an attribute of the pad; because you may want to draw the same histogram in linear scale in one; pad and in log scale in another pad. Frequently, we see several; histograms on top of each other in the same pad. It would be very; inconvenient to set the scale attribute for each histogram in a pad. Furthermore, if the logic was set in the histogram class (or each; object) the scale setting in each `Paint` method of all objects should; be tested. If you have a pad with a histogram, a right-click on the pad, outside of; the histograms frame will convince you. The `SetLogx()`, `SetLogy()` and; `SetLogz()` methods are there. As you see, **`TPad`** defines log scale; for the two directions `x` and `y` plus `z` if you want to draw a 3D; representation of some function or histogram. The way to set log scale in the x direction for the active pad is:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetLogx(1); ```. To reset log in the z direction:. ``` {.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:29142,log,logarithmic,29142,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['log'],['logarithmic']

Let's remind; that. - a slot can be any class method with a generated Cling dictionary. - a slot can be a function with a dictionary. Detailed information how to generate a dictionary can be found on; <http://root.cern.ch/root/CintGenerator.html>. The following example demonstrates how to use signals/slots mechanism in; a standalone executable program on `linux` platform with the `gcc`; compiler. `tst.C `. ``` {.cpp}; #include <TQObject.h>; #include <RQ_OBJECT.h>. class A {; RQ_OBJECT(""A""); private:; Int_t fValue;; public:; A() : fValue(0) { }; ~A() { }; void SetValue(Int_t value); // *SIGNAL*; void PrintValue() const { printf(""value = %d\n"", fValue); }; };; void A::SetValue(Int_t value) { // Set new value; // Emit signal ""SetValue(Int_t)"" with a single parameter; if (value != fValue) {; fValue = value;; Emit(""SetValue(Int_t)"", fValue);; }; }; // Main program; #ifdef STANDALONE; int main(int argc, char **argv) {; A* a = new A();; A* b = new A();; a->Connect(""SetValue(Int_t)"", ""A"", b, ""SetValue(Int_t)"");; printf(""n******* Test of SetValue(Int_t) signal *******n"");; b->SetValue(10);; printf(""nt***** b before ******n"");; b->PrintValue();; a->SetValue(20);; printf(""t***** b after a->SetValue(20) ******n"");; b->PrintValue();; return 0;; }; #endif; ```. ACLiC simplifies this procedure and allows the dictionary generation by:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L tst.C++; ```. It will create the shared library `tst_C.so.`. The next line will create an executable:. **`` g++ -otst tst.C `root-config --cflags --libs` ./tst_C.so -DSTANDALONE ``**. The library `tst_C.so` is a dynamically loaded library and should be; located in `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. The current working directory should be; added to `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` via:. **`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./`**. To run it, you just do:. **`./tst`**. ## Widgets in Detail. ### Buttons.

Most features are self descriptive - explore, and; if you have a question, drop by on #llvm in IRC to get help. Note that as e-mail is the system of reference for code reviews, and some; people prefer it over a web interface, we do not generate automated mail; when a review changes state, for example by clicking ""Accept Revision"" in; the web interface. Thus, please type LGTM into the comment box to accept; a change from Phabricator. .. _pre-merge-testing:. Pre-merge testing; -----------------. The pre-merge tests are a continuous integration (CI) workflow. The workflow; checks the patches uploaded to Phabricator before a user merges them to the main; branch - thus the term *pre-merge testing*. When a user uploads a patch to Phabricator, Phabricator triggers the checks and; then displays the results. This way bugs in a patch are contained during the; code review stage and do not pollute the main branch. Our goal with pre-merge testing is to report most true problems while strongly; minimizing the number of false positive reports. Our goal is that problems; reported are always actionable. If you notice a false positive, please report; it so that we can identify the cause.

UnbundleArchive takes a heterogeneous device archive file ("".a"") as input; containing bundled device binary files, and a list of offload targets (not; host), and extracts the device binaries into a new archive file for each; offload target. Each resulting archive file contains all device binaries; compatible with that particular offload target. Compatibility between a; device binary in HDA and a target is based on the compatibility between their; bundle entry IDs as defined in :ref:`compatibility-bundle-entry-id`. Following cases may arise during compatibility testing:. * A binary is compatible with one or more targets: Insert the binary into the; device-specific archive of each compatible target.; * A binary is not compatible with any target: Skip the binary.; * One or more binaries are compatible with a target: Insert all binaries into; the device-specific archive of the target. The insertion need not be ordered.; * No binary is compatible with a target: If ``allow-missing-bundles`` option is; present then create an empty archive for the target. Otherwise, produce an; error without creating an archive. The created archive file does not contain an index of the symbols and device; binary files are named as <<Parent Bundle Name>-<DeviceBinary's TargetID>>,; with ':' replaced with '_'.

Using the fit option `S` one can access the full result of the fit including the covariance and correlation matrix.; See later the paragraph `TFitResult`. ### Associated Errors. By default, for each bin, the sum of weights is computed at fill time.; One can also call `TH1::Sumw2` to force the storage and computation of; the sum of the square of weights per bin. If Sumw2 has been called,; the error per bin is computed as the `sqrt(sum of squares of; weights)`; otherwise, the error is set equal to the; `sqrt(bin content)`. To return the error for a given bin number, do:. ``` {.cpp}; Double_t error = h->GetBinError(bin);; ```. Empty bins are excluded in the fit when using the Chi-square fit method.; When fitting an histogram representing counts (i.e with Poisson statistics) it is recommended to; use the Log-Likelihood method (option ‘`L`' or ""`WL`""), particularly in case of low statistics.; When the histogram has been filled with weights different than one, a weighted likelihood method can be used; and the errors retrieved from the fit are corrected following a procedure described in paragraph 8.5.2 of the book,; *F. James, Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics, 2nd Edition*. ### Fit Statistics. You can change the statistics box to display the fit parameters with the; `TStyle::SetOptFit(mode)` method.

All of this is better explained in the ``xray/xray_log_interface.h`` header. Basic Mode; ----------. XRay supports a basic logging mode which will trace the application's; execution, and periodically append to a single log. This mode can be; installed/enabled by setting ``xray_mode=xray-basic`` in the ``XRAY_OPTIONS``; environment variable. Combined with ``patch_premain=true`` this can allow for; tracing applications from start to end. Like all the other modes installed through ``__xray_log_select_mode(...)``, the; implementation can be configured through the ``__xray_log_init_mode(...)``; function, providing the mode string and the flag options. Basic-mode specific; defaults can be provided in the ``XRAY_BASIC_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Flight Data Recorder Mode; -------------------------. XRay supports a logging mode which allows the application to only capture a; fixed amount of memory's worth of events. Flight Data Recorder (FDR) mode works; very much like a plane's ""black box"" which keeps recording data to memory in a; fixed-size circular queue of buffers, and have the data available; programmatically until the buffers are finalized and flushed. To use FDR mode; on your application, you may set the ``xray_mode`` variable to ``xray-fdr`` in; the ``XRAY_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Additional options to the FDR mode; implementation can be provided in the ``XRAY_FDR_OPTIONS`` environment; variable. Programmatic configuration can be done by calling; ``__xray_log_init_mode(""xray-fdr"", <configuration string>)`` once it has been; selected/installed. When the buffers are flushed to disk, the result is a binary trace format; described by `XRay FDR format <XRayFDRFormat.html>`_. When FDR mode is on, it will keep writing and recycling memory buffers until; the logging implementation is finalized -- at which point it can be flushed a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst:8829,log,logging,8829,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst,1,['log'],['logging']

This can be used as an alternative to PyKeras Interface for complex models providing more flexibility and power. ## RooFit Libraries. - Extension / updates of the doxygen reference guide.; - Allow for removing RooPlot from global directory management, see [RooPlot::AddDirectory](https://root.cern/doc/v624/classRooPlot.html#a47f7ba71dcaca30ad9ee295dee89c9b8); and [RooPlot::SetDirectory](https://root.cern/doc/v624/classRooPlot.html#a5938bc6d5c47d94c2f04fdcc10c1c026); - Hash-assisted finding of elements in RooWorkspace. Large RooWorkspace objects were slow in finding elements.; This was improved using a hash map.; - Stabilise RooStats::HypoTestInverter. It can now tolerate a few failed fits when conducting hypothesis tests.; This is relevant when a few points in a parameter scan don't converge due to numerical or model instabilities.; These points will be skipped, and HypoTestInverter can continue.; - Tweak pull / residual plots. ROOT automatically zoomed out a bit when a pull / residual plot is created. Now, the; axis range of the original plot is transferred to the residual plot, so the pulls can be drawn below the main plot. ### Massive speed up of RooFit's `BatchMode` on CPUs with vector extensions. RooFit's [`BatchMode`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#a8f802a3a93467d5b7b089e3ccaec0fa8) has been around; [since ROOT 6.20](https://root.cern/doc/v620/release-notes.html#fast-function-evaluation-and-vectorisation), but to; fully use vector extensions of modern CPUs, a manual compilation of ROOT was necessary, setting the required compiler flags.

A logical AND can be performed if all the arguments are either; 0 or 1. ``!cast<``\ *type*\ ``>(``\ *a*\ ``)``; This operator performs a cast on *a* and produces the result.; If *a* is not a string, then a straightforward cast is performed, say; between an ``int`` and a ``bit``, or between record types. This allows; casting a record to a class. If a record is cast to ``string``, the; record's name is produced. If *a* is a string, then it is treated as a record name and looked up in; the list of all defined records. The resulting record is expected to be of; the specified *type*. For example, if ``!cast<``\ *type*\ ``>(``\ *name*\ ``)``; appears in a multiclass definition, or in a; class instantiated inside a multiclass definition, and the *name* does not; reference any template arguments of the multiclass, then a record by; that name must have been instantiated earlier; in the source file.

Testability,"tation allows for; mapping previously defined memory definitions into the execution context of a; process. The value name refers to a previously defined memory definition and; the address is a decimal number that specifies the address the memory; definition should start at. Note that a single memory definition can be; mapped multiple times. Using this annotation requires the subprocess; execution mode.; * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-SNIPPET-ADDRESS <address>` - This annotation allows for; setting the address where the beginning of the snippet to be executed will; be mapped in at. The address is given in hexadecimal. Note that the snippet; also includes setup code, so the instruction exactly at the specified; address will not be the first instruction in the snippet. Using this; annotation requires the subprocess execution mode. This is useful in; cases where the memory accessed by the snippet depends on the location; of the snippet, like RIP-relative addressing. EXAMPLE 1: benchmarking instructions; ------------------------------------. Assume you have an X86-64 machine. To measure the latency of a single; instruction, run:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-exegesis --mode=latency --opcode-name=ADD64rr. Measuring the uop decomposition or inverse throughput of an instruction works similarly:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-exegesis --mode=uops --opcode-name=ADD64rr; $ llvm-exegesis --mode=inverse_throughput --opcode-name=ADD64rr.

More details can be found in :ref:`the SPIR-V support section <spir-v>`. - SPIR is available as a generic target to allow portable bitcode to be produced; that can be used across GPU toolchains. The implementation follows `the SPIR; specification <https://www.khronos.org/spir>`_. There are two flavors; available for 32 and 64 bits. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spir test.cl -emit-llvm -c; $ clang --target=spir64 test.cl -emit-llvm -c. Clang will generate SPIR v1.2 compatible IR for OpenCL versions up to 2.0 and; SPIR v2.0 for OpenCL v2.0 or C++ for OpenCL. - x86 is used by some implementations that are x86 compatible and currently; remains for backwards compatibility (with older implementations prior to; SPIR target support). For ""non-SPMD"" targets which cannot spawn multiple; work-items on the fly using hardware, which covers practically all non-GPU; devices such as CPUs and DSPs, additional processing is needed for the kernels; to support multiple work-item execution. For this, a 3rd party toolchain,; such as for example `POCL <http://portablecl.org/>`_, can be used. This target does not support multiple memory segments and, therefore, the fake; address space map can be added using the :ref:`-ffake-address-space-map; <opencl_fake_address_space_map>` flag.

Testability,"tation remains however the same.; A new method TF1::operator()(double x, double y=0, double z) which is equivalent to TF1::Eval has been added for using TF1 as a callable object.; New templated methods TF1::SetFunction for generic C++ callable objects or for class member functions. TH1. Fixed a bug in the TH1::KolmogorovTest function in the case of scaled or weighted histograms. The routine has been improved and; now could also be used for comparing an histogram with a function if it is represented as an histogram with zero errors (equivalent to the case of options ""F1"" or ""F2"" in the original HDIFF routine of HBOOK). The bug has been fixed also for the TH2 and TH3 corresponding method. In addition in the case of TH3 use now all 6 axis combinations for estimating the maximum deviation. This is consistent with what is done in the 2D case.; Improved the TH1::Chi2Test for the treatment of empty bins in the histograms. If both histograms have one empty bin, the number of degree of freedom is decreased by one but the test is performed without reporting an error. If only one histogram is having an empty bin it is considered in the comparison. Fixed a bug in preserving the global statistic information after scaling, adding or rebinning the histogram. TH2. Improve TH2::FitFitSliceX and TH2::FitFitSliceY by adding the possibility to return the generated histograms in a TObjArray when the passed pointer is not null. Support also variable bin size histograms. Improve histogram projections. The implementation of TH2::ProjectionX and TH2::ProjectionY has been combined in a single private method. TH3. Fixed a couple of bugs in TH3::Project3DProfile. TProfile and TProfile2D. Add a new option ""W"" in TProfile::ProjectionX and TProfile::ProjectionXY to be able to return the equivalent weighted filled histogram.

SNIPPET ANNOTATIONS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` supports benchmarking arbitrary snippets of assembly.; However, benchmarking these snippets often requires some setup so that they; can execute properly. :program:`llvm-exegesis` has five annotations and some; additional utilities to help with setup so that snippets can be benchmarked; properly. * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <register name>` - Adding this annotation to the text; assembly snippet to be benchmarked marks the register as requiring a definition.; A value will automatically be provided unless a second parameter, a hex value,; is passed in. This is done with the `LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <register name> <hex value>`; format. `<hex value>` is a bit pattern used to fill the register. If it is a; value smaller than the register, it is sign extended to match the size of the; register.; * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-LIVEIN <register name>` - This annotation allows specifying; registers that should keep their value upon starting the benchmark. Values; can be passed through registers from the benchmarking setup in some cases.; The registers and the values assigned to them that can be utilized in the; benchmarking script with a `LLVM-EXEGESIS-LIVEIN` are as follows:. * Scratch memory register - The specific register that this value is put in; is platform dependent (e.g., it is the RDI register on X86 Linux). Setting; this register as a live in ensures that a pointer to a block of memory (1MB); is placed within this register that can be used by the snippet.; * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-MEM-DEF <value name> <size> <value>` - This annotation allows; specifying memory definitions that can later be mapped into the execution; process of a snippet with the `LLVM-EXEGESIS-MEM-MAP` annotation.

Testability,"te is identical in its behavior and usage to 'ns_returns_retained'; except for the distinction of returning a Core Foundation object instead of a; Cocoa object. This distinction is important for the following reason:; as Core Foundation is a C API,; the analyzer cannot always tell that a pointer return value refers to a; Core Foundation object.; In contrast, it is; trivial for the analyzer to recognize if a pointer refers to a Cocoa object; (given the Objective-C type system). Placing on C functions: When placing the attribute; 'cf_returns_retained' on the declarations of C functions, the analyzer; interprets the function as:. Returning a Core Foundation Object; Treating the function as if it its name; contained the keywords ""create"" or ""copy"". This means the; returned object as a +1 retain count that must be released by the caller, either; by sending a release message (via toll-free bridging to an Objective-C; object pointer), or calling CFRelease or a similar function.

Testability,"te many branches. Each branch has; its own buffer in memory. In case of many branches (say more than 100),; you should adjust the buffer size accordingly. A recommended buffer size; is 32000 bytes if you have less than 50 branches. Around 16000 bytes if; you have less than 100 branches and 4000 bytes if you have more than 500; branches. These numbers are recommended for computers with memory size; ranging from 32MB to 256MB. If you have more memory, you should specify; larger buffer sizes. However, in this case, do not forget that your file; might be used on another machine with a smaller memory configuration. #### Performance Considerations when Splitting a Branch. A split branch is faster to read, but slightly slower to write. The; reading is quicker because variables of the same type are stored; consecutively and the type does not have to be read each time. It is; slower to write because of the large number of buffers as described; above. See "". Performance Benchmarks"" for performance impact of split and non-split; mode. #### Rules for Splitting. When splitting a branch, variables of different types are handled; differently. Here are the rules that apply when splitting a branch. - If a data member is a basic type, it becomes one branch of class; **`TBranchElement`**. - A data member can be an array of basic types. In this case, one; single branch is created for the array. - A data member can be a pointer to an array of basic types. The; length can vary, and must be specified in the comment field of the; data member in the class definition. See ""Input/Output"". - Pointer data member are not split, except for pointers to a; **`TClonesArray`**. The **`TClonesArray`** (pointed to) is split if; the split level is greater than two. When the split level is one,; the **`TClonesArray`** is not split. - If a data member is a pointer to an object, a special branch is; created. The branch will be filled by calling the class `Streamer`; function to serialize the object into the",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:26761,Benchmark,Benchmarks,26761,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['Benchmark'],['Benchmarks']

You can also call; **`TTree::Autosave` in the acquisition loop every `n `entry.**. ### Trees with Circular Buffers. When a **`TTree`** is memory resident, you set it up so that it retains; retain only the last few entries. For example, this can be very useful; for monitoring purpose. ``` {.cpp}; void TTree::SetCircular(Long64_t maxEntries);; ```. where `maxEntries` is the maximum number of entries to be kept in the; buffers. When the number of entries exceeds this value, the first; entries in the **`Tree`** are deleted and the buffers used again. An; example of a script using a circular buffer is shown below:. ``` {.cpp}; void circular() {; gROOT->cd(); //make sure that the Tree is memory resident; TTree *T = new TTree(""T"",""test circular buffers"");; TRandom r;; Float_t px,py,pz;; Double_t random;; UShort_t i;; T->Branch(""px"",&px,""px/F"");; T->Branch(""py"",&py,""py/F"");; T->Branch(""pz"",&pz,""pz/F"");; T->Branch(""random"",&random,""random/D"");; T->Branch(""i"",&i,""i/s"");; T->SetCircular(20000);; for (i = 0; i < 65000; i++) {; r.Rannor(px,py);; pz = px*px + py*py;; random = r.Rndm();; T->Fill();; }; T->Print();; }; ```. ### Size of TTree in the File. When writing a **`TTree`** to a file, if the file size reaches the value; stored in the `TTree::GetMaxTreeSize()`, the current file is closed and; a new file is created. If the original file is named ""`myfile.root`"",; subsequent files are named ""`myfile_1.root`"", ""`myfile_2.root`"", etc. Currently, the automatic change of file is restricted to the case where; the tree is in the top level directory. The file should not contain; sub-directories. Before switching to a new file, the tree header is; written to the current file, then the current file is closed. To process; the multiple files created by `ChangeFile()`, one must use a; **`TChain`**.

This test suite is located in the; ``cross-project-tests/debuginfo-tests`` directory. Quick start; ===========. The tests are located in two separate repositories. The unit and; regression tests are in the main ""llvm""/ directory under the directories; ``llvm/unittests`` and ``llvm/test`` (so you get these tests for free with the; main LLVM tree).

COMPARE; ~~~~~~~; When dealing with debug information, there are situations when the; printing of the elements is not the correct approach. That is the case,; when we are interested in the effects caused by different versions of; the same toolchain, or the impact of specific compiler optimizations. For those cases, we are looking to see which elements have been added; or removed. Due to the complicated debug information format, it is very; difficult to use a regular diff tool to find those elements; even; impossible when dealing with different debug formats. :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` supports a logical element comparison,; allowing to find semantic differences between logical views, produced by; different toolchain versions or even debug information formats. When comparing logical views created from different debug formats, its; accuracy depends on how close the debug information represents the; user code. For instance, a logical view created from a binary file with; DWARF debug information may include more detailed data than a logical; view created from a binary file with CodeView/COFF debug information. The following options describe the elements to compare. .. option:: --compare=<value[,value,...]>. With **value** being one of the options in the following list. .. code-block:: text. =all: Include all the below elements. .. code-block:: text. =lines: Include lines.; =scopes: Include scopes.; =symbols: Include symbols.; =types: Include types. :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` takes the first binary file on the; command line as the **reference** and the second one as the **target**.; To get a more descriptive report, the comparison is done twice. The; reference and target views are swapped, in order to produce those; **missing** elements from the target view and those **added** elements; to the reference view.

Nearly all of these variable names begin with; ``LLVM_``. **BUILD_SHARED_LIBS**:BOOL; Flag indicating if each LLVM component (e.g. Support) is built as a shared; library (ON) or as a static library (OFF). Its default value is OFF. On; Windows, shared libraries may be used when building with MinGW, including; mingw-w64, but not when building with the Microsoft toolchain. .. note:: BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is only recommended for use by LLVM developers.; If you want to build LLVM as a shared library, you should use the; ``LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB`` option. **LLVM_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS**:STRING; Used to decide if LLVM should be built with ABI breaking checks or; not. Allowed values are `WITH_ASSERTS` (default), `FORCE_ON` and; `FORCE_OFF`. `WITH_ASSERTS` turns on ABI breaking checks in an; assertion enabled build. `FORCE_ON` (`FORCE_OFF`) turns them on; (off) irrespective of whether normal (`NDEBUG`-based) assertions are; enabled or not. A version of LLVM built with ABI breaking checks; is not ABI compatible with a version built without it. **LLVM_ADDITIONAL_BUILD_TYPES**:LIST; Adding a semicolon separated list of additional build types to this flag; allows for them to be specified as values in CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE without; encountering a fatal error during the configuration process. **LLVM_UNREACHABLE_OPTIMIZE**:BOOL; This flag controls the behavior of `llvm_unreachable()` in release build; (when assertions are disabled in general).

Iterators in key classes have been updated, such that many workflows in RooFit are 10 - 20% faster. #### Legacy iterators; The (three kinds) of legacy iterators in RooFit are still supported, such that old code will not break, but they are slower than `begin(), end()` and range-based for loops. **Important caveat**:; The old RooFit collections could be modified while iterating. The STL-like iterators do not support this (as for a *e.g.* std::vector)! Using the legacy iterators with the new collections (*i.e.* in existing code), mutating the collection is still possible in the following cases:; - Inserting/deleting elements **after** the current iterator.; - Changing an element at a position **other than** the current iterator; - **But not** inserting/deleting before/at the current iterator position. With a debug build (with assertions), the legacy iterators will check that the collection is not mutated. In a release build, elements might be skipped or be iterated twice. #### Moving away from the slower iterators; The legacy iterators have been flagged with a special deprecation macro that can be used help the user use the recommended ROOT interface. Defining one of the [deprecation macros](#preprocessor-deprecation-macros) (either in a single translation unit or in the build system), and creating a legacy iterator will trigger a compiler warning such as:; ```; <path>/RooChebychev.cxx:66:34: warning: 'createIterator' is deprecated: There is a superior alternative: begin(), end() and range-based for loops.

We also ask that the OS distribution release managers test their packages with; the first candidate of every release, and report any *new* errors in GitHub.; If the bug can be reproduced with an unpatched upstream version of the release; candidate (as opposed to the distribution's own build), the priority should be; release blocker. During the first round of testing, all regressions must be fixed before the; second release candidate is tagged. In the subsequent stages, the testing is only to ensure that bug; fixes previously merged in have not created new major problems. *This is not; the time to solve additional and unrelated bugs!* If no patches are merged in,; the release is determined to be ready and the release manager may move onto the; next stage. Reporting Regressions; ---------------------. Every regression that is found during the tests (as per the criteria above),; should be filled in a bug in GitHub and added to the release milestone. If a bug can't be reproduced, or stops being a blocker, it should be removed; from the Milestone. Debugging can continue, but on trunk. Backport Requests; -----------------.

This loop defines records named ``R0``, ``R1``, ``R2``, and ``R3``, along; with ``F0``, ``F1``, ``F2``, and ``F3``. ``dump`` --- print messages to stderr; -------------------------------------. A ``dump`` statement prints the input string to standard error; output. It is intended for debugging purpose. * At top level, the message is printed immediately. * Within a record/class/multiclass, `dump` gets evaluated at each; instantiation point of the containing record. .. productionlist::; Dump: ""dump"" `string` "";"".

TEST STATUS RESULTS; -------------------. Each test ultimately produces one of the following eight results:. **PASS**. The test succeeded. **FLAKYPASS**. The test succeeded after being re-run more than once. This only applies to; tests containing an ``ALLOW_RETRIES:`` annotation. **XFAIL**. The test failed, but that is expected. This is used for test formats which allow; specifying that a test does not currently work, but wish to leave it in the test; suite. **XPASS**. The test succeeded, but it was expected to fail. This is used for tests which; were specified as expected to fail, but are now succeeding (generally because; the feature they test was broken and has been fixed). **FAIL**. The test failed. **UNRESOLVED**. The test result could not be determined. For example, this occurs when the test; could not be run, the test itself is invalid, or the test was interrupted. **UNSUPPORTED**. The test is not supported in this environment. This is used by test formats; which can report unsupported tests. **TIMEOUT**. The test was run, but it timed out before it was able to complete. This is; considered a failure. Depending on the test format tests may produce additional information about; their status (generally only for failures).

This table; shows four runs of the demo script that creates 15 histograms with; different compression parameters. To make the numbers more significant,; the macro was modified to create 1000 histograms. We have included two; more examples to show the impact of compression on Trees in the next; chapter. ### Using the General Open Function of TFile. To make life simple we provide a general function to open any type of; file (except shared memory files of class **`TMapFile`**). This; functionality is provided by the static `TFile::Open()` function:. ``` {.cpp}; TFile *TFile::Open(const Text_t *name,Option_t *option="""",; const Text_t *title="""",Int_t compress,Int_t netopt); ```. Depending on the `name` argument, the function returns a **`TFile`** or one; of its derivations, for example a; **`TNetXNGFile`** or a **`TDavixFile`** object. In case a URL; specifies a local file, a **`TFile`** object will be returned (and of; course no login information is needed). The arguments of the `Open()`; function are the same as the ones for the **`TFile`** constructor. Using `ReOpen()` method it is possible to reopen a file with a; different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE,; RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either ""READ"" or; ""UPDATE"". The method returns:. - 0 in case the mode was successfully modified;. - 1 in case the mode did not change (it was already as requested or; there were wrong input arguments);. - -1 in case of failure. In the last case the file cannot be used; anymore. ## Remotely Access to ROOT Files. ROOT files can be accessed remotely in many ways, on the base of the protocol; URL. Among the most popular are XRootD (protocols 'root://' and 'xrd://') and; a Web server (protocl 'http://' or 'https://'). The rootd daemon is deprecated and has been removed in version 6.16/00.

The footer envelope has the following structure:. - Feature flags; - Header checksum (XxHash-3 64bit); - Schema extension record frame; - List frame of column group record frames; - List frame of cluster group record frames. The header checksum can be used to cross-check that header and footer belong together.; The meaning of the feature flags is the same as for the header.; The header flags do not need to be repeated.; Readers should combine (logical `or` of the bits) the feature flags from header and footer for the full set of flags. #### Schema Extension Record Frame. The schema extension record frame contains an additional schema description that is incremental; with respect to the schema contained in the header (see Section Header Envelope).; Specifically, it is a record frame with the following four fields; (identical to the last four fields in Header Envelope):. - List frame: list of field record frames; - List frame: list of column record frames; - List frame: list of alias column record frames; - List frame: list of extra type information. In general, a schema extension is optional, and thus this record frame might be empty.; The interpretation of the information contained therein should be identical; as if it was found directly at the end of the header.; This is necessary when fields have been added during writing.

With ``-fsanitize-coverage=trace-cmp`` (default with ``-fsanitize=fuzzer``); and extra run-time flag ``-use_value_profile=1`` the fuzzer will; collect value profiles for the parameters of compare instructions; and treat some new values as new coverage. The current implementation does roughly the following:. * The compiler instruments all CMP instructions with a callback that receives both CMP arguments.; * The callback computes `(caller_pc&4095) | (popcnt(Arg1 ^ Arg2) << 12)` and uses this value to set a bit in a bitset.; * Every new observed bit in the bitset is treated as new coverage. This feature has a potential to discover many interesting inputs,; but there are two downsides.; First, the extra instrumentation may bring up to 2x additional slowdown.; Second, the corpus may grow by several times. Fuzzer-friendly build mode; ---------------------------; Sometimes the code under test is not fuzzing-friendly. Examples:. - The target code uses a PRNG seeded e.g. by system time and; thus two consequent invocations may potentially execute different code paths; even if the end result will be the same. This will cause a fuzzer to treat; two similar inputs as significantly different and it will blow up the test corpus.; E.g. libxml uses ``rand()`` inside its hash table.; - The target code uses checksums to protect from invalid inputs.; E.g. png checks CRC for every chunk. In many cases it makes sense to build a special fuzzing-friendly build; with certain fuzzing-unfriendly features disabled. We propose to use a common build macro; for all such cases for consistency: ``FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION``. .. code-block:: c++. void MyInitPRNG() {; #ifdef FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION; // In fuzzing mode the behavior of the code should be deterministic.; srand(0);; #else; srand(time(0));; #endif; }.

Testability,"ters is arbitrary.; The difference is that `fitTo` has a step to analyze the `RooCmdArg` optional parameters for their content dynamically at runtime, while in `buildLikelihood` the arguments are statically typed and so no further runtime analysis is needed. As a side-note: one optional parameter of `RooNLLVar` that is not included in the `RooAbsL` tree is offsetting.; Offsetting has instead been implemented in the calculators that we'll describe next.; This is one of the consequences of the conceptual splitting of functionality into statistics and calculator classes.; Offsetting is a feature of calculation in a fitting context; it enhances numerical precision by subtracting the initial likelihood value from the value that the minimizer sees, thus setting it to zero for the minimizer.; Since this does not impact the derivative terms, it does not affect the fitting result, except for added numerical precision. ## Calculators; `RooFit::TestStatistics` provides two abstract base classes for likelihood calculation: `LikelihoodWrapper` and `LikelihoodGradientWrapper`.; These are used by the `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` implementation `MinuitFcnGrad` which expects them to, respectively, provide likelihood and likelihood gradient values for use by `Minuit2` in fitting the pdf to the dataset.

Testability,"tervalMap.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. IntervalMap is a compact map for small keys and values. It maps key intervals; instead of single keys, and it will automatically coalesce adjacent intervals.; When the map only contains a few intervals, they are stored in the map object; itself to avoid allocations. The IntervalMap iterators are quite big, so they should not be passed around as; STL iterators. The heavyweight iterators allow a smaller data structure. .. _dss_intervaltree:. llvm/ADT/IntervalTree.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``llvm::IntervalTree`` is a light tree data structure to hold intervals. It; allows finding all intervals that overlap with any given point. At this time,; it does not support any deletion or rebalancing operations. The IntervalTree is designed to be set up once, and then queried without any; further additions. .. _dss_map:. <map>; ^^^^^. std::map has similar characteristics to :ref:`std::set <dss_set>`: it uses a; single allocation per pair inserted into the map, it offers log(n) lookup with; an extremely large constant factor, imposes a space penalty of 3 pointers per; pair in the map, etc. std::map is most useful when your keys or values are very large, if you need to; iterate over the collection in sorted order, or if you need stable iterators; into the map (i.e. they don't get invalidated if an insertion or deletion of; another element takes place). .. _dss_mapvector:. llvm/ADT/MapVector.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``MapVector<KeyT,ValueT>`` provides a subset of the DenseMap interface. The; main difference is that the iteration order is guaranteed to be the insertion; order, making it an easy (but somewhat expensive) solution for non-deterministic; iteration over maps of pointers. It is implemented by mapping from key to an index in a vector of key,value; pairs. This provides fast lookup and iteration, but has two main drawbacks:; the key is stored twice and removing elements takes linear time.

Testability,"tes. There is no analogous flag to use when tracing indirect calls, branches, and; returns. The predicate state must be accumulated through some other means.; Fundamentally, this is the reverse of the problem posed in CFI: we need to; check where we came from rather than where we are going. For function-local; jump tables, this is easily arranged by testing the input to the jump table; within each destination (not yet implemented, use retpolines):; ```; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; jmpq *.LJTI0_0(,%rdi,8) # Indirect jump through table.; .LBB0_2: # %sw.bb; testq $0, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL. .LBB0_3: # %sw.bb1; testq $1, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL. .LBB0_5: # %sw.bb10; testq $2, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL; ... .section .rodata,""a"",@progbits; .p2align 3; .LJTI0_0:; .quad .LBB0_2; .quad .LBB0_3; .quad .LBB0_5; ...; ```. Returns have a simple mitigation technique on x86-64 (or other ABIs which have; what is called a ""red zone"" region beyond the end of the stack). This region is; guaranteed to be preserved across interrupts and context switches, making the; return address used in returning to the current code remain on the stack and; valid to read.

These files serve as both a marker of test suites; and as configuration files which :program:`lit` loads in order to understand; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite.

Testability,"test-suite Guide; ================. Quickstart; ----------. 1. The lit test runner is required to run the tests. You can either use one; from an LLVM build:. ```bash; % <path to llvm build>/bin/llvm-lit --version; lit 0.8.0dev; ```. An alternative is installing it as a python package in a python virtual; environment:. ```bash; % mkdir venv; % virtualenv venv; % . venv/bin/activate; % pip install svn+https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk/utils/lit; % lit --version; lit 0.8.0dev; ```. 2. Check out the `test-suite` module with:. ```bash; % git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git test-suite; ```. 3. Create a build directory and use CMake to configure the suite. Use the; `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` option to specify the compiler to test. Use a cache file; to choose a typical build configuration:. ```bash; % mkdir test-suite-build; % cd test-suite-build; % cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<path to llvm build>/bin/clang \; -C../test-suite/cmake/caches/O3.cmake \; ../test-suite; ```. **NOTE!** if you are using your built clang, and you want to build and run the; MicroBenchmarks/XRay microbenchmarks, you need to add `compiler-rt` to your; `LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES` cmake flag. 4. Build the benchmarks:. ```text; % make; Scanning dependencies of target timeit-target; [ 0%] Building C object tools/CMakeFiles/timeit-target.dir/timeit.c.o; [ 0%] Linking C executable timeit-target; ...; ```. 5. Run the tests with lit:. ```text; % llvm-lit -v -j 1 -o results.json .; -- Testing: 474 tests, 1 threads --; PASS: test-suite :: MultiSource/Applications/ALAC/decode/alacconvert-decode.test (1 of 474); ********** TEST 'test-suite :: MultiSource/Applications/ALAC/decode/alacconvert-decode.test' RESULTS **********; compile_time: 0.2192; exec_time: 0.0462; hash: ""59620e187c6ac38b36382685ccd2b63b""; size: 83348; **********; PASS: test-suite :: MultiSource/Applications/ALAC/encode/alacconvert-encode.test (2 of 474); ...; ```. 6.

You can find further information in the respective README files such as; `test-suite/External/SPEC/README`. For the SPEC benchmarks you can switch between the `test`, `train` and; `ref` input datasets via the `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` configuration option.; The `train` dataset is used by default. Custom Suites; -------------. You can build custom suites using the test-suite infrastructure. A custom suite; has a `CMakeLists.txt` file at the top directory. The `CMakeLists.txt` will be; picked up automatically if placed into a subdirectory of the test-suite or when; setting the `TEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS` variable:. ```bash; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS=path/to/my/benchmark-suite ../test-suite; ```. Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile guided optimization requires to compile and run twice. First the; benchmark should be compiled with profile generation instrumentation enabled; and setup for training data. The lit runner will merge the profile files; using `llvm-profdata` so they can be used by the second compilation run. Example:; ```bash; # Profile generation run using LLVM IR PGO:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=train \; ../test-suite; % make; % llvm-lit .; # Use the profile data for compilation and actual benchmark run:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=OFF \; -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_USE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=ref \; .; % make; % llvm-lit -o result.json .; ```. To use Clang frontend's PGO instead of LLVM IR PGO, set `-DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=OFF`. The `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` setting only affects the SPEC benchmark suites.

This is why it is highly recommended to run this; in-process fuzzer with all sanitizers to detect most bugs on the spot.; * It is harder to protect the in-process fuzzer from excessive memory; consumption and infinite loops in the target library (still possible).; * The target library should not have significant global state that is not; reset between the runs.; * Many interesting target libraries are not designed in a way that supports; the in-process fuzzer interface (e.g. require a file path instead of a; byte array).; * If a single test run takes a considerable fraction of a second (or; more) the speed benefit from the in-process fuzzer is negligible.; * If the target library runs persistent threads (that outlive; execution of one test) the fuzzing results will be unreliable.

Testability,"tests robust, always use ``opt ... < %s`` in the RUN line.; :program:`opt` does not output a ``ModuleID`` when input comes from stdin. Platform-Specific Tests; -----------------------. Whenever adding tests that require the knowledge of a specific platform,; either related to code generated, specific output or back-end features,; you must make sure to isolate the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True. Other platform-specific tests are those that depend on a specific feature; of a specific sub-architecture, for example only to Intel chips that support ``AVX2``.

In some tests of `MyCondition` using an internal mutex, `Broadcast()`; activated only one thread (probably depending whether `MyCondition` had; been signaled before). - `MyCondition.TimedWait(secs,nanosecs)` waits for `MyCondition` until; the *absolute* time in seconds and nanoseconds since beginning of; the epoch (January, 1st, 1970) is reached; to use relative timeouts; ‘‘delta'', it is required to calculate the absolute time at the; beginning of waiting ‘‘now''; for example:. ``` {.cpp}; Ulong_t now,then,delta; // seconds; TDatime myTime; // root daytime class; myTime.Set(); // myTime set to ""now""; now=myTime.Convert(); // to seconds since 1970; ```. - Return value wait of `MyCondition.TimedWait` should be 0, if; `MyCondition.Signal()` was received, and should be nonzero, if; timeout was reached.

Testability,"textual elements; ===================. These are elements that supply information necessary to convert presentation; elements to symbolic form. Unlike presentation elements, they are not directly; related to the surrounding text. Contextual elements should appear alone on; lines with no other non-whitespace text, so that the symbolizing filter might; elide the whole line from its output without hiding any other log text. The contextual elements themselves do not necessarily need to be presented in; human-readable output. However, the information they impart may be essential to; understanding the logging text even after symbolization. So it's recommended; that this information be preserved in some form when the original raw log with; markup may no longer be readily accessible for whatever reason. Contextual elements should appear in the logging stream before they are needed.; That is, if some piece of context may affect how the symbolizing filter would; interpret or present a later presentation element, the necessary contextual; elements should have appeared somewhere earlier in the logging stream. It should; always be possible for the symbolizing filter to be implemented as a single pass; over the raw logging stream, accumulating context and massaging text as it goes. ``{{{reset}}}``. This should be output before any other contextual element. The need for this; contextual element is to support implementations that handle logs coming from; multiple processes. Such implementations might not know when a new process; starts or ends. Because some identifying information (like process IDs) might; be the same between old and new processes, a way is needed to distinguish two; processes with such identical identifying information. This element informs; such implementations to reset the state of a filter so that information from a; previous process's contextual elements is not assumed for new process that; just happens have the same identifying information. ``{{{module:%i:%s:",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst:18046,log,logging,18046,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,1,['log'],['logging']

However, it is considered to be part of the module for the purpose; of checking *use-declaration*\s, and must still be a lexically-valid header; file. In the future, we intend to pre-tokenize such headers and include the; token sequence within the prebuilt module representation. A header with the ``exclude`` specifier is excluded from the module. It will not be included when the module is built, nor will it be considered to be part of the module, even if an ``umbrella`` header or directory would otherwise make it part of the module. **Example:** The C header ``assert.h`` is an excellent candidate for a textual header, because it is meant to be included multiple times (possibly with different ``NDEBUG`` settings).

Testability,"th a few simple extensions we've; covered in the last chapters, we have grown a real-ish language.

For example, we can now add a nice sequencing; operator (printd is defined to print out the specified value and a; newline):. ::. ready> extern printd(x);; Read extern:; declare double @printd(double). ready> def binary : 1 (x y) 0; # Low-precedence operator that ignores operands.; ...; ready> printd(123) : printd(456) : printd(789);; 123.000000; 456.000000; 789.000000; Evaluated to 0.000000. We can also define a bunch of other ""primitive"" operations, such as:. ::. # Logical unary not.; def unary!(v); if v then; 0; else; 1;. # Unary negate.; def unary-(v); 0-v;. # Define > with the same precedence as <.; def binary> 10 (LHS RHS); RHS < LHS;. # Binary logical or, which does not short circuit.; def binary| 5 (LHS RHS); if LHS then; 1; else if RHS then; 1; else; 0;. # Binary logical and, which does not short circuit.; def binary& 6 (LHS RHS); if !LHS then; 0; else; !!RHS;. # Define = with slightly lower precedence than relationals.; def binary = 9 (LHS RHS); !(LHS < RHS | LHS > RHS);. # Define ':' for sequencing: as a low-precedence operator that ignores operands; # and just returns the RHS.; def binary : 1 (x y) y;. Given the previous if/then/else support, we can also define interesting; functions for I/O. For example, the following prints out a character; whose ""density"" reflects the value passed in: the lower the value, the; denser the character:. ::. ready> extern putchard(char);; ...; ready> def printdensity(d); if d > 8 then; putchard(32) # ' '; else if d > 4 then; putchard(46) # '.'; else if d > 2 then; putchard(43) # '+'; else; putchard(42); # '*'; ...; ready> printdensity(1): printdensity(2): printdensity(3):; printdensity(4): printdensity(5): printdensity(9):; putchard(10);; **++.; Evaluated to 0.000000.

We generate:. _X:; lis r2, ha16(.CPI_X_0); lfd f0, lo16(.CPI_X_0)(r2); lis r2, ha16(.CPI_X_1); lfd f2, lo16(.CPI_X_1)(r2); fmadd f0, f1, f0, f2; lis r2, ha16(.CPI_X_2); lfd f1, lo16(.CPI_X_2)(r2); lis r2, ha16(.CPI_X_3); lfd f2, lo16(.CPI_X_3)(r2); fmadd f1, f0, f1, f2; blr. It would be better to materialize .CPI_X into a register, then use immediates; off of the register to avoid the lis's. This is even more important in PIC ; mode. Note that this (and the static variable version) is discussed here for GCC:; http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2006-02/msg00133.html. Here's another example (the sgn function):; double testf(double a) {; return a == 0.0 ? 0.0 : (a > 0.0 ? 1.0 : -1.0);; }. it produces a BB like this:; LBB1_1: ; cond_true; lis r2, ha16(LCPI1_0); lfs f0, lo16(LCPI1_0)(r2); lis r2, ha16(LCPI1_1); lis r3, ha16(LCPI1_2); lfs f2, lo16(LCPI1_2)(r3); lfs f3, lo16(LCPI1_1)(r2); fsub f0, f0, f1; fsel f1, f0, f2, f3; blr . ===-------------------------------------------------------------------------===.

Getting a Modern Host C++ Toolchain; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. This section mostly applies to Linux and older BSDs. On macOS, you should; have a sufficiently modern Xcode, or you will likely need to upgrade until you; do. Windows does not have a ""system compiler"", so you must install either Visual; Studio 2019 (or later), or a recent version of mingw64. FreeBSD 10.0 and newer; have a modern Clang as the system compiler. However, some Linux distributions and some other or older BSDs sometimes have; extremely old versions of GCC. These steps attempt to help you upgrade you; compiler even on such a system. However, if at all possible, we encourage you; to use a recent version of a distribution with a modern system compiler that; meets these requirements. Note that it is tempting to install a prior; version of Clang and libc++ to be the host compiler, however libc++ was not; well tested or set up to build on Linux until relatively recently. As; a consequence, this guide suggests just using libstdc++ and a modern GCC as the; initial host in a bootstrap, and then using Clang (and potentially libc++). The first step is to get a recent GCC toolchain installed. The most common; distribution on which users have struggled with the version requirements is; Ubuntu Precise, 12.04 LTS. For this distribution, one easy option is to install; the `toolchain testing PPA`_ and use it to install a modern GCC. There is; a really nice discussions of this on the `ask ubuntu stack exchange`_ and a; `github gist`_ with updated commands. However, not all users can use PPAs and; there are many other distributions, so it may be necessary (or just useful, if; you're here you *are* doing compiler development after all) to build and install; GCC from source. It is also quite easy to do these days. .. _toolchain testing PPA:; https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-to",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst:15751,test,tested,15751,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability,"th this type metadata, we can now use the ``llvm.type.test`` intrinsic to; test whether a given pointer is compatible with a type identifier. Working; backwards, if ``llvm.type.test`` returns true for a particular pointer,; we can also statically determine the identities of the virtual functions; that a particular virtual call may call. For example, if a program assumes; a pointer to be a member of ``!""_ZST1A""``, we know that the address can; be only be one of ``_ZTV1A+16``, ``_ZTV1B+16`` or ``_ZTV1D+16`` (i.e. the; address points of the vtables of A, B and D respectively). If we then load; an address from that pointer, we know that the address can only be one of; ``&A::f``, ``&B::f`` or ``&D::f``. .. _address point: https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#vtable-general. Testing Addresses For Type Membership; =====================================. If a program tests an address using ``llvm.type.test``, this will cause; a link-time optimization pass, ``LowerTypeTests``, to replace calls to this; intrinsic with efficient code to perform type member tests. At a high level,; the pass will lay out referenced globals in a consecutive memory region in; the object file, construct bit vectors that map onto that memory region,; and generate code at each of the ``llvm.type.test`` call sites to test; pointers against those bit vectors. Because of the layout manipulation, the; globals' definitions must be available at LTO time. For more information,; see the `control flow integrity design document`_. A type identifier that identifies functions is transformed into a jump table,; which is a block of code consisting of one branch instruction for each; of the functions associated with the type identifier that branches to the; target function. The pass will redirect any taken function addresses to the; corresponding jump table entry. In the object file's symbol table, the jump; table entries take the identities of the original functions, so that addresses; taken outside th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TypeMetadata.rst:5036,test,test,5036,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TypeMetadata.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TypeMetadata.rst,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"
Testability,"th very short (often purely numeric) names. What to do when bugpoint isn't enough; =====================================; 	; Sometimes, ``bugpoint`` is not enough. In particular, InstCombine and; TargetLowering both have visitor structured code with lots of potential; transformations. If the process of using bugpoint has left you with still too; much code to figure out and the problem seems to be in instcombine, the; following steps may help. These same techniques are useful with TargetLowering; as well. Turn on ``-debug-only=instcombine`` and see which transformations within; instcombine are firing by selecting out lines with ""``IC``"" in them. At this point, you have a decision to make. Is the number of transformations; small enough to step through them using a debugger? If so, then try that. If there are too many transformations, then a source modification approach may; be helpful. In this approach, you can modify the source code of instcombine to; disable just those transformations that are being performed on your test input; and perform a binary search over the set of transformations. One set of places; to modify are the ""``visit*``"" methods of ``InstCombiner`` (*e.g.*; ``visitICmpInst``) by adding a ""``return false``"" as the first line of the; method. If that still doesn't remove enough, then change the caller of; ``InstCombiner::DoOneIteration``, ``InstCombiner::runOnFunction`` to limit the; number of iterations. You may also find it useful to use ""``-stats``"" now to see what parts of; instcombine are firing. This can guide where to put additional reporting code. At this point, if the amount of transformations is still too large, then; inserting code to limit whether or not to execute the body of the code in the; visit function can be helpful. Add a static counter which is incremented on; every invocation of the function. Then add code which simply returns false on; desired ranges.

But the maintenance costs of such diverse ecosystem is non trivial, so we divide; the level of support in two tiers: core and peripheral, with two; different levels of impact and responsibilities.

Stack memory allocated with the alloca; instruction is fully general: you can pass the address of the stack slot; to functions, you can store it in other variables, etc. In our example; above, we could rewrite the example to use the alloca technique to avoid; using a PHI node:. .. code-block:: llvm. @G = weak global i32 0 ; type of @G is i32*; @H = weak global i32 0 ; type of @H is i32*. define i32 @test(i1 %Condition) {; entry:; %X = alloca i32 ; type of %X is i32*.; br i1 %Condition, label %cond_true, label %cond_false. cond_true:; %X.0 = load i32, i32* @G; store i32 %X.0, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_false:; %X.1 = load i32, i32* @H; store i32 %X.1, i32* %X ; Update X; br label %cond_next. cond_next:; %X.2 = load i32, i32* %X ; Read X; ret i32 %X.2; }. With this, we have discovered a way to handle arbitrary mutable; variables without the need to create Phi nodes at all:. #. Each mutable variable becomes a stack allocation.; #. Each read of the variable becomes a load from the stack.; #. Each update of the variable becomes a store to the stack.; #. Taking the address of a variable just uses the stack address; directly.

Testability,"the LLVM testing; infrastructure, the tools needed to use it, and how to add and run; tests. Requirements; ============. In order to use the LLVM testing infrastructure, you will need all of the; software required to build LLVM, as well as `Python <http://python.org>`_ 3.6 or; later. LLVM Testing Infrastructure Organization; ========================================. The LLVM testing infrastructure contains three major categories of tests:; unit tests, regression tests and whole programs. The unit tests and regression; tests are contained inside the LLVM repository itself under ``llvm/unittests``; and ``llvm/test`` respectively and are expected to always pass -- they should be; run before every commit. The whole programs tests are referred to as the ""LLVM test suite"" (or; ""test-suite"") and are in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_.; For historical reasons, these tests are also referred to as the ""nightly; tests"" in places, which is less ambiguous than ""test-suite"" and remains; in use although we run them much more often than nightly. Unit tests; ----------. Unit tests are written using `Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/primer.md>`_; and `Google Mock <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md>`_; and are located in the ``llvm/unittests`` directory.; In general unit tests are reserved for targeting the support library and other; generic data structure, we prefer relying on regression tests for testing; transformations and analysis on the IR. Regression tests; ----------------. The regression tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory.

Testability,"the left most base class. Schema Evolution. Fix schema evolution problem in TTree::Draw by extending support in; TStreamerInfo::ReadValueAux to 'converted' numerical types, (; see issue in ROOT forum). When reading more than one TStreamerInfo for the same versioned; class, we now use the highest possible class version as the current; version of the class. Practically, we update the class version; when reading new (higher versioned) StreamerInfo until the Class; is actually used (i.e. TClass::GetClassVersion is call directly; or indirectly). In particular, if a file has several StreamerInfos for the same; versioned class, we will use the highest version number as the; 'current' class version (as opposed to the lowest until now). For backward compatibility TStreamerInfo::BuildCheck compares the checksum of; the on-file StreamerInfo not only to the current value of the class checksum; but also to the checksum calculated using the older algorithms. This patch extends this test to also be done when comparing 2 on-file StreamerInfos. This removes spurrious warning message when loading 2 older files which; were written with 2 different version of the TClass CheckSum algorithm; (and the in-memory class's version is greater than both TStreamerInfos'; class version).

Testability,"the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled. For example, this code will warn:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned Size = V.size();; assert(Size > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value);; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. These are two interesting different cases. In the first case, the call to; ``V.size()`` is only useful for the assert, and we don't want it executed when; assertions are disabled.

Testability,"the record header.; The recovery algorithm reads the file and creates the saved objects in; memory according to the header information. It then rebuilds the; directory and file structure. If the file is opened in write mode, the; recovery makes the correction on disk when the file is closed; however; if the file is opened in read mode, the correction can not be written to; disk. You can also explicitly invoke the recovery procedure by calling; the `TFile::Recover()` method. You can recover the directory structure,; but you cannot save what you recovered to the file on disk. In the; following example, we interrupted and aborted the previous ROOT session,; causing the file not to be closed. When we start a new session and; attempt to open the file, it gives us an explanation and status on the; recovery attempt. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f(""demo.root""); Warning in <TFile::TFile>: file demo.root probably not closed, trying to recover successfully recovered 15 keys; ```. ## The Logical ROOT File: TFile and TKey. We saw that the `TFile::Map()` method reads the file sequentially and; prints information about each record while scanning the file.

To; do so, `TFile` keeps a list of **`TKeys`**, which is; essentially an index to the objects in the file. The **`TKey`** class; describes the record headers of objects in the file. For example, we can; get the list of keys and print them. To find a specific object on the; file we can use the **`TFile::Get()` method.**. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f(""demo.root""); root[] f.GetListOfKeys()->Print(); TKey Name = h0, Title = histo nr:0, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = h1, Title = histo nr:1, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = h2, Title = histo nr:2, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = h3, Title = histo nr:3, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = h4, Title = histo nr:4, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = h5, Title = histo nr:5, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = h6, Ti",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:16288,Log,Logical,16288,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['Log'],['Logical']

Testability,"the root session.; See Environment Setup below for more information. ## Environment Setup. The behavior of a ROOT session can be tailored with the options in the; .`rootrc` file. At start-up, ROOT looks for a .`rootrc` file in the; following order:. - `./.rootrc` *`//local directory`*. - `$HOME/.rootrc ` *`//user directory`*. - `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc ` *`//global ROOT directory`*. If more than one `.rootrc` files are found in the search paths above,; the options are merged, with precedence local, user, global. While in; a session, to see current settings, you can do:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gEnv->Print(); ```. The `rootrc` file typically looks like:. ```; # Path used by dynamic loader to find shared libraries; Unix.*.Root.DynamicPath: .:~/rootlibs:$(ROOTSYS)/lib; Unix.*.Root.MacroPath: .:~/rootmacros:$(ROOTSYS)/macros. # Path where to look for TrueType fonts; Unix.*.Root.UseTTFonts: true; Unix.*.Root.TTFontPath:; ...; # Activate memory statistics; Rint.Load: rootalias.C; Rint.Logon: rootlogon.C; Rint.Logoff: rootlogoff.C; ...; Rint.Canvas.MoveOpaque: false; Rint.Canvas.HighLightColor: 5; ```. The various options are explained in `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc`. The; `.rootrc` file contents are combined. For example, if the flag to use; true type fonts is set to true in the `system.rootrc` file, you have; to set explicitly it false in your local `.rootrc` file if you do not; want to use true type fonts. Removing the `UseTTFonts `statement in; the local `.rootrc` file will not disable true fonts. The value of the; environment variable `ROOTDEBUG` overrides the value in the `.rootrc`; file at startup. Its value is used to set ***`gDebug`*** and helps for; quick turn on debug mode in **`TROOT`** startup.

This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``.

This set of threads doesn't change after; jump-threading, so the answer to the question posed above remains the same. .. _opportunistic_convergence:. Opportunistic convergent operations; -----------------------------------. Some programs have local regions of code that contain a sequence of convergent; operations where the code does not care about the exact set of threads with; which it is executed, but only that the set of threads is the same for all the; operations within the sequence. (If a subset of the convergent operations in the; sequence have additional, non-uniform control dependencies, then this is not; possible.

In this; case, :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor; <llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor>` can be used to express the desired; semantics. The following example function could be part of a hypothetical ""append buffer""; implementation, where threads conditionally write fixed-sized records; contiguously into a global buffer. The function ``@reserveSpaceInBuffer``; returns the index into the buffer at which the calling thread should store its; data. This could be achieved by using a simple atomic operation in every thread to; bump an allocation counter. However, the following implementation can be more performant on some hardware,; because it uses only a single atomic operation for an entire group of threads.; To do this, it first determines the total size of the group, which will be the; operand to the atomic operation, and then later broadcasts the result of the; atomic operation to all threads of the group, s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst:11880,log,logically,11880,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ConvergentOperations.rst,1,['log'],['logically']

Testability,"thmic or linear is an attribute of the pad,; not the axis or the histogram. The scale is an attribute of the pad; because you may want to draw the same histogram in linear scale in one; pad and in log scale in another pad. Frequently, we see several; histograms on top of each other in the same pad. It would be very; inconvenient to set the scale attribute for each histogram in a pad. Furthermore, if the logic was set in the histogram class (or each; object) the scale setting in each `Paint` method of all objects should; be tested. If you have a pad with a histogram, a right-click on the pad, outside of; the histograms frame will convince you. The `SetLogx()`, `SetLogy()` and; `SetLogz()` methods are there. As you see, **`TPad`** defines log scale; for the two directions `x` and `y` plus `z` if you want to draw a 3D; representation of some function or histogram. The way to set log scale in the x direction for the active pad is:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetLogx(1); ```. To reset log in the z direction:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetLogz(0); ```. If you have a divided pad, you need to set the scale on each of the; sub-pads. Setting it on the containing pad does not automatically; propagate to the sub-pads. Here is an example of how to set the log; scale for the x-axis on a canvas with four sub-pads:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCanvas MyCanvas(""MyCanvas"",""My Canvas""); root[] MyCanvas->Divide(2,2); root[] MyCanvas->cd(1); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(2); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(3); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); ```. ### WaitPrimitive method. When the `TPad::WaitPrimitive()` method is called with no arguments, it; will wait until a double click or any key pressed is executed in the; canvas. A call to `gSystem->Sleep(10)` has been added in the loop to; avoid consuming at all the CPU. This new option is convenient when; executing a macro.

Testability,"tices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test. If there; are relevant issues in the bug tracker, add references to those bug reports; (for example, ""See PR999 for more details"").; - Avoid undefined behavior and poison/undef values unless necessary. For; example, do not use patterns like ``br i1 undef``, which are likely to break; as a result of future optimizations.; - Minimize tests by removing unnecessary instructions, metadata, attributes,; etc. Tools like ``llvm-reduce`` can help automate this.; - Outside PhaseOrdering tests, only run a minimal set of passes. For example,; prefer ``opt -S -passes=instcombine`` over ``opt -S -O3``.; - Avoid unnamed instructions/blocks (such as ``%0`` or ``1:``), because they may; require renumbering on future test modifications. These can be removed by; running the test through ``opt -S -passes=instnamer``.; - Try to give values (including variables, blocks and functions) meaningful; names, and avoid retaining complex names generated by the optimization; pipeline (such as ``%foo.0.0.0.0.0.0``). Extra files; -----------. If your test requires extra files besides the file containing the ``RUN:`` lines; and the extra files are small, consider specifying them in the same file and; using ``split-file`` to extract them. For example,. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: split-file %s %t; ; RUN: llvm-link -S %t/a.ll %t/b.ll | FileCheck %s. ; CHECK: ... ;--- a.ll; ...; ;--- b.ll; ... The parts are separated by the regex ``^(.|//)--- <part>``. If you want to test relative line numbers like ``[[#@LINE+1]]``, specify; ``--leading-lines`` to add leading empty lines to preserve line numbers. If the extra files are large, the idiomatic place to put them is in a subdirectory ``Inputs``.; You can then refer to the extra files as ``%S/Inputs/foo.bar``.

When a single identifier is passed,; the lookup results for the identifier are printed to `stderr`. When an expression is passed,; the AST for the expression is printed to `stderr`.

Testability,"ting the limit higher than; 2 is thus harmless. To facilitate debugging, after reaching the limit, lit will make one extra pass; and report an error if the ``RUN:`` line changes again. In the above example,; setting the limit to 1 will thus cause lit to report an error instead of; producing incorrect output. Options; -------. The llvm lit configuration allows to customize some things with user options:. ``llc``, ``opt``, ...; Substitute the respective llvm tool name with a custom command line. This; allows to specify custom paths and default arguments for these tools.; Example:. % llvm-lit ""-Dllc=llc -verify-machineinstrs"". ``run_long_tests``; Enable the execution of long running tests. ``llvm_site_config``; Load the specified lit configuration instead of the default one. Other Features; --------------. To make RUN line writing easier, there are several helper programs. These; helpers are in the PATH when running tests, so you can just call them using; their name. For example:. ``not``; This program runs its arguments and then inverts the result code from it.; Zero result codes become 1. Non-zero result codes become 0. To make the output more useful, :program:`lit` will scan; the lines of the test case for ones that contain a pattern that matches; ``PR[0-9]+``. This is the syntax for specifying a PR (Problem Report) number; that is related to the test case. The number after ""PR"" specifies the; LLVM Bugzilla number. When a PR number is specified, it will be used in; the pass/fail reporting. This is useful to quickly get some context when; a test fails. Finally, any line that contains ""END."" will cause the special; interpretation of lines to terminate. This is generally done right after; the last RUN: line. This has two side effects:. (a) it prevents special interpretation of lines that are part of the test; program, not the instructions to the test case, and. (b) it speeds things up for really big test cases by avoiding; interpretation of the remainder of the file.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:38594,test,test,38594,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,6,['test'],['test']

Testability,"ting; -----------------. The pre-merge tests are a continuous integration (CI) workflow. The workflow; checks the patches uploaded to Phabricator before a user merges them to the main; branch - thus the term *pre-merge testing*. When a user uploads a patch to Phabricator, Phabricator triggers the checks and; then displays the results. This way bugs in a patch are contained during the; code review stage and do not pollute the main branch. Our goal with pre-merge testing is to report most true problems while strongly; minimizing the number of false positive reports. Our goal is that problems; reported are always actionable. If you notice a false positive, please report; it so that we can identify the cause. If you notice issues or have an idea on how to improve pre-merge checks, please; `create a new issue <https://github.com/google/llvm-premerge-checks/issues/new>`_; or give a ❤️ to an existing one. Requirements; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. To get a patch on Phabricator tested, the build server must be able to apply the; patch to the checked out git repository. Please make sure that either:. * You set a git hash as ``sourceControlBaseRevision`` in Phabricator which is; available on the GitHub repository,; * **or** you define the dependencies of your patch in Phabricator,; * **or** your patch can be applied to the main branch. Only then can the build server apply the patch locally and run the builds and; tests. Accessing build results; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Phabricator will automatically trigger a build for every new patch you upload or; modify. Phabricator shows the build results at the top of the entry. Clicking on; the links (in the red box) will show more details:. .. image:: Phabricator_premerge_results.png. The CI will compile and run tests, run clang-format and clang-tidy on lines; changed. If a unit test failed, this is shown below the build status.

Here ``%u`` is the frame number, which starts at zero for the location of the; fault being identified, increments to one for the caller of frame zero's call; frame, to two for the caller of frame one, etc. ``%p`` is the memory address; of a code location. Code locations in a backtrace come from two distinct sources. Most backtrace; frames describe a return address code location, i.e. the instruction; immediately after a call instruction. This is the location of code that has; yet to run, since the function called there has not yet returned. Hence the; code location of actual interest is usually the call site itself rather than; the return address, i.e. one instruction earlier. When presenting the source; location for a return address frame, the symbolizing filter will subtract one; byte or one instruction length from the actual return address for the call; site, with the intent that the address logged can be translated directly to a; source location for the call site and not for the apparent return site; thereafter (which can be confusing). When inlined functions are involved, the; call site and the return site can appear to be in different functions at; entirely unrelated source locations rather than just a line away, making the; confusion of showing the return site rather the call site quite severe. Often the first frame in a backtrace (""frame zero"") identifies the precise; code location of a fault, trap, or asynchronous interrupt rather than a return; address. At other times, even the first frame is actually a return address; (for example, backtraces collected at the time of an object allocation and; reported later when the allocated object is used or misused). When a system; supports in-thread trap handling, there may also be frames after the first; that represent a precise interrupted code location rather than a return; address, prese",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst:10909,log,logged,10909,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SymbolizerMarkupFormat.rst,1,['log'],['logged']

Bearer tokens are part of WLCG capability-based infrastructure with capability-based scheme which uses an infrastructure that describes what the bearer is allowed to do as opposed to who that bearer is. Token discovery procedure are developed according WLCG Bearer Token Discovery specification document (https://github.com/WLCG-AuthZ-WG/bearer-token-discovery/blob/master/specification.md). Short overview:. 1. If the `BEARER_TOKEN` environment variable is set, then the value is taken to be the token contents.; 2. If the `BEARER_TOKEN_FILE` environment variable is set, then its value is interpreted as a filename. The contents of the specified file are taken to be the token contents.; 3. If the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` environment variable is set, then take the token from the contents of `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bt_u$ID`(this additional location is intended to provide improved security for shared login environments as `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is defined to be user-specific as opposed to a system-wide directory.).; 4. Otherwise, take the token from `/tmp/bt_u$ID`. ## GUI Libraries. ### RBrowser improvements. - central factory methods to handle browsing, editing and drawing of different classes; - simple possibility to extend RBrowser on user-defined classes; - support of web-based geometry viewer; - better support of TTree drawing; - server-side handling of code editor and image viewer widgets; - rbrowser content is fully recovered when web-browser is reloaded; - load of widgets code only when really required (shorter startup time for RBrowser). ## Montecarlo Libraries. ## PROOF Libraries. ## Language Bindings. ## JavaScript ROOT. ### Major JSROOT update to version 6. - update all used libraries `d3.js`, `three.js`, `MathJax.js`, openui5; - change to Promise based interface for all async methods, remove call-back arguments; - change scripts",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md:26611,log,login,26611,README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md,1,['log'],['login']

Testability,"tion, are literally files that represent an; on-disk cache that contains the vital information necessary to reduce; some of the work needed to process a corresponding header file. While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:47215,test,test,47215,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"tions for assignments where a local variable (or a field of one) is the; LHS. In rare and complicated circumstances indirect assignments might be; optimized away without being tracked, but otherwise we make our best effort to; track all variable locations. The core idea is to track more information about source assignments in order; and preserve enough information to be able to defer decisions about whether to; use non-memory locations (register, constant) or memory locations until after; middle end optimisations have run. This is in opposition to using; `llvm.dbg.declare` and `llvm.dbg.value`, which is to make the decision for most; variables early on, which can result in suboptimal variable locations that may; be either incorrect or incomplete. A secondary goal of assignment tracking is to cause minimal additional work for; LLVM pass writers, and minimal disruption to LLVM in general. ## Status and usage. **Status**: Experimental work in progress. Enabling is strongly advised against; except for development and testing. **Enable in Clang**: `-Xclang -fexperimental-assignment-tracking`. That causes Clang to get LLVM to run the pass `declare-to-assign`. The pass; converts conventional debug intrinsics to assignment tracking metadata and sets; the module flag `debug-info-assignment-tracking` to the value `i1 true`. To; check whether assignment tracking is enabled for a module call; `isAssignmentTrackingEnabled(const Module &M)` (from `llvm/IR/DebugInfo.h`). ## Design and implementation. ### Assignment markers: `llvm.dbg.assign`. `llvm.dbg.value`, a conventional debug intrinsic, marks out a position in the; IR where a variable takes a particular value. Similarly, Assignment Tracking; marks out the position of assignments with a new intrinsic called; `llvm.dbg.assign`. In order to know where in IR it is appropriate to use a memory location for a; variable, each assignment marker must in some way refer to the store, if any; (or multiple!), that performs the assignment.

Testability,"tions with hyphens; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sometimes you may want to specify a value to your positional argument that; starts with a hyphen (for example, searching for '``-foo``' in a file). At; first, you will have trouble doing this, because it will try to find an argument; named '``-foo``', and will fail (and single quotes will not save you). Note; that the system ``grep`` has the same problem:. ::. $ spiffygrep '-foo' test.txt; Unknown command line argument '-foo'. Try: spiffygrep -help'. $ grep '-foo' test.txt; grep: illegal option -- f; grep: illegal option -- o; grep: illegal option -- o; Usage: grep -hblcnsviw pattern file . . . The solution for this problem is the same for both your tool and the system; version: use the '``--``' marker. When the user specifies '``--``' on the; command line, it is telling the program that all options after the '``--``'; should be treated as positional arguments, not options. Thus, we can use it; like this:. ::. $ spiffygrep -- -foo test.txt; ...output... Determining absolute position with getPosition(); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sometimes an option can affect or modify the meaning of another option. For; example, consider ``gcc``'s ``-x LANG`` option. This tells ``gcc`` to ignore the; suffix of subsequent positional arguments and force the file to be interpreted; as if it contained source code in language ``LANG``. In order to handle this; properly, you need to know the absolute position of each argument, especially; those in lists, so their interaction(s) can be applied correctly. This is also; useful for options like ``-llibname`` which is actually a positional argument; that starts with a dash. So, generally, the problem is that you have two ``cl::list`` variables that; interact in some way. To ensure the correct interaction, you can use the; ``cl::list::getPosition(optnum)`` method. This method returns the absolute; position (as found on the command line) of the ``optnum`` item",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:28610,test,test,28610,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Address spaces attribute; ------------------------. Clang has arbitrary address space support using the ``address_space(N)``; attribute, where ``N`` is an integer number in the range specified in the; Clang source code. This addresses spaces can be used along with the OpenCL; address spaces however when such addresses spaces converted to/from OpenCL; address spaces the behavior is not governed by OpenCL specification. An OpenCL implementation provides a list of standard address spaces using; keywords: ``private``, ``local``, ``global``, and ``generic``. In the AST and; in the IR each of the address spaces will be represented by unique number; provided in the Clang source code. The specific IDs for an address space do not; have to match between the AST and the IR. Typically in the AST address space; numbers represent logical segments while in the IR they represent physical; segments.; Therefore, machines with flat memory segments can map all AST address space; numbers to the same physical segment ID or skip address space attribute; completely while generating the IR. However, if the address space information; is needed by the IR passes e.g. to improve alias analysis, it is recommended; to keep it and only lower to reflect physical memory segments in the late; machine passes.

Combined with a clear separation of offset/index data and payload data for collections,; uncompressed RNTuple data can be directly mapped to memory without further copies. Goals; -----. RNTuple shall investigate improvements of the TTree I/O in the following ways. 1. More speed; * Improve mapping to vectorized and parallel hardware; * For types known at compile / JIT time: generate optimized code; * Optimized for simple types (float, int, and vectors of them); * Better memory control: work with a fixed budget of pre-defined I/O buffers; * Naturally thread-safe and asynchronous interfaces. 2. More robust interfaces; * Compile-time type safety by default; * Decomposition into layers: logical layer, primitives layer, storage layer; * Separation of data model and live data; * Self-contained I/O code to support creation of a standalone I/O library. Concepts; --------. At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which represents a memory location; storing a value of the given C++ type. These distinguished memory locations are the destinations and sources for the; deserialization and serialization. The (de-)serialization is a mapping from the C++ type to the more simple **column** type system. A column contains; an arbitrary number of fixed-sized elements of a well-defined set of types: integers and floats of different; bit sizes. A C++ type may be mapped to multiple columns. For instance, an `std::vector<float>` maps to two columns,; an offset column indicating ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md:1520,log,logical,1520,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,1,['log'],['logical']
Testability,"tly defined:. 1. ``DW_OP_regval_type``. ``DW_OP_regval_type`` has two operands. The first is an unsigned LEB128; integer that represents a register number R. The second is an unsigned; LEB128 integer DR that represents the byte offset of a debugging information; entry D relative to the beginning of the current compilation unit, that; provides the type T of the register value. The operation is equivalent to performing ``DW_OP_regx R; DW_OP_deref_type; DR``. .. note::. Should DWARF allow the type T to be a larger size than the size of the; register R? Restricting a larger bit size avoids any issue of conversion; as the, possibly truncated, bit contents of the register is simply; interpreted as a value of T. If a conversion is wanted it can be done; explicitly using a ``DW_OP_convert`` operation. GDB has a per register hook that allows a target specific conversion on a; register by register basis. It defaults to truncation of bigger registers.; Removing use of the target hook does not cause any test failures in common; architectures. If the compiler for a target architecture did want some; form of conversion, including a larger result type, it could always; explicitly use the ``DW_OP_convert`` operation. If T is a larger type than the register size, then the default GDB; register hook reads bytes from the next register (or reads out of bounds; for the last register!). Removing use of the target hook does not cause; any test failures in common architectures (except an illegal hand written; assembly test). If a target architecture requires this behavior, these; extensions allow a composite location description to be used to combine; multiple registers. 2. ``DW_OP_deref``. S is the bit size of the generic type divided by 8 (the byte size) and; rounded up to a whole number. DR is the offset of a hypothetical debug; information entry D in the current compilation unit for a base type of the; generic type. The operation is equivalent to performing ``DW_OP_deref_type S, DR``.

Testability,"to 'CPU Time / number of threads' AND 'Compressed Throughput' is lower than expected; for your storage medium: this would imply that your CPU threads aren't decompressing data as fast as your storage; medium can provide it, and so decompression is the bottleneck.; The best way to decrease your runtime would be to utilise a system with a faster CPU, or make use; use of more threads when running, or use a compression algorithm with a higher decompression rate such as LZ4,; possibly at the cost of some extra file size. ### A note on caching. If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is; first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if; you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache -; consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed.; On Linux this can be done by running 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' as a superuser,; or a specific file can be dropped from the cache with; `dd of=<FILENAME> oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0 > /dev/null 2>&1`. ### Known overhead of TTreeReader, RDataFrame. `rootreadspeed` is designed to read all data present in the specified branches, trees and files at the highest; possible speed. When the application bottleneck is not in the computations performed by analysis logic,; higher-level interfaces built on top of TTree such as TTreeReader and RDataFrame are known to add a significant; runtime overhead with respect to the runtimes reported by `rootreadspeed` (up to a factor 2). In realistic analysis; applications it has been observed that a large part of that overhead is compensated by the ability of TTreeReader and; RDataFrame to read branch values selectively, based on event cuts, and this overhead will be reduced significantly; when using RDataFrame in conjunction with RNTuple.; See also [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PPP138) (slides 16 to 19).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md:4271,log,logic,4271,tree/readspeed/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md,1,['log'],['logic']

An example of this can be seen with `gamma_cdf()` in MathFuncs.h`,; for which the custom derivative is not supported, but in this specific; instance, it falls back to Numeric Differentiation and works fine, since `; gamma_cdf()` doesn't have a lot of parameters. > In such cases, Numeric Differentiation fallback is only used for that; specific function. In above example, `gamma_cdf()` falls back to Numeric; Differentiation but other functions in `MathFuncs.h` will still be; able to use AD. This is because Clad is going to assume that you have a; derivative for this `gamma_cdf()` function, and the remaining functions will; use AD as expected. In the end, the remaining functions (including; `gamma_cdf()`) will try to fall back to Numeric Differentiation.

For; example, we would split the module map file above into two module map; files:. .. code-block:: c. /* module.modulemap */; module Foo {; header ""Foo.h""; }. /* module.private.modulemap */; module Foo_Private {; header ""Foo_Private.h""; }. When a ``module.private.modulemap`` file is found alongside a; ``module.modulemap`` file, it is loaded after the ``module.modulemap``; file. In our example library, the ``module.private.modulemap`` file; would be available when ``Foo_Private.h`` is available, making it; easier to split a library's public and private APIs along header; boundaries. When writing a private module as part of a *framework*, it's recommended that:. * Headers for this module are present in the ``PrivateHeaders`` framework; subdirectory.; * The private module is defined as a *top level module* with the name of the; public framework prefixed, like ``Foo_Private`` above. Clang has extra logic; to work with this naming, using ``FooPrivate`` or ``Foo.Private`` (submodule); trigger warnings and might not work as expected. Modularizing a Platform; =======================; To get any benefit out of modules, one needs to introduce module maps for software libraries starting at the bottom of the stack. This typically means introducing a module map covering the operating system's headers and the C standard library headers (in ``/usr/include``, for a Unix system). The module maps will be written using the `module map language`_, which provides the tools necessary to describe the mapping between headers and modules. Because the set of headers differs from one system to the next, the module map will likely have to be somewhat customized for, e.g., a particular distribution and version of the operating system. Moreover, the system headers themselves may require some modification, if they exhibit any anti-patterns that break modules. Such common patterns are described below. **Macro-guarded copy-and-pas",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:51803,log,logic,51803,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['log'],['logic']

Regression tests; ----------------. The regression tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory. Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory. For example, it can be a small; piece of LLVM IR distilled from an actual application or benchmark. Testing Analysis; ----------------. An analysis is a pass that infer properties on some part of the IR and not; transforming it. They are tested in general using the same infrastructure as the; regression tests, by creating a separate ""Printer"" pass to consume the analysis; result and print it on the standard output in a textual format suitable for; FileCheck.; See `llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll>`_; for an example of such test. ``test-suite``; --------------.

Once we have the variable, codegen'ing the assignment is; straightforward: we emit the RHS of the assignment, create a store, and; return the computed value. Returning a value allows for chained; assignments like ""X = (Y = Z)"". Now that we have an assignment operator, we can mutate loop variables; and arguments. For example, we can now run code like this:. ::. # Function to print a double.; extern printd(x);. # Define ':' for sequencing: as a low-precedence operator that ignores operands; # and just returns the RHS.; def binary : 1 (x y) y;. def test(x); printd(x) :; x = 4 :; printd(x);. test(123);. When run, this example prints ""123"" and then ""4"", showing that we did; actually mutate the value!

However, to be really useful, we want the ability to define our; own local variables, let's add this next!. User-defined Local Variables; ============================.

If the PR contains performance-critical; code consider writing a benchmark against the [rootbench repository](https://github.com/root-project/rootbench). ## Quality Assurance. Each contribution should contain developer documentation in the form of code; comments and sufficient amount of tests in the form of unit and/or integration; tests. Unit tests are relatively small and quick programs focused to check if; small pieces of code and API work as expected. Integration tests are checks; which ensure the synergy between different (unit tested) components. Put in; practice, unit tests verify (member) function behavior whereas integration tests; check classes and their cooperation. The boundary between both kinds of testing; is blurred. ROOT has support for both kinds of tests in the [roottest repository](https://github.com/root-project/roottest); and supports ""inline"" unit tests in each component's `test` folder. Unit testing; uses the [GTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest) infrastructure; along with small ROOT-specific extensions located in; [TestSupport](../core/test_support/). The documentation of GTest; and GMock is rather extensive and we will describe some of the features of; ROOT::TestSupport. In order to write an inline unit test, add a new file in the; nearest to the tested component's `test` folder and call `ROOT_ADD_GTEST` in the; `CMakeLists.txt` file.

Testability,"try hierarchy in memory"" width=600. Nodes are never instantiated directly by users, but created as a result; of volume operations. Adding a volume named A with a given `user id`; inside a volume B will create a node named `A_id.` This will be added to; the list of nodes stored by B. In addition, when applying a division; operation in N slices to a volume A, a list of nodes `B_1`, `B_2`, ... ,; `B_N` is also created. A node `B_i` does not represent a unique object; in the geometry because its container A might be at its turn positioned; as node inside several other volumes. Only when a complete branch of; nodes is fully defined up to the top node in the geometry, a given; path:` /TOP_1/`...`/A_3/B_7` will represent a unique object. Its global; transformation matrix can be computed as the pile-up of all local; transformations in its branch. We will therefore call `logical graph`; the hierarchy defined by nodes and volumes. The expansion of the logical; graph by all possible paths defines a tree structure where all nodes are; unique ""touchable"" objects. We will call this the ""physical tree"".; Unlike the logical graph, the physical tree can become a huge structure; with several millions of nodes in case of complex geometries; therefore,; it is not always a good idea to keep it transient in memory. Since the; logical and physical structures are correlated, the modeller rather; keeps track only of the current branch, updating the current global; matrix at each change of the level in geometry. The current physical; node is not an object that can be asked for at a given moment, but; rather represented by the combination: current node/current global; matrix. However, physical nodes have unique ID's that can be retrieved; for a given modeller state. These can be fed back to the modeller in; order to force a physical node to become current.

Logical nodes (positioned volumes) are created and destroyed by the; TGeoVolume class. Physical nodes and their global transformations; are subjected to a caching mechanism due to the sometimes very large; memory requirements of logical graph expansion.

Finally, if the output of the selected code generator matches the reference; output, ``bugpoint`` runs the test program after all of the LLVM passes have; been applied to it. If its output differs from the reference output, it assumes; the difference resulted from a failure in one of the LLVM passes, and enters the; `miscompilation debugger`_. Otherwise, there is no problem ``bugpoint`` can; debug. .. _crash debugger:. Crash debugger; --------------. If an optimizer or code generator crashes, ``bugpoint`` will try as hard as it; can to reduce the list of passes (for optimizer crashes) and the size of the; test program. First, ``bugpoint`` figures out which combination of optimizer; passes triggers the bug. This is useful when debugging a problem exposed by; ``opt``, for example, because it runs over 38 passes. Next, ``bugpoint`` tries removing functions from the test program, to reduce its; size. Usually it is able to reduce a test program to a single function, when; debugging intraprocedural optimizations. Once the number of functions has been; reduced, it attempts to delete various edges in the control flow graph, to; reduce the size of the function as much as possible. Finally, ``bugpoint``; deletes any individual LLVM instructions whose absence does not eliminate the; failure. At the end, ``bugpoint`` should tell you what passes crash, give you a; bitcode file, and give you instructions on how to reproduce the failure with; ``opt`` or ``llc``. .. _code generator debugger:. Code generator debugger; -----------------------. The code generator debugger attempts to narrow down the amount of code that is; being miscompiled by the selected code generator. To do this, it takes the test; program and partitions it into two pieces: one piece which it compiles with the; ""safe"" backend (into a shared object), and one piece which it runs with either; the JIT or the static LLC compiler. It uses several techniques to reduce the; amount of code",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst:3551,test,test,3551,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,1,['test'],['test']

The test suite contains whole programs, which are pieces of code which; can be compiled and linked into a stand-alone program that can be; executed. These programs are generally written in high level languages; such as C or C++. These programs are compiled using a user specified compiler and set of; flags, and then executed to capture the program output and timing; information. The output of these programs is compared to a reference; output to ensure that the program is being compiled correctly. In addition to compiling and executing programs, whole program tests; serve as a way of benchmarking LLVM performance, both in terms of the; efficiency of the programs generated as well as the speed with which; LLVM compiles, optimizes, and generates code. The test-suite is located in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details. Debugging Information tests; ---------------------------. The test suite contains tests to check quality of debugging information.; The test are written in C based languages or in LLVM assembly language. These tests are compiled and run under a debugger. The debugger output; is checked to validate of debugging information. See README.txt in the; test suite for more information. This test suite is located in the; ``cross-project-tests/debuginfo-tests`` directory. Quick start; ===========. The tests are located in two separate repositories. The unit and; regression tests are in the main ""llvm""/ directory under the directories; ``llvm/unittests`` and ``llvm/test`` (so you get these tests for free with ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:3705,test,tests,3705,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,2,"['benchmark', 'test']","['benchmarking', 'tests']"

Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in the other output. Passes are not reported; explicitly. Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the output; (depending on which sometest you use). For example, the ``nightly`` test; explicitly outputs TEST-PASS or TEST-FAIL for every test after each; program. Though these lines are still drowned in the output, it's easy; to grep the output logs in the Output directories. Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``). The; exact contents of the report are dependent on which ``TEST`` you are; running, but the text results are always shown at the end of the run and; the results are always stored in the ``report.<type>.format`` file (when; running with ``TEST=<type>``). The ``report`` also generate a file; called ``report.<type>.raw.out`` containing the output of the entire; test run. Writing Custom Tests for the test-suite; =======================================. Assuming you can run the test suite, (e.g.; ""``gmake TEST=nightly report``"" should work), it is really easy to run; optimizations or code generator components against every program in the; tree, collecting statistics or running custom checks ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst:4272,test,test,4272,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst,4,"['TEST', 'test']","['TEST-FAIL', 'TEST-PASS', 'test']"

Testability,"ts`` and ``llvm/test`` (so you get these tests for free with the; main LLVM tree). Use ``make check-all`` to run the unit and regression tests; after building LLVM. The ``test-suite`` module contains more comprehensive tests including whole C; and C++ programs. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details. Unit and Regression tests; -------------------------. To run all of the LLVM unit tests use the check-llvm-unit target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm-unit. To run all of the LLVM regression tests use the check-llvm target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm. In order to get reasonable testing performance, build LLVM and subprojects; in release mode, i.e. .. code-block:: bash. % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=""Release"" -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On. If you have `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_ checked out and built, you; can run the LLVM and Clang tests simultaneously using:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-all. To run the tests with Valgrind (Memcheck by default), use the ``LIT_ARGS`` make; variable to pass the required options to lit. For example, you can use:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check LIT_ARGS=""-v --vg --vg-leak"". to enable testing with valgrind and with leak checking enabled. To run individual tests or subsets of tests, you can use the ``llvm-lit``; script which is built as part of LLVM. For example, to run the; ``Integer/BitPacked.ll`` test by itself you can run:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/Integer/BitPacked.ll. or to run all of the ARM CodeGen tests:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/CodeGen/ARM. The regression tests will use the Python psutil module only if installed in a; **non-user** location. Under Linux, install with sudo or within a virtual; environment. Under Windows, install Python for all users and then run; ``pip install psutil`` in an elevated command prompt.

Therefore, adding a new expression or statement; kind into Clang requires some care. The following list details the various; places in Clang where an expression or statement needs to be introduced, along; with patterns to follow to ensure that the new expression or s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:144003,log,logic,144003,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['log'],['logic']

A few; things to check at this point:. * If your expression can construct a new C++ class or return a new; Objective-C object, be sure to update and then call; ``Sema::MaybeBindToTemporary`` for your just-created AST node to be sure; that the object gets properly destructed. An easy way to test this is to; return a C++ class with a private destructor: semantic analysis should; flag an error here with the attempt to call the destructor.; * Inspect the generated AST by printing it using ``clang -cc1 -ast-print``,; to make sure you're capturing all of the important information about how; the AST was written.; * Inspect the generated AST under ``clang -cc1 -ast-dump`` to verify that; all of the types in the generated AST line up the way you want them.; Remember that clients of the AST should never have to ""think"" to; understand what's going on. For example, all implicit conversions should; show up explicitly in the AST.; * Write tests that use your expression as a subexpression of other,; well-known expressions. Can you call a function using your expression as; an argument? Can you use the ternary operator?. #. Teach code generation to create IR to your AST node. This step is the first; (and only) that requires knowledge of LLVM IR. There are several things to; keep in mind:. * Code generation is separated into scalar/aggregate/complex and; lvalue/rvalue paths, depending on what kind of result your expression; produces. On occasion, this requires some careful factoring of code to; avoid duplication.; * ``CodeGenFunction`` contains functions ``ConvertType`` and; ``ConvertTypeForMem`` that convert Clang's types (``clang::Type*`` or; ``clang::QualType``) to LLVM types. Use the former for values, and the; latter for memory locations: test with the C++ ""``bool``"" type to check; this. If you find that you are having to use LLVM bitcasts to make the; subexpressions of your expression have the type that your expression; expects, STOP!

Traverse Mode. The default mode of operation of AST Matchers visits all nodes in the AST,; even if they are not spelled in the source. This is; AsIs mode. This mode requires writing AST matchers; that explicitly traverse or ignore implicit nodes, such as parentheses; surrounding an expression or expressions with cleanups. These implicit; nodes are not always obvious from the syntax of the source code, and so this; mode requires careful consideration and testing to get the desired behavior; from an AST matcher. In addition, because template instantiations are matched in the default mode,; transformations can be accidentally made to template declarations. Finally,; because implicit nodes are matched by default, transformations can be made on; entirely incorrect places in the code.; For these reasons, it is possible to ignore AST nodes which are not spelled; in the source using the IgnoreUnlessSpelledInSource; mode. This is likely to be far less error-prone for users who are not already; very familiar with where implicit nodes appear in the AST.

Compiling a program with; ""``-O3 -g``"" gives you full debug information that is always available and; accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call; elimination and inlining), but you might lose the ability to modify the program; and call functions which were optimized out of the program, or inlined away; completely. The :doc:`LLVM test-suite <TestSuiteMakefileGuide>` provides a framework to; test the optimizer's handling of debugging information.

LLVM debugging information has been carefully designed to make it possible for; the optimizer to optimize the program and debugging information without; necessarily having to know anything about debugging information. In; particular, the use of metadata avoids duplicated debugging information from; the beginning, and the global dead code elimination pass automatically deletes; debugging information for a function if it decides to delete the function. To do this, most of the debugging information (descriptors for types,; variables, functions, source files, etc) is inserted by the language front-end; in the form of LLVM metadata.

Clang will expect the ``llvm-spirv`` executable to; be present in the ``PATH`` environment variable. Clang uses ``llvm-spirv``; with `the widely adopted assembly syntax package; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/#build-with-spirv-tools>`_. `The versioning; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/releases>`_ of; ``llvm-spirv`` is aligned with Clang major releases. The same applies to the; main development branch. It is therefore important to ensure the ``llvm-spirv``; version is in alignment with the Clang version. For troubleshooting purposes; ``llvm-spirv`` can be `tested in isolation; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#test-instructions>`_. Example usage for OpenCL kernel compilation:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -c test.cl; $ clang --target=spirv64 -c test.cl. Both invocations of Clang will result in the generation of a SPIR-V binary file; `test.o` for 32 bit and 64 bit respectively. This file can be imported; by an OpenCL driver that support SPIR-V consumption or it can be compiled; further by offline SPIR-V consumer tools. Converting to SPIR-V produced with the optimization levels other than `-O0` is; currently available as an experimental feature and it is not guaranteed to work; in all cases. Clang also supports integrated generation of SPIR-V without use of ``llvm-spirv``; tool as an experimental feature when ``-fintegrated-objemitter`` flag is passed in; the command line. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -fintegrated-objemitter -c test.cl. Note that only very basic functionality is supported at this point and therefore; it is not suitable for arbitrary use cases. This feature is only enabled when clang; build is configured with ``-DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=SPIRV`` option.

Testability,"uld be used instead of; '``undef``' whenever possible. Poison values are stronger than undef, and; enable more optimizations. Just the existence of '``undef``' blocks certain; optimizations (see the examples below). Undefined values are useful because they indicate to the compiler that; the program is well defined no matter what value is used. This gives the; compiler more freedom to optimize. Here are some examples of; (potentially surprising) transformations that are valid (in pseudo IR):. .. code-block:: llvm. %A = add %X, undef; %B = sub %X, undef; %C = xor %X, undef; Safe:; %A = undef; %B = undef; %C = undef. This is safe because all of the output bits are affected by the undef; bits. Any output bit can have a zero or one depending on the input bits. .. code-block:: llvm. %A = or %X, undef; %B = and %X, undef; Safe:; %A = -1; %B = 0; Safe:; %A = %X ;; By choosing undef as 0; %B = %X ;; By choosing undef as -1; Unsafe:; %A = undef; %B = undef. These logical operations have bits that are not always affected by the; input. For example, if ``%X`` has a zero bit, then the output of the; '``and``' operation will always be a zero for that bit, no matter what; the corresponding bit from the '``undef``' is. As such, it is unsafe to; optimize or assume that the result of the '``and``' is '``undef``'.; However, it is safe to assume that all bits of the '``undef``' could be; 0, and optimize the '``and``' to 0. Likewise, it is safe to assume that; all the bits of the '``undef``' operand to the '``or``' could be set,; allowing the '``or``' to be folded to -1. .. code-block:: llvm. %A = select undef, %X, %Y; %B = select undef, 42, %Y; %C = select %X, %Y, undef; Safe:; %A = %X (or %Y); %B = 42 (or %Y); %C = %Y (if %Y is provably not poison; unsafe otherwise); Unsafe:; %A = undef; %B = undef; %C = undef.

Use the; ``-Wincomplete-umbrella`` warning option to ask Clang to complain; about headers not covered by the umbrella header or the module map. A header with the ``private`` specifier may not be included from outside the module itself. A header with the ``textual`` specifier will not be compiled when the module is; built, and will be textually included if it is named by a ``#include``; directive. However, it is considered to be part of the module for the purpose; of checking *use-declaration*\s, and must still be a lexically-valid header; file. In the future, we intend to pre-tokenize such headers and include the; token sequence within the prebuilt module representation. A header with the ``exclude`` specifier is excluded from the module. It will not be included when the module is built, nor will it be considered to be part of the module, even if an ``umbrella`` header or directory would otherwise make it part of the module. **Example:** The C header ``assert.h`` is an excellent candidate for a textual header, because it is meant to be included multiple times (possibly with different ``NDEBUG`` settings). However, declarations within it should typically be split into a separate modular header. .. parsed-literal::. module std [system] {; textual header ""assert.h""; }. A given header shall not be referenced by more than one *header-declaration*. Two *header-declaration*\s, or a *header-declaration* and a ``#include``, are; considered to refer to the same file if the paths resolve to the same file; and the specified *header-attr*\s (if any) match the attributes of that file,; even if the file is named differently (for instance, by a relative path or; via symlinks). .. note::; The use of *header-attr*\s avoids the need for Clang to speculatively; ``stat`` every header referenced by a module map.

So, preference has been granted to the ""logarithmical search"". Though in the case of need, *logarithmical-search* (read ""total-ordering"") could; be used as a milestone on our way to the *random-access* implementation.

In; the *random-access* approach, we could use the same comparison algorithm.; During comparison, we exit once we find the difference, but here we might have; to scan the whole function body every time (note, it could be slower). Like in; ""total-ordering"", we will track every number and flag, but instead of; comparison, we should get the numbers sequence and then create the hash number.; So, once again, *total-ordering* could be considered as a milestone for even; faster (in theory) random-access approach.

The; **`TTree::Draw`** method is a powerful yet simple way to look and draw the; trees contents. It enables you to plot a variable (a leaf) with just one; line of code. However, the Draw method falls short once you want to look; at each entry and design more sophisticated acceptance criteria for your; analysis. For these cases, you can use `TTree::MakeClass`.

It is especially important for large data set in a parallel; processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several; processors and you can specify which entries to send to each processor.; With `MakeClass` the user has control over the event loop, with; `MakeSelector `the tree is in control of the event loop. ## Simple Analysis Using TTree::Draw.

Tips for JITLink backend developers; -----------------------------------. #. Make liberal use of assert and ``llvm::Error``.

Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures).

You can use the MIR format for testing in two different ways:. - You can write MIR tests that invoke a single code generation pass using the; ``-run-pass`` option in llc. - You can use llc's ``-stop-after`` option with existing or new LLVM assembly; tests and check the MIR output of a specific code generation pass. Testing Individual Code Generation Passes; -----------------------------------------. The ``-run-pass`` option in llc allows you to create MIR tests that invoke just; a single code generation pass. When this option is used, llc will parse an; input MIR file, run the specified code generation pass(es), and output the; resulting MIR code. You can generate an input MIR file for the test by using the ``-stop-after`` or; ``-stop-before`` option in llc. For example, if you would like to write a test; for the post register allocation pseudo instruction expansion pass, you can; specify the machine copy propagation pass in the ``-stop-after`` option, as it; runs just before the pass that we are trying to test:. ``llc -stop-after=machine-cp bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. If the same pass is run multiple times, a run index can be included; after the name with a comma. ``llc -stop-after=dead-mi-elimination,1 bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. After generating the input MIR file, you'll have to add a run line that uses; the ``-run-pass`` option to it. In order to test the post register allocation; pseudo instruction expansion pass on X86-64, a run line like the one shown; below can be used:. ``# RUN: llc -o - %s -mtriple=x86_64-- -run-pass=postrapseudos | FileCheck %s``. The MIR files are target dependent, so they have to be placed in the target; specific test directories (``lib/CodeGen/TARG",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst:1813,test,test,1813,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Please do note that running ``-verify-each-debuginfo-preserve`` on big projects; could be heavily time consuming.

Furthermore, there is a way to export the issues that have been found into; a JSON file as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. $ opt -verify-debuginfo-preserve -verify-di-preserve-export=sample.json -pass-to-test sample.ll. and then use the ``llvm/utils/llvm-original-di-preservation.py`` script; to generate an HTML page with the issues reported in a more human readable form; as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-original-di-preservation.py sample.json sample.html.

Mutation testing for MIR-level transformations; ----------------------------------------------. A variant of the ``debugify`` utility described in; :ref:`Mutation testing for IR-level transformations<IRDebugify>` can be used; for MIR-level transformations as well: much like the IR-level pass,; ``mir-debugify`` inserts sequentially increasing line locations to each; ``MachineInstr`` in a ``Module``. And the MIR-level ``mir-check-debugify`` is; similar to IR-level ``check-debugify`` pass.

Before this happens; we need to decide where it is appropriate to use memory locations and where we; must use a non-memory location (or no location) for each variable. In order to; make those decisions we run a standard fixed-point dataflow analysis that makes; the choice at each instruction, iteratively joining the results for each block. ### TODO list. As this is an experimental work in progress so there are some items we still need; to tackle:. * As mentioned in test llvm/test/DebugInfo/assignment-tracking/X86/diamond-3.ll,; the analysis should treat escaping calls like untagged stores. * The system expects locals to be backed by a local alloca. This isn't always; the case - sometimes a pointer to storage is passed into a function; (e.g. sret, byval). We need to be able to handle those cases. See; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for examples. * `trackAssignments` doesn't yet work for variables that have their; `llvm.dbg.declare` location modified by a `DIExpression`, e.g. when the; address of the variable is itself stored in an `alloca` with the; `llvm.dbg.declare` using `DIExpression(DW_OP_deref)`. See `indirectReturn` in; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and in; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for an; example. * In order to solve the first bullet-point we need to be able to specify that a; memory location is available without using a `DIAssignID`. This is because; the storage address is not computed by an instruction (it's an argument; value) and therefore we have nowhere to put the metadata attachment. To solve; this we probably need another marker intrinsic to denote ""the variable's; stack home is X address"" - similar to `llvm.dbg.declare` except that it needs; to compose with `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsic",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md:9921,test,test,9921,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"ur source code for executables.; For each program that you build, you will have one directory in **tools**; that will contain that program's source code. **test**. This subdirectory should contain tests that verify that your code works; correctly. Automated tests are especially useful. Currently, the LLVM build system provides basic support for tests. The LLVM; system provides the following:. * LLVM contains regression tests in ``llvm/test``. These tests are run by the; :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool. This test procedure uses ``RUN``; lines in the actual test case to determine how to run the test. See the; :doc:`TestingGuide` for more details. * LLVM contains an optional package called ``llvm-test``, which provides; benchmarks and programs that are known to compile with the Clang front; end. You can use these programs to test your code, gather statistical; information, and compare it to the current LLVM performance statistics. Currently, there is no way to hook your tests directly into the ``llvm/test``; testing harness. You will simply need to find a way to use the source; provided within that directory on your own.

Testability,"ure tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a particular relevant target?. If the answer to any of these is ""yes"", the feature test macro should either; not be defined or there should be very strong rationale for why the issues; should not prevent defining it. Note, it is acceptable to define the feature; test macro on a per-target basis if needed. When in doubt, being conservative is better than being aggressive. If we don't; claim support for the feature but it does useful things, users can still use it; and provide us with useful feedback on what is missing. But if we claim support; for a feature that has significant bugs, we've eliminated most of the utility; of having a feature testing macro at all because users are then forced to test; what compiler version is in use to get a more accurate answer. The status reported by the feature test macro should always be reflected in the; language support page for the corresponding feature (`C++; <https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html>`_, `C; <https://clang.llvm.org/c_status.html>`_) if applicable. This page can give; more nuanced information to the user as well, such as claiming partial support; for a feature and specifying details as to what remains to be done.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:163856,test,test,163856,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,4,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"

In the current,; experimental, implementation the identifier of type T is calculated as; follows:. - Obtain the mangled name for ""typeinfo name for T"".; - Calculate MD5 hash of the name as a string.; - Reinterpret the first 8 bytes of the hash as a little-endian; 64-bit integer. It is possible, but unlikely, that collisions in the; ``CallSiteTypeId`` hashing will result in weaker CFI checks that would; still be conservatively correct. CFI_Check; ---------. In the general case, only the target DSO knows whether the call to; function ``f`` with type ``CallSiteTypeId`` is valid or not. To; export this information, every DSO implements. .. code-block:: none. void __cfi_check(uint64 CallSiteTypeId, void *TargetAddr, void *DiagData). This function provides external modules with access to CFI checks for; the targets inside this DSO. For each known ``CallSiteTypeId``, this; function performs an ``llvm.type.test`` with the corresponding type; identifier. It reports an error if the type is unknown, or if the; check fails. Depending on the values of compiler flags; ``-fsanitize-trap`` and ``-fsanitize-recover``, this function may; print an error, abort and/or return to the caller. ``DiagData`` is an; opaque pointer to the diagnostic information about the error, or; ``null`` if the caller does not provide this information.

The job of ``classof`` is to dynamically determine whether an object of; a base class is in fact of a particular derived class. In order to; downcast a type ``Base`` to a type ``Derived``, there needs to be a; ``classof`` in ``Derived`` which will accept an object of type ``Base``. To be concrete, consider the following code:. .. code-block:: c++. Shape *S = ...;; if (isa<Circle>(S)) {; /* do something ... */; }. The code of the ``isa<>`` test in this code will eventually boil; down---after template instantiation and some other machinery---to a; check roughly like ``Circle::classof(S)``. For more information, see; :ref:`classof-contract`. The argument to ``classof`` should always be an *ancestor* class because; the implementation has logic to allow and optimize away; upcasts/up-``isa<>``'s automatically.

Note that this is the reason that we did not need to introduce a; ``classof`` into ``Shape``: all relevant classes derive from ``Shape``,; and ``Shape`` itself is abstract (has no entry in the ``Kind`` enum),; so this notional inferred ``classof`` is all we need.

Since; it constructs our pass, we need to also add the proper #include in; ``llvm/lib/Passes/PassBuilder.cpp``:. .. code-block:: c++. #include ""llvm/Transforms/Utils/HelloWorld.h"". This should be all the code necessary for our pass, now it's time to compile; and run it. Running a pass with ``opt``; ---------------------------. Now that you have a brand new shiny pass, we can build :program:`opt` and use; it to run some LLVM IR through the pass. .. code-block:: console. $ ninja -C build/ opt; # or whatever build system/build directory you are using. $ cat /tmp/a.ll; define i32 @foo() {; %a = add i32 2, 3; ret i32 %a; }. define void @bar() {; ret void; }. $ build/bin/opt -disable-output /tmp/a.ll -passes=helloworld; foo; bar.

Viewing static analyzer results in a web browser. What is Static Analysis?; The term ""static analysis"" is conflated, but here we use it to mean; a collection of algorithms and techniques used to analyze source code in order; to automatically find bugs. The idea is similar in spirit to compiler warnings; (which can be useful for finding coding errors) but to take that idea a step; further and find bugs that are traditionally found using run-time debugging; techniques such as testing.; Static analysis bug-finding tools have evolved over the last several decades; from basic syntactic checkers to those that find deep bugs by reasoning about; the semantics of code. The goal of the Clang Static Analyzer is to provide a; industrial-quality static analysis framework for analyzing C, C++, and; Objective-C programs that is freely available, extensible, and has a high quality of implementation.; Part of Clang and LLVM; As its name implies, the Clang Static Analyzer is built on top of Clang and LLVM.; Strictly speaking, the analyzer is part of Clang, as Clang consists of a set of; reusable C++ libraries for building powerful source-level tools. The static; analysis engine used by the Clang Static Analyzer is a Clang library, and has; the capability to be reused in different contexts and by different clients.; Important Points to Consider; While we believe that",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/index.html:1334,test,testing,1334,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/index.html,1,['test'],['testing']

You don't want to put that information in the; headers themselves --- perhaps because you want to keep them clean for other; clients, or perhaps because they're from some open source project and you don't; want to modify them at all. **Incomplete solution:** Redeclare all the interesting parts of the API in your; own header and add the attributes you want. Unfortunately, this:. * doesn't work with attributes that must be present on a definition; * doesn't allow changing the definition in other ways; * requires your header to be included in any client code to take effect. **Better solution:** Provide a ""sidecar"" file with the information you want to; add, and have that automatically get picked up by the module-building logic in; the compiler. That's API notes. API notes use a YAML-based file format. YAML is a format best explained by; example, so here is a `small example; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/APINotes/Inputs/Frameworks/SomeKit.framework/Headers/SomeKit.apinotes>`_; from the compiler test suite of API; notes for a hypothetical ""SomeKit"" framework.

Additionally, a; file named ""SomeKit_private.apinotes"" will also be picked up to go with a; private module map. For bare modules these two files will be in the same; directory as the corresponding module map; for framework modules, they should; be placed in the Headers and PrivateHeaders directories, respectively. The; module map for a private top-level framework module should be placed in the; PrivateHeaders directory as well, though it does not need an additional; ""_private"" suffix on its name.

Testability,"used to represent; LLVM's :ref:`machine specific intermediate representation; <machine code representation>`. The MIR serialization format is designed to be used for testing the code; generation passes in LLVM. Overview; ========. The MIR serialization format uses a YAML container. YAML is a standard; data serialization language, and the full YAML language spec can be read at; `yaml.org; <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Introduction>`_. A MIR file is split up into a series of `YAML documents`_. The first document; can contain an optional embedded LLVM IR module, and the rest of the documents; contain the serialized machine functions. .. _YAML documents: http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2800132. MIR Testing Guide; =================. You can use the MIR format for testing in two different ways:. - You can write MIR tests that invoke a single code generation pass using the; ``-run-pass`` option in llc. - You can use llc's ``-stop-after`` option with existing or new LLVM assembly; tests and check the MIR output of a specific code generation pass. Testing Individual Code Generation Passes; -----------------------------------------. The ``-run-pass`` option in llc allows you to create MIR tests that invoke just; a single code generation pass. When this option is used, llc will parse an; input MIR file, run the specified code generation pass(es), and output the; resulting MIR code. You can generate an input MIR file for the test by using the ``-stop-after`` or; ``-stop-before`` option in llc. For example, if you would like to write a test; for the post register allocation pseudo instruction expansion pass, you can; specify the machine copy propagation pass in the ``-stop-after`` option, as it; runs just before the pass that we are trying to test:. ``llc -stop-after=machine-cp bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. If the same pass is run multiple times, a run index can be included; after the name with a comma. ``llc -stop-after=dead-mi-elimination,1 bug-trigger.ll -o",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst:1364,test,tests,1364,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,1,['test'],['tests']

The first; step is to set a precedence:. .. code-block:: c++. int main() {; // Install standard binary operators.; // 1 is lowest precedence.; BinopPrecedence['='] = 2;; BinopPrecedence['<'] = 10;; BinopPrecedence['+'] = 20;; BinopPrecedence['-'] = 20;.

Unlike the rest of the binary operators, our assignment operator doesn't; follow the ""emit LHS, emit RHS, do computation"" model. As such, it is; handled as a special case before the other binary operators are handled.; The other strange thing is that it requires the LHS to be a variable. It; is invalid to have ""(x+1) = expr"" - only things like ""x = expr"" are; allowed. .. code-block:: c++. // Codegen the RHS.; Value *Val = RHS->codegen();; if (!Val); return nullptr;. // Look up the name.; Value *Variable = NamedValues[LHSE->getName()];; if (!Variable); return LogErrorV(""Unknown variable name"");.

Once we have the variable, codegen'ing the assignment is; straightforward: we emit the RHS of the assignment, create a store, and; return the computed value.

In addition to compiling and executing programs, whole program tests; serve as a way of benchmarking LLVM performance, both in terms of the; efficiency of the programs generated as well as the speed with which; LLVM compiles, optimizes, and generates code. The test-suite is located in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details. Debugging Information tests; ---------------------------. The test suite contains tests to check quality of debugging information.; The test are written in C based languages or in LLVM assembly language. These tests are compiled and run under a debugger. The debugger output; is checked to validate of debugging information. See README.txt in the; test suite for more information. This test suite is located in the; ``cross-project-tests/debuginfo-tests`` directory. Quick start; ===========. The tests are located in two separate repositories. The unit and; regression tests are in the main ""llvm""/ directory under the directories; ``llvm/unittests`` and ``llvm/test`` (so you get these tests for free with the; main LLVM tree). Use ``make check-all`` to run the unit and regression tests; after building LLVM. The ``test-suite`` module contains more comprehensive tests including whole C; and C++ programs. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details. Unit and Regression tests; -------------------------.

If *either* the LHS or RHS has a single use, we can definitely do the; transformation. In the overlapping liverange case we're trading one register; use for one fewer operation, which is a reasonable trade. Before doing this; we should verify that the llc output actually shrinks for some benchmarks.; 2.

Testability,"very simple: it expects to be called when the current; token is a ``tok_number`` token. It takes the current number value,; creates a ``NumberExprAST`` node, advances the lexer to the next token,; and finally returns. There are some interesting aspects to this. The most important one is; that this routine eats all of the tokens that correspond to the; production and returns the lexer buffer with the next token (which is; not part of the grammar production) ready to go. This is a fairly; standard way to go for recursive descent parsers. For a better example,; the parenthesis operator is defined like this:. .. code-block:: c++. /// parenexpr ::= '(' expression ')'; static std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> ParseParenExpr() {; getNextToken(); // eat (.; auto V = ParseExpression();; if (!V); return nullptr;. if (CurTok != ')'); return LogError(""expected ')'"");; getNextToken(); // eat ).; return V;; }. This function illustrates a number of interesting things about the; parser:. 1) It shows how we use the LogError routines. When called, this function; expects that the current token is a '(' token, but after parsing the; subexpression, it is possible that there is no ')' waiting. For example,; if the user types in ""(4 x"" instead of ""(4)"", the parser should emit an; error. Because errors can occur, the parser needs a way to indicate that; they happened: in our parser, we return null on an error. 2) Another interesting aspect of this function is that it uses recursion; by calling ``ParseExpression`` (we will soon see that; ``ParseExpression`` can call ``ParseParenExpr``). This is powerful; because it allows us to handle recursive grammars, and keeps each; production very simple. Note that parentheses do not cause construction; of AST nodes themselves. While we could do it this way, the most; important role of parentheses are to guide the parser and provide; grouping. Once the parser constructs the AST, parentheses are not; needed.

Testability,"view; ========. The MIR serialization format uses a YAML container. YAML is a standard; data serialization language, and the full YAML language spec can be read at; `yaml.org; <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Introduction>`_. A MIR file is split up into a series of `YAML documents`_. The first document; can contain an optional embedded LLVM IR module, and the rest of the documents; contain the serialized machine functions. .. _YAML documents: http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2800132. MIR Testing Guide; =================. You can use the MIR format for testing in two different ways:. - You can write MIR tests that invoke a single code generation pass using the; ``-run-pass`` option in llc. - You can use llc's ``-stop-after`` option with existing or new LLVM assembly; tests and check the MIR output of a specific code generation pass. Testing Individual Code Generation Passes; -----------------------------------------. The ``-run-pass`` option in llc allows you to create MIR tests that invoke just; a single code generation pass. When this option is used, llc will parse an; input MIR file, run the specified code generation pass(es), and output the; resulting MIR code. You can generate an input MIR file for the test by using the ``-stop-after`` or; ``-stop-before`` option in llc. For example, if you would like to write a test; for the post register allocation pseudo instruction expansion pass, you can; specify the machine copy propagation pass in the ``-stop-after`` option, as it; runs just before the pass that we are trying to test:. ``llc -stop-after=machine-cp bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. If the same pass is run multiple times, a run index can be included; after the name with a comma. ``llc -stop-after=dead-mi-elimination,1 bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``. After generating the input MIR file, you'll have to add a run line that uses; the ``-run-pass`` option to it. In order to test the post register allocation; pseudo instruction expansion pass on X86-64, ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst:1574,test,tests,1574,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MIRLangRef.rst,1,['test'],['tests']

Before this happens; we need to decide where it is appropriate to use memory locations and where we; must use a non-memory location (or no location) for each variable. In order to; make those decisions we run a standard fixed-point dataflow analysis that makes; the choice at each instruction, iteratively joining the results for each block. ### TODO list. As this is an experimental work in progress so there are some items we still need; to tackle:. * As mentioned in test llvm/test/DebugInfo/assignment-tracking/X86/diamond-3.ll,; the analysis should treat escaping calls like untagged stores. * The system expects locals to be backed by a local alloca. This isn't always; the case - sometimes a pointer to storage is passed into a function; (e.g. sret, byval). We need to be able to handle those cases. See; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for examples. * `trackAssignments` doesn't yet work for variables that have their; `llvm.dbg.declare` location modified by a `DIExpression`, e.g. when the; address of the variable is itself stored in an `alloca` with the; `llvm.dbg.declare` using `DIExpression(DW_OP_deref)`. See `indirectReturn` in; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and in; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for an; example. * In order to solve the first bullet-point we need to be able to specify that a; memory location is available without using a `DIAssignID`. This is because; the storage address is not computed by an instruction (it's an argument; value) and therefore we have nowhere to put the metadata attachment.

The naive lowering select between two different values. It should recognize the; test is equality test so it's more a conditional move rather than a select:; cmp r0, #1; movne r0, #0.

Optimize unnecessary checks for zero with __builtin_clz/ctz. Those builtins; are specified to be undefined at zero, so portable code must check for zero; and handle it as a special case. That is unnecessary on ARM where those; operations are implemented in a way that is well-defined for zero. For; example:. int f(int x) { return x ? __builtin_clz(x) : sizeof(int)*8; }. should just be implemented with a CLZ instruction. Since there are other; targets, e.g., PPC, that share this behavior, it would be best to implement; this in a target-independent way: we should probably fold that (when using; ""undefined at zero"" semantics) to set the ""defined at zero"" bit and have; the code generator expand out the right code. //===-----------------------------",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/lib/Target/ARM/README.txt:20407,test,test,20407,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/lib/Target/ARM/README.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/lib/Target/ARM/README.txt,2,['test'],['test']

However,; `TTree::Draw` when called with option ""`same`"" gets the current pad; coordinates to build an intermediate histogram with the right limits.; Since nothing has been painted in the pad yet, the pad limits have not; been computed. Calling `pad->Update()` forces the painting of the pad; and allows `TTree::Draw` to compute the right limits for the; intermediate histogram. ### Setting the Range in TTree::Draw.

Otherwise, it will exit with the status 0. Other exit codes are used; for non-test related failures (for example a user error or an internal program; error). .. _test-discovery:. TEST DISCOVERY; --------------. The inputs passed to :program:`lit` can be either individual tests, or entire; directories or hierarchies of tests to run. When :program:`lit` starts up, the; first thing it does is convert the inputs into a complete list of tests to run; as part of *test discovery*. In the :program:`lit` model, every test must exist inside some *test suite*.; :program:`lit` resolves the inputs specified on the command line to test suites; by searching upwards from the input path until it finds a :file:`lit.cfg` or; :file:`lit.site.cfg` file. These files serve as both a marker of test suites; and as configuration files which :program:`lit` loads in order to understand; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite. Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directories. This behavior makes it easy to specify a subset of tests to run, while still; allowing the test suite configuration to control exactly how tests are; interpreted. In addition, :program:`lit` always identifies tests by the test; suite they are in, and their relative path inside the test suite. For; appropriately configured projects, this allows :program:`lit` to provide; convenient and flexible support for out-of-tree builds. .. _test-status-results:.

Testability,"want them.; Remember that clients of the AST should never have to ""think"" to; understand what's going on. For example, all implicit conversions should; show up explicitly in the AST.; * Write tests that use your expression as a subexpression of other,; well-known expressions. Can you call a function using your expression as; an argument? Can you use the ternary operator?. #. Teach code generation to create IR to your AST node. This step is the first; (and only) that requires knowledge of LLVM IR. There are several things to; keep in mind:. * Code generation is separated into scalar/aggregate/complex and; lvalue/rvalue paths, depending on what kind of result your expression; produces. On occasion, this requires some careful factoring of code to; avoid duplication.; * ``CodeGenFunction`` contains functions ``ConvertType`` and; ``ConvertTypeForMem`` that convert Clang's types (``clang::Type*`` or; ``clang::QualType``) to LLVM types. Use the former for values, and the; latter for memory locations: test with the C++ ""``bool``"" type to check; this. If you find that you are having to use LLVM bitcasts to make the; subexpressions of your expression have the type that your expression; expects, STOP! Go fix semantic analysis and the AST so that you don't; need these bitcasts.; * The ``CodeGenFunction`` class has a number of helper functions to make; certain operations easy, such as generating code to produce an lvalue or; an rvalue, or to initialize a memory location with a given value. Prefer; to use these functions rather than directly writing loads and stores,; because these functions take care of some of the tricky details for you; (e.g., for exceptions).; * If your expression requires some special behavior in the event of an; exception, look at the ``push*Cleanup`` functions in ``CodeGenFunction``; to introduce a cleanup. You shouldn't have to deal with; exception-handling directly.; * Testing is extremely important in IR generation.

Testability,"ward: simply call the constructor; for the kind of instruction to instantiate and provide the necessary parameters.; For example, an ``AllocaInst`` only *requires* a (const-ptr-to) ``Type``. Thus:. .. code-block:: c++. auto *ai = new AllocaInst(Type::Int32Ty);. will create an ``AllocaInst`` instance that represents the allocation of one; integer in the current stack frame, at run time. Each ``Instruction`` subclass; is likely to have varying default parameters which change the semantics of the; instruction, so refer to the `doxygen documentation for the subclass of; Instruction <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Instruction.html>`_ that; you're interested in instantiating. *Naming values*. It is very useful to name the values of instructions when you're able to, as; this facilitates the debugging of your transformations. If you end up looking; at generated LLVM machine code, you definitely want to have logical names; associated with the results of instructions! By supplying a value for the; ``Name`` (default) parameter of the ``Instruction`` constructor, you associate a; logical name with the result of the instruction's execution at run time. For; example, say that I'm writing a transformation that dynamically allocates space; for an integer on the stack, and that integer is going to be used as some kind; of index by some other code. To accomplish this, I place an ``AllocaInst`` at; the first point in the first ``BasicBlock`` of some ``Function``, and I'm; intending to use it within the same ``Function``. I might do:. .. code-block:: c++. auto *pa = new AllocaInst(Type::Int32Ty, 0, ""indexLoc"");. where ``indexLoc`` is now the logical name of the instruction's execution value,; which is a pointer to an integer on the run time stack. *Inserting instructions*.

There is no analogous flag to use when tracing indirect calls, branches, and; returns. The predicate state must be accumulated through some other means.; Fundamentally, this is the reverse of the problem posed in CFI: we need to; check where we came from rather than where we are going. For function-local; jump tables, this is easily arranged by testing the input to the jump table; within each destination (not yet implemented, use retpolines):; ```; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; jmpq *.LJTI0_0(,%rdi,8) # Indirect jump through table.; .LBB0_2: # %sw.bb; testq $0, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL. .LBB0_3: # %sw.bb1; testq $1, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL. .LBB0_5: # %sw.bb10; testq $2, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL; ... .section .rodata,""a"",@progbits; .p2align 3; .LJTI0_0:; .quad .LBB0_2; .quad .LBB0_3; .quad .LBB0_5; ...; ```. Returns have a simple mitigation technique on x86-64 (or other ABIs which have; what is called a ""red zone"" region beyond the end of the stack). This region is; guaranteed to be preserved across interrupts and context switches, making the; return address used in returning to the current code remain on the stack and; valid to read.

The user can force a collection to delete its objects, but that is; the user's choice. ### Determining the Class of Contained Objects. Most containers may hold heterogeneous collections of objects and then; it is left to the user to correctly cast the **`TObject`** pointer to; the right class. Casting to the wrong class will give wrong results and; may well crash the program! Therefore, the user has to be very careful.; Often a container only contains one class of objects, but if it really; contains a mixture, it is possible to ask each object about its class; using the `InheritsFrom` method. For example if `myObject` is a **`TObject`** pointer:. ``` {.cpp}; if (myObject->InheritsFrom(""TParticle"") {; printf(""myObject is a TParticlen"");; }; ```. As the name suggests, this test works even if the object is a subclass; of **`TParticle`**. The member function `IsA()` can be used instead of; `InheritsFrom` to make the test exact. The `InheritsFrom` and `IsA`; methods use the extensive Run Time Type Information (RTTI) available via; the ROOT meta-classes. ### Types of Collections. The ROOT system implements the following basic types of collections:; unordered collections, ordered collections and sorted collections. Next; figure shows the inheritance hierarchy for the primary collection; classes.

If the test is run and the expected error is emitted on the expected line, the; diagnostic verifier will pass. However, if the expected error does not appear; or appears in a different location than expected, or if additional diagnostics; appear, the diagnostic verifier will fail and emit information as to why. The ``-verify`` command optionally accepts a comma-delimited list of one or; more verification prefixes that can be used to craft those special comments.; Each prefix must start with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters,; hyphens, and underscores. ``-verify`` by itself is equivalent to; ``-verify=expected``, meaning that special comments will start with; ``expected``. Using different prefixes makes it easier to have separate; ``RUN:`` lines in the same test file which result in differing diagnostic; behavior. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // RUN: %clang_cc1 -verify=foo,bar %s. int A = B; // foo-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}; int C = D; // bar-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'D'}}; int E = F; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'F'}}. The verifier will recognize ``foo-error`` and ``bar-error`` as special comments; but will not recognize ``expected-error`` as one because the ``-verify`` line; does not contain that as a prefix. Thus, this test would fail verification; because an unexpected diagnostic would appear on the declaration of ``E``. Multiple occurrences accumulate prefixes.

By fixing the address of the indirect jump; for the lifetime of the program we can give the function a permanent ""effective; address"", one that can be safely used for indirection and function pointer; comparison even if the function's implementation is never compiled, or if it is; compiled more than once (due to, for example, recompiling the function at a; higher optimization level) and changes address. The second utility, the compile; callback, represents a re-entry point from the program into the compiler that; will trigger compilation and then execution of a function. By initializing the; function's stub to point at the function's compile callback, we enable lazy; compilation: The first attempted call to the function will follow the function; pointer and trigger the compile callback instead.

Relationship to other ROOT components; -------------------------------------. The RNTuple classes have the following relationship to other parts of ROOT. The RNTuple classes use core ROOT infrastructure classes, such as error handling and logging.; When necessary, RNTuple uses a `TFile` for reading and writing.; The cases of writing to a local file and reading from a local file, a file from XRootD or from HTTP, do _not_ require `TFile`.; For these cases, RNTuple depends on the `RRawFile` class and its XRootD and Davix plugins. For user-defined classes as well as sets and maps, RNTuple uses `TClass`.; Simple types and other stdlib classes are natively supported and do not require dictionaries.; See the format specification for an exhaustive list of types supported in RNTuple.; The streamer field uses the standard ROOT streaming machinery. Integration to RDataFrame is provided through an RNTuple data source.; A universal RDataFrame constructor can create a data frame from either a TTree or an RNTuple with the same syntax.

To do this, it takes the test; program and partitions it into two pieces: one piece which it compiles with the; ""safe"" backend (into a shared object), and one piece which it runs with either; the JIT or the static LLC compiler. It uses several techniques to reduce the; amount of code pushed through the LLVM code generator, to reduce the potential; scope of the problem. After it is finished, it emits two bitcode files (called; ""test"" [to be compiled with the code generator] and ""safe"" [to be compiled with; the ""safe"" backend], respectively), and instructions for reproducing the; problem.

The miscompilation debugger works similarly to the code generator debugger.

It attempts to narrow down the list of passes to the one (or few); which are causing the miscompilation, then reduce the portion of the test; program which is being miscompiled.

Here are some hints and tips:. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, ``bugpoint`` only works; with programs that have deterministic output. Thus, if the program outputs; ``argv[0]``, the date, time, or any other ""random"" data, ``bugpoint`` may; misinterpret differences in these data, when output, as the result of a; miscompilation. Programs should be temporarily modified to disable outputs; that are likely to vary from run to run. * In the `crash debugger`_, ``bugpoint`` does",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst:5150,test,test,5150,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,1,['test'],['test']

[sec:intro]. ## The organization of M ##. The M package acts on a multiparameter *objective function* which is; called — for historical reasons — the $\mbox{FCN}$ function (see; [howto:fcn]). This function is usually a chisquared or a log–likelihood,; but it could also be a mathematical function. The $\mbox{FCN}$; function needs to be written in for which M defines the pure abstract; base class FCNBase as interface. The user must define and implement the; $\mbox{FCN}$ function in a derived class from FCNBase. Sometimes; this is done by an intermediate program such as HippoDraw@bib-HippoDraw,; in which case M is being used under the control of such an intermediate; program[^1]. The value of the $\mbox{FCN}$ function will in general; depend on one or more variable parameters whose meaning is defined by; the user (or by the intermediate program), but whose trial values are; determined by M . To take a simple example, suppose the problem is to fit a polynomial; through a set of data points. Then the user would write a; $\mbox{FCN}$ which calculates the $\chi^2$ between a polynomial and; the data; the variable parameters of $\mbox{FCN}$ would be the; coefficients of the polynomials.

For more details, consult the usage notes in the [TestStatistics README.md](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/roofit/roofitcore/src/TestStatistics/README.md).; For benchmarking results on the prototype version of the parallelized gradient calculator, see the corresponding [CHEP19 proceedings paper](https://doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/202024506027). ### New pythonizations.

Asserts are always enabled for `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` and `dev=ON`. The previous behavior of the builds set via the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable has not changed.; - `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`, i.e. the C++ standard ROOT is built with, now defaults to the compiler default (or C++11 if the compiler default is older than that) rather than always defaulting to C++11. In turn this means that v6.24 is the first ROOT release for which ROOT's pre-compiled binaries are not compiled with C++11 but with the default standard in use by the default system compiler. On Ubuntu 20.04, for example, the v6.24 pre-compiled binaries are now compiled with C++14 rather than C++11 as it happened for previous ROOT versions.

A AVX512 feature will enable both ``__EVEX256__``,; ``__EVEX512__`` and its own macro.

Testability,"x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction. Along both edges after this fork in control flow,; the flags register remains alive and contains data that we can use to build up; our accumulated predicate state. We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These conditional move instructions are known to not be predicted on any x86; processors, making them immune to misprediction that could reintroduce the; vulnerability. When we insert the conditional moves, the code ends up looking; like the following:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.2: # %then1; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.3: # %then2; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_4; .LBB0_1:; cmoveq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; ```. Here we create the ""empty"" or ""correct execution"" predicate state by zeroing; `%rax`, and we create a constant ""incorrect execution"" predicate value by; putting `-1` into `%r8`. Then, along each edge coming out of a conditional; branch we do a conditional move that in a correct execution will be a no-op,; but if misspeculated, will replace the `%rax` with the value of `%r8`.; Misspeculating any one of the three predicates will cause `%rax` to hold the; ""incorrect execution"" value from `%r8` as we preserve incoming values when; execution is correct rather than overwriting it. We now have a value in `%rax` in each basic block that indicates if at some; point previously a predicate was mispredicted.

Also, it's generally better to write regular expressions that use entire; triple components, than to do something clever to shorten them. For; example, to match both freebsd and netbsd in an expression, you could write; ``target={{.*(free|net)bsd.*}}`` and that would work. However, it would; prevent a ``grep freebsd`` from finding this test. Better to use:; ``target={{.+-freebsd.*}} || target={{.+-netbsd.*}}``. Substitutions; -------------.

To execute this macro, you will; need the library `$ROOTSYS/test/libEvent.so`. If it does not exist you; can build the test directory applications by following the instruction; in the `$ROOTSYS/test/README` file.

In addition, because it inherits from; **`TObject`** it can be a member of a collection.

Testability,"xpected to fail when targeting PowerPC or running on Darwin.; ; XFAIL: target=powerpc{{.*}}, system-darwin. Tips for writing constraints; ----------------------------. **``REQUIRES`` and ``UNSUPPORTED``**. These are logical inverses. In principle, ``UNSUPPORTED`` isn't absolutely; necessary (the logical negation could be used with ``REQUIRES`` to get; exactly the same effect), but it can make these clauses easier to read and; understand. Generally, people use ``REQUIRES`` to state things that the test; depends on to operate correctly, and ``UNSUPPORTED`` to exclude cases where; the test is expected never to work. **``UNSUPPORTED`` and ``XFAIL``**. Both of these indicate that the test isn't expected to work; however, they; have different effects. ``UNSUPPORTED`` causes the test to be skipped;; this saves execution time, but then you'll never know whether the test; actually would start working. Conversely, ``XFAIL`` actually runs the test; but expects a failure output, taking extra execution time but alerting you; if/when the test begins to behave correctly (an XPASS test result). You; need to decide which is more appropriate in each case. **Using ``target=...``**. Checking the target triple can be tricky; it's easy to mis-specify. For; example, ``target=mips{{.*}}`` will match not only mips, but also mipsel,; mips64, and mips64el. ``target={{.*}}-linux-gnu`` will match; x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, but not armv8l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.; Prefer to use hyphens to delimit triple components (``target=mips-{{.*}}``); and it's generally a good idea to use a trailing wildcard to allow for; unexpected suffixes. Also, it's generally better to write regular expressions that use entire; triple components, than to do something clever to shorten them. For; example, to match both freebsd and netbsd in an expression, you could write; ``target={{.*(free|net)bsd.*}}`` and that would work. However, it would; prevent a ``grep freebsd`` from finding this test.

Once the PassManager is set up, we need to make use of it. We do this by; running it after our newly created function is constructed (in; ``FunctionAST::codegen()``), but before it is returned to the client:. .. code-block:: c++. if (Value *RetVal = Body->codegen()) {; // Finish off the function.; Builder.CreateRet(RetVal);. // Validate the generated code, checking for consistency.; verifyFunction(*TheFunction);. // Optimize the function.; TheFPM->run(*TheFunction, *TheFAM);. return TheFunction;; }.

As expected, we now get our nicely optimized code, saving a floating; point add instruction from every execution of this function. LLVM provides a wide variety of optimizations that can be used in; certain circumstances. Some `documentation about the various; passes <../../Passes.html>`_ is available, but it isn't very complete.; Another good source of ideas can come from looking at the passes that; ``Clang`` runs to get started. The ""``opt``"" tool allows you to; experiment with passes from the command line, so you can see if they do; anything.

A header with the ``umbrella`` specifier is called an umbrella header. An umbrella header includes all of the headers within its directory (and any subdirectories), and is typically used (in the ``#include`` world) to easily access the full API provided by a particular library. With modules, an umbrella header is a convenient shortcut that eliminates the need to write out ``header`` declarations for every library header. A given directory can only contain a single umbrella header. .. note::; Any headers not included by the umbrella header should have; explicit ``header`` declarations. Use the; ``-Wincomplete-umbrella`` warning option to ask Clang to complain; about headers not covered by the umbrella header or the module map.

Test LLVM in Visual Studio:. You can run LLVM tests by merely building the project ""check-all"". The test; results will be shown in the VS output window.

Of course we could; introduce hashing and other helpers, but it is still just an optimization, and; thus the level of O(N*N) complexity. Can we reach another level? Could we introduce logarithmical search, or random; access lookup? The answer is: ""yes"". Random-access; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; How it could this be done? Just convert each function to a number, and gather; all of them in a special hash-table. Functions with equal hashes are equal.; Good hashing means, that every function part must be taken into account. That; means we have to convert every function part into some number, and then add it; into the hash. The lookup-up time would be small, but such an approach adds some; delay due to the hashing routine. Logarithmical search; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; We could introduce total ordering among the functions set, once ordered we; could then implement a logarithmical search. Lookup time still depends on N,; but adds a little of delay (*log(N)*). Present state; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; Both of the approaches (random-access and logarithmical) have been implemented; and tested and both give a very good improvement. What was most; surprising is that logarithmical search was faster; sometimes by up to 15%. The; hashing method needs some extra CPU time, which is the main reason why it works; slower; in most cases, total ""hashing"" time is greater than total; ""logarithmical-search"" time. So, preference has been granted to the ""logarithmical search"". Though in the case of need, *logarithmical-search* (read ""total-ordering"") could; be used as a milestone on our way to the *random-access* implementation. Every comparison is based either on the numbers or on the flags comparison. In; the *random-access* approach, we could use the same comparison algorithm.; During comparison, we exit once we find the difference, but here we might have; to scan the whole function body every time (note, it could be slower).

Testability,"y instrumentation of 'safe' variables. SafeStack is going to be the; first user. 'safe' variables can be defined as variables that can not be used out-of-scope; (e.g. use-after-return) or accessed out of bounds. In the future it can be; extended to track other variable properties. E.g. we plan to extend; implementation with a check to make sure that variable is always initialized; before every read to optimize use-of-uninitialized-memory checks. How it works; ============. The analysis is implemented in two stages:. The intra-procedural, or 'local', stage performs a depth-first search inside; functions to collect all uses of each alloca, including loads/stores and uses as; arguments functions. After this stage we know which parts of the alloca are used; by functions itself but we don't know what happens after it is passed as; an argument to another function. The inter-procedural, or 'global', stage, resolves what happens to allocas after; they are passed as function arguments. This stage performs a depth-first search; on function calls inside a single module and propagates allocas usage through; functions calls. When used with ThinLTO, the global stage performs a whole program analysis over; the Module Summary Index. Testing; =======. The analysis is covered with lit tests. We expect that users can tolerate false classification of variables as; 'unsafe' when in-fact it's 'safe'. This may lead to inefficient code. However, we; can't accept false 'safe' classification which may cause sanitizers to miss actual; bugs in instrumented code. To avoid that we want additional validation tool. AddressSanitizer may help with this validation. We can instrument all variables; as usual but additionally store stack-safe information in the; ``ASanStackVariableDescription``. Then if AddressSanitizer detects a bug on; a 'safe' variable we can produce an additional report to let the user know that; probably Stack Safety Analysis failed and we should check for a bug in the; compiler.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst:1561,Test,Testing,1561,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst,2,"['Test', 'test']","['Testing', 'tests']"

These limitations impose restrictions on what you can test with the MIR format.; For now, tests that would like to test some behaviour that depends on the state; of temporary or local ``MCSymbol`` operands or the exception handling state in; MMI, can't use the MIR format.

In CPython, the performance of `non-overloaded` function calls depends; greatly on the Python interpreter's internal specializations; and Python3; has many specializations specific to basic extension modules (C function; pointer calls), gaining a performance boost of more than 30% over Python2.; Only since Python3.8 is there also better support for closure objects (vector; calls) as cppyy uses, to short-cut through the interpreter's own overhead. As a practical consideration, whether a binder performs well on code that you; care about, depends `entirely` on whether it has the relevant specializations; for your most performance-sensitive use cases.; The only way to know for sure is to write a test application and measure, but; a binder that provides more specializations, or makes it easy to add your; own, is more likely to deliver. `Manual v.s. automatic`; -----------------------.

Using ``debugify``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A simple way to use ``debugify`` is as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. $ opt -debugify -pass-to-test -check-debugify sample.ll. This will inject synthetic DI to ``sample.ll`` run the ``pass-to-test`` and; then check for missing DI.

In order for ``check-debugify`` to work, the DI must be coming from; ``debugify``. Thus, modules with existing DI will be skipped. ``debugify`` can be used to test a backend, e.g:. .. code-block:: bash. $ opt -debugify < sample.ll | llc -o -. There is also a MIR-level debugify pass that can be run before each backend; pass, see:; :ref:`Mutation testing for MIR-level transformations<MIRDebugify>`. ``debugify`` in regression tests; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Feature Test Macros; ===================; Clang implements several ways to test whether a feature is supported or not.; Some of these feature tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a particular relevant target?. If the answer to any of these is ""yes"", the feature test macro should either; not be defined or there should be very strong rationale for why the issues; should not prevent defining it. Note, it is acceptable to define the feature; test macro on a per-target basis if needed. When in doubt, being conservative is better than being aggressive. If we don't; claim support for the feature but it does useful things, users can still use it; and provide us with useful feedback on what is missing. But if we claim support; for a feature that has significant bugs, we've eliminated most of the utility; of having a feature testing macro at all because u",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:163276,test,test,163276,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,2,['test'],['test']

Type ""show warranty"" for details.; This GDB was configured as ""sparc-sun-solaris2.6""...; (gdb). Note that :program:`opt` has a lot of debugging information in it, so it takes; time to load. Be patient. Since we cannot set a breakpoint in our pass yet; (the shared object isn't loaded until runtime), we must execute the process,; and have it stop before it invokes our pass, but after it has loaded the shared; object. The most foolproof way of doing this is to set a breakpoint in; ``PassManager::run`` and then run the process with the arguments you want:. .. code-block:: console. $ (gdb) break llvm::PassManager::run; Breakpoint 1 at 0x2413bc: file Pass.cpp, line 70.; (gdb) run test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Starting program: opt test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Breakpoint 1, PassManager::run (this=0xffbef174, M=@0x70b298) at Pass.cpp:70; 70 bool PassManager::run(Module &M) { return PM->run(M); }; (gdb).

Miscellaneous Problems; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

The ``report`` also generate a file; called ``report.<type>.raw.out`` containing the output of the entire; test run. Writing Custom Tests for the test-suite; =======================================. Assuming you can run the test suite, (e.g.; ""``gmake TEST=nightly report``"" should work), it is really easy to run; optimizations or code generator components against every program in the; tree, collecting statistics or running custom checks for correctness. At; base, this is how the nightly tester works, it's just one example of a; general framework. Lets say that you have an LLVM optimization pass, and you want to see; how many times it triggers. First thing you should do is add an LLVM; `statistic <ProgrammersManual.html#Statistic>`_ to your pass, which will; tally counts of things you care about. Following this, you can set up a test and a report that collects these; and formats them for easy viewing. This consists of two files, a; ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.Makefile``"" fragment (where XXX is the name of; your test) and a ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.report``"" file that indicates; how to format the output into a table. There are many example reports of; various levels of sophistication included with the test suite, and the; framework is very general. If you are interested in testing an optimization pass, check out the; ""libcalls"" test as an example. It can be run like this:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd llvm/projects/test-suite/MultiSource/Benchmarks # or some other level; % make TEST=libcalls report.

Testability,"ysis should; always involve two functions: an ``ActOnXXX`` function that will be called; directly from the parser, and a ``BuildXXX`` function that performs the; actual semantic analysis and will (eventually!) build the AST node. It's; fairly common for the ``ActOnCXX`` function to do very little (often just; some minor translation from the parser's representation to ``Sema``'s; representation of the same thing), but the separation is still important:; C++ template instantiation, for example, should always call the ``BuildXXX``; variant. Several notes on semantic analysis before we get into construction; of the AST:. * Your expression probably involves some types and some subexpressions.; Make sure to fully check that those types, and the types of those; subexpressions, meet your expectations. Add implicit conversions where; necessary to make sure that all of the types line up exactly the way you; want them. Write extensive tests to check that you're getting good; diagnostics for mistakes and that you can use various forms of; subexpressions with your expression.; * When type-checking a type or subexpression, make sure to first check; whether the type is ""dependent"" (``Type::isDependentType()``) or whether a; subexpression is type-dependent (``Expr::isTypeDependent()``). If any of; these return ``true``, then you're inside a template and you can't do much; type-checking now. That's normal, and your AST node (when you get there); will have to deal with this case. At this point, you can write tests that; use your expression within templates, but don't try to instantiate the; templates.; * For each subexpression, be sure to call ``Sema::CheckPlaceholderExpr()``; to deal with ""weird"" expressions that don't behave well as subexpressions.; Then, determine whether you need to perform lvalue-to-rvalue conversions; (``Sema::DefaultLvalueConversions``) or the usual unary conversions; (``Sema::UsualUnaryConversions``), for places where the subexpression is; producing a value y",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:146662,test,tests,146662,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['test'],['tests']

To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location. To build a relocatable precompiled header, place your headers into a; subdirectory whose structure mimics the installed location.

In case you want to rotate the; frame and want to know the coordinates of objects in the rotated system,; you should apply the inverse rotation to the objects. If you want to; transform coordinates from the rotated frame to the original frame you; have to apply the direct transformation. A rotation around a specified; axis means counterclockwise rotation around the positive direction of; the axis. ### Declaration, Access, Comparisons. ``` {.cpp}; TRotation r; // r initialized as identity; TRotation m(r); // m = r; ```. There is no direct way to set the matrix elements - to ensure that a; **`TRotation`** always describes a real rotation.

The `Rotate()` method allows you to rotate around an arbitrary vector; (not necessary a unit one) and returns the result. ``` {.cpp}; r.Rotate(TMath::Pi()/3,TVector3(3,4,5));; ```.

Note that we use the option itself to print; out the error message (the ``error`` method always returns true) in order to get; a nice error message (shown below).

Which adds this to the output of our program:. ::. OPTIONS:; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); ...; -max-file-size=<size> - Maximum file size to accept. And we can test that our parse works correctly now (the test program just prints; out the max-file-size argument value):. ::. $ ./test; MFS: 0; $ ./test -max-file-size=123MB; MFS: 128974848; $ ./test -max-file-size=3G; MFS: 3221225472; $ ./test -max-file-size=dog; -max-file-size option: 'dog' value invalid for file size argument!.

The test-suite has configuration options to customize building and running the; benchmarks. CMake can print a list of them:. ```bash; % cd test-suite-build; # Print basic options:; % cmake -LH; # Print all options:; % cmake -LAH; ```. ### Common Configuration Options. - `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`. Specify extra flags to be passed to C compiler invocations. The flags are; also passed to the C++ compiler and linker invocations. See; [https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_FLAGS.html](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_FLAGS.html). - `CMAKE_C_COMPILER`.

In case you want to rotate the; frame and want to know the coordinates of objects in the rotated system,; you should apply the inverse rotation to the objects. If you want to; transform coordinates from the rotated frame to the original frame you; have to apply the direct transformation.

The `Rotate()` method allows you to rotate around an arbitrary vector; (not necessary a unit one) and returns the result. ``` {.cpp}; r.Rotate(TMath::Pi()/3,TVector3(3,4,5));; ```.

The performance overhead of this technique is likely to be very significant and; something users wish to control or reduce. There are interesting options here; that impact the implementation strategy used. One particularly appealing option is to allow both opt-in and opt-out of this; mitigation at reasonably fine granularity such as on a per-function basis,; including intelligent handling of inlining decisions -- protected code can be; prevented from inlining into unprotected code, and unprotected code will become; protected when inlined into protected code.

The **Total Time** is the real time in seconds to run the program.; **Effective time** is the real time minus the time spent in non I/O; operations (essentially the random number generator). The program; `Event` generates in average 600 tracks per event. Each track has 17; data members. The read benchmark runs in the interactive version of; ROOT. The ‘Total Time to Read All' is the real time reported by the; execution of the script `&ROOTSYS/test/eventa`. We did not correct this time for the overhead coming from the; interpreter itself. The **Total time to read sample** is the execution; time of the script `$ROOTSYS/test/eventb`. This script loops on all; events. For each event, the branch containing the number of tracks is; read. In case the number of tracks is less than 585, the full event is; read in memory. This test is obviously not possible in non-split mode.; In non-split mode, the full event must be read in memory. The times; reported in the table correspond to complete I/O operations necessary to; deal with **machine independent binary files**. On **Linux**, this also; includes byte-swapping operations. The ROOT file allows for direct; access to any event in the file and direct access to any part of an; event when split=1. Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7; Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1. The difference in; size is due to the object identification mechanism overhead when the; event is written to a single buffer. This overhead does not exist in; split mode because the branch buffers are optimized for homogeneous data; types. You can run the test programs on your architecture. The program; `Event` will report the write performance. You can measure the read; performance by executing the scripts `eventa` and `eventb`.

Between runs, CMake preserves the values set for all options. CMake has the; following build types defined:. Debug. These builds are the default. The build system will compile the tools and; libraries unoptimized, with debugging information, and asserts enabled. Release. For these builds, the build system will compile the tools and libraries; with optimizations enabled and not generate debug info. CMakes default; optimization level is -O3. This can be configured by setting the; ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE`` variable on the CMake command line. RelWithDebInfo. These builds are useful when debugging. They generate optimized binaries with; debug information. CMakes default optimization level is -O2. This can be; configured by setting the ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO`` variable on the; CMake command line. Once you have LLVM configured, you can build it by entering the *OBJ_ROOT*; directory and issuing the following command:. .. code-block:: console. % make.

Some existing tests use ``RUN: true`` in extra files instead of just; putting the extra files in an ``Inputs/`` directory. This pattern is; deprecated. Fragile tests; -------------. It is easy to write a fragile test that would fail spuriously if the tool being; tested outputs a full path to the input file. For example, :program:`opt` by; default outputs a ``ModuleID``:. .. code-block:: console. $ cat example.ll; define i32 @main() nounwind {; ret i32 0; }. $ opt -S /path/to/example.ll; ; ModuleID = '/path/to/example.ll'. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ret i32 0; }. ``ModuleID`` can unexpectedly match against ``CHECK`` lines. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: opt -S %s | FileCheck. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ; CHECK-NOT: load; ret i32 0; }. This test will fail if placed into a ``download`` directory. To make your tests robust, always use ``opt ... < %s`` in the RUN line.; :program:`opt` does not output a ``ModuleID`` when input comes from stdin. Platform-Specific Tests; -----------------------. Whenever adding tests that require the knowledge of a specific platform,; either related to code generated, specific output or back-end features,; you must make sure to isolate the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory.

The link or some other informative information about; the external action can then be presented to the user. ``{{{dumpfile:%s:%s}}}`` [#not_yet_implemented]_. Here the first ``%s`` is an identifier for a type of dump and the second; ``%s`` is an identifier for a particular dump that's just been published. The; types of dumps, the exact meaning of ""published"", and the nature of the; identifier are outside the scope of the markup format per se. In general it; might correspond to writing a file by that name or something similar. This element may trigger additional post-processing work beyond symbolizing; the markup. It indicates that a dump file of some sort has been published.; Some logic attached to the symbolizing filter may understand certain types of; dump file and trigger additional post-processing of the dump file upon; encountering this element (e.g. generating visualizations, symbolization). The; expectation is that the information collected from contextual elements; (described below) in the logging stream may be necessary to decode the content; of the dump. So if the symbolizing filter triggers other processing, it may; need to feed some distilled form of the contextual information to those; processes.

Usability," *point[3]);; ```. ### Initializing the Direction. In order to move inside geometry starting with the current point, the; modeller needs to know the current direction `(nx,ny,nz)`. This; direction is stored as `Double_t fCurrentDirection[3]` by the navigator; and it represents a direction in the global frame. It can be retrieved; with:. ``` {.cpp}; Const Double_t *cdir = gGeoManager->GetCurrentDirection();; ```. The direction can be initialized in a similar manner as the current; point:. ``` {.cpp}; gGeoManager->SetCurrentDirection(nx,ny,nz);; // or:; gGeoManager->SetCurrentDirection(Double_t *dir);; ```. ### Initializing the State. Setting the initial point and direction is not enough for initializing; tracking. The modeller needs to find out where the initial point is; located in the geometrical hierarchy. Due to the containment based; architecture of the model, this is the deepest positioned object; containing the point. For illustrating this, imagine that we have a; simple structure with a top volume `A` and another one `B `positioned; inside. Since `A `is a top volume, its associated node `A_1` will define; `MARS` and our simple hierarchy of nodes (positioned volumes) will be:; `/A_1/B_1`. Suppose now that the initial point is contained by `B_1`.; This implies by default that the point is also contained by `A_1`, since; `B_1` have to be fully contained by this. After searching the point; location, the modeller will consider that the point is located inside; `B_1`, which will be considered as the representative object (node) for; the current state. This is stored as: **`TGeoNode`**; \*`TGeoManager::fCurrentNode `and can be asked from the manager class; only after the `'Where am I?'` was completed:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoNode *current = gGeoManager->GetCurrentNode();; ```. In order to find the location of the current point inside the hierarchy; of nodes, after setting this point it is mandatory to call the; `‘Where am I?'` method:. ``` {.cpp}; gGeoManager->FindNode();;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:105461,simpl,simple,105461,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']

There are several ways of obtaining `PyROOT`, and which is best depends; on your specific situation. If you work at CERN, you can use the; installation available on `afs`.

ROOT installations with the build of `PyROOT` enabled are available from; the CERN `afs` cell `/afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>`. To use; them, simply modify your shell environment accordingly. For Unix:. `export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PYTHONDIR/bin:$PATH`. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. `export PYTHONPATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONPATH`. For Windows:. `set PATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONDIR%/bin;%PATH%`. `set PYTHONPATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONPATH%`. where `$ROOTSYS` should be set to; `/afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>`, and `PYTHONDIR` to; `/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/Python/2.3.4/<platform>` with `<version>`; and `<platform>` as appropriate. Note that the latest version of Python; is 2.4.1. #### Building from Source. The standard installation instructions for building ROOT from source; apply, with the addition that the build of `PyROOT` needs to be enabled; at the configuration step.

This function illustrates a number of interesting things about the; parser:. 1) It shows how we use the LogError routines. When called, this function; expects that the current token is a '(' token, but after parsing the; subexpression, it is possible that there is no ')' waiting. For example,; if the user types in ""(4 x"" instead of ""(4)"", the parser should emit an; error. Because errors can occur, the parser needs a way to indicate that; they happened: in our parser, we return null on an error. 2) Another interesting aspect of this function is that it uses recursion; by calling ``ParseExpression`` (we will soon see that; ``ParseExpression`` can call ``ParseParenExpr``). This is powerful; because it allows us to handle recursive grammars, and keeps each; production very simple. Note that parentheses do not cause construction; of AST nodes themselves. While we could do it this way, the most; important role of parentheses are to guide the parser and provide; grouping. Once the parser constructs the AST, parentheses are not; needed.

This code relies on an implicit conversion from the type of the lambda; expression (an unnamed, local class type called the *closure type*) to the; corresponding block pointer type. The conversion itself is expressed by a; conversion operator in that closure type that produces a block pointer with the; same signature as the lambda itself, e.g.,. .. code-block:: objc. operator NSComparisonResult (^)(id, id)() const;. This conversion function returns a new block that simply forwards the two; parameters to the lambda object (which it captures by copy), then returns the; result.

The conversion from a lambda to a block pointer is only available in; Objective-C++, and not in C++ with blocks, due to its use of Objective-C memory; management (autorelease).

Usability," ============. Block Frequency is a metric for estimating the relative frequency of different; basic blocks.

Blocks with multiple successors have probabilities associated with each; outgoing edge. These are called branch probabilities. For a given block, the; sum of its outgoing branch probabilities should be 1.0. Branch Weight; =============. Rather than storing fractions on each edge, we store an integer weight.; Weights are relative to the other edges of a given predecessor block. The; branch probability associated with a given edge is its own weight divided by; the sum of the weights on the predecessor's outgoing edges. For example, consider this IR:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() {; ; ...; A:; br i1 %cond, label %B, label %C, !prof !0; ; ...; }; !0 = !{!""branch_weights"", i32 7, i32 8}. and this simple graph representation::. A -> B (edge-weight: 7); A -> C (edge-weight: 8). The probability of branching from block A to block B is 7/15, and the; probability of branching from block A to block C is 8/15. See :doc:`BranchWeightMetadata` for details about the branch weight IR; representation. Block Frequency; ===============.

Usability," A cleanup is extra code which needs to be run as part of unwinding a scope. C++; destructors are a typical example, but other languages and language extensions; provide a variety of different kinds of cleanups. In general, a landing pad may; need to run arbitrary amounts of cleanup code before actually entering a catch; block. To indicate the presence of cleanups, a :ref:`i_landingpad` should have; a *cleanup* clause. Otherwise, the unwinder will not stop at the landing pad if; there are no catches or filters that require it to. .. note::. Do not allow a new exception to propagate out of the execution of a; cleanup. This can corrupt the internal state of the unwinder. Different; languages describe different high-level semantics for these situations: for; example, C++ requires that the process be terminated, whereas Ada cancels both; exceptions and throws a third. When all cleanups are finished, if the exception is not handled by the current; function, resume unwinding by calling the :ref:`resume instruction <i_resume>`,; passing in the result of the ``landingpad`` instruction for the original; landing pad. Throw Filters; -------------. Prior to C++17, C++ allowed the specification of which exception types may be; thrown from a function. To represent this, a top level landing pad may exist to; filter out invalid types. To express this in LLVM code the :ref:`i_landingpad`; will have a filter clause. The clause consists of an array of type infos.; ``landingpad`` will return a negative value; if the exception does not match any of the type infos. If no match is found then; a call to ``__cxa_call_unexpected`` should be made, otherwise; ``_Unwind_Resume``. Each of these functions requires a reference to the; exception structure. Note that the most general form of a ``landingpad``; instruction can have any number of catch, cleanup, and filter clauses (though; having more than one cleanup is pointless). The LLVM C++ front-end can generate; such ``landingpad`` instructions ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:12913,resume,resume,12913,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,2,['resume'],['resume']
Usability," After optimisations and code layout complete, information about variable; values must be translated into variable locations, i.e. registers and stack; slots. This is performed in the [`LiveDebugValues` pass][LiveDebugValues], where; the debug instructions and machine code are separated out into two independent; functions:; * One that assigns values to variable names,; * One that assigns values to machine registers and stack slots. LLVM's existing SSA tools are used to place `PHI`s for each function, between; variable values and the values contained in machine locations, with value; propagation eliminating any unnecessary `PHI`s. The two can then be joined up; to map variables to values, then values to locations, for each instruction in; the function. Key to this process is being able to identify the movement of values between; registers and stack locations, so that the location of values can be preserved; for the full time that they are resident in the machine. # Required target support and transition guide. Instruction referencing will work on any target, but likely with poor coverage.; Supporting instruction referencing well requires:; * Target hooks to be implemented to allow `LiveDebugValues` to follow values; through the machine,; * Target-specific optimisations to be instrumented, to preserve instruction; numbers. ## Target hooks. `TargetInstrInfo::isCopyInstrImpl` must be implemented to recognise any; instructions that are copy-like -- `LiveDebugValues` uses this to identify when; values move between registers. `TargetInstrInfo::isLoadFromStackSlotPostFE` and; `TargetInstrInfo::isStoreToStackSlotPostFE` are needed to identify spill and; restore instructions. Each should return the destination or source register; respectively. `LiveDebugValues` will track the movement of a value from / to; the stack slot.

Usability," CommandLine.; Simply specify the parser that you want to use with the command line option; when you declare it. `Custom parsers`_ are no problem. #. Labor Saving: The CommandLine library cuts down on the amount of grunt work; that you, the user, have to do. For example, it automatically provides a; ``-help`` option that shows the available command line options for your tool.; Additionally, it does most of the basic correctness checking for you. #. Capable: The CommandLine library can handle lots of different forms of; options often found in real programs. For example, `positional`_ arguments,; ``ls`` style `grouping`_ options (to allow processing '``ls -lad``'; naturally), ``ld`` style `prefix`_ options (to parse '``-lmalloc; -L/usr/lib``'), and interpreter style options. This document will hopefully let you jump in and start using CommandLine in your; utility quickly and painlessly. Additionally it should be a simple reference; manual to figure out how stuff works. Quick Start Guide; =================. This section of the manual runs through a simple CommandLine'ification of a; basic compiler tool. This is intended to show you how to jump into using the; CommandLine library in your own program, and show you some of the cool things it; can do. To start out, you need to include the CommandLine header file into your program:. .. code-block:: c++. #include ""llvm/Support/CommandLine.h"". Additionally, you need to add this as the first line of your main program:. .. code-block:: c++. int main(int argc, char **argv) {; cl::ParseCommandLineOptions(argc, argv);; ...; }. ... which actually parses the arguments and fills in the variable declarations.

Usability," CostModel, Legalization and SelectionDAG lowering. We will also emit diagnostics in Clang to prevent the use of; non-streaming(-compatible) operations, e.g. through ACLE intrinsics, when a; function is decorated with the streaming mode attributes. Other things to consider; ------------------------. * Inlining must be disabled when the call-site needs to toggle PSTATE.SM or; when the callee's function body is executed in a different streaming mode than; its caller. This is needed because function calls are the boundaries for; streaming mode changes. * Tail call optimization must be disabled when the call-site needs to toggle; PSTATE.SM, such that the caller can restore the original value of PSTATE.SM. 3. Handling PSTATE.ZA; =====================. In contrast to PSTATE.SM, enabling PSTATE.ZA does not affect the SVE vector; length and also doesn't clobber FP/AdvSIMD/SVE registers. This means it is safe; to toggle PSTATE.ZA using intrinsics. This also makes it simpler to setup a; lazy-save mechanism for calls to private-ZA functions (i.e. functions that may; either directly or indirectly clobber ZA state). For the purpose of handling functions marked with ``aarch64_pstate_za_new``,; we have introduced a new LLVM IR pass (SMEABIPass) that is run just before; SelectionDAG.

For more difficult problems the full FOAM may be better. ### How to run application programs ?. The application program can be run in two modes: it can be simply; interpreted by CLING or compiled. The first method is simpler but; results in slower execution. The second method employs ACLiC -; The Automatic Compiler of Libraries, which automatizes the; process of compilation and linking. In $(ROOTSYS)/tutorials there are 3 demonstration programs:. #### foam_kanwa.C; is a simple example how to run FOAM in interactive; mode.

You do not need to specify this second parameter; you can indicate by; the filename extension what format you want to save a canvas in (i.e.; `canvas.ps`, `canvas.gif`, `canvas.C`, etc). The size of the PostScript picture, by default, is computed to keep the; aspect ratio of the picture on the screen, where the size along `x` is; always 20 cm. You can set the size of the PostScript picture before; generating the picture with a command such as:. ``` {.cpp}; TPostScript myps(""myfile.ps"",111); myps.Range(xsize,ysize);; object->Draw();; myps.Close();; ```. The first parameter in the **`TPostScript`** constructor is the name of; the file; the second one is the format option:. - 111 - `ps portrait`. - 112 - `ps landscape`. - 113 - `eps`. You can set the default paper size with:. ``` {.cpp}; gStyle->SetPaperSize(xsize,ysize);; ```. You can resume writing again in this file with `myps.Open()`. Note that; you may have several Post Script files opened simultaneously. Use; `TPostScript::Text(x,y,""string"")` to add text to a postscript file. This; method writes the string in quotes into a PostScript file at position; `x, y` in world coordinates. ### Special Characters. The following characters have a special action on the PostScript file:. - `` ` `` - go to Greek. - `'` - go to special. - `~` - go to Zapf Dingbats. - `?` - go to subscript. - `^` - go to superscript. - `!` - go to normal level of script. - `&` - backspace one character. - `#` - end of Greek or end of ZapfDingbats. These special characters are printed as such on the screen. To generate; one of these characters on the PostScript file, you must escape it with; the escape character ""@"".

Range based loops over arrays of; size ``N`` that:. - start at index ``0``; - iterate consecutively; - end at index ``N-1``. We already check for (1), so all we need to add is a check to the loop's; condition to ensure that the loop's index variable is compared against; ``N`` and another check to ensure that the increment step just; increments this same variable.

Usability," Most layers that derived from IRLayer can rely on this default implementation; of the ``add`` method. These two operations, ``add`` and ``emit``, together constitute the layer; concept: A layer is a way to wrap a part of a compiler pipeline (in this case; the ""opt"" phase of an LLVM compiler) whose API is opaque to ORC with an; interface that ORC can call as needed. The add method takes an; module in some input program representation (in this case an LLVM IR module); and stores it in the target ``JITDylib``, arranging for it to be passed back; to the layer's emit method when any symbol defined by that module is requested.; Each layer can complete its own work by calling the ``emit`` method of its base; layer. For example, in this tutorial our IRTransformLayer calls through to; our IRCompileLayer to compile the transformed IR, and our IRCompileLayer in; turn calls our ObjectLayer to link the object file produced by our compiler. So far we have learned how to optimize and compile our LLVM IR, but we have; not focused on when compilation happens. Our current REPL optimizes and; compiles each function as soon as it is referenced by any other code,; regardless of whether it is ever called at runtime. In the next chapter we; will introduce a fully lazy compilation, in which functions are not compiled; until they are first called at run-time. At this point the trade-offs get much; more interesting: the lazier we are, the quicker we can start executing the; first function, but the more often we will have to pause to compile newly; encountered functions. If we only code-gen lazily, but optimize eagerly, we; will have a longer startup time (as everything is optimized at that time) but; relatively short pauses as each function just passes through code-gen. If we; both optimize and code-gen lazily we can start executing the first function; more quickly, but we will have longer pauses as each function has to be both; optimized and code-gen'd when it is first executed.

Usability," Pad. Now that we have a pointer to the active pad, ***`gPad`*** and that we; know this pad contains some objects, it is sometimes interesting to; access one of those objects. The method `GetPrimitive()` of **`TPad`**,; i.e. `TPad::GetPrimitive(const char* name)` does exactly this. Since; most of the objects that a pad contains derive from **`TObject`**, they; have a name. The following statement will return a pointer to the object; `myobjectname` and put that pointer into the variable `obj`. As you can; see, the type of returned pointer is `TObject*`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] obj = gPad->GetPrimitive(""myobjectname""); (class TObject*)0x1063cba8; ```. Even if your object is something more complicated, like a histogram; **`TH1F`**, this is normal. A function cannot return more than one type.; So the one chosen was the lowest common denominator to all possible; classes, the class from which everything derives, **`TObject`**. How do; we get the right pointer then? Simply do a cast of the function output; that will transform the output (pointer) into the right type. For; example if the object is a **`TPaveLabel`**:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] obj = (TPaveLabel*)(gPad->GetPrimitive(""myobjectname"")); (class TPaveLabel*)0x1063cba8; ```. This works for all objects deriving from **`TObject`**. However, a; question remains. An object has a name if it derives from **`TNamed`**,; not from **`TObject`**. For example, an arrow (**`TArrow`**) doesn't; have a name. In that case, the ""name"" is the name of the class. To know; the name of an object, just click with the right button on it. The name; appears at the top of the context menu. In case of multiple unnamed; objects, a call to `GetPrimitive(""className"")` returns the instance of; the class that was first created. To retrieve a later instance you can; use `GetListOfPrimitives()`, which returns a list of all the objects on; the pad. From the list you can select the object you need. #### Hiding an Object.

Note that after deleting ``%d``, all uses of its operand ``%c`` become; trivially dead. The debug use which used to point to ``%c`` is now ``undef``,; and debug info is needlessly lost. To solve this problem, do:. .. code-block:: cpp. llvm::replaceAllDbgUsesWith(%c, theSimplifiedAndInstruction, ...).

Usability," StreamerInfo record, which is written to disk; automatically when a new or modified file is closed. The StreamerInfo record is a list (ROOTIO class TList) of ""StreamerInfo"" objects; (ROOTIO class TStreamerInfo). There is one StreamerInfo object in the list for; every class used in the file in a data record, other than a core layer record.; There is no streamerinfo object for a class used in a core layer record unless the; class is also used elsewhere in a data record. When reading a self-identifying; object from a file, the system uses the StreamerInfo list to decompose the object; recursively into its simple data members. Each streamerinfo object is an array of ""streamer element"" objects, each of which; describes a base class of the object or a (non-static and non-transient) data member; of the object. If the base class or data member is itself a class, then there will; also be a streamerinfo object in the record for that class. In this way, each; class is recursively decomposed into its atomic elements, each of which is a simple; type (e.g. ""int"").

Usability," Symbolic values. In the previous example where we tried to figure out what values a variable can; have, the analysis had to be seeded with a concrete value. What if there are no; assignments of concrete values in the program? We can still deduce some; interesting information by representing unknown input values symbolically, and; computing results as symbolic expressions:. ```c++; void PrintAbs(int x) {; int result;; if (x >= 0) {; result = x; // result is {x}; } else {; result = -x; // result is {-x}; }; print(result); // result is {x; -x}; }; ```. We can't say what specific value gets printed, but we know that it is either `x`; or `-x`. Dataflow analysis is an instance of abstract interpretation, and does not dictate; how exactly the lattice and transfer functions should be designed, beyond the; necessary conditions for the analysis to converge. Nevertheless, we can use; symbolic execution ideas to guide our design of the lattice and transfer; functions: lattice values can be symbolic expressions, and transfer functions; can construct more complex symbolic expressions from symbolic expressions that; represent arguments. See [this StackOverflow; discussion](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19708/symbolic-execution-is-a-case-of-abstract-interpretation); for a further comparison of abstract interpretation and symbolic execution. ### Flow condition. A human can say about the previous example that the function returns `x` when; `x >= 0`, and `-x` when `x < 0`. We can make this conclusion programmatically by; tracking a flow condition.

Usability," The LLVM project is using GitHub Pull Requests for Code Reviews. This document; describes the typical workflow of creating a Pull Request and getting it reviewed; and accepted. This is meant as an overview of the GitHub workflow, for complete; documentation refer to `GitHub's documentation <https://docs.github.com/pull-requests>`_. GitHub Tools; ------------; You can interact with GitHub in several ways: via git command line tools,; the web browser, `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_, or the; `GitHub CLI <https://cli.github.com>`_. This guide will cover the git command line; tools and the GitHub CLI. The GitHub CLI (`gh`) will be most like the `arc` workflow and; recommended. Creating Pull Requests; ----------------------; Keep in mind that when creating a pull request, it should generally only contain one; self-contained commit initially.; This makes it easier for reviewers to understand the introduced changes and; provide feedback. It also helps maintain a clear and organized commit history; for the project. If you have multiple changes you want to introduce, it's; recommended to create separate pull requests for each change. Create a local branch per commit you want to submit and then push that branch; to your `fork <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks>`_; of the llvm-project and; `create a pull request from the fork <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_.; As GitHub uses the first line of the commit message truncated to 72 characters; as the pull request title, you may have to edit to reword or to undo this; truncation.

Usability," The histogram can be drawn also normalised, ROOT; automatically takes cares of the necessary rescaling. - line *24* to *30*: This small snippet shows how easy it is to access; the moments and associated errors of a histogram. ## Add and Divide Histograms ##. Quite a large number of operations can be carried out with histograms.; The most useful are addition and division. In the following macro we; will learn how to manage these procedures within ROOT. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro6.C; ```.

In this case the function simply sets up some; parameters to conveniently set the line of histograms. - line *19* to *21*: Some `C++` syntax for conditional; statements is used to fill the histograms with different numbers of; entries inside the loop. - line *30*: The sum of two histograms.

These lines provide a skeleton to perform this operation. ## Two-dimensional Histograms ##. Two-dimensional histograms are a very useful tool, for example to; inspect correlations between variables. You can exploit the; bi-dimensional histogram classes provided by ROOT in a simple way.; Let's see how in this macro:. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro7.C; ```.

Usability," The performance of `PyROOT` when programming with ROOT in Python is; similar to that of Cling. Differences occur mainly because of differences; in the respective languages: C++ is much harder to parse, but once; parsed, it is much easier to optimize. Consequently, individual calls to; ROOT are typically faster from `PyROOT`, whereas loops are typically; slower. When programming in Python, the modus operandi is to consider; performance generally ""good enough"" on the outset, and when it turns out; that, it is not good enough; the performance critical part is converted; into C/C++ in an extension module. The school of thought where; pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil should find this way of; working very satisfying. In addition, if you look at their history, you; will see that many of the standard Python modules have followed this; path. Your code should always make maximum use of ROOT facilities; such that; most of the time is spending in compiled code. This goes even for very; simple things: e.g. do not compute invariant masses in Python, use; **`TLorentzVector`** instead. Moreover, before you start optimizing,; make sure that you have run a profiler to find out where the bottlenecks; are. Some performance, without cost in terms of programmer effort, may; be gained by using `psyco`, see the next link:; <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>, a Python just in time compiler (JIT).; Note, however, that `psyco` is limited to Intel i386 CPUs. Since `psyco`; optimizes Python, not `PyROOT` calls; it generally does not improve; performance that much if most of your code consists of ROOT API calls.; Mathematical computations in Python, on the other hand, benefit a lot. Every call to a Python member function results in a lookup of that; member function and an association of this method with `'self'`.; Furthermore, a temporary object is created during this process that is; discarded after the method call. In inner loops, it may be worth your; while (up to 30%), to short-cu",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:23331,simpl,simple,23331,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability," The table below divides the passes that LLVM provides into three categories.; Analysis passes compute information that other passes can use or for debugging; or program visualization purposes. Transform passes can use (or invalidate); the analysis passes. Transform passes all mutate the program in some way.; Utility passes provides some utility but don't otherwise fit categorization.; For example passes to extract functions to bitcode or write a module to bitcode; are neither analysis nor transform passes.

Introduce TClonesArray::ConstructedAt which; always returns an already constructed object. If the slot is being used for the; first time, it calls the default constructor otherwise it returns the object as; is (unless a string is passed as the 2nd argument to the function in which case,; it also calls Clear(second_argument) on the object).; This allows to replace code like:. for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) {; new(a[i]) TTrack(x,y,z,...);; ...; ...; }; ...; a.Delete(); // or a.Clear(""C""). with the simpler and more efficient:. for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) {; TTrack *track = (TTrack*)a.ConstructedAt(i);; track->Set(x,y,z,....);; ...; ...; }; ...; a.Clear();. even in case where the TTrack class allocates memory. TClonesArray: update ExpandCreateFast to also reset the non-used slots; so that calling Clear (which does too much) is no longer necessary; when using ExpandCreateFast. New Thread Pool class. A first version of TThreadPool class has been introduced.; This class implements a Thread Pool pattern.; So far it supports only one type of queue - FIFO. Thread library. Reduces risk of internal dead lock by using a private internal lock to protect the internals of TThread, rather than using TThread::Lock.

Usability," To create a concrete target-specific subclass of ``LLVMTargetMachine``, start; by copying an existing ``TargetMachine`` class and header. You should name the; files that you create to reflect your specific target. For instance, for the; SPARC target, name the files ``SparcTargetMachine.h`` and; ``SparcTargetMachine.cpp``. For a target machine ``XXX``, the implementation of ``XXXTargetMachine`` must; have access methods to obtain objects that represent target components. These; methods are named ``get*Info``, and are intended to obtain the instruction set; (``getInstrInfo``), register set (``getRegisterInfo``), stack frame layout; (``getFrameInfo``), and similar information. ``XXXTargetMachine`` must also; implement the ``getDataLayout`` method to access an object with target-specific; data characteristics, such as data type size and alignment requirements.

Usability," `GetListOfPrimitives()`, which returns a list of all the objects on; the pad. From the list you can select the object you need. #### Hiding an Object. Hiding an object in a pad can be made by removing it from the list of; objects owned by that pad. This list is accessible by the; `GetListOfPrimitives()` method of **`TPad`**. This method returns a; pointer to a **`TList`**. Suppose we get the pointer to the object, we; want to hide, call it `obj` (see paragraph above). We get the pointer to; the list:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] li = gPad->GetListOfPrimitives(); ```. Then remove the object from this list:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] li->Remove(obj); ```. The object will disappear from the pad as soon as the pad is updated; (try to resize it for example). If one wants to make the object; reappear:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] obj->Draw(); ```. Caution, this will not work with composed objects, for example many; histograms drawn on the same plot (with the option ""`same`""). There are; other ways! Try to use the method described here for simple objects. ### The Coordinate Systems of a Pad. There are coordinate systems in a **`TPad`**: user coordinates,; normalized coordinates (NDC), and pixel coordinates. ![Pad coordinate systems](pictures/080000A3.png). #### The User Coordinate System. The most common is the user coordinate system. Most methods of; **`TPad`** use the user coordinates, and all graphic primitives have; their parameters defined in terms of user coordinates. By default, when; an empty pad is drawn, the user coordinates are set to a range from 0 to; 1 starting at the lower left corner. At this point they are equivalent; of the NDC coordinates (see below). If you draw a high level graphical; object, such as a histogram or a function, the user coordinates are set; to the coordinates of the histogram. Therefore, when you set a point it; will be in the histogram coordinates. For a newly created blank pad, one may use `TPad::Range` to set the user; coordinate system.

Usability," ``llvm.coro.end`` without having first; reached a ``llvm.coro.suspend.retcon`` has undefined behavior. The remainder of this section describes the behavior under switched-resume; lowering. This intrinsic is lowered when a coroutine is split into; the start, resume and destroy parts. In the start part, it is a no-op,; in resume and destroy parts, it is replaced with `ret void` instruction and; the rest of the block containing `coro.end` instruction is discarded.; In landing pads it is replaced with an appropriate instruction to unwind to; caller. The handling of coro.end differs depending on whether the target is; using landingpad or WinEH exception model. For landingpad based exception model, it is expected that frontend uses the; `coro.end`_ intrinsic as follows:. .. code-block:: llvm. ehcleanup:; %InResumePart = call i1 @llvm.coro.end(ptr null, i1 true, token none); br i1 %InResumePart, label %eh.resume, label %cleanup.cont. cleanup.cont:; ; rest of the cleanup. eh.resume:; %exn = load ptr, ptr %exn.slot, align 8; %sel = load i32, ptr %ehselector.slot, align 4; %lpad.val = insertvalue { ptr, i32 } undef, ptr %exn, 0; %lpad.val29 = insertvalue { ptr, i32 } %lpad.val, i32 %sel, 1; resume { ptr, i32 } %lpad.val29. The `CoroSpit` pass replaces `coro.end` with ``True`` in the resume functions,; thus leading to immediate unwind to the caller, whereas in start function it; is replaced with ``False``, thus allowing to proceed to the rest of the cleanup; code that is only needed during initial invocation of the coroutine. For Windows Exception handling model, a frontend should attach a funclet bundle; referring to an enclosing cleanuppad as follows:. .. code-block:: llvm. ehcleanup:; %tok = cleanuppad within none []; %unused = call i1 @llvm.coro.end(ptr null, i1 true, token none) [ ""funclet""(token %tok) ]; cleanupret from %tok unwind label %RestOfTheCleanup.

Some constraint codes are typically supported by all targets:. - ``r``: A register in the target's general purpose register class.; - ``m``: A memory address operand. It is target-specific what addressing modes; are supported, typical examples are register, or register + register offset,; or register + immediate offset (of some target-specific size).; - ``p``: An address operand.

If `fLocalFrame` is false, `fLocalMaster` should contain an identity; matrix. This is set by default, and can be reset using the; **`TBuffer3D::SetLocalMasterIdentity()` method.**. #### Bounding Boxes. You are not obliged to complete the `kBoundingBox` section, as any; viewer requiring one internally (GL Viewer) will build it if you do not; provide. However to do this the viewer will force you to provide the; (expensive) raw tessellation, and the resulting box will be axis aligned; with the overall scene, which is non-ideal for rotated shapes. As we; need to support orientated (rotated) bounding boxes, **`TBuffer3D`**; requires the 6 vertices of the box. We also provide a convenience; function, `TBuffer::SetAABoundingBox()`, for simpler case of setting an; axis aligned bounding box. The bounding box should be filled in same; frame (local / master) as the rest of the **`TBuffer3D`**, and; in accordance with `fLocalFrame` flag.

You can disable this; new optimization by adding Optimize(1) to the RooAbsPdf::fitTo() command line (0 = no caching,; 1 = cache constant terms only, 2 = cache also variable terms according to above mentioned strategy (DEFAULT)). It is also possible to tune this 'cache-and-track' optimization to perform a more fine-grained caching; of components than Optimize(2) implements: to do so, call arg->setAttribute(""CacheAndTrack"") on each; pdf component that you'd like to be cache-and-tracked individually.

For such binned shapes generate() will now by default follow the 'binned' strategy ; -- that is, take the expectation value in each bin and sample a Poisson distribution from that -- rather; than follow the unbinned strategy. The rationale is that such datasets result in much faster likelihood; calculations (for nbin smaller than nevent). The optimization is also exact: the likelihood of a binned ; data using a binned pdf is identical to that of an unbinned dataset with a binned pdf.

Usability," a ``catchret`` instruction, which is a terminator indicating where in; the function control is returned to. A cleanup handler which reaches its end; by normal execution executes a ``cleanupret`` instruction, which is a terminator; indicating where the active exception will unwind to next. Each of these new EH pad instructions has a way to identify which action should; be considered after this action. The ``catchswitch`` instruction is a terminator; and has an unwind destination operand analogous to the unwind destination of an; invoke. The ``cleanuppad`` instruction is not; a terminator, so the unwind destination is stored on the ``cleanupret``; instruction instead. Successfully executing a catch handler should resume; normal control flow, so neither ``catchpad`` nor ``catchret`` instructions can; unwind. All of these ""unwind edges"" may refer to a basic block that contains an; EH pad instruction, or they may unwind to the caller. Unwinding to the caller; has roughly the same semantics as the ``resume`` instruction in the landingpad; model.

The above describes the function of the StreamerInfo record in decomposing a; self-identifying object if the user uses the streamer generated by ""rootcint"".; There are two reasons why a user may need to write a specialized streamer for a class.; One reason is that it may be necessary to execute some code before or after data is read; or written, for example, to initialize some non-persistent data members after the; persistent data is read. In this case, the custom streamer can use the StreamerInfo record; to decompose a self-identifying object in the exact same manner as the generated; streamer would have done. An example is given (for the Event class) in the Root User's; Guide (URL below) (Input/Output chapter, Streamers subchapter). On the other hand, if; the user needs to write a streamer for a class that ROOT cannot handle, the user may need; to explicitly code the decomposition and composition of the object to its members.; In this case, the StreamerInfo for that class might not be used.

LLVM also allows the explicit specification of the extensions in an ``-march`` string. .. _riscv-profiles-extensions-note:. ``Za128rs``, ``Za64rs``, ``Zic64b``, ``Ziccamoa``, ``Ziccif``, ``Zicclsm``, ``Ziccrse``; These extensions are defined as part of the `RISC-V Profiles specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-profiles/releases/tag/v1.0>`_. They do not introduce any new features themselves, but instead describe existing hardware features. Experimental Extensions; =======================. LLVM supports (to various degrees) a number of experimental extensions. All experimental extensions have ``experimental-`` as a prefix. There is explicitly no compatibility promised between versions of the toolchain, and regular users are strongly advised *not* to make use of experimental extensions before they reach ratification. The primary goal of experimental support is to assist in the process of ratification by providing an existence proof of an implementation, and simplifying efforts to validate the value of a proposed extension against large code bases. Experimental extensions are expected to either transition to ratified status, or be eventually removed. The decision on whether to accept an experimental extension is currently done on an entirely case by case basis; if you want to propose one, attending the bi-weekly RISC-V sync-up call is strongly advised. ``experimental-zacas``; LLVM implements the `1.0-rc1 draft specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-zacas/releases/tag/v1.0-rc1>`_. ``experimental-zfbfmin``, ``experimental-zvfbfmin``, ``experimental-zvfbfwma``; LLVM implements assembler support for the `1.0.0-rc2 specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-bfloat16/releases/tag/v59042fc71c31a9bcb2f1957621c960ed36fac401>`_. ``experimental-zicfilp``, ``experimental-zicfiss``; LLVM implements the `0.4 draft specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/releases/tag/v0.4.0>`__. ``experimental-ztso``; LLVM im",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/RISCVUsage.rst:9957,simpl,simplifying,9957,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/RISCVUsage.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/RISCVUsage.rst,1,['simpl'],['simplifying']

The set can depend on the input operand values.; This set is empty on x86 and ARM, but can be non-empty on other architectures.; (For instance, on wasm, if any input NaN does not have the preferred all-zero; payload or any input NaN is an SNaN, then this set contains all possible; payloads; otherwise, it is empty. On SPARC, this set consists of the all-one; payload.). In particular, if all input NaNs are quiet (or if there are no input NaNs), then; the output NaN is definitely quiet. Signaling NaN outputs can only occur if they; are provided as an input value. For example, ""fmul SNaN, 1.0"" may be simplified; to SNaN rather than QNaN. Similarly, if all input NaNs are preferred (or if; there are no input NaNs) and the target does not have any ""extra"" NaN payloads,; then the output NaN is guaranteed to be preferred.

Another time when ``auto`` works well; for these purposes is when the type would have been abstracted away anyways,; often behind a container's typedef such as ``std::vector<T>::iterator``. Similarly, C++14 adds generic lambda expressions where parameter types can be; ``auto``. Use these where you would have used a template. Beware unnecessary copies with ``auto``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The convenience of ``auto`` makes it easy to forget that its default behavior; is a copy. Particularly in range-based ``for`` loops, careless copies are; expensive. Use ``auto &`` for values and ``auto *`` for pointers unless you need to make a; copy. .. code-block:: c++. // Typically there's no reason to copy.; for (const auto &Val : Container) observe(Val);; for (auto &Val : Container) Val.change();. // Remove the reference if you really want a new copy.; for (auto Val : Container) { Val.change(); saveSomewhere(Val); }. // Copy pointers, but make it clear that they're pointers.; for (const auto *Ptr : Container) observe(*Ptr);; for (auto *Ptr : Container) Ptr->change();. Beware of non-determinism due to ordering of pointers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In general, there is no relative ordering among pointers. As a result,; when unordered containers like sets and maps are used with pointer keys; the iteration order is undefined. Hence, iterating such containers may; result in non-deterministic code generation. While the generated code; might work correctly, non-determinism can make it harder to reproduce bugs and; debug the compiler. In case an ordered result is expected, remember to; sort an unordered container before iteration.

Usability," an index, the resume and destroy; function pointers are updated at every suspend. Early testing showed that the; current approach is easier on the optimizer than the latter so it is a; lowering strategy implemented at the moment. Distinct Save and Suspend; -------------------------. In the previous example, setting a resume index (or some other state change that; needs to happen to prepare a coroutine for resumption) happens at the same time as; a suspension of a coroutine. However, in certain cases, it is necessary to control; when coroutine is prepared for resumption and when it is suspended. In the following example, a coroutine represents some activity that is driven; by completions of asynchronous operations `async_op1` and `async_op2` which get; a coroutine handle as a parameter and resume the coroutine once async; operation is finished. .. code-block:: text. void g() {; for (;;); if (cond()) {; async_op1(<coroutine-handle>); // will resume once async_op1 completes; <suspend>; do_one();; }; else {; async_op2(<coroutine-handle>); // will resume once async_op2 completes; <suspend>; do_two();; }; }; }. In this case, coroutine should be ready for resumption prior to a call to; `async_op1` and `async_op2`. The `coro.save`_ intrinsic is used to indicate a; point when coroutine should be ready for resumption (namely, when a resume index; should be stored in the coroutine frame, so that it can be resumed at the; correct resume point):. .. code-block:: llvm. if.true:; %save1 = call token @llvm.coro.save(ptr %hdl); call void @async_op1(ptr %hdl); %suspend1 = call i1 @llvm.coro.suspend(token %save1, i1 false); switch i8 %suspend1, label %suspend [i8 0, label %resume1; i8 1, label %cleanup]; if.false:; %save2 = call token @llvm.coro.save(ptr %hdl); call void @async_op2(ptr %hdl); %suspend2 = call i1 @llvm.coro.suspend(token %save2, i1 false); switch i8 %suspend2, label %suspend [i8 0, label %resume2; i8 1, label %cleanup]. .. _coroutine promise:.

When we compare two classes or enums and one of them is incomplete or has; unloaded external lexical declarations then we cannot descend to compare their; contained declarations. So in these cases they are considered equal if they; have the same names. This is the way how we compare forward declarations with; definitions. .. TODO Should we elaborate the actual implementation of the graph traversal,; .. which is a very weird BFS traversal?. Redeclaration Chains; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The early version of the ``ASTImporter``'s merge mechanism squashed the; declarations, i.e. it aimed to have only one declaration instead of maintaining; a whole redeclaration chain. This early approach simply skipped importing a; function prototype, but it imported a definition. To demonstrate the problem; with this approach let's consider an empty ""to"" context and the following; ``virtual`` function declarations of ``f`` in the ""from"" context:. .. code-block:: c++. struct B { virtual void f(); };; void B::f() {} // <-- let's import this definition. If we imported the definition with the ""squashing"" approach then we would; end-up having one declaration which is indeed a definition, but ``isVirtual()``; returns ``false`` for it. The reason is that the definition is indeed not; virtual, it is the property of the prototype!. Consequently, we must either set the virtual flag for the definition (but then; we create a malformed AST which the parser would never create), or we import; the whole redeclaration chain of the function.

Usability," and it will take longer to generate, but it provides the most; opportunity for the compiler to optimize. The guidance for minimizing distribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication. This will come at a; substantial performance penalty to the generated binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only. Due to design and implementation decisions, LLVM relies on; global data which can end up being duplicated across shared libraries; resulting in bugs. As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools. The simplest example of building a distribution with reasonable performance is; captured in the DistributionExample CMake cache file located at; clang/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake.

Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools.

Usability," and may have a; greater performance impact since pointer reads are more frequent than writes. .. _plugin:. .. _builtin-gc-strategies:. Built In GC Strategies; ======================. LLVM includes built in support for several varieties of garbage collectors. The Shadow Stack GC; ----------------------. To use this collector strategy, mark your functions with:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(""shadow-stack"");. Unlike many GC algorithms which rely on a cooperative code generator to compile; stack maps, this algorithm carefully maintains a linked list of stack roots; [:ref:`Henderson2002 <henderson02>`]. This so-called ""shadow stack"" mirrors the; machine stack. Maintaining this data structure is slower than using a stack map; compiled into the executable as constant data, but has a significant portability; advantage because it requires no special support from the target code generator,; and does not require tricky platform-specific code to crawl the machine stack. The tradeoff for this simplicity and portability is:. * High overhead per function call. * Not thread-safe. Still, it's an easy way to get started. After your compiler and runtime are up; and running, writing a :ref:`plugin <plugin>` will allow you to take advantage; of :ref:`more advanced GC features <collector-algos>` of LLVM in order to; improve performance. The shadow stack doesn't imply a memory allocation algorithm. A semispace; collector or building atop ``malloc`` are great places to start, and can be; implemented with very little code. When it comes time to collect, however, your runtime needs to traverse the stack; roots, and for this it needs to integrate with the shadow stack. Luckily, doing; so is very simple. (This code is heavily commented to help you understand the; data structure, but there are only 20 lines of meaningful code.). .. code-block:: c++. /// The map for a single function's stack frame.

Simulation of expected data is another important aspect in data; analysis. By repeated generation of ""pseudo-data"", which are analysed in; the same manner as intended for the real data, analysis procedures can; be validated or compared. In many cases, the distribution of the; measurement errors is not precisely known, and simulation offers the; possibility to test the effects of different assumptions.

It needs to be implemented if an; object has to be stored in a collection using a hashing technique,; like **`THashTable`**, **`THashList`** and **`TMap`**. By default,; `Hash(`) returns the address of the object. It is essential to; choose a good hash function. The example below shows how to use and override these member functions. ``` {.cpp}; class TObjNum : public TObject {; private:; Int_t num; // TObjNum is a simple container for an integer.; public:; TObjNum(Int_t i = 0) : num(i) { }; ~TObjNum() { }; void SetNum(Int_t i) { num = i; }; Int_t GetNum() const { return num; }; void Print(Option_t *) const; { printf(""num = %dn"", num); }; Bool_t IsEqual(TObject *obj) const; { return num == ((TObjNum*)obj)->num; }; Bool_t IsSortable() const { return kTRUE; }; Int_t Compare(const TObject *obj) const; { if (num < ((TObjNum*)obj)->num) return -1;; else if (num > ((TObjNum*)obj)->num) return 1;; else return 0; }; ULong_t Hash() const { return num; }; };; ```. ## The TIter Generic Iterator.

Usability," arguments to variable symbol table.; NamedValues[std::string(Arg.getName())] = Alloca;; }. Here we're first creating the variable, giving it the scope (``SP``),; the name, source location, type, and since it's an argument, the argument; index. Next, we create an ``lvm.dbg.declare`` call to indicate at the IR; level that we've got a variable in an alloca (and it gives a starting; location for the variable), and setting a source location for the; beginning of the scope on the declare. One interesting thing to note at this point is that various debuggers have; assumptions based on how code and debug information was generated for them; in the past. In this case we need to do a little bit of a hack to avoid; generating line information for the function prologue so that the debugger; knows to skip over those instructions when setting a breakpoint. So in; ``FunctionAST::CodeGen`` we add some more lines:. .. code-block:: c++. // Unset the location for the prologue emission (leading instructions with no; // location in a function are considered part of the prologue and the debugger; // will run past them when breaking on a function); KSDbgInfo.emitLocation(nullptr);. and then emit a new location when we actually start generating code for the; body of the function:. .. code-block:: c++.

Now try. ``` {.cpp}; root [2] cond_data->Draw(""Current/Potential:Temperature""); ```. It should have become clear from these examples how to navigate in such; a multi-dimensional space of variables and unveil relations between; variables using n-tuples. ### Reading N-tuples. For completeness, you find here a small macro to read the data back from; a ROOT n-tuple. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/read_ntuple_from_file.C; ```. The macro shows the easiest way of accessing the content of a n-tuple:; after loading the n-tuple, its branches are assigned to variables and; `GetEntry(long)` automatically fills them with the content for a; specific row. By doing so, the logic for reading the n-tuple and the; code to process it can be split and the source code remains clear. ### Storing Arbitrary N-tuples ###. It is also possible to write n-tuples of arbitrary type by using ROOT's; `TBranch` class. This is especially important as `TNtuple::Fill()`; accepts only floats. The following macro creates the same n-tuple as; before but the branches are booked directly. The `Fill()` function then; fills the current values of the connected variables to the tree. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/write_ntuple_to_file_advanced.C; ```. The `Branch()` function requires a pointer to a variable and a; definition of the variable type. The following table lists some of the possible; values.; Please note that ROOT is not checking the input and mistakes are likely; to result in serious problems.

You may also find it useful to use ""``-stats``"" now to see what parts of; instcombine are firing. This can guide where to put additional reporting code. At this point, if the amount of transformations is still too large, then; inserting code to limit whether or not to execute the body of the code in the; visit function can be helpful. Add a static counter which is incremented on; every invocation of the function. Then add code which simply returns false on; desired ranges.

This is from an actual test case and raises an important; point---a simple binary search may not be sufficient, as transformations that; interact may require isolating more than one call.

Example `TMhs3:` Class **`TThreadframe`**; (`TThreadframe.h, TThreadframe.cxx`) is a simple example of a framework; class managing up to four threaded methods. Class `TMhs3`; (`TMhs3.h, TMhs3.cxx)` inherits from this base class, showing the `mhs3`; example 8.1 `(mhs3.h, mhs3.cxx) `within a class.

These are either loaded or executed by the ROOT script; `TMhs3demo.C,` or are linked against an executable: `TMhs3run.cxx`. ### Known Problems.

Underneath your top level directory, you should have the following directories:. **lib**. This subdirectory should contain all of your library source code. For each; library that you build, you will have one directory in **lib** that will; contain that library's source code. Libraries can be object files, archives, or dynamic libraries. The **lib**; directory is just a convenient place for libraries as it places them all in; a directory from which they can be linked later. **include**. This subdirectory should contain any header files that are global to your; project. By global, we mean that they are used by more than one library or; executable of your project. By placing your header files in **include**, they will be found; automatically by the LLVM build system. For example, if you have a file; **include/jazz/note.h**, then your source files can include it simply with; **#include ""jazz/note.h""**. **tools**. This subdirectory should contain all of your source code for executables.; For each program that you build, you will have one directory in **tools**; that will contain that program's source code. **test**. This subdirectory should contain tests that verify that your code works; correctly. Automated tests are especially useful. Currently, the LLVM build system provides basic support for tests. The LLVM; system provides the following:. * LLVM contains regression tests in ``llvm/test``. These tests are run by the; :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool.

Redirecting the; output of scan-build to a text file (make sure to redirect standard; error) is useful for filing bug reports against scan-build or the; analyzer, as we can see the exact options (and files) passed to the analyzer.; For more comprehensible logs, don't perform a parallel build.; Run './configure' through scan-build; If an analyzed ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/scan-build.html:6037,Guid,Guidelines,6037,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/scan-build.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/scan-build.html,1,['Guid'],['Guidelines']

The net effect is a faster initialization time in this common case.; - Handle gracefully the presence of chains the files associated to which are corrupted.; - Reduce number of expensive `TChain::LoadTree` calls by spawning nested TBB tasks to ensure clusters of a given file will be most likely processed by the same thread. ### TTree; - TTrees can be forced to only create new baskets at event cluster boundaries.; This simplifies file layout and I/O at the cost of memory. Recommended for; simple file formats such as ntuples but not more complex data types. To; enable, invoke `tree->SetBit(TTree::kOnlyFlushAtCluster)`. ## Histogram Libraries. ## Math Libraries. ### [Clad](https://github.com/vgvassilev/clad); - Enable experimental automatic differentiation techniques to compute; derivatives and gradients of functions. Automatic differentiation is; superior to the slow symbolic or often inaccurate numerical differentiation.; It uses the fact that every computer program can be divided into a set of; elementary operations (-,+,*,/) and functions (sin, cos, log, etc).

Usability," bytecode) is actually two things: a `bitstream; container format`_ and an `encoding of LLVM IR`_ into the container format. The bitstream format is an abstract encoding of structured data, very similar to; XML in some ways. Like XML, bitstream files contain tags, and nested; structures, and you can parse the file without having to understand the tags.; Unlike XML, the bitstream format is a binary encoding, and unlike XML it; provides a mechanism for the file to self-describe ""abbreviations"", which are; effectively size optimizations for the content. LLVM IR files may be optionally embedded into a `wrapper`_ structure, or in a; `native object file`_. Both of these mechanisms make it easy to embed extra; data along with LLVM IR files. This document first describes the LLVM bitstream format, describes the wrapper; format, then describes the record structure used by LLVM IR files. .. _bitstream container format:. Bitstream Format; ================. The bitstream format is literally a stream of bits, with a very simple; structure. This structure consists of the following concepts:. * A ""`magic number`_"" that identifies the contents of the stream. * Encoding `primitives`_ like variable bit-rate integers. * `Blocks`_, which define nested content. * `Data Records`_, which describe entities within the file. * Abbreviations, which specify compression optimizations for the file. Note that the :doc:`llvm-bcanalyzer <CommandGuide/llvm-bcanalyzer>` tool can be; used to dump and inspect arbitrary bitstreams, which is very useful for; understanding the encoding. .. _magic number:. Magic Numbers; -------------. The first four bytes of a bitstream are used as an application-specific magic; number. Generic bitcode tools may look at the first four bytes to determine; whether the stream is a known stream type. However, these tools should *not*; determine whether a bitstream is valid based on its magic number alone.

Cumulative distributions functions that are calculated numerically are handled slightly differently; that standard running integrals: their values is constructed to converge to exactly zero at the lower bound; and exactly 1 at the upper bound so that algorithms that make use of that property of c.d.f can do so reliably. Constraints management. New tools have been added to simplify studies with fits involving (external) constraints on parameters.; The general philosophy is that constraints on parameters can be represented as probability density functions; and can thus be modeled by RooAbsPdf classes (e.g. a RooGaussian for a simple Gaussian constraint on a parameter).; There are two modes of operation: you can add parameter constraints to your problem definition by multiplying; the constraint p.d.f.s with your 'master' p.d.f. or you specify them externally in each operation. The; first mode of operation keeps all information in your master p.d.f and may make the logistics of non-trivial; fitting problems easier. It works as follows: first you define your regular p.d.f, then you define your; constraint p.d.f and you multiply them with RooProdPdf. // Construct constraint; RooGaussian fconstraint(""fconstraint"",""fconstraint"",f,RooConst(0.8),RooConst(0.1)) ;. // Multiply constraint with p.d.f; RooProdPdf pdfc(""pdfc"",""p.d.f with constraint"",RooArgSet(p.d.f,fconstraint)) ;.

Usability," called out these commands should work with any CMake; generator. Many of the build configurations mentioned on this documentation page can be; utilized by using a CMake cache. A CMake cache is essentially a configuration; file that sets the necessary flags for a specific build configuration. The caches; for Clang are located in :code:`/clang/cmake/caches` within the monorepo. They; can be passed to CMake using the :code:`-C` flag as demonstrated in the examples; below along with additional configuration flags. Bootstrap Builds; ================. The Clang CMake build system supports bootstrap (aka multi-stage) builds. At a; high level a multi-stage build is a chain of builds that pass data from one; stage into the next. The most common and simple version of this is a traditional; bootstrap build. In a simple two-stage bootstrap build, we build clang using the system compiler,; then use that just-built clang to build clang again. In CMake this simplest form; of a bootstrap build can be configured with a single option,; CLANG_ENABLE_BOOTSTRAP. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \; -DCLANG_ENABLE_BOOTSTRAP=On \; -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=""clang"" \; <path to source>/llvm; $ ninja stage2.

Usability," can be; used to achieve this sort of thing in a localizable way, see below. Formatting a Diagnostic Argument; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Arguments to diagnostics are fully typed internally, and come from a couple; different classes: integers, types, names, and random strings. Depending on; the class of the argument, it can be optionally formatted in different ways.; This gives the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` information about what the argument means; without requiring it to use a specific presentation (consider this MVC for; Clang :). It is really easy to add format specifiers to the Clang diagnostics system, but; they should be discussed before they are added. If you are creating a lot of; repetitive diagnostics and/or have an idea for a useful formatter, please bring; it up on the cfe-dev mailing list. Here are the different diagnostic argument formats currently supported by; Clang:. **""s"" format**. Example:; ``""requires %0 parameter%s0""``; Class:; Integers; Description:; This is a simple formatter for integers that is useful when producing English; diagnostics. When the integer is 1, it prints as nothing. When the integer; is not 1, it prints as ""``s``"". This allows some simple grammatical forms to; be to be handled correctly, and eliminates the need to use gross things like; ``""requires %1 parameter(s)""``. Note, this only handles adding a simple; ""``s``"" character, it will not handle situations where pluralization is more; complicated such as turning ``fancy`` into ``fancies`` or ``mouse`` into; ``mice``. You can use the ""plural"" format specifier to handle such situations. **""select"" format**. Example:; ``""must be a %select{unary|binary|unary or binary}0 operator""``; Class:; Integers; Description:; This format specifier is used to merge multiple related diagnostics together; into one common one, without requiring the difference to be specified as an; English string argument.

Usability," can cause the; state to change, resulting in a new node in the ExplodedGraph with an; updated program point and an updated state. A bug is found by hitting; a node that satisfies some ""bug condition"" (basically a violation of a; checking invariant). The analyzer traces out multiple paths by reasoning about branches and; then bifurcating the state: on the true branch the conditions of the; branch are assumed to be true and on the false branch the conditions; of the branch are assumed to be false. Such ""assumptions"" create; constraints on the values of the program, and those constraints are; recorded in the ProgramState object (and are manipulated by the; ConstraintManager). If assuming the conditions of a branch would; cause the constraints to be unsatisfiable, the branch is considered; infeasible and that path is not taken. This is how we get; path-sensitivity. We reduce exponential blow-up by caching nodes. If; a new node with the same state and program point as an existing node; would get generated, the path ""caches out"" and we simply reuse the; existing node. Thus the ExplodedGraph is not a DAG; it can contain; cycles as paths loop back onto each other and cache out. ProgramState and ExplodedNodes are basically immutable once created. Once; one creates a ProgramState, you need to create a new one to get a new; ProgramState. This immutability is key since the ExplodedGraph represents; the behavior of the analyzed program from the entry point. To; represent these efficiently, we use functional data structures (e.g.,; ImmutableMaps) which share data between instances. Finally, individual Checkers work by also manipulating the analysis; state. The analyzer engine talks to them via a visitor interface.; For example, the PreVisitCallExpr() method is called by ExprEngine; to tell the Checker that we are about to analyze a CallExpr, and the; checker is asked to check for any preconditions that might not be; satisfied. The checker can do nothing, or it can generate a new;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt:2573,simpl,simply,2573,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Gap regions are used to eliminate unnatural artifacts in coverage reports, such; as red ""unexecuted"" highlights present at the end of an otherwise covered line,; or blue ""executed"" highlights present at the start of a line that is otherwise; not executed. Branch regions; --------------; When viewing branch coverage details in source-based file-level sub-views using; ``--show-branches``, it is recommended that users show all macro expansions; (using option ``--show-expansions``) since macros may contain hidden branch; conditions. The coverage summary report will always include these macro-based; boolean expressions in the overall branch coverage count for a function or; source file. Branch coverage is not tracked for constant folded branch conditions since; branches are not generated for these cases. In the source-based file-level; sub-view, these branches will simply be shown as ``[Folded - Ignored]`` so that; users are informed about what happened. Branch coverage is tied directly to branch-generating conditions in the source; code. Users should not see hidden branches that aren't actually tied to the; source code. MC/DC Instrumentation; ---------------------. When instrumenting for Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) using the; clang option ``-fcoverage-mcdc``, users are limited to at most **six** leaf-level; conditions in a boolean expression.

Also, if a boolean expression is embedded in the nest of another boolean; expression but separated by a non-logical operator, this is also not supported.; For example, in ``x = (a && b && c && func(d && f))``, the ``d && f`` case; starts a new boolean expression that is separated from the other conditions by; the operator ``func()``.

Even so, the edge ``U3 -> Llld1`` could be problematic for future; merges from upstream. git will think that we've already merged from; ``U3``, and we have, except for the state of the clang tree. One; possible mitigation strategy is to manually diff clang between ``U2``; and ``U3`` and apply those updates to ``local/zip``. Another,; possibly simpler strategy is to freeze local work on downstream; branches and merge all submodules from the latest upstream before; running ``zip-downstream-fork.py``. If downstream merged each project; from upstream in lockstep without any intervening local commits, then; things should be fine without any special action. We anticipate this; to be the common case.

This set of options specifies the amount of feedback printed on the; root command line after performed fits. *‘Verbose'* - prints fit results after each iteration. *‘Quiet'* - no fit information is printed. *‘Default'* - between Verbose and Quiet. ### Command Buttons. *Fit button* - performs a fit taking different option settings via the; Fit Panel interface. *Reset* - sets the GUI elements and related fit settings to the; default ones. *Close* - closes the Fit panel window. ### Minimization Options. With this tab one can select specific options for minimization. These include. * The minimizer library ( *Minuit*, *Minuit2*, *Fumili*, *GSL*, *Genetics* ); * The method (algorithm) for minimization.

Relationship to other ROOT components; -------------------------------------. The RNTuple classes have the following relationship to other parts of ROOT. The RNTuple classes use core ROOT infrastructure classes, such as error handling and logging.; When necessary, RNTuple uses a `TFile` for reading and writing.; The cases of writing to a local file and reading from a local file, a file from XRootD or from HTTP, do _not_ require `TFile`.; For these cases, RNTuple depends on the `RRawFile` class and its XRootD and Davix plugins. For user-defined classes as well as sets and maps, RNTuple uses `TClass`.; Simple types and other stdlib classes are natively supported and do not require dictionaries.; See the format specification for an exhaustive list of types supported in RNTuple.; The streamer field uses the standard ROOT streaming machinery. Integration to RDataFrame is provided through an RNTuple data source.; A universal RDataFrame constructor can create a data frame from either a TTree or an RNTuple with the same syntax. The RBrowser uses RNTuple classes to display RNTuple dataset information. Future Features; ---------------. The following features are planned for after the first RNTuple production version:; - RNTupleProcessor: advanced RNTupleReader that allows for free combination of chains and (indexed/unaligned) friends; - Horizontal merging: persistified friends, analogous to a classical merge being a persistified chain; - An interface for bulk writing; - Meta-data: RNTuple-specific and user-provided meta-data storage, such as file provenance, scale factors, or varied columns; - C library interface; - S3 storage backend (",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md:28943,Simpl,Simple,28943,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md,1,['Simpl'],['Simple']

If these are used on a target that does not support atomic; scopes, then they will behave exactly as the standard GNU atomic builtins. Low-level ARM exclusive memory builtins; ---------------------------------------. Clang provides overloaded builtins giving direct access to the three key ARM; instructions for implementing atomic operations. .. code-block:: c. T __builtin_arm_ldrex(const volatile T *addr);; T __builtin_arm_ldaex(const volatile T *addr);; int __builtin_arm_strex(T val, volatile T *addr);; int __builtin_arm_stlex(T val, volatile T *addr);; void __builtin_arm_clrex(void);. The types ``T`` currently supported are:. * Integer types with width at most 64 bits (or 128 bits on AArch64).; * Floating-point types; * Pointer types. Note that the compiler does not guarantee it will not insert stores which clear; the exclusive monitor in between an ``ldrex`` type operation and its paired; ``strex``. In practice this is only usually a risk when the extra store is on; the same cache line as the variable being modified and Clang will only insert; stack stores on its own, so it is best not to use these operations on variables; with automatic storage duration. Also, loads and stores may be implicit in code written between the ``ldrex`` and; ``strex``. Clang will not necessarily mitigate the effects of these either, so; care should be exercised. For these reasons the higher level atomic primitives should be preferred where; possible. Non-temporal load/store builtins; --------------------------------. Clang provides overloaded builtins allowing generation of non-temporal memory; accesses. .. code-block:: c.

Usability," do not follow the; project how the C API is changing and evolving. .. _toolchain:. Updating Toolchain Requirements; -------------------------------. We intend to require newer toolchains as time goes by. This means LLVM's; codebase can use newer versions of C++ as they get standardized. Requiring newer; toolchains to build LLVM can be painful for those building LLVM; therefore, it; will only be done through the following process:. * It is a general goal to support LLVM and GCC versions from the last 3 years; at a minimum. This time-based guideline is not strict: we may support much; older compilers, or decide to support fewer versions. * An RFC is sent to the `LLVM Discourse forums`_. - Detail upsides of the version increase (e.g. which newer C++ language or; library features LLVM should use; avoid miscompiles in particular compiler; versions, etc).; - Detail downsides on important platforms (e.g. Ubuntu LTS status). * Once the RFC reaches consensus, update the CMake toolchain version checks as; well as the :doc:`getting started<GettingStarted>` guide. This provides a; softer transition path for developers compiling LLVM, because the; error can be turned into a warning using a CMake flag. This is an important; step: LLVM still doesn't have code which requires the new toolchains, but it; soon will. If you compile LLVM but don't read the forums, we should; tell you!. * Ensure that at least one LLVM release has had this soft-error. Not all; developers compile LLVM top-of-tree. These release-bound developers should; also be told about upcoming changes. * Turn the soft-error into a hard-error after said LLVM release has branched. * Update the :doc:`coding standards<CodingStandards>` to allow the new; features we've explicitly approved in the RFC. * Start using the new features in LLVM's codebase. Here's a `sample RFC; <https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-migrating-past-c-11/50943>`_ and the; `corresponding change <https://reviews.llvm.org/D57264>`_. .. _ci-usage:.

The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types. Success values are created by calling ``Error::success()``, E",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:17934,simpl,simple,17934,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['simpl'],['simple']

For example,; when walking an archive, some clients may be happy to skip over badly formatted; object files rather than terminating the walk immediately. Skipping badly; formatted objects could be achieved using an elaborate handler method, but the; Error.h header provides two utilities that make this idiom much cleaner: the; type inspection method, ``isA``, and the ``consumeError`` function:. .. code-block:: c++. Error walkArchive(Archive A) {; for (unsigned I = 0; I != A.numMembers(); ++I) {; auto ChildOrErr = A.getMember(I);; if (auto Err = ChildOrErr.takeError()) {; if (Err.isA<BadFileFormat>()); consumeError(std::move(Err)); else; return Err;; }; auto &Child = *ChildOrErr;; // Use Child; ...; }; return Error::success();; }.

In the archive walking example above ``BadFileFormat`` errors are simply; consumed and ignored. If the client had wanted report these errors after; completing the walk over the archive they could use the ``joinErrors`` utility:. .. code-block:: c++.

The ``joinErrors`` routine builds a special error type called ``ErrorList``,; which holds a list of user defined errors. The ``handleErrors`` routine; recognizes this type and will attempt to handle each of the contained errors in; order.

The `TTree::Draw` method is convenient and easy to use; however it falls; short if you need to do some programming with the variable. For example, for plotting the masses of all oppositely changed pairs of; tracks, you would need to write a program that loops over all events,; finds all pairs of tracks, and calculates the required quantities. We; have shown how to retrieve the data arrays from the branches of the tree; in the previous section, and you could just write that program from; scratch.

These are our assumptions: we would like to do selective plotting and; loop through each entry of the tree and tracks.

Usability," frontend has to; create a landing pad. The frontend has to destroy the already; constructed argument ``b`` before restoring the stack pointer. If the; constructor does not unwind, ``g`` is called. In the Microsoft C++ ABI,; ``g`` will destroy its arguments, and then the stack is restored in; ``f``. Design Considerations; =====================. Lifetime; --------. The biggest design consideration for this feature is object lifetime.; We cannot model the arguments as static allocas in the entry block,; because all calls need to use the memory at the top of the stack to pass; arguments. We cannot vend pointers to that memory at function entry; because after code generation they will alias. The rule against allocas between argument allocations and the call site; avoids this problem, but it creates a cleanup problem. Cleanup and; lifetime is handled explicitly with stack save and restore calls. In; the future, we may want to introduce a new construct such as ``freea``; or ``afree`` to make it clear that this stack adjusting cleanup is less; powerful than a full stack save and restore. Nested Calls and Copy Elision; -----------------------------. We also want to be able to support copy elision into these argument; slots. This means we have to support multiple live argument; allocations. Consider the evaluation of:. .. code-block:: c++. // Foo is non-trivial.; struct Foo { int a; Foo(); Foo(const &Foo); ~Foo(); };; Foo bar(Foo b);; int main() {; bar(bar(Foo()));; }. In this case, we want to be able to elide copies into ``bar``'s argument; slots. That means we need to have more than one set of argument frames; active at the same time. First, we need to allocate the frame for the; outer call so we can pass it in as the hidden struct return pointer to; the middle call. Then we do the same for the middle call, allocating a; frame and passing its address to ``Foo``'s default constructor. By; wrapping the evaluation of the inner ``bar`` with stack save and; restore, we can have",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/InAlloca.rst:3815,clear,clear,3815,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/InAlloca.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/InAlloca.rst,1,['clear'],['clear']

This new; tool succeeds the original RooSimPdfBuilder tool which had a similar functionality but; has a much cleaner interface, partly thanks to its use of the RooWorkspace class for both input; of prototype p.d.fs and output of built p.d.f.s. The simplest use case to to take a workspace p.d.f as prototype and 'split' a parameter of that p.d.f ; into two specialized parameters depending on a category in the dataset. ; For example, given a Gaussian p.d.f G(x,m,s) we want to construct a G_a(x,m_a,s) and a G_b(x,m_b,s); with different mean parameters to be fit to a dataset with observables; (x,c) where c is a category with states 'a' and 'b'.; Using RooSimWSTool one can create a simultaneous p.d.f from G_a and G_b; from G with the following command.

The ""`+`"" sign tells `rootcling` to use the new `Streamer `system; introduced in ROOT 3.0. The following is an example of a customized; `Streamer `for `Event`. The `Streamer` takes a **`TBuffer`** as a; parameter, and first checks to see if this is a case of reading or; writing the buffer. ``` {.cpp}; void Event::Streamer(TBuffer &R__b) {; if (R__b.IsReading()) {; Event::Class()->ReadBuffer(R__b, this);; fTransient = gDirectory; //save current directory; fPt= TMath::Sqrt(fPx*fPx + fPy*fPy + fPz*fPz);; } else {; Event::Class()->WriteBuffer(R__b, this);; }; }; ```. ### Writing Objects. The `Streamer` decomposes the objects into data members and writes them; to a buffer. It does not write the buffer to a file, it simply populates; a buffer with bytes representing the object. This allows us to write the; buffer to a file or do anything else we could do with the buffer. For; example, we can write it to a socket to send it over the network. This; is beyond the scope of this chapter, but it is worthwhile to emphasize; the need and advantage of separating the creation of the buffer from its; use. Let us look how a buffer is written to a file. The dictionary for a; class needs to be loaded before any object of that type can be saved. The `TObject::Write` method does the following:. - Creates a **`TKey`** object in the current directory. - Creates a **`TBuffer`** object which is part of the newly created; **`TKey`**. - Fills the **`TBuffer`** with a call to the `class::Streamer` method. - Creates a second buffer for compression, if needed. - Reserves space by scanning the **`TFree`** list.

We will focus in this chapter on uni-; and bi- dimensional histograms the bin contents of which are represented by; floating point numbers [^4], the `TH1F` and `TH2F` classes respectively. ## Your First Histogram ##. Let's suppose you want to measure the counts of a Geiger detector located in; proximity of a radioactive source in a given time interval. This would; give you an idea of the activity of your source. The count distribution; in this case is a Poisson distribution. Let's see how operatively you; can fill and draw a histogram with the following example macro. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro5.C; ```. Which gives you the following plot (Figure [5.1](#f51)):. [f51]: figures/poisson.png ""f51""; <a name=""f51""></a>. ![The result of a counting (pseudo) experiment. Only bins corresponding; to integer values are filled given the discrete nature of the poissonian; distribution. \label{f51}][f51]. Using histograms is rather simple. The main differences with respect to; graphs that emerge from the example are:. - line *5*: The histograms have a name and a title right from the; start, no predefined number of entries but a number of bins and a; lower-upper range. - line *15*: An entry is stored in the histogram through the; `TH1F::Fill` method. - line *18* and *21*: The histogram can be drawn also normalised, ROOT; automatically takes cares of the necessary rescaling. - line *24* to *30*: This small snippet shows how easy it is to access; the moments and associated errors of a histogram. ## Add and Divide Histograms ##. Quite a large number of operations can be carried out with histograms.; The most useful are addition and division. In the following macro we; will learn how to manage these procedures within ROOT. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro6.C; ```.

Usability," is defined by; way of a *personality function* (e.g. ``__gxx_personality_v0`` in C++),; which receives the context of the exception, an *exception structure*; containing the exception object type and value, and a reference to the exception; table for the current function. The personality function for the current; compile unit is specified in a *common exception frame*. The organization of an exception table is language dependent. For C++, an; exception table is organized as a series of code ranges defining what to do if; an exception occurs in that range. Typically, the information associated with a; range defines which types of exception objects (using C++ *type info*) that are; handled in that range, and an associated action that should take place. Actions; typically pass control to a *landing pad*. A landing pad corresponds roughly to the code found in the ``catch`` portion of; a ``try``/``catch`` sequence. When execution resumes at a landing pad, it; receives an *exception structure* and a *selector value* corresponding to the; *type* of exception thrown. The selector is then used to determine which *catch*; should actually process the exception. LLVM Code Generation; ====================. From a C++ developer's perspective, exceptions are defined in terms of the; ``throw`` and ``try``/``catch`` statements. In this section we will describe the; implementation of LLVM exception handling in terms of C++ examples. Throw; -----. Languages that support exception handling typically provide a ``throw``; operation to initiate the exception process. Internally, a ``throw`` operation; breaks down into two steps. #. A request is made to allocate exception space for an exception structure.; This structure needs to survive beyond the current activation. This structure; will contain the type and value of the object being thrown. #. A call is made to the runtime to raise the exception, passing the exception; structure as an argument. In C++, the allocation of the exception st",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:5525,resume,resumes,5525,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,1,['resume'],['resumes']
Usability," is not provided in the API, due to the fact accessing the elements in order; would allocate all the iterated pages, defeating memory savings and the purpose; of the ``PagedVector``. Finally a ``materialized_begin()`` and ``materialized_end`` iterators are; provided to access the elements associated to the accessed pages, which could; speed up operations that need to iterate over initialized elements in a; non-ordered manner. .. _dss_vector:. <vector>; ^^^^^^^^. ``std::vector<T>`` is well loved and respected. However, ``SmallVector<T, 0>``; is often a better option due to the advantages listed above. std::vector is; still useful when you need to store more than ``UINT32_MAX`` elements or when; interfacing with code that expects vectors :). One worthwhile note about std::vector: avoid code like this:. .. code-block:: c++. for ( ... ) {; std::vector<foo> V;; // make use of V.; }. Instead, write this as:. .. code-block:: c++. std::vector<foo> V;; for ( ... ) {; // make use of V.; V.clear();; }. Doing so will save (at least) one heap allocation and free per iteration of the; loop. .. _dss_deque:. <deque>; ^^^^^^^. ``std::deque`` is, in some senses, a generalized version of ``std::vector``.; Like ``std::vector``, it provides constant time random access and other similar; properties, but it also provides efficient access to the front of the list. It; does not guarantee continuity of elements within memory. In exchange for this extra flexibility, ``std::deque`` has significantly higher; constant factor costs than ``std::vector``. If possible, use ``std::vector`` or; something cheaper. .. _dss_list:. <list>; ^^^^^^. ``std::list`` is an extremely inefficient class that is rarely useful. It; performs a heap allocation for every element inserted into it, thus having an; extremely high constant factor, particularly for small data types.; ``std::list`` also only supports bidirectional iteration, not random access; iteration.

Usability," is one exception table per function, except leaf functions and functions; that have calls only to non-throwing functions. They do not need an exception; table. .. _wineh:. Exception Handling using the Windows Runtime; =================================================. Background on Windows exceptions; ---------------------------------. Interacting with exceptions on Windows is significantly more complicated than; on Itanium C++ ABI platforms. The fundamental difference between the two models; is that Itanium EH is designed around the idea of ""successive unwinding,"" while; Windows EH is not. Under Itanium, throwing an exception typically involves allocating thread local; memory to hold the exception, and calling into the EH runtime. The runtime; identifies frames with appropriate exception handling actions, and successively; resets the register context of the current thread to the most recently active; frame with actions to run. In LLVM, execution resumes at a ``landingpad``; instruction, which produces register values provided by the runtime. If a; function is only cleaning up allocated resources, the function is responsible; for calling ``_Unwind_Resume`` to transition to the next most recently active; frame after it is finished cleaning up. Eventually, the frame responsible for; handling the exception calls ``__cxa_end_catch`` to destroy the exception,; release its memory, and resume normal control flow. The Windows EH model does not use these successive register context resets.; Instead, the active exception is typically described by a frame on the stack.; In the case of C++ exceptions, the exception object is allocated in stack memory; and its address is passed to ``__CxxThrowException``. General purpose structured; exceptions (SEH) are more analogous to Linux signals, and they are dispatched by; userspace DLLs provided with Windows. Each frame on the stack has an assigned EH; personality routine, which decides what actions to take to handle the exception.; Ther",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:20708,resume,resumes,20708,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,1,['resume'],['resumes']

The picture of file h1\_s.xpm is used in the button. All `.xpm` files; are located in the directory `$ROOTSYS/icons`. You can assign a command; directly as a parameter of the picture button constructor. The picture; of **`TGPictureButton`** can be changed by:. ``` {.cpp}; fPicture->SetPicture(""h2_s.xpm"");; ```. The advantage of command buttons is that they are always visible,; providing a reminder of their existence. They can be inscribed with a; meaningful description of what they do by; `TGToolTip(""Some describing text"").` Their activation is much easier and; faster than using a two-step menu bar/pull-down sequence. The only; disadvantage of the text and picture buttons is that they consume; considerable screen space if they are many.

It is very useful to provide a; default setting whenever it is possible.

Usability," limiting the transformation of; releases, this rule requires ARC to eliminate retains and release; only in pairs. ARC's power to reorder the destruction of objects is critical to its; ability to do any optimization, for essentially the same reason that; it must retain the power to decrease the lifetime of an object.; Unfortunately, while it's generally poor style for the destruction; of objects to have arbitrary side-effects, it's certainly possible.; Hence the caveat. .. _arc.optimization.precise:. Precise lifetime semantics; --------------------------. In general, ARC maintains an invariant that a retainable object pointer held in; a ``__strong`` object will be retained for the full formal lifetime of the; object. Objects subject to this invariant have :arc-term:`precise lifetime; semantics`. By default, local variables of automatic storage duration do not have precise; lifetime semantics. Such objects are simply strong references which hold; values of retainable object pointer type, and these values are still fully; subject to the optimizations on values under local control. .. admonition:: Rationale. Applying these precise-lifetime semantics strictly would be prohibitive.; Many useful optimizations that might theoretically decrease the lifetime of; an object would be rendered impossible. Essentially, it promises too much. A local variable of retainable object owner type and automatic storage duration; may be annotated with the ``objc_precise_lifetime`` attribute to indicate that; it should be considered to be an object with precise lifetime semantics. .. admonition:: Rationale. Nonetheless, it is sometimes useful to be able to force an object to be; released at a precise time, even if that object does not appear to be used.; This is likely to be uncommon enough that the syntactic weight of explicitly; requesting these semantics will not be burdensome, and may even make the code; clearer. .. _arc.misc:.

The most basic form of input mutation is to use the built in mutators of; LibFuzzer. These simply treat the input corpus as a bag of bits and make random; mutations. This type of fuzzer is good for stressing the surface layers of a; program, and is good at testing things like lexers, parsers, or binary; protocols. Some of the in-tree fuzzers that use this type of mutator are `clang-fuzzer`_,; `clang-format-fuzzer`_, `llvm-as-fuzzer`_, `llvm-dwarfdump-fuzzer`_,; `llvm-mc-assemble-fuzzer`_, and `llvm-mc-disassemble-fuzzer`_. .. _fuzzing-llvm-protobuf:. Structured Fuzzing using ``libprotobuf-mutator``; ------------------------------------------------. We can use libprotobuf-mutator_ in order to perform structured fuzzing and; stress deeper layers of programs. This works by defining a protobuf class that; translates arbitrary data into structurally interesting input. Specifically, we; use this to work with a subset of the C++ language and perform mutations that; produce valid C++ programs in order to exercise parts of clang that are more; interesting than parser error handling.

There are AST matchers to match all the different nodes of the AST,; narrowing matchers to only match AST nodes fulfilling specific criteria,; and traversal matchers to get from one kind of AST node to another.

Usability," objects which can be used to minimize are:. ### $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ ###. This is the best minimizer for nearly all functions. It is a; variable-metric method with inexact line search, a stable metric; updating scheme, and checks for positive-definiteness. It will run; faster if you instantiate it with a low–level MnStrategy and will be; more reliable if you instantiate it with a high–level MnStrategy; (although the latter option may not help much). Its main weakness is; that it depends heavily on knowledge of the first derivatives, and fails; miserably if they are very inaccurate. If first derivatives are a; problem, they can be calculated analytically inside $\mbox{FCN}$; (see [howto:fcn]) or if this is not feasible, the user can try to; improve the accuracy of M 's numerical approximation by adjusting values; of MnMachinePrecision and/or MnStrategy (see [api:epsmac] and; [api:strategy]). ### $\mbox{MINIMIZE}$ ###. This is equivalent to $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, except that if; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ fails, it reverts to $\mbox{SIMPLEX}$ and then; calls $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ again. ### $\mbox{SCAN}$ ###. This is not intended to minimize, and just scans the function, one; parameter at a time. It does however retain the best value after each; scan, so it does some sort of highly primitive minimization. ### $\mbox{SIMPLEX}$ ###. This genuine multidimensional minimization routine is usually much; slower than $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, but it does not use first derivatives,; so it should not be so sensitive to the precision of the; $\mbox{FCN}$ calculations, and is even rather robust with respect to; gross fluctuations in the function value. However, it gives no reliable; information about parameter errors, no information whatsoever about; parameter correlations, and worst of all cannot be expected to converge; accurately to the minimum in a finite time.

Usability," of the block containing `coro.end` instruction is discarded.; In landing pads it is replaced with an appropriate instruction to unwind to; caller. The handling of coro.end differs depending on whether the target is; using landingpad or WinEH exception model. For landingpad based exception model, it is expected that frontend uses the; `coro.end`_ intrinsic as follows:. .. code-block:: llvm. ehcleanup:; %InResumePart = call i1 @llvm.coro.end(ptr null, i1 true, token none); br i1 %InResumePart, label %eh.resume, label %cleanup.cont. cleanup.cont:; ; rest of the cleanup. eh.resume:; %exn = load ptr, ptr %exn.slot, align 8; %sel = load i32, ptr %ehselector.slot, align 4; %lpad.val = insertvalue { ptr, i32 } undef, ptr %exn, 0; %lpad.val29 = insertvalue { ptr, i32 } %lpad.val, i32 %sel, 1; resume { ptr, i32 } %lpad.val29. The `CoroSpit` pass replaces `coro.end` with ``True`` in the resume functions,; thus leading to immediate unwind to the caller, whereas in start function it; is replaced with ``False``, thus allowing to proceed to the rest of the cleanup; code that is only needed during initial invocation of the coroutine. For Windows Exception handling model, a frontend should attach a funclet bundle; referring to an enclosing cleanuppad as follows:. .. code-block:: llvm. ehcleanup:; %tok = cleanuppad within none []; %unused = call i1 @llvm.coro.end(ptr null, i1 true, token none) [ ""funclet""(token %tok) ]; cleanupret from %tok unwind label %RestOfTheCleanup. The `CoroSplit` pass, if the funclet bundle is present, will insert; ``cleanupret from %tok unwind to caller`` before; the `coro.end`_ intrinsic and will remove the rest of the block. In the unwind path (when the argument is `true`), `coro.end` will mark the coroutine; as done, making it undefined behavior to resume the coroutine again and causing ; `llvm.coro.done` to return `true`.

Usability," of the coroutine. The `coro.suspend`_; intrinsic in combination with the following switch indicates what happens to; control flow when a coroutine is suspended (default case), resumed (case 0) or; destroyed (case 1). Coroutine Transformation; ------------------------. One of the steps of coroutine lowering is building the coroutine frame. The; def-use chains are analyzed to determine which objects need be kept alive across; suspend points. In the coroutine shown in the previous section, use of virtual register; `%inc` is separated from the definition by a suspend point, therefore, it; cannot reside on the stack frame since the latter goes away once the coroutine; is suspended and control is returned back to the caller. An i32 slot is; allocated in the coroutine frame and `%inc` is spilled and reloaded from that; slot as needed. We also store addresses of the resume and destroy functions so that the; `coro.resume` and `coro.destroy` intrinsics can resume and destroy the coroutine; when its identity cannot be determined statically at compile time. For our; example, the coroutine frame will be:. .. code-block:: llvm. %f.frame = type { ptr, ptr, i32 }. After resume and destroy parts are outlined, function `f` will contain only the; code responsible for creation and initialization of the coroutine frame and; execution of the coroutine until a suspend point is reached:. .. code-block:: llvm. define ptr @f(i32 %n) {; entry:; %id = call token @llvm.coro.id(i32 0, ptr null, ptr null, ptr null); %alloc = call noalias ptr @malloc(i32 24); %frame = call noalias ptr @llvm.coro.begin(token %id, ptr %alloc); %1 = getelementptr %f.frame, ptr %frame, i32 0, i32 0; store ptr @f.resume, ptr %1; %2 = getelementptr %f.frame, ptr %frame, i32 0, i32 1; store ptr @f.destroy, ptr %2. %inc = add nsw i32 %n, 1; %inc.spill.addr = getelementptr inbounds %f.Frame, ptr %FramePtr, i32 0, i32 2; store i32 %inc, ptr %inc.spill.addr; call void @print(i32 %n). ret ptr %frame; }.

Usability," of the existence of ROOT's interactive features and use; them if you find them convenient. Some trial-and-error is certainly necessary; to find your way through the huge number of menus and parameter; settings. ## ROOT Beginners' FAQ ##. At this point of the guide, some basic questions could have already come; to your mind. We will try to clarify some of them with further; explanations in the following. ### ROOT type declarations for basic data types ###. In the official ROOT documentation, you find special data types; replacing the normal ones, e.g. `Double_t`, `Float_t` or `Int_t`; replacing the standard `double`, `float` or `int` types. Using the ROOT; types makes it easier to port code between platforms (64/32 bit) or; operating systems (windows/Linux), as these types are mapped to suitable; ones in the ROOT header files. If you want adaptive code of this type,; use the ROOT type declarations. However, usually you do not need such; adaptive code, and you can safely use the standard C type declarations; for your private code, as we did and will do throughout this guide. If; you intend to become a ROOT developer, however, you better stick to the; official coding rules!. ### Configure ROOT at start-up ###. The behaviour of a ROOT session can be tailored with the options in the; `.rootrc` file. Examples of the tunable parameters are the ones related; to the operating and window system, to the fonts to be used, to the; location of start-up files. At start-up, ROOT looks for a `.rootrc` file; in the following order:. - `./.rootrc //local directory`. - `$HOME/.rootrc //user directory`. - `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc //global ROOT directory`. If more than one `.rootrc` files are found in the search paths above,; the options are merged, with precedence local, user, global. The parsing; and interpretation of this file is handled by the ROOT class `TEnv`.; Have a look to its documentation if you need such rather advanced; features.

Usability," of two theorems:. 1- A linear combination of `sigmoids` can approximate any continuous; function. 2- Trained with `output=1` for the signal and 0 for the background,; the approximated function of inputs `X` is the probability of signal,; knowing `X`. ### Learning Methods. The aim of all learning methods is to minimize the total error on a; set of weighted examples. The error is defined as the sum in quadrate,; divided by two, of the error on each individual output neuron. In all; methods implemented in this library, one needs to compute the first; derivative of that error with respect to the weights. Exploiting the; well-known properties of the derivative, one can express this; derivative as the product of the local partial derivative by the; weighted sum of the outputs derivatives (for a neuron) or as the; product of the input value with the local partial derivative of the; output neuron (for a synapse). This computation is called; ""back-propagation of the errors"". Six learning methods are; implemented. #### Stochastic Minimization. This is the most trivial learning method. The Robbins-Monro stochastic; approximation is applied to multilayer perceptrons. The weights are; updated after each example according to the formula:. $$; w_{ij}(t+1) = w_{ij}(t) + \Delta w_{ij}(t); $$. with:. $$; \Delta w_{ij}(t) = - \eta \left(; \frac{\partial e_p}{\partial w_{ij}} + \delta \right) +; \epsilon \Delta w_{ij}(t-1); $$. The parameters for this method are `Eta`, `EtaDecay`, `Delta` and; `Epsilon`. #### Steepest Descent With Fixed Step Size (Batch Learning). It is the same as the stochastic minimization, but the weights are; updated after considering all the examples, with the total derivative; `dEdw`. The parameters for this method are `Eta`, `EtaDecay`, `Delta`; and `Epsilon`. #### Steepest Descent Algorithm. Weights are set to the minimum along the line defined by the gradient.; The only parameter for this method is `Tau`. Lower `Tau` = higher; precision = slower search.

The created; volumes will have tracking media `ID=NUMED` (if `NUMED=0` -\> same media; as `MOTHER`). The behavior of the division operation can be triggered using `OPTION`; (case insensitive):. - `N`divide all range in `NDIV` cells (same effect as `STEP<=0`); (GSDVN in G3); - `NX`divide range starting with `START` in `NDIV` cells (GSDVN2 in; G3); - `S`divide all range with given `STEP`; `NDIV` is computed and; divisions will be centered in full range (same effect as `NDIV<=0`); (GSDVS, GSDVT in G3); - `SX`same as `DVS`, but from `START` position (GSDVS2, GSDVT2 in G3). #### Volume Assemblies. In general, geometry contains structures of positioned volumes that have; to be grouped and handled together, for different possible reasons. One; of these is that the structure has to be replicated in several parts of; the geometry, or it may simply happen that they really represent a; single object, too complex to be described by a primitive shape. Usually handling structures like these can be easily done by positioning; all components in the same container volume, then positioning the; container itself. However, there are many practical cases when defining; such a container is not straightforward or even possible without; generating overlaps with the rest of the geometry. There are few ways; out of this:. - Defining the container for the structure as ""overlapping"" (see also; "" Overlapping Volumes **""**); - Representing the container as a composite shape - the Boolean union; of all components (see also "" Composite Shapes ""); - Using an assembly volume - this will be described in the following. The first two approaches have the disadvantage of penalizing the; navigation performance with a factor increasing more than linear of the; number of components in the structure.

Usability," one branch with both coordinates; on it. A variable on a **`TBranch`** is called a leaf (yes -; **`TLeaf`**). Another point to keep in mind when designing trees is that; branches of the same **`TTree`** can be written to separate files. To; add a **`TBranch`** to a **`TTree`** we call the; method **`TTree::Branch()`**. Note that we DO NOT use the `TBranch`; constructor. The `TTree::Branch` method has several signatures. The branch type; differs by what is stored in it. A branch can hold an entire object, a; list of simple variables, contents of a folder, contents of a; **`TList`**, or an array of objects. Let's see some examples. To follow; along you will need the shared library `libEvent.so`. First, check if it; is in `$ROOTSYS/test`. If it is, copy it to your own area. If it is not; there, you have to build it by typing make in `$ROOTSYS/test`. ## Adding a Branch to Hold a List of Variables. As in the very first example (`cernstaff.root.root`); the data we want to save is a list of simple variables, such as integers; or floats. In this case, we use the following `TTree::Branch` signature:. ``` {.cpp}; tree->Branch(""Ev_Branch"",&event,; ""temp/F:ntrack/I:nseg:nvtex:flag/i"");; ```. The first parameter is the branch name. The second parameter is the address from which the first variable is to; be read. In the code above, ""event"" is a structure with one float and; three integers and one unsigned integer. You should not assume that the; compiler aligns the elements of a structure without gaps. To avoid; alignment problems, you need to use structures with same length members.; If your structure does not qualify, you need to create one branch for; each element of the structure. The leaf name is NOT used to pick the variable out of the structure, but; is only used as the name for the leaf. This means that the list of; variables needs to be in a structure in the order described in the third; parameter. This third parameter is a string describing the leaf list.

If more than one `.rootrc` files are found in the search paths above,; the options are merged, with precedence local, user, global. The parsing; and interpretation of this file is handled by the ROOT class `TEnv`.; Have a look to its documentation if you need such rather advanced; features. The file `.rootrc` defines the location of two rather; important files inspected at start-up: `rootalias.C` and `rootlogon.C`.; They can contain code that needs to be loaded and executed at ROOT; startup. `rootalias.C` is only loaded and best used to define some often; used functions. `rootlogon.C` contains code that will be executed at; startup: this file is extremely useful for example to pre-load a custom; style for the plots created with ROOT. This is done most easily by; creating a new `TStyle` object with your preferred settings, as; described in the class reference guide, and then use the command; `gROOT->SetStyle(""MyStyleName"");` to make this new style definition the; default one. As an example, have a look in the file `rootlogon.C` coming; with this tutorial. Another relevant file is `rootlogoff.C` that it; called when the session is finished. ### ROOT command history ###. Every command typed at the ROOT prompt is stored in a file `.root_hist`; in your home directory. ROOT uses this file to allow for navigation in; the command history with the up-arrow and down-arrow keys. It is also; convenient to extract successful ROOT commands with the help of a text; editor for use in your own macros. ### ROOT Global Pointers ###.

Usability," order; that they are processed (which is in order from simplest/weakest to most; complex/powerful). Generally you want to use the first alias mechanism that; meets the needs of your instruction, because it will allow a more concise; description. Mnemonic Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The first phase of alias processing is simple instruction mnemonic remapping for; classes of instructions which are allowed with two different mnemonics. This; phase is a simple and unconditionally remapping from one input mnemonic to one; output mnemonic. It isn't possible for this form of alias to look at the; operands at all, so the remapping must apply for all forms of a given mnemonic.; Mnemonic aliases are defined simply, for example X86 has:. ::. def : MnemonicAlias<""cbw"", ""cbtw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""smovq"", ""movsq"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""fldcww"", ""fldcw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""fucompi"", ""fucomip"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""ud2a"", ""ud2"">;. ... and many others. With a MnemonicAlias definition, the mnemonic is remapped; simply and directly. Though MnemonicAlias's can't look at any aspect of the; instruction (such as the operands) they can depend on global modes (the same; ones supported by the matcher), through a Requires clause:. ::. def : MnemonicAlias<""pushf"", ""pushfq"">, Requires<[In64BitMode]>;; def : MnemonicAlias<""pushf"", ""pushfl"">, Requires<[In32BitMode]>;. In this example, the mnemonic gets mapped into a different one depending on; the current instruction set. Instruction Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The most general phase of alias processing occurs while matching is happening:; it provides new forms for the matcher to match along with a specific instruction; to generate. An instruction alias has two parts: the string to match and the; instruction to generate. For example:. ::. def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX16rr8W GR16:$dst, GR8 :$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX16rm8W GR16:$dst, i8mem:$src)>;; def : InstAlias<""movsx $src, $dst"", (MOVSX32rr8 G",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:82887,simpl,simply,82887,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Usability," painful. Debuggers generally read debug information from object files on; disk, but for JITed code there is no such file to look for. In order to hand over the necessary debug info, `GDB established an; interface <https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/JIT-Interface.html>`_; for registering JITed code with debuggers. LLDB implements it in the; JITLoaderGDB plugin. On the JIT side, LLVM MCJIT does implement the interface; for ELF object files. At a high level, whenever MCJIT generates new machine code, it does so in an; in-memory object file that contains the debug information in DWARF format.; MCJIT then adds this in-memory object file to a global list of dynamically; generated object files and calls a special function; ``__jit_debug_register_code`` that the debugger knows about. When the debugger; attaches to a process, it puts a breakpoint in this function and associates a; special handler with it. Once MCJIT calls the registration function, the; debugger catches the breakpoint signal, loads the new object file from the; inferior's memory and resumes execution. This way it can obtain debug; information for pure in-memory object files. GDB Version; ===========. In order to debug code JIT-ed by LLVM, you need GDB 7.0 or newer, which is; available on most modern distributions of Linux. The version of GDB that; Apple ships with Xcode has been frozen at 6.3 for a while. LLDB Version; ============. Due to a regression in release 6.0, LLDB didn't support JITed code debugging for; a while. The bug was fixed in mainline recently, so that debugging JITed ELF; objects should be possible again from the upcoming release 12.0 on. On macOS the; feature must be enabled explicitly using the ``plugin.jit-loader.gdb.enable``; setting. Debugging MCJIT-ed code; =======================. The emerging MCJIT component of LLVM allows full debugging of JIT-ed code with; GDB. This is due to MCJIT's ability to use the MC emitter to provide full; DWARF debugging information to GDB.

Usability," parent class ``S`` with one set of template arguments, while record or class; ``B`` can request ``S`` with a different set of arguments. Without template; arguments, many more classes would be required, one for each combination of; the template arguments. Both classes and concrete records can include fields that are uninitialized.; The uninitialized ""value"" is represented by a question mark (``?``). Classes; often have uninitialized fields that are expected to be filled in when those; classes are inherited by concrete records. Even so, some fields of concrete; records may remain uninitialized. TableGen provides *multiclasses* to collect a group of record definitions in; one place. A multiclass is a sort of macro that can be ""invoked"" to define; multiple concrete records all at once. A multiclass can inherit from other; multiclasses, which means that the multiclass inherits all the definitions; from its parent multiclasses. `Appendix C: Sample Record`_ illustrates a complex record in the Intel X86; target and the simple way in which it is defined. Source Files; ============. TableGen source files are plain ASCII text files. The files can contain; statements, comments, and blank lines (see `Lexical Analysis`_). The standard file; extension for TableGen files is ``.td``. TableGen files can grow quite large, so there is an include mechanism that; allows one file to include the content of another file (see `Include; Files`_). This allows large files to be broken up into smaller ones, and; also provides a simple library mechanism where multiple source files can; include the same library file. TableGen supports a simple preprocessor that can be used to conditionalize; portions of ``.td`` files. See `Preprocessing Facilities`_ for more; information. Lexical Analysis; ================.

Many of the examples below are written assuming specific CMake Generators.; Unless otherwise explicitly called out these commands should work with any CMake; generator. Many of the build configurations mentioned on this documentation page can be; utilized by using a CMake cache. A CMake cache is essentially a configuration; file that sets the necessary flags for a specific build configuration. The caches; for Clang are located in :code:`/clang/cmake/caches` within the monorepo. They; can be passed to CMake using the :code:`-C` flag as demonstrated in the examples; below along with additional configuration flags. Bootstrap Builds; ================. The Clang CMake build system supports bootstrap (aka multi-stage) builds. At a; high level a multi-stage build is a chain of builds that pass data from one; stage into the next. The most common and simple version of this is a traditional; bootstrap build. In a simple two-stage bootstrap build, we build clang using the system compiler,; then use that just-built clang to build clang again.

In a production quality JIT you could give the; address of a function that throws an exception in order to unwind the JIT'd; code's stack. Now we can construct our CompileOnDemandLayer.

Usability," repetitive editing. In our experience, automated solutions become; worthwhile somewhere between 100 and 500 files. Getting Started; ---------------. Patterns in Transformer are expressed with :doc:`clang's AST matchers <LibASTMatchers>`.; Matchers are a language of combinators for describing portions of a clang; Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Since clang's AST includes complete type information; (within the limits of single `Translation Unit (TU)`_,; these patterns can even encode rich constraints on the type properties of AST; nodes. .. _`Translation Unit (TU)`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_unit_\(programming\). We assume a familiarity with the clang AST and the corresponding AST matchers; for the purpose of this tutorial. Users who are unfamiliar with either are; encouraged to start with the recommended references in `Related Reading`_. Example: style-checking names; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Assume you have a style-guide rule which forbids functions from being named; ""MkX"" and you want to write a check that catches any violations of this rule. We; can express this a Transformer rewrite rule:. .. code-block:: c++. makeRule(functionDecl(hasName(""MkX"").bind(""fun""),; 	 noopEdit(node(""fun"")),; 	 cat(""The name ``MkX`` is not allowed for functions; please rename""));. ``makeRule`` is our go-to function for generating rewrite rules. It takes three; arguments: the pattern, the edit, and (optionally) an explanatory note. In our; example, the pattern (``functionDecl(...)``) identifies the declaration of the; function ``MkX``. Since we're just diagnosing the problem, but not suggesting a; fix, our edit is an no-op. But, it contains an *anchor* for the diagnostic; message: ``node(""fun"")`` says to associate the message with the source range of; the AST node bound to ""fun""; in this case, the ill-named function declaration.; Finally, we use ``cat`` to build a message that explains the change. Regarding the; name ``cat`` -- we'll discuss it in more detail below, but",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTransformerTutorial.rst:3054,guid,guide,3054,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTransformerTutorial.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTransformerTutorial.rst,1,['guid'],['guide']
Usability," replace an existing value if one is already; associated with a key, otherwise it should add a new value for the key.; No syntax is provided for removing elements from mutable dictionaries. Discussion; ----------. An Objective-C subscript expression occurs when the base operand of the; C subscript operator has an Objective-C object pointer type. Since this; potentially collides with pointer arithmetic on the value, these; expressions are only supported under the modern Objective-C runtime,; which categorically forbids such arithmetic. Currently, only subscripts of integral or Objective-C object pointer; type are supported. In C++, a class type can be used if it has a single; conversion function to an integral or Objective-C pointer type, in which; case that conversion is applied and analysis continues as appropriate.; Otherwise, the expression is ill-formed. An Objective-C object subscript expression is always an l-value. If the; expression appears on the left-hand side of a simple assignment operator; (=), the element is written as described below. If the expression; appears on the left-hand side of a compound assignment operator (e.g.; +=), the program is ill-formed, because the result of reading an element; is always an Objective-C object pointer and no binary operators are; legal on such pointers. If the expression appears in any other position,; the element is read as described below. It is an error to take the; address of a subscript expression, or (in C++) to bind a reference to; it. Programs can use object subscripting with Objective-C object pointers of; type ``id``. Normal dynamic message send rules apply; the compiler must; see *some* declaration of the subscripting methods, and will pick the; declaration seen first. Caveats; =======. Objects created using the literal or boxed expression syntax are not; guaranteed to be uniqued by the runtime, but nor are they guaranteed to; be newly-allocated.

GitHub recognizes such commit; messages and will automatically close the specified issue with a reference; to your commit. * If the reported behavior is not a bug, it is appropriate to close the issue; with a comment explaining why you believe it is not a bug, and adding the; ``invalid`` tag. * If the bug duplicates another issue, close it as a duplicate by adding the; ``duplicate`` label with a comment pointing to the issue it duplicates. * If there is a sound reason for not fixing the issue (difficulty, ABI, open; research questions, etc), add the ``wontfix`` label and a comment explaining; why no changes are expected. * If there is a specific and plausible reason to think that a given bug is; otherwise inapplicable or obsolete.

Usability," results than a; sampling profiler. It also provides reproducible results, at least to the; extent that the code behaves consistently across runs. Clang supports two types of instrumentation: frontend-based and IR-based.; Frontend-based instrumentation can be enabled with the option ``-fprofile-instr-generate``,; and IR-based instrumentation can be enabled with the option ``-fprofile-generate``.; For best performance with PGO, IR-based instrumentation should be used. It has; the benefits of lower instrumentation overhead, smaller raw profile size, and; better runtime performance. Frontend-based instrumentation, on the other hand,; has better source correlation, so it should be used with source line-based; coverage testing. The flag ``-fcs-profile-generate`` also instruments programs using the same; instrumentation method as ``-fprofile-generate``. However, it performs a; post-inline late instrumentation and can produce context-sensitive profiles. Here are the steps for using profile guided optimization with; instrumentation:. 1. Build an instrumented version of the code by compiling and linking with the; ``-fprofile-generate`` or ``-fprofile-instr-generate`` option. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ -O2 -fprofile-instr-generate code.cc -o code. 2. Run the instrumented executable with inputs that reflect the typical usage.; By default, the profile data will be written to a ``default.profraw`` file; in the current directory. You can override that default by using option; ``-fprofile-instr-generate=`` or by setting the ``LLVM_PROFILE_FILE``; environment variable to specify an alternate file. If non-default file name; is specified by both the environment variable and the command line option,; the environment variable takes precedence. The file name pattern specified; can include different modifiers: ``%p``, ``%h``, ``%m``, ``%t``, and ``%c``.

Usability," results when they are no longer useful. The; ``releaseMemory`` virtual method is the way to do this. If you are writing an analysis or any other pass that retains a significant; amount of state (for use by another pass which ""requires"" your pass and uses; the :ref:`getAnalysis <writing-an-llvm-pass-getAnalysis>` method) you should; implement ``releaseMemory`` to, well, release the memory allocated to maintain; this internal state. This method is called after the ``run*`` method for the; class, before the next call of ``run*`` in your pass. Registering dynamically loaded passes; =====================================. *Size matters* when constructing production quality tools using LLVM, both for; the purposes of distribution, and for regulating the resident code size when; running on the target system. Therefore, it becomes desirable to selectively; use some passes, while omitting others and maintain the flexibility to change; configurations later on. You want to be able to do all this, and, provide; feedback to the user. This is where pass registration comes into play. The fundamental mechanisms for pass registration are the; ``MachinePassRegistry`` class and subclasses of ``MachinePassRegistryNode``. An instance of ``MachinePassRegistry`` is used to maintain a list of; ``MachinePassRegistryNode`` objects. This instance maintains the list and; communicates additions and deletions to the command line interface. An instance of ``MachinePassRegistryNode`` subclass is used to maintain; information provided about a particular pass. This information includes the; command line name, the command help string and the address of the function used; to create an instance of the pass. A global static constructor of one of these; instances *registers* with a corresponding ``MachinePassRegistry``, the static; destructor *unregisters*. Thus a pass that is statically linked in the tool; will be registered at start up.

Intermezzo: Learn AST matcher basics; ====================================. Clang recently introduced the :doc:`ASTMatcher; library <LibASTMatchers>` to provide a simple, powerful, and; concise way to describe specific patterns in the AST. Implemented as a; DSL powered by macros and templates (see; `ASTMatchers.h <../doxygen/ASTMatchers_8h_source.html>`_ if you're; curious), matchers offer the feel of algebraic data types common to; functional programming languages. For example, suppose you wanted to examine only binary operators. There; is a matcher to do exactly that, conveniently named ``binaryOperator``.; I'll give you one guess what this matcher does:. .. code-block:: c++. binaryOperator(hasOperatorName(""+""), hasLHS(integerLiteral(equals(0)))). Shockingly, it will match against addition expressions whose left hand; side is exactly the literal 0. It will not match against other forms of; 0, such as ``'\0'`` or ``NULL``, but it will match against macros that; expand to 0. The matcher will also not match against calls to the; overloaded operator ``'+'``, as there is a separate ``operatorCallExpr``; matcher to handle overloaded operators.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.rst:5792,simpl,simple,5792,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.rst,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability," running other heavy applications - the number of your own threads; running at any time may be lower than the limit due to demand on the CPU.; - The 'Real Time' is similar to 'CPU Time / number of threads' AND 'Compressed Throughput' is lower than expected; for your storage medium: this would imply that your CPU threads aren't decompressing data as fast as your storage; medium can provide it, and so decompression is the bottleneck.; The best way to decrease your runtime would be to utilise a system with a faster CPU, or make use; use of more threads when running, or use a compression algorithm with a higher decompression rate such as LZ4,; possibly at the cost of some extra file size. ### A note on caching. If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is; first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if; you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache -; consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed.; On Linux this can be done by running 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' as a superuser,; or a specific file can be dropped from the cache with; `dd of=<FILENAME> oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0 > /dev/null 2>&1`. ### Known overhead of TTreeReader, RDataFrame. `rootreadspeed` is designed to read all data present in the specified branches, trees and files at the highest; possible speed. When the application bottleneck is not in the computations performed by analysis logic,; higher-level interfaces built on top of TTree such as TTreeReader and RDataFrame are known to add a significant; runtime overhead with respect to the runtimes reported by `rootreadspeed` (up to a factor 2). In realistic analysis; applications it has been observed that a large part of that overhead is compensated by the ability of TTreeReader and; RDataFrame to read branch values selectively, based on event cuts, and",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md:3738,clear,clearing,3738,tree/readspeed/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md,1,['clear'],['clearing']
Usability," scheduling a LoopPass.; After the loop optimizations are done, these extra phi nodes; will be deleted by :ref:`-instcombine <passes-instcombine>`. Note that an exit block is outside of a loop, so how can such a phi ""close""; the value inside the loop since it uses it outside of it ? First of all,; for phi nodes, as; `mentioned in the LangRef <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#id311>`_:; ""the use of each incoming value is deemed to occur on the edge from the; corresponding predecessor block to the current block"". Now, an; edge to an exit block is considered outside of the loop because; if we take that edge, it leads us clearly out of the loop. However, an edge doesn't actually contain any IR, so in source code,; we have to choose a convention of whether the use happens in; the current block or in the respective predecessor. For LCSSA's purpose,; we consider the use happens in the latter (so as to consider the; use inside) [#point-of-use-phis]_. The major benefit of LCSSA is that it makes many other loop optimizations; simpler. First of all, a simple observation is that if one needs to see all; the outside users, they can just iterate over all the (loop closing); PHI nodes in the exit blocks (the alternative would be to; scan the def-use chain [#def-use-chain]_ of all instructions in the loop). Then, consider for example; :ref:`simple-loop-unswitch <passes-simple-loop-unswitch>` ing the loop above.; Because it is in LCSSA form, we know that any value defined inside of; the loop will be used either only inside the loop or in a loop closing; PHI node. In this case, the only loop closing PHI node is X4.; This means that we can just copy the loop and change the X4; accordingly, like so:. .. code-block:: C. c = ...;; if (c) {; for (...) {; if (true); X1 = ...; else; X2 = ...; X3 = phi(X1, X2);; }; } else {; for (...) {; if (false); X1' = ...; else; X2' = ...; X3' = phi(X1', X2');; }; }; X4 = phi(X3, X3').

For example, ``list=spec.txt`` where ``spec.txt`` contains:. ::. !foo; !!1 !!3 !!5; !!2 !!4 !!6. will create two unique sections for function ``foo`` with the first; containing the odd numbered basic blocks and the second containing the; even numbered basic blocks. Basic block sections allow the linker to reorder basic blocks and enables; link-time optimizations like whole program inter-procedural basic block; reordering. Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile information enables better optimization. For example, knowing that a; branch is taken very frequently helps the compiler make better decisions when; ordering basic blocks. Knowing that a function ``foo`` is called more; frequently than another function ``bar`` helps the inliner. Optimization; levels ``-O2`` and above are recommended for use of profile guided optimization. Clang supports profile guided optimization with two different kinds of; profiling. A sampling profiler can generate a profile with very low runtime; overhead, or you can build an instrumented version of the code that collects; more detailed profile information. Both kinds of profiles can provide execution; counts for instructions in the code and information on branches taken and; function invocation. Regardless of which kind of profiling you use, be careful to collect profiles; by running your code with inputs that are representative of the typical; behavior. Code that is not exercised in the profile will be optimized as if it; is unimportant, and the compiler may make poor optimization choices for code; that is disproportionately used while profiling.

It specializes in recognizing general induction; variables, representing them with the abstract and opaque ``SCEV`` class.; Given this analysis, trip counts of loops and other important properties can be; obtained. This analysis is primarily useful for induction variable substitution and; strength reduction. ``scev-aa``: ScalarEvolution-based Alias Analysis; -------------------------------------------------. Simple alias analysis implemented in terms of ``ScalarEvolution`` queries. This differs from traditional loop dependence analysis in that it tests for; dependencies within a single iteration of a loop, rather than dependencies; between different iterations. ``ScalarEvolution`` has a more complete understanding of pointer arithmetic; than ``BasicAliasAnalysis``' collection of ad-hoc analyses. ``stack-safety``: Stack Safety Analysis; ---------------------------------------. The ``StackSafety`` analysis can be used to determine if stack allocated; variables can be considered safe from memory access bugs. This analysis' primary purpose is to be used by sanitizers to avoid unnecessary; instrumentation of safe variables. Transform Passes; ================.

But in the first case, B could still link successfully if it implicitly; depended on C, or the opposite in the second case). .. _minimal list of #includes:. ``#include`` as Little as Possible; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``#include`` hurts compile time performance. Don't do it unless you have to,; especially in header files. But wait! Sometimes you need to have the definition of a class to use it, or to; inherit from it. In these cases go ahead and ``#include`` that header file. Be; aware however that there are many cases where you don't need to have the full; definition of a class. If you are using a pointer or reference to a class, you; don't need the header file. If you are simply returning a class instance from a; prototyped function or method, you don't need it. In fact, for most cases, you; simply don't need the definition of a class. And not ``#include``\ing speeds up; compilation. It is easy to try to go too overboard on this recommendation, however. You; **must** include all of the header files that you are using --- you can include; them either directly or indirectly through another header file. To make sure; that you don't accidentally forget to include a header file in your module; header, make sure to include your module header **first** in the implementation; file (as mentioned above). This way there won't be any hidden dependencies that; you'll find out about later. Keep ""Internal"" Headers Private; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Many modules have a complex implementation that causes them to use more than one; implementation (``.cpp``) file. It is often tempting to put the internal; communication interface (helper classes, extra functions, etc) in the public; module header file. Don't do this!.

Usability," specified location list expression E is; evaluated. The evaluation of E uses the current context, except the result; kind is a location description, the compilation unit is the one that; contains D, and the initial stack is empty. The location description; result is pushed on the stack. .. note::. This rule avoids having to define how to execute a matched location list; entry operation expression on the same stack as the call when there are; multiple matches. But it allows the call to obtain the location; description for a variable or formal parameter which may use a location; list expression. An alternative is to treat the case when D has a ``DW_AT_location``; attribute that is encoded as a ``loclist`` or ``loclistsptr``, and the; specified location list expression E' matches a single location list; entry with operation expression E, the same as the ``exprloc`` case and; evaluate on the same stack. But this is not attractive as if the attribute is for a variable that; happens to end with a non-singleton stack, it will not simply put a; location description on the stack. Presumably the intent of using; ``DW_OP_call*`` on a variable or formal parameter debugger information; entry is to push just one location description on the stack. That; location description may have more than one single location description. The previous rule for ``exprloc`` also has the same problem, as normally; a variable or formal parameter location expression may leave multiple; entries on the stack and only return the top entry. GDB implements ``DW_OP_call*`` by always executing E on the same stack.; If the location list has multiple matching entries, it simply picks the; first one and ignores the rest. This seems fundamentally at odds with; the desire to support multiple places for variables. So, it feels like ``DW_OP_call*`` should both support pushing a location; description on the stack for a variable or formal parameter, and also; support being able to execute an operation expression on",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst:76911,simpl,simply,76911,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Usability," succeeding, it isn't perfect: there are edges. The following sections; explain in some detail what you can expect, and what you need to watch; out for. #### Access to ROOT Classes. Before a ROOT class can be used from Python, its dictionary needs to be; loaded into the current process. Starting with ROOT version 4.00/06,; this happens automatically for all classes that are declared to the; auto-loading mechanism through so-called `rootmap` files. Effectively,; this means that all classes in the ROOT distributions are directly; available for import. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TCanvas # available at startup; c = TCanvas(). from ROOT import TLorentzVector # triggers auto-load of libPhysics; l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Although it is not recommended, a simple way of working with `PyROOT` is; doing a global import:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import *. c = TCanvas(); l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Keeping the ROOT namespace (""`import ROOT`""), or only importing from; ROOT those classes that you will actually use (see above), however, will; always be cleaner and clearer:. ``` {.cpp}; import ROOT. c = ROOT.TCanvas(); l = ROOT.TLorentzVector(); ```. Since it is foreseen that most people will use the simple approach; anyway, the request to copy all from module ROOT will not actually; result in copying all ROOT classes into the current namespace. Instead,; classes will still be bound (and possibly loaded) on an as-needed basis.; Note carefully how this is different from other Python (extension); modules, and what to expect if you use the normal inspection tools (such; as e.g. '`dir()`'). This feature prevents the inspection tools from; being swamped by an enormous amount of classes, but they can no longer; be used to explore unknown parts of the system (e.g. to find out which; classes are available). Furthermore, because of this approach,; \<`tab`\>-completion will usually not be available until after the first; use (and hence creation) of a class.

Usability," suffix. This allows differentiating intrinsics with; different unnamed types as arguments. (For example:; ``llvm.ssa.copy.p0s_s.2(%42*)``) The number is tracked in the LLVM module and; it ensures unique names in the module. While linking together two modules, it is; still possible to get a name clash. In that case one of the names will be; changed by getting a new number. For target developers who are defining intrinsics for back-end code; generation, any intrinsic overloads based solely the distinction between; integer or floating point types should not be relied upon for correct; code generation. In such cases, the recommended approach for target; maintainers when defining intrinsics is to create separate integer and; FP intrinsics rather than rely on overloading. For example, if different; codegen is required for ``llvm.target.foo(<4 x i32>)`` and; ``llvm.target.foo(<4 x float>)`` then these should be split into; different intrinsics. To learn how to add an intrinsic function, please see the `Extending; LLVM Guide <ExtendingLLVM.html>`_. .. _int_varargs:. Variable Argument Handling Intrinsics; -------------------------------------. Variable argument support is defined in LLVM with the; :ref:`va_arg <i_va_arg>` instruction and these three intrinsic; functions. These functions are related to the similarly named macros; defined in the ``<stdarg.h>`` header file. All of these functions operate on arguments that use a target-specific; value type ""``va_list``"". The LLVM assembly language reference manual; does not define what this type is, so all transformations should be; prepared to handle these functions regardless of the type used. This example shows how the :ref:`va_arg <i_va_arg>` instruction and the; variable argument handling intrinsic functions are used. .. code-block:: llvm. ; This struct is different for every platform.

To reduce the very large number of new and delete calls in large loops; like this (O(100000) x O(10000) times new/delete):. ``` {.cpp}; TObjArray a(10000);; while (TEvent *ev = (TEvent *)next()) { // O(100000); for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) { // O(10000); a[i] = new TTrack(x,y,z,...);; ...; }; ...; a.Delete();; }; ```. You better use a **`TClonesArray`** which reduces the number of; new/delete calls to only O(10000):. ``` {.cpp}; TClonesArray a(""TTrack"", 10000);; while (TEvent *ev = (TEvent *)next()) { // O(100000); for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) { // O(10000); TTrack *track = (Track*)a.ConstructedAt(i);; track->Set(x,y,z,...);; ...; }; ...; a.Clear(); // Or Clear(""C"") if the track objects must be returned (via Track::Clear) to a default state.; }; ```. Considering that a pair of new/delete calls on average cost about 70 ms,; O(109) new/deletes will save about 19 hours. For the other collections,; see the class reference guide on the web and the test program; `$ROOTSYS/test/tcollex.cxx.`. ## Template Containers and STL. Some people dislike polymorphic containers because they are not truly; ""type safe"". In the end, the compiler leaves it the user to ensure that; the types are correct. This only leaves the other alternative: creating; a new class each time a new (container organization) / (contained; object) combination is needed. To say the least this could be very; tedious. Most people faced with this choice would, for each type of; container:. Define the class leaving a dummy name for the contained object type.; When a particular container was needed, copy the code and then do a; global search and replace for the contained class. C++ has a built in; template scheme that effectively does just this. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; template<class T>; class ArrayContainer {; private:; T *member[10];; ...; };; ```.

The ``__builtin_dump_struct`` function is used to print the fields of a simple; structure and their values for debugging purposes. The first argument of the; builtin should be a pointer to a complete record type to dump. The second argument ``f``; should be some callable expression, and can be a function object or an overload; set. The builtin calls ``f``, passing any further arguments ``args...``; followed by a ``printf``-compatible format string and the corresponding; arguments. ``f`` may be called more than once, and ``f`` and ``args`` will be; evaluated once per call. In C++, ``f`` may be a template or overload set and; resolve to different functions for each call. In the format string, a suitable format specifier will be used for builtin; types that Clang knows how to format. This includes standard builtin types, as; well as aggregate structures, ``void*`` (printed with ``%p``), and ``const; char*`` (printed with ``%s``). A ``*%p`` specifier will be used for a field; that Clang doesn't know how to format, and the corresponding argument will be ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:104853,simpl,simple,104853,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability," that have pointer; arguments. If it can prove, through the use of alias analysis, that an; argument is *only* loaded, then it can pass the value into the function instead; of the address of the value. This can cause recursive simplification of code; and lead to the elimination of allocas (especially in C++ template code like; the STL). This pass also handles aggregate arguments that are passed into a function,; scalarizing them if the elements of the aggregate are only loaded. Note that; it refuses to scalarize aggregates which would require passing in more than; three operands to the function, because passing thousands of operands for a; large array or structure is unprofitable!. Note that this transformation could also be done for arguments that are only; stored to (returning the value instead), but does not currently. This case; would be best handled when and if LLVM starts supporting multiple return values; from functions. ``block-placement``: Profile Guided Basic Block Placement; ---------------------------------------------------------. This pass is a very simple profile guided basic block placement algorithm. The; idea is to put frequently executed blocks together at the start of the function; and hopefully increase the number of fall-through conditional branches. If; there is no profile information for a particular function, this pass basically; orders blocks in depth-first order. ``break-crit-edges``: Break critical edges in CFG; -------------------------------------------------. Break all of the critical edges in the CFG by inserting a dummy basic block.; It may be ""required"" by passes that cannot deal with critical edges. This; transformation obviously invalidates the CFG, but can update forward dominator; (set, immediate dominators, tree, and frontier) information. ``codegenprepare``: Optimize for code generation; ------------------------------------------------.

Usability," that is; derived at run-time from the header files.; It is still possible to fully embed header files rather than only storing; their names and search locations, to make the dictionary more self-contained. After generating the dictionary, it should be compiled into a shared library.; This provides additional dependency control: by linking it directly with any; further libraries needed, you can use standard mechanisms such as ``rpath``; to locate those library dependencies.; Alternatively, you can add the additional libraries to load to the mapping; files of the class loader (see below). .. note::. The JIT needs to resolve linker symbols in order to call them through; generated wrappers.; Thus, any classes, functions, and data that will be used in Python need; to be exported.; This is the default behavior on Mac and Linux, but not on Windows.; On that platform, use ``__declspec(dllexport)`` to explicitly export the; classes and function you expect to call.; CMake has simple `support for exporting all`_ C++ symbols. In tandem with any dictionary, a pre-compiled module (.pcm) file will be; generated.; C++ modules are still on track for inclusion in the C++20 standard and most; modern C++ compilers, ``clang`` among them, already have implementations.; The benefits for cppyy include faster bindings generation, lower memory; footprint, and isolation from preprocessor macros and compiler flags.; The use of modules is transparent, other than the requirement that they; need to be co-located with the compiled dictionary shared library. Optionally, the dictionary generation process also produces a mapping file,; which lists the libraries needed to load C++ classes on request (for details,; see the section on the class loader below).

(Note that in this way, indirect outputs act more like an *input* than; an output: just like an input, they consume an argument of the call expression,; rather than producing a return value. An indirect output constraint is an; ""output"" only in that the asm is expected to write to the contents of the input; memory location, instead of just read from it). This is most typically used for memory constraint, e.g. ""``=*m``"", to pass the; address of a variable as a value. It is also possible to use an indirect *register* constraint, but only on output; (e.g. ""``=*r``""). This will cause LLVM to allocate a register for an output; value normally, and then, separately emit a store to the address provided as; input, after the provided inline asm. (It's not clear what value this; functionality provides, compared to writing the store explicitly after the asm; statement, and it can only produce worse code, since it bypasses many; optimization passes.

These; integration tests are part of clang as part of a continuous integration; framework, ensuring updates to the compiler that reduce CFI coverage on; indirect control flow instructions are identified. Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code. The analysis of machine code is important as it ensures that any bugs; present in linker or compiler do not subvert CFI protections in the final; shipped binary. Unprotected indirect control flow instructions will be flagged for manual; review. These unexpected control flows may simply have not been accounted for in; the compiler implementation of CFI (e.g. indirect jumps to facilitate switch; statements may not be fully protected). It may be possible in the future to extend this tool to flag unnecessary CFI; directives (e.g. CFI directives around a static call to a non-polymorphic base; type). This type of directive has no security implications, but may present; performance impacts. Design Ideas; ============. This tool will disassemble binaries and DSO's from their machine code format and; analyse the disassembled machine code. The tool will inspect virtual calls and; indirect function calls.

Usability," the RNTuple is immutable and cannot be amended.; An RNTuple that is currently being written cannot be read. ### RNTupleReader; The RNTupleReader is the primary interface to read and inspect an RNTuple.; An RNTupleReader owns a model: either a model created from the on-disk information or an imposed, user-provided model.; The user-provided model can be limited to a subset of fields.; Data is populated to an explicit `REntry` or the model's default entry through `RNTupleReader::LoadEntry()`. The reader can create `RNTupleView` objects for the independent reading of individual fields.; The reader can create `RBulk` objects for bulk reading of individual fields. Additionally, the reader provides access to a cached copy of the descriptor.; It can display individual entries (`RNTupleReader::Show()`) and summary information (`RNTupleReader::PrintInfo()`). ### RNTupleView<T>; RNTuple views provide read access to individual fields.; Views are created from an RNTupleReader.; Views are templated; for simple types (e.g., `float`, `int`), views provide read-only access directly to an RNTuple page in memory.; Complex types and void views require additional memory copies to populate an object in memory from the column data. A view can iterate over the entry range, over the field range, and over the range of a collection within an entry.; For instance, for a field `std::vector<float> pt`, a view can iterate over all `pt` values of all entries, or over the `pt` values of a particular entry. A view can safely outlive its originating reader.; Once the reader is deconstructed, any attempt to read data will throw an exception, but the view is still properly destructed. Views that originate from the same reader _cannot_ be used concurrently by different threads.

Creating Pull Requests; ----------------------; Keep in mind that when creating a pull request, it should generally only contain one; self-contained commit initially.; This makes it easier for reviewers to understand the introduced changes and; provide feedback. It also helps maintain a clear and organized commit history; for the project. If you have multiple changes you want to introduce, it's; recommended to create separate pull requests for each change. Create a local branch per commit you want to submit and then push that branch; to your `fork <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks>`_; of the llvm-project and; `create a pull request from the fork <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_.; As GitHub uses the first line of the commit message truncated to 72 characters; as the pull request title, you may have to edit to reword or to undo this; truncation.

As an optimization, direct calls to native ABI functions will call the; native ABI function directly and the pass will compute the appropriate label; internally. This has the advantage of reducing the number of union operations; required when the return value label is known to be zero (i.e. ``discard``; functions, or ``functional`` functions with known unlabelled arguments). Checking ABI Consistency; ------------------------. DFSan changes the ABI of each function in the module. This makes it possible; for a function with the native ABI to be called with the instrumented ABI,; or vice versa, thus possibly invoking undefined behavior. A simple way; of statically detecting instances of this problem is to append the suffix; "".dfsan"" to the name of each instrumented-ABI function.

The choice of MC sampling algorithm can be steered through class RooNumGenConfig, which; is similar in style and structure, to RooNumIntConfig which configures the choice of; numeric integration algorithm. A new tutorial macro rf902_numgenconfig.C has been added to $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit; to illustrate the use of the steering. A macro that demonstrates of the power of these newly interface numeric algorithms is provided at the; end of the RooFit section of the release notes. Optional persistent caching of numeric integrals; For p.d.f.s with numeric integrals that remain difficult or very time consuming,; a new persistent caching technique is now available that allows to precalculate; these integrals and store their values for future use. This technique works transparently; for any p.d.f. stored in a RooWorkspace. One can store numeric integral values for problems with zero, one or two floating parameters.; In the first case, the value is simply stored. In cases with one or two floating parameters; a grid (histogram) of integral values is stored, which are interpolated to return integral; values for each value of the parameters.

Usability," the; execution known as 'safepoints' For most collectors, it is sufficient; to track at least one copy of each unique pointer value. However, for; a collector which wishes to relocate objects directly reachable from; running code, a higher standard is required. One additional challenge is that the compiler may compute intermediate; results (""derived pointers"") which point outside of the allocation or; even into the middle of another allocation. The eventual use of this; intermediate value must yield an address within the bounds of the; allocation, but such ""exterior derived pointers"" may be visible to the; collector. Given this, a garbage collector can not safely rely on the; runtime value of an address to indicate the object it is associated; with. If the garbage collector wishes to move any object, the; compiler must provide a mapping, for each pointer, to an indication of; its allocation. To simplify the interaction between a collector and the compiled code,; most garbage collectors are organized in terms of three abstractions:; load barriers, store barriers, and safepoints. #. A load barrier is a bit of code executed immediately after the; machine load instruction, but before any use of the value loaded.; Depending on the collector, such a barrier may be needed for all; loads, merely loads of a particular type (in the original source; language), or none at all. #. Analogously, a store barrier is a code fragment that runs; immediately before the machine store instruction, but after the; computation of the value stored. The most common use of a store; barrier is to update a 'card table' in a generational garbage; collector. #. A safepoint is a location at which pointers visible to the compiled; code (i.e. currently in registers or on the stack) are allowed to; change. After the safepoint completes, the actual pointer value; may differ, but the 'object' (as seen by the source language); pointed to will not. Note that the term 'safepoint' is somewhat overloaded.

Usability," these compilers requires a lot of options. To simplify the; configuration the Apple Clang build settings are contained in CMake Cache files.; You can build an Apple Clang compiler using the following commands:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/Apple-stage1.cmake <path to source>/llvm; $ ninja stage2-distribution. This CMake invocation configures the stage1 host compiler, and sets; CLANG_BOOTSTRAP_CMAKE_ARGS to pass the Apple-stage2.cmake cache script to the; stage2 configuration step. When you build the stage2-distribution target it builds the minimal stage1; compiler and required tools, then configures and builds the stage2 compiler; based on the settings in Apple-stage2.cmake. This pattern of using cache scripts to set complex settings, and specifically to; make later stage builds include cache scripts is common in our more advanced; build configurations. Multi-stage PGO; ===============. Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) is a really great way to optimize the code; clang generates. Our multi-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a single profdata file that you; can feed into the LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE option. Our PGO.cmake cache automates that whole process. You can use it for; configuration with CMake with the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; <path to source>/llvm.

Usability," these days,; but many people need them to get bigger goals accomplished: it makes sense for; everyone to work together.; For more information about the LLVM/clang license, please see the LLVM License; Description for more information. Internal Design and Implementation. A real-world, production quality compiler. Clang is designed and built by experienced compiler developers who are; increasingly frustrated with the problems that existing open source; compilers have. Clang is carefully and thoughtfully designed and; built to provide the foundation of a whole new generation of; C/C++/Objective C development tools, and we intend for it to be; production quality.; Being a production quality compiler means many things: it means being high; performance, being solid and (relatively) bug free, and it means eventually; being used and depended on by a broad range of people. While we are still in; the early development stages, we strongly believe that this will become a; reality. A simple and hackable code base. Our goal is to make it possible for anyone with a basic understanding; of compilers and working knowledge of the C/C++/ObjC languages to understand and; extend the clang source base. A large part of this falls out of our decision to; make the AST mirror the languages as closely as possible: you have your friendly; if statement, for statement, parenthesis expression, structs, unions, etc, all; represented in a simple and explicit way.; In addition to a simple design, we work to make the source base approachable; by commenting it well, including citations of the language standards where; appropriate, and designing the code for simplicity. Beyond that, clang offers; a set of AST dumpers, printers, and visualizers that make it easy to put code in; and see how it is represented.

Usability," these interfaces appropriately. The ``deleteValue`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``deleteValue`` method is called by transformations when they remove an; instruction or any other value from the program (including values that do not; use pointers). Typically alias analyses keep data structures that have entries; for each value in the program. When this method is called, they should remove; any entries for the specified value, if they exist. The ``copyValue`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``copyValue`` method is used when a new value is introduced into the; program. There is no way to introduce a value into the program that did not; exist before (this doesn't make sense for a safe compiler transformation), so; this is the only way to introduce a new value. This method indicates that the; new value has exactly the same properties as the value being copied. The ``replaceWithNewValue`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. This method is a simple helper method that is provided to make clients easier to; use. It is implemented by copying the old analysis information to the new; value, then deleting the old value. This method cannot be overridden by alias; analysis implementations. The ``addEscapingUse`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``addEscapingUse`` method is used when the uses of a pointer value have; changed in ways that may invalidate precomputed analysis information.; Implementations may either use this callback to provide conservative responses; for points whose uses have change since analysis time, or may recompute some or; all of their internal state to continue providing accurate responses. In general, any new use of a pointer value is considered an escaping use, and; must be reported through this callback, *except* for the uses below:. * A ``bitcast`` or ``getelementptr`` of the pointer; * A ``store`` through the pointer (but not a ``store`` *of* the pointer); * A ``load`` through the pointer.

Usability," this scaffolding, we can now talk about parsing expressions and; function bodies in Kaleidoscope. Parser Basics; =============. Now that we have an AST to build, we need to define the parser code to; build it. The idea here is that we want to parse something like ""x+y""; (which is returned as three tokens by the lexer) into an AST that could; be generated with calls like this:. .. code-block:: c++. auto LHS = std::make_unique<VariableExprAST>(""x"");; auto RHS = std::make_unique<VariableExprAST>(""y"");; auto Result = std::make_unique<BinaryExprAST>('+', std::move(LHS),; std::move(RHS));. In order to do this, we'll start by defining some basic helper routines:. .. code-block:: c++. /// CurTok/getNextToken - Provide a simple token buffer. CurTok is the current; /// token the parser is looking at. getNextToken reads another token from the; /// lexer and updates CurTok with its results.; static int CurTok;; static int getNextToken() {; return CurTok = gettok();; }. This implements a simple token buffer around the lexer. This allows us; to look one token ahead at what the lexer is returning. Every function; in our parser will assume that CurTok is the current token that needs to; be parsed. .. code-block:: c++. /// LogError* - These are little helper functions for error handling.; std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> LogError(const char *Str) {; fprintf(stderr, ""Error: %s\n"", Str);; return nullptr;; }; std::unique_ptr<PrototypeAST> LogErrorP(const char *Str) {; LogError(Str);; return nullptr;; }. The ``LogError`` routines are simple helper routines that our parser will; use to handle errors. The error recovery in our parser will not be the; best and is not particular user-friendly, but it will be enough for our; tutorial. These routines make it easier to handle errors in routines; that have various return types: they always return null. With these basic helper functions, we can implement the first piece of; our grammar: numeric literals.

Usability," to completion by returning; a null continuation pointer.

The ramp; function returns a continuation function pointer and yielded; values, the continuation function may optionally return ordinary; results when the coroutine has run to completion. The coroutine frame is maintained in a fixed-size buffer that is; passed to the `coro.id` intrinsic, which guarantees a certain size; and alignment statically. The same buffer must be passed to the; continuation function(s). The coroutine will allocate memory if the; buffer is insufficient, in which case it will need to store at; least that pointer in the buffer; therefore the buffer must always; be at least pointer-sized. How the coroutine uses the buffer may; vary between suspend points. In addition to the buffer pointer, continuation functions take an; argument indicating whether the coroutine is being resumed normally; (zero) or abnormally (non-zero). LLVM is currently ineffective at statically eliminating allocations; after fully inlining returned-continuation coroutines into a caller.; This may be acceptable if LLVM's coroutine support is primarily being; used for low-level lowering and inlining is expected to be applied; earlier in the pipeline.

HLSL support in Clang is expressed as C++ minus unsupported C and C++ features.; This is different from how other Clang languages are implemented. Most languages; in Clang are additive on top of C. HLSL is not a formally or fully specified language, and while our goals require; a high level of source compatibility, implementations can vary and we have some; flexibility to be more or less permissive in some cases. For modern HLSL DXC is; the reference implementation. The HLSL effort prioritizes following similar patterns for other languages,; drivers, runtimes and targets. Specifically, We will maintain separation between; HSLS-specific code and the rest of Clang as much as possible following patterns; in use in Clang code today (i.e. ParseHLSL.cpp, SemaHLSL.cpp, CGHLSL*.cpp...).; We will use inline checks on language options where the code is simple and; isolated, and prefer HLSL-specific implementation files for any code of; reasonable complexity. In places where the HLSL language is in conflict with C and C++, we will seek to; make minimally invasive changes guarded under the HLSL language options. We will; seek to make HLSL language support as minimal a maintenance burden as possible. DXC Driver; ----------. A DXC driver mode will provide command-line compatibility with DXC, supporting; DXC's options and flags. The DXC driver is HLSL-specific and will create an; HLSLToolchain which will provide the basis to support targeting both DirectX and; Vulkan. Parser; ------. Following the examples of other parser extensions HLSL will add a ParseHLSL.cpp; file to contain the implementations of HLSL-specific extensions to the Clang; parser.

Such an analogy works fine as long as the vector; elements are byte sized. However, when the elements of the vector aren't byte; sized it gets a bit more complicated. One way to describe the layout is by; describing what happens when a vector such as <N x iM> is bitcasted to an; integer type with N*M bits, and then following the rules for storing such an; integer to memory.

ROOT/TMVA SOFIE (“System for Optimized Fast Inference code Emit”) is a new package introduced in this release that generates C++ functions easily invokable for the fast inference of trained neural network models. It takes ONNX model files as inputs and produces C++ header files that can be included and utilized in a “plug-and-go” style.; This is a new development and it is currently still in experimental stage. From ROOT command line, or in a ROOT macro you can use this code for parsing a model in ONNX file format; and generate C++ code that can be used to evaluate the model:. ```; using namespace TMVA::Experimental;; SOFIE::RModelParser_ONNX parser;; SOFIE::RModel model = parser.Parse(“./example_model.onnx”);; model.Generate();; model.OutputGenerated(“./example_output.hxx”);; ```; And an C++ header file will be generated. In addition also a text file, `example_output.dat` will be also generated.

This change is required to prevent non reproducible behaviours in a multithreaded environments. For example, if several threads change the; `TH1::fgStatOverflows` flag and fill histograms, the behaviour will be undefined.; - A fix has been added in resetting the statistics of histograms with label.

The error recovery in our parser will not be the; best and is not particular user-friendly, but it will be enough for our; tutorial. These routines make it easier to handle errors in routines; that have various return types: they always return null. With these basic helper functions, we can implement the first piece of; our grammar: numeric literals. Basic Expression Parsing; ========================. We start with numeric literals, because they are the simplest to; process. For each production in our grammar, we'll define a function; which parses that production.

This routine is very simple: it expects to be called when the current; token is a ``tok_number`` token. It takes the current number value,; creates a ``NumberExprAST`` node, advances the lexer to the next token,; and finally returns. There are some interesting aspects to this. The most important one is; that this routine eats all of the tokens that correspond to the; production and returns the lexer buffer with the next token (which is; not part of the grammar production) ready to go. This is a fairly; standard way to go for recursive descent parsers.

A single code object can contain code for kernels that have different wavefront; sizes. The vector registers and some scalar registers are based on the wavefront; size. AMDGPU defines distinct DWARF registers for each wavefront size. This; simplifies the consumer of the DWARF so that each register has a fixed size,; rather than being dynamic according to the wavefront size mode. Similarly,; distinct DWARF registers are defined for those registers that vary in size; according to the process address size. This allows a consumer to treat a; specific AMDGPU processor as a single architecture regardless of how it is; configured at run time. The compiler explicitly specifies the DWARF registers; that match the mode in which the code it is generating will be executed.

If `fLocalFrame` is false, `fLocalMaster` should contain an identity; matrix. This is set by default, and can be reset using the; **`TBuffer3D::SetLocalMasterIdentity()` method.**. #### Bounding Boxes.

After its creation, the; geometry manager class can be accessed with the global; `gGeoManager`:. ~~~{.cpp}; root[] new TGeoManager(""world"", ""the simplest geometry"");; ~~~. We want to create a single volume in our geometry, but since any volume; needs to have an associated medium, we will create a dummy one.

Usability," whole new generation of; C/C++/Objective C development tools, and we intend for it to be; production quality.; Being a production quality compiler means many things: it means being high; performance, being solid and (relatively) bug free, and it means eventually; being used and depended on by a broad range of people. While we are still in; the early development stages, we strongly believe that this will become a; reality. A simple and hackable code base. Our goal is to make it possible for anyone with a basic understanding; of compilers and working knowledge of the C/C++/ObjC languages to understand and; extend the clang source base. A large part of this falls out of our decision to; make the AST mirror the languages as closely as possible: you have your friendly; if statement, for statement, parenthesis expression, structs, unions, etc, all; represented in a simple and explicit way.; In addition to a simple design, we work to make the source base approachable; by commenting it well, including citations of the language standards where; appropriate, and designing the code for simplicity. Beyond that, clang offers; a set of AST dumpers, printers, and visualizers that make it easy to put code in; and see how it is represented. A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++,; and Objective C++. Clang is the ""C Language Family Front-end"", which means we intend to support; the most popular members of the C family. We are convinced that the right; parsing technology for this class of languages is a hand-built recursive-descent; parser. Because it is plain C++ code, recursive descent makes it very easy for; new developers to understand the code, it easily supports ad-hoc rules and other; strange hacks required by C/C++, and makes it straight-forward to implement; excellent diagnostics and error recovery.; We believe that implementing C/C++/ObjC in a single unified parser makes the; end result easier to maintain and evolve than maintaining a separate C and C++; parser which",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html:12424,simpl,simple,12424,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,2,['simpl'],"['simple', 'simplicity']"

Usability," with the gaussian pre-defined function; histo->Fit(""gaus"");; ```. In the following we will give some brief description of the minimization packages.; The packages all implement the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface which can be use for; finding the minimum of a multi-dimensional function.; The interface is documented in the Mathematical Library Chapter. In addition packages like Minuit or Minuit2 provide their own interfaces. ## MINUIT (Old TMInuit Version). This package was originally written in FORTRAN by Fred James and part; of `PACKLIB` (patch D506). It has been converted to a C++ class by; René Brun. The current implementation in C++ is a straightforward; conversion of the original FORTRAN version. The main changes are:. - The variables in the various `Minuit` labeled common blocks have; been changed to the **`TMinuit`** class data members. - The internal arrays with a maximum dimension depending on the; maximum number of parameters are now data members' arrays with a; dynamic dimension such that one can fit very large problems by; simply initializing the **`TMinuit`** constructor with the maximum; number of parameters. - The include file `Minuit.h` has been commented as much as possible; using existing comments in the code or the printed documentation. - The original `Minuit` subroutines are now member functions. - Constructors and destructor have been added. - Instead of passing the `FCN` function in the argument list, the; addresses of this function is stored as pointer in the data; members of the class. This is by far more elegant and flexible in; an interactive environment. The member function `SetFCN` can be; used to define this pointer. - The ROOT static function `Printf` is provided to replace all; format statements and to print on currently defined output file. - The functions `SetObjectFit/GetObjectFit` can be used inside the; `FCN` function to set/get a referenced object instead of using; global variables. - By default `fGraphicsMode` is true.

Support Diverse Clients. Clang is designed and built with many grand plans for how we can use it. The; driving force is the fact that we use C and C++ daily, and have to suffer due to; a lack of good tools available for it. We believe that the C and C++ tools; ecosystem has been significantly limited by how difficult it is to parse and; represent the source code for these languages, and we aim to rectify this; problem in clang.; The problem with this goal is that different clients have very different; requirements. Consider code generation, for example: a simple front-end that; parses for code generation must analyze the code for validity and emit code; in some intermediate form to pass off to a optimizer or backend. Because; validity analysis and code generation can largely be done on the fly, there is; not hard requirement that the front-end actually build up a full AST for all; the expressions and statements in the code. TCC and GCC are examples of; compilers that either build no real AST (in the former case) or build a stripped; down and simplified AST (in the later case) because they focus primarily on; codegen.; On the opposite side of the spectrum, some clients (like refactoring) want; highly detailed information about the original source code and want a complete; AST to describe it with. Refactoring wants to have information about macro; expansions, the location of every paren expression '(((x)))' vs 'x', full; position information, and much more. Further, refactoring wants to look; across the whole program to ensure that it is making transformations; that are safe.

Usability," written to disk, with the class. When; it writes an object to file, it also writes the description of the; current class version along with it. This description is implemented in; the `StreamerInfo `class. ### The TStreamerInfo Class. Each class has a list of `StreamerInfo` objects, one for each version of; the class if that version was written to disk at least once. When; reading an object from a file, the system uses the `StreamerInfo` list; to decode an object into the current version. The `StreamerInfo` is made; up of **`TStreamerElements`** . Each describes one persistent data; member of the class. By default, all data members of a class are; persistent. To exclude a data member (i.e. make it not persistent), add; a ""`!`"" after the comment marks. For example the pointer \*`fPainter` of; a **`TH1`** is not persistent:. ``` {.cpp}; TVirtualHistPainter* fPainter //!pointer to histogram painter; ```. ### The TStreamerElement Class. A **`TStreamerElement`** describes a data member of a simple type,; object, array, pointer, or container. The offset in the; **`TStreamerElement`** is the starting address of the data for that data; member. ``` {.cpp}; BASE TNamed offset= 0 type=67 The basis for a named object; BASE TAttLine offset= 28 type= 0 Line attributes; ```. In this example, the **`TNamed`** data starts at byte 0, and; **`TAttLine`** starts at byte 28. The offset is machine and compiler; dependent and is computed when the `StreamerInfo` is analyzed. The types; are defined in the file `TStreamerInfo.h` and listed here:. ``` {.cpp}; enum EReadWrite {; kBase=0, kChar=1,kShort=2,kInt=3,kLong=4,; kFloat=5, kCounter=6,kCharStar=7, kDouble=8,kUChar=11,; kUShort=12, kUInt=13,kULong=14,kBits=15,kOffsetL=20,; kOffsetP=40, kObject=61,kAny=62,kObjectp=63,kObjectP=64,; kTString=65, kTObject=66,kTNamed=67,kSkip=100,kSkipL=120,; kSkipP=140, kConv=200, kConvL=220,kConvP=240,kStreamer=500,; kStreamLoop=501, kMissing=99999; };; ```.

The GUI classes interface to the platform dependent low level graphics; system via the semi-abstract graphics base class **`TVirtualX`**.; Currently concrete implementations exist for X11 and Win32 (MacOS X is; fully supported via Apple's X11 implementation). Thanks to this single; graphics interface, porting the ROOT GUI to a new platform requires only; the implementation of **`TVirtualX`**. ![](pictures/02000201.jpg). ## A Simple Example. We will start with a simple example that builds a small application; containing a canvas and two buttons: Draw and Exit. Its functionality; will be very simple: every time you click on Draw button, the graphics; of the function `sin(x)/x` will be drawn in randomly chosen interval in; the canvas window, if you click on Exit - you close the application.; This example shows the basic concepts for almost any GUI-application in; ROOT and it is important to understand how it is constructed. The; example program is written as a named script. See ""Cling the C++; Interpreter"". Remember that the named script can be executed via. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .x example.C; ```. only if the filename (without extension) and the function entry point; are both the same. ![](pictures/02000202.jpg).

The old pythonization with the `__getattr__` syntax still works, but emits a deprecation warning and will be removed from ROOT 6.34. ### Removal of Python 2 support. ROOT does no longer support Python 2. The minimum Python version necessary to use ROOT in a Python application is 3.8.; As a consequence, any reference to Python 2 in ROOT code was removed and certain configuration options are no longer; usable, e.g. * `root-config --python2-version`; * cmake -Dpyroot-python2. The cmake build system now looks for the standard `Python3` package and previously custom Python-related cmake variables; are now just the ones automatically produced by cmake (see https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html). ### More usage of the public cppyy API.

At other times, even the first frame is actually a return address; (for example, backtraces collected at the time of an object allocation and; reported later when the allocated object is used or misused). When a system; supports in-thread trap handling, there may also be frames after the first; that represent a precise interrupted code location rather than a return; address, presented as the ""caller"" of a trap handler function (for example,; signal handlers in POSIX systems). Return address frames are identified by the ``:ra`` suffix. Precise code; location frames are identified by the ``:pc`` suffix. Traditional practice has often been to collect backtraces as simple address; lists, losing the distinction between return address code locations and; precise code locations. Some such code applies the ""subtract one"" adjustment; described above to the address values before reporting them, and it's not; always clear or consistent whether this adjustment has been applied or not.; These ambiguous cases are supported by the ``bt`` and ``pc`` forms with no; ``:ra`` or ``:pc`` suffix, which indicate it's unclear which sort of code; location this is. However, it's highly recommended that all emitters use the; suffixed forms and deliver address values with no adjustments applied. When; traditional practice has been ambiguous, the majority of cases seem to have; been of printing addresses that are return address code locations and printing; them without adjustment. So the symbolizing filter will usually apply the; ""subtract one byte"" adjustment to an address printed without a disambiguating; suffix. Assuming that a call instruction is longer than one byte on all; supported machines, applying the ""subtract one byte"" adjustment a second time; still results in an address somewhere in the call instruction, so a little; sloppiness here often does little or no harm.

For example:. .. code-block:: yaml. # a mapping; name: Tom; hat-size: 7. A sequence is a list of items where each item starts with a leading dash ('-').; For example:. .. code-block:: yaml. # a sequence; - x86; - x86_64; - PowerPC. You can combine mappings and sequences by indenting. For example a sequence; of mappings in which one of the mapping values is itself a sequence:. .. code-block:: yaml. # a sequence of mappings with one key's value being a sequence; - name: Tom; cpus:; - x86; - x86_64; - name: Bob; cpus:; - x86; - name: Dan; cpus:; - PowerPC; - x86. Sometime sequences are known to be short and the one entry per line is too; verbose, so YAML offers an alternate syntax for sequences called a ""Flow; Sequence"" in which you put comma separated sequence elements into square; brackets. The above example could then be simplified to :. .. code-block:: yaml. # a sequence of mappings with one key's value being a flow sequence; - name: Tom; cpus: [ x86, x86_64 ]; - name: Bob; cpus: [ x86 ]; - name: Dan; cpus: [ PowerPC, x86 ].

The use of indenting makes the YAML easy for a human to read and understand,; but having a program read and write YAML involves a lot of tedious details.; The YAML I/O library structures and simplifies reading and writing YAML; documents. YAML I/O assumes you have some ""native"" data structures which you want to be; able to dump as YAML and recreate from YAML. The first step is to try; writing example YAML for your data structures.

Here's the explicit lowering for the previous example for a non-relocating; collector:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 addrspace(1)* @test1(i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); gc ""statepoint-example"" {; call token (i64, i32, void ()*, i32, i32, ...)* @llvm.experimental.gc.statepoint.p0f_isVoidf(i64 0, i32 0, void ()* @foo, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); ret i8 addrspace(1)* %obj; }. Recording On Stack Regions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In addition to the explicit relocation form previously described, the; statepoint infrastructure also allows the listing of allocas within the gc; pointer list. Allocas can be listed with or without additional explicit gc; pointer values and relocations. An alloca in the gc region of the statepoint operand list will cause the; address of the stack region to be listed in the stackmap for the statepoint.

Usability,"# Automatic HTML Documentation; \index{documentation!class}. **`THtml`** is ROOT's documentation engine. It can be used to document; your classes in a reference guide, and to convert your text or source; files to HTML. ## Reference Guide. The Reference Guide for the ROOT classes at; <http://root.cern.ch/root/html/> has been generated by ROOT's; **`THtml`** class. Just as for ROOT's classes, it can generate (and; update) a reference guide for your classes, too. You document your; classes using source code comments. All comments will be automatically; put into a `<pre></pre>` environment to keep the indentation and line; length. You can write ""raw"" HTML by enclosing comments in the keywords; `Begin_Html` and `End_Html`. To generate documentation for the class **`TObject`** you could run the; following commands:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] THtml h; root[] h.SetInputDir(""$(ROOTSYS)"");; root[] h.MakeClass(""TObject"");; root[] h.CreateJavascript();; root[] h.CreateStylesheet();; ```. The comments following the first comment of the form; //\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, before any method, is; assumed to be the **class description**. As with any other documentation; part, it has to be a continuous block of comments. Any documented class will have an **class index entry** in the; `ClassIndex.html`, showing their name with a link to their documentation; page and a miniature description. This description for e.g. the class; `MyClass` has to be given in `MyClass's` header file as documentation. A **method description** block starts immediately after '`{`' and looks; like this:. ``` {.cpp}; void TWorld::HelloWorldFunc(string *text); {; // This is a documentation example of the function TWorld::HelloWorldFunc; helloWorld.Print(text);; }; ```. Like in a class description block, everything until the first; non-commented line is considered as a valid member function description; block. **Data members** are documented by putting a C++ comment behind their; declaration in the header ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/HTMLDoc.md:161,guid,guide,161,documentation/users-guide/HTMLDoc.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/HTMLDoc.md,4,"['Guid', 'guid']","['Guide', 'guide']"
Usability,"# C++ Modules in ROOT. Technology Overview. *Vassil Vassilev, Oksana Shadura, Yuka Takahashi and Raphael Isemann*. ## Overview. ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit; header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,; or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is; redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same; header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. The ROOT v6.16 release came with a preview of the module technology;; dedicated binaries have been built and can be reproduced by passing; `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` as configure flag. The goals of this technology are:; * Gain feedback from early adoption -- the technology is being long anticipated; by some of the users of ROOT. It improves correctness of ROOT and improves; performance when carefully adopted.; * Study performance bottlenecks -- the feature is designed with performance; considerations in mind. In this document we describe the current performance; bottlenecks and trade-offs.; * Understand if the gradual migration policy is sufficient -- C++ Modules in; ROOT support gradual migration. In particular, ROOT can enable C++ Modules for; itself and still run in legacy mode for the third-party code (generating; rootmap files and other scaffolding). C++ Modules are here and we would like to give a brief introduction of how the; feature works, what are its pros and cons, what's the current state of the; implementation and how third-party code can use it. Read more [[1]]. C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX). ## Design Goals. * Coherence with standard C++ -- C++ Modules TS is advancing and will be; likely part the upcoming C++20 standard;; * Performance -- provide performance that is competitive to ROOT with PCH and; advance further the implementation of the C++ Modules in clang to optimize; memory footprint and execution time;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:743,feedback,feedback,743,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['feedback'],['feedback']
Usability,"# Concluding Remarks #. This is the end of our guided tour for beginners through ROOT. There is; still a lot coming to mind to be said, but by now you are experienced; enough to use the ROOT documentation, most importantly the **[ROOT home; page](http://root.cern.ch)** and the **[ROOT reference; guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/)** with the; documentation of all ROOT classes, or the **[ROOT users; manual](https://root.cern/manual/)**. A very useful way for you to continue exploring ROOT is to study the; examples in the sub-directory `tutorials/` of any ROOT installation. There are some powerful features of ROOT which were not treated in this; document, e.g. packages named RooFit and RooStats providing an advanced; framework for model building, fitting and statistical analysis. The ROOT; namespace `TMVA` offers multi-variate analysis tools including an artificial; neural network and many other advanced tools for classification; problems. The remarkable ability of ROOT to handle large data volumes; was already mentioned in this guide, implemented through the class; `TTree`. But there is still much more for you to explore!. **End of this guide ... but hopefully not of your interaction with ROOT !**; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/concludingRemarks.md:47,guid,guided,47,documentation/primer/concludingRemarks.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/concludingRemarks.md,4,['guid'],"['guide', 'guided']"

Usability,"# Discourse Migration Guide . ## Current Status of Migration: Discourse is back online at a new URL: [https://discourse.llvm.org](https://discourse.llvm.org). The old one still works as well. We are aware of an issue with reply by email to emails from before the merge. We will update once we know more. This document is intended to help LLVM users to migrate from the mailing lists to; Discourse. Discourse has two basic ways for interaction: Via the [web; UI](https://llvm.discourse.group/) and via emails. ## Setting up your account. The easiest way is to create an account using your GitHub account:. 1. Navigate to https://llvm.discourse.group/; 1. Click on ""Sign Up"" in the top right corner.; 1. Choose ""With GitHub"" on the right side and log in with your GitHub account. ## Structure of Discourse. Discourse's structure is similar to a set of mailing lists, however different; terms are used there. To help with the transition, here's a translation table; for the terms:. <table border=1>; <tr><th>Mailing list</th><th>Discourse</th></tr>; <tr><td><i>Mailing list</i>, consists of threads</td><td><i>category</i>, consists of topics</td></tr>; <tr><td><i>thread</i>, consists of emails</td><td><i>topic</i>, consists of posts</td></tr>; <tr><td>email</td><td>post</td></tr>; </table>. ## Setting up email interactions.

Usability,"# File I/O and Parallel Analysis #. ## Storing ROOT Objects ##. ROOT offers the possibility to write instances of classes on; disk, into a *ROOT-file* (see the `TFile` class for more details).; One says that the object is made ""persistent"" by storing; it on disk. When reading the file back, the object is reconstructed; in memory. The requirement to be satisfied to perform I/O of instances; of a certain class is that the ROOT type system is aware of the layout; in memory of that class.; This topic is beyond the scope of this document: it is worth to mention; that I/O can be performed out of the box for the almost complete set; of ROOT classes. We can explore this functionality with histograms and two simple macros. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/write_to_file.C; ```. Not bad, eh ? Especially for a language that does not foresees; persistency natively like C++. The *RECREATE* option forces ROOT to; create a new file even if a file with the same name exists on disk. Now, you may use the Cling command line to access information in the file; and draw the previously written histogram:. ``` {.cpp}; > root my_rootfile.root; root [0]; Attaching file my_rootfile.root as _file0...; root [1] _file0->ls(); TFile** my_rootfile.root; TFile* my_rootfile.root; KEY: TH1F	my_histogram;1 My Title; root [2] my_histogram->Draw(); ```; \newpage; Alternatively, you can use a simple macro to carry out the job:. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/read_from_file.C; ```. ## N-tuples in ROOT ##. ### Storing simple N-tuples ###. Up to now we have seen how to manipulate input read from ASCII files.; ROOT offers the possibility to do much better than that, with its own; n-tuple classes. Among the many advantages provided by these classes one; could cite. - Optimised disk I/O. - Possibility to store many n-tuple rows. - Write the n-tuples in ROOT files. - Interactive inspection with `TBrowser`. - Store not only numbers, but also *objects* in the columns.

Usability,"# Getting Started. We begin by showing you how to use ROOT interactively. There are two; examples to click through and learn how to use the GUI. We continue by; using the command line, and explaining the coding conventions, global; variables and the environment setup. If you have not installed ROOT,; you can do so by following the instructions in the appendix, or on the; ROOT web site: <http://root.cern.ch/root/Availability.html>. ## Setting the Environment Variables. Before you can run ROOT you need to set the environment variable; `ROOTSYS` and change your path to include `root/bin` and library path; variables to include `root/lib`. Please note: the syntax is for; `bash`, if you are running `tcsh` you will have to use `setenv`; instead of `export`. 1. Define the variable \$ROOTSYS to the directory where you unpacked; the ROOT:. ```; $ export ROOTSYS=$HOME/root; ```. 2. Add ROOTSYS/bin to your PATH:. ```; $ export PATH=$PATH:$ROOTSYS/bin; ```. 3. Setting the Library Path. On HP-UX, before executing the interactive module, you must set the; library path:. ```; $ export SHLIB_PATH=$SHLIB_PATH:$ROOTSYS/lib; ```. On AIX, before executing the interactive module, you must set the; library path:. ```; $ [ -z ""$LIBPATH"" ] && export LIBPATH=/lib:/usr/lib; $ export LIBPATH=$LIBPATH:$ROOTSYS/lib; ```. On Linux, Solaris, Alpha OSF and SGI, before executing the interactive; module, you must set the library path:. ```; $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ROOTSYS/lib; ```.

Usability,"# Graphs #. In this Chapter we will learn how to exploit some of the functionalities; ROOT provides to display data exploiting the class `TGraphErrors`,; which you already got to know previously. ## Read Graph Points from File ##. The fastest way in which you can fill a graph with experimental data is; to use the constructor which reads data points and their errors from an; ASCII file (i.e. standard text) format:. ``` {.cpp}; TGraphErrors(const char *filename,; const char *format=""%lg %lg %lg %lg"", Option_t *option="""");; ```. The format string can be:. - `""%lg %lg""` read only 2 first columns into X,Y. - `""%lg %lg %lg""` read only 3 first columns into X,Y and EY. - `""%lg %lg %lg %lg""` read only 4 first columns into X,Y,EX,EY. This approach has the nice feature of allowing the user to reuse the; macro for many different data sets. Here is an example of an input file.; The nice graphic result shown is produced by the macro below, which; reads two such input files and uses different options to display the; data points. ```; # Measurement of Friday 26 March; # Experiment 2 Physics Lab. 1 6 5; 2 12 5; 3 14 4.7; 4 20 4.5; 5 22 4.2; 6 24 5.1; 7 35 2.9; 8 45 4.1; 9 44 4.8; 10 53 5.43; ```; \newpage; ![](figures/graph_with_expectation.png). ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro2.C; ```. In addition to the inspection of the plot, you can check the actual; contents of the graph with the `TGraph::Print()` method at any time,; obtaining a printout of the coordinates of data points on screen. The; macro also shows us how to print a coloured band around a graph instead; of error bars, quite useful for example to represent the errors of a; theoretical prediction. ## Polar Graphs ##. With ROOT you can profit from rather advanced plotting routines, like; the ones implemented in the `TPolarGraph`, a class to draw graphs in; polar coordinates. You can see the example macro in the following and the; resulting Figure is [4.2](#f42):. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/graphs.md:36,learn,learn,36,documentation/primer/graphs.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/graphs.md,1,['learn'],['learn']

Usability,"# Motivation and Introduction #. ***Welcome to data analysis!***. Comparison of measurements to theoretical models is one of the standard; tasks in experimental physics. In the most simple case, a ""model"" is; just a function providing predictions of measured data. Very often, the; model depends on parameters. Such a model may simply state ""the current; *I* is proportional to the voltage *U*"", and the task of the; experimentalist consists of determining the resistance, *R*, from a set; of measurements. As a first step, a visualisation of the data is needed. Next, some; manipulations typically have to be applied, e.g. corrections or; parameter transformations. Quite often, these manipulations are complex; ones, and a powerful library of mathematical functions and procedures; should be provided - think for example of an integral or peak-search or; a Fourier transformation applied to an input spectrum to obtain the; actual measurement described by the model. One specialty of experimental physics are the inevitable uncertainties; affecting each measurement, and visualisation tools have to include; these. In subsequent analysis, the statistical nature of the errors must; be handled properly. As the last step, measurements are compared to models, and free model; parameters need to be determined in this process. See Figure [1.1](#f11) for an; example of a function (model) fit to data points. Several standard methods are; available, and a data analysis tool should provide easy access to more; than one of them. Means to quantify the level of agreement between; measurements and model must also be available.; <!--; [f11]: figures/examplefit.png ""f11""; <a name=""f11""></a>. ![Measured data points with error bars and fitted quadratic; function.\label{f11}][f11]-->.

Usability,"# Networking. In this chapter, you will learn how to send data over the network using; the ROOT socket classes. ## Setting-up a Connection. *On the serverside*, we create a **`TServerSocket`** to wait for a; connection request over the network. If the request is accepted, it; returns a full-duplex socket. Once the connection is accepted, we can; communicate to the client that we are ready to go by sending the string; ""go"", and we can close the server socket. ``` {.cpp}; { // server; TServerSocket *ss = new TServerSocket(9090,kTRUE);; TSocket *socket = ss->Accept();; socket->Send(""go"");; ss->Close();; }; ```. *On the clientside*, we create a socket and ask the socket to receive; input. ``` {.cpp}; { // client; TSocket *socket = new TSocket(""localhost"",9090);; Char str[32];; socket->Recv(str,32);; }; ```. ## Sending Objects over the Network. We have just established a connection and you just saw how to send and; receive a string with the example ""go"". Now let's send a histogram. *To send an object (in our case on the client side*) it has to derive; from **`TObject`** class because it uses the `Streamers` to fill a; buffer that is then sent over the connection. On the receiving side, the; `Streamers` are used to read the object from the message sent via the; socket. For network communication, we have a specialized **`TBuffer`**,; a descendant of **`TBuffer`** called **`TMessage`**. In the following; example, we create a **`TMessage`** with the intention to store an; object, hence the constant `kMESS_OBJECT` in the constructor. We create; and fill the histogram and write it into the message. Then we call; **`TSocket`**`::Send` to send the message with the histogram. ``` {.cpp}; ...; // create an object to be sent; TH1F *hpx = new TH1F(""hpx"",""px distribution"",100,-4,4);; hpx->FillRandom(""gaus"",1000);. // create a TMessage to send the object; TMessage message(kMESS_OBJECT);. // write the histogram into the message buffer; message.WriteObject(hpx);. // send the message; soc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Networking.md:40,learn,learn,40,documentation/users-guide/Networking.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Networking.md,1,['learn'],['learn']

Usability,"# Preface {.unnumbered}. In late 1994, we decided to learn; and investigate Object Oriented programming and C++ to better judge; the suitability of these relatively new techniques for scientific; programming. We knew that there is no better way to learn a new; programming environment than to use it to write a program that can; solve a real problem. After a few weeks, we had our first; histogramming package in C++. A few weeks later we had a rewrite of; the same package using the, at that time, very new template features; of C++. Again, a few weeks later we had another rewrite of the package; without templates since we could only compile the version with; templates on one single platform using a specific compiler. Finally,; after about four months we had a histogramming package that was faster; and more efficient than the well-known FORTRAN based HBOOK; histogramming package. This gave us enough confidence in the new; technologies to decide to continue the development. Thus was born; ROOT. Since its first public release at the end of 1995, ROOT has; enjoyed an ever-increasing popularity. Currently it is being used in; all major High Energy and Nuclear Physics laboratories around the; world to monitor, to store and to analyse data. In the other sciences; as well as the medical and financial industries, many people are using; ROOT. We estimate the current user base to be around several thousand; people. In 1997, Eric Raymond analysed in his paper ""The Cathedral and; the Bazaar"" the development method that makes Linux such a success.; The essence of that method is: ""release early, release often and; listen to your customers"". This is precisely how ROOT is being; developed. Over the last five years, many of our ""customers"" became; co-developers. Here we would like to thank our main co-developers and; contributors:. **Masaharu Goto** wrote the C++ interpreter CINT that was an; essential part of ROOT before ROOT 6.

Usability,"# ROOT Basics #. Now that you have installed ROOT, what's this interactive shell thing; you're running ? It's like this: ROOT leads a double life. It has an; interpreter for macros (Cling [@Cling]) that you can run from the command; line or run like applications. But it is also an interactive shell that; can evaluate arbitrary statements and expressions. This is extremely; useful for debugging, quick hacking and testing. Let us first have a; look at some very simple examples. ## ROOT as calculator ##. You can even use the ROOT interactive shell in lieu of a calculator!; Launch the ROOT interactive shell with the command. ``` {.cpp}; > root; ```. on your Linux box. The prompt should appear shortly:. ``` {.cpp}; root [0]; ```. and let's dive in with the steps shown here:. ``` {.cpp}; root [0] 1+1; (int) 2; root [1] 2*(4+2)/12.; (double) 1.000000; root [2] sqrt(3.); (double) 1.732051; root [3] 1 > 2; (bool) false; root [4] TMath::Pi(); (double) 3.141593; root [5] TMath::Erf(.2); (double) 0.222703; ```. Not bad. You can see that ROOT offers you the possibility not only to; type in `C++` statements, but also advanced mathematical functions,; which live in the `TMath` namespace. Now let's do something more elaborated. A numerical example with the; well known geometrical series:. ``` {.cpp}; root [6] double x=.5; (double) 0.500000; root [7] int N=30; (int) 30; root [8] double geom_series=0; (double) 0.000000; root [9] for (int i=0;i<N;++i)geom_series+=TMath::Power(x,i); root [10] cout << TMath::Abs(geom_series - (1-TMath::Power(x,N-1))/(1-x)) <<endl;; 1.86265e-09; ```. Here we made a step forward. We even declared variables and used a *for*; control structure. Note that there are some subtle differences between; Cling and the standard `C++` language. You do not need the "";"" at the end; of line in interactive mode -- try the difference e.g. using the command; at line `root [6]`. ## Learn C++ at the ROOT prompt ##; Behind the ROOT prompt there is an interpreter based on a rea",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md:464,simpl,simple,464,documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability,"# ROOT Macros #. You know how other books go on and on about programming fundamentals and; finally work up to building a complete, working program ? Let's skip all; that. In this guide, we will describe macros executed by the ROOT C++; interpreter Cling. It is relatively easy to compile a macro, either as a pre-compiled; library to load into ROOT, or as a stand-alone application, by adding; some include statements for header file or some ""dressing code"" to any; macro. ## General Remarks on ROOT macros ##. If you have a number of lines which you were able to execute at the ROOT; prompt, they can be turned into a ROOT macro by giving them a name which; corresponds to the file name without extension. The general structure; for a macro stored in file `MacroName.C` is. ``` {.cpp}; void MacroName() {; < ...; your lines of C++ code; ... >; }; ```. The macro is executed by typing. ``` {.cpp}; > root MacroName.C; ```. at the system prompt, or executed using `.x`. ``` {.cpp}; > root; root [0] .x MacroName.C; ```. at the ROOT prompt. or it can be loaded into a ROOT session and then; be executed by typing. ``` {.cpp}; root [0].L MacroName.C; root [1] MacroName();; ```. at the ROOT prompt. Note that more than one macro can be loaded this; way, as each macro has a unique name in the ROOT name space. A small set; of options can help making your plot nicer. ``` {.cpp}; gROOT->SetStyle(""Plain""); // set plain TStyle; gStyle->SetOptStat(111111); // draw statistics on plots,; // (0) for no output; gStyle->SetOptFit(1111); // draw fit results on plot,; // (0) for no ouput; gStyle->SetPalette(57); // set color map; gStyle->SetOptTitle(0); // suppress title box; ...; ```. Next, you should create a canvas for graphical output, with size,; subdivisions and format suitable to your needs, see documentation of; class `TCanvas`:. ``` {.cpp}; TCanvas c1(""c1"",""<Title>"",0,0,400,300); // create a canvas, specify position and size in pixels; c1.Divide(2,2); //set subdivisions, called pads; c1.cd(1); ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md:179,guid,guide,179,documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md,1,['guid'],['guide']
Usability,"# ROOT in Python #. ROOT offers the possibility to interface to Python via a set of bindings called; PyROOT.; Python is used in a wide variety of application areas and one of the most used; scripting languages today.; With the help of PyROOT it becomes possible to combine the power of a scripting; language with ROOT tools. Introductory material to Python is available from many; sources on the web, see e. g. http://docs.python.org. ## PyROOT ##. The access to ROOT classes and their methods in PyROOT is almost identical to C++; macros, except for the special language features of Python, most importantly dynamic; type declaration at the time of assignment. Coming back to our first example, simply; plotting a function in ROOT, the following C++ code:. ``` {.cpp}; TF1 *f1 = new TF1(""f2"",""[0]*sin([1]*x)/x"",0.,10.);; f1->SetParameter(0,1);; f1->SetParameter(1,1);; f1->Draw();; ```. in Python becomes:. ``` {.python}; import ROOT; f1 = ROOT.TF1(""f2"",""[0]*sin([1]*x)/x"",0.,10.); f1.SetParameter(0,1);; f1.SetParameter(1,1);; f1.Draw();; ```. A slightly more advanced example hands over data defined in the macro to the ROOT; class `TGraphErrors`. Note that a Python array can be used to pass data between; Python and ROOT. The first line in the Python script allows it to be executed; directly from the operating system, without the need to start the script from; python or the highly recommended powerful interactive shell ipython. The last line; in the python script is there to allow you to have a look at the graphical output; in the ROOT canvas before it disappears upon termination of the script. Here is the C++ version:. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/TGraphFit.C; ```. In Python it looks like this:. ``` {.python}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/TGraphFit.py; ```. Comparing the C++ and Python versions in these two examples, it now should be; clear how easy it is to convert any ROOT Macro in C++ to a Python version.

Usability,"# Trees. ## Why Should You Use a Tree?. In the ""Input/Output"" chapter, we saw how objects can be saved in ROOT; files. In case you want to store large quantities of same-class objects,; ROOT has designed the **`TTree`** and **`TNtuple`** classes specifically; for that purpose. The **`TTree`** class is optimized to reduce disk; space and enhance access speed. A **`TNtuple`** is a **`TTree`** that is; limited to only hold floating-point numbers; a **`TTree`** on the other; hand can hold all kind of data, such as objects or arrays in addition to; all the simple types. When using a **`TTree`**, we fill its branch buffers with leaf data and; the buffers are written to disk when it is full. Branches, buffers, and; leafs, are explained a little later in this chapter, but for now, it is; important to realize that each object is not written individually, but; rather collected and written a bunch at a time. This is where the **`TTree`** takes advantage of compression and will; produce a much smaller file than if the objects were written; individually. Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the; **`TTree`** contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects; can be compressed. The **`TTree`** reduces the header of each object, but it still contains; the class name. Using compression, the class name of each same-class; object has a good chance of being compressed, since the compression; algorithm recognizes the bit pattern representing the class name. Using; a **`TTree`** and compression the header is reduced to about 4 bytes; compared to the original 60 bytes. However, if compression is turned; off, you will not see these large savings. The **`TTree`** is also used to optimize the data access. A tree uses a; hierarchy of branches, and each branch can be read independently from; any other branch. Now, assume that `Px` and `Py` are data members of the; event, and we would like to compute `Px2 + Py2` for every event; and histogram the result.

Usability,"# Writing a TableGen Backend in Python. This tutorial is going to walk through creating a TableGen backend using Python. We are using Python to better fit into a notebook, but backends in LLVM are written in C++. The principles you learn here will still apply and you could port this tutorial to any language that has a JSON parser. This is the process in LLVM, using a C++ backend:; ```; TableGen source -> llvm-tblgen -> backend (within llvm-tblgen) -> results; ```; This is what we will be doing:; ```; TableGen source -> llvm-tblgen -> JSON -> Python -> results; ```. The backend here is ported from one of several in ""SQLGen"" which was written by Min-Yih Hsu.; * SQLGen C++ sources - https://github.com/mshockwave/SQLGen; * LLVM dev presentation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP-LBRbvI_U. I encourage you to use those resources to supplement this notebook. ## Compiling TableGen. Unlike the other tutorial notebooks we are not using the TableGen kernel. This is an iPython notebook and we're going to run `llvm-tblgen` as a subprocess. First let's find it, in the same way the TableGen kernel does. ```python; import os; import shutil. def find_tblgen():; path = os.environ.get(""LLVM_TBLGEN_EXECUTABLE""); if path is not None and os.path.isfile(path) and os.access(path, os.X_OK):; return path; else:; path = shutil.which(""llvm-tblgen""); if path is None:; raise OSError(""llvm-tblgen not found""); return path; ; _ = find_tblgen(); ```. If the above cell raises an exception, either put `llvm-tblgen` on your `PATH` or point to it using the `LLVM_TBLGEN_EXECUTABLE` environment variable. Alternatively, edit the code to use whatever path you want. Then we need to compile some TableGen by passing it to `llvm-tblgen`'s stdin. We will be using the option `--dump-json` and returning the JSON as a Python dictionary if the compilation succeeds. If it fails, we raise an exception. ```python; import subprocess; import tempfile; import json. def run_tblgen(src):; # Passing to stdin requires a file",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/utils/TableGen/jupyter/sql_query_backend.md:232,learn,learn,232,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/utils/TableGen/jupyter/sql_query_backend.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/utils/TableGen/jupyter/sql_query_backend.md,1,['learn'],['learn']

If you call `TTree::SetBranchAddress` with NumPy array or `array.array` inputs, ROOT will now check if the array type matches with the column type.; If it doesn't, `SetBranchAddress()` will return a negative status code and print an error.; Take for example this code snippet:; ```python; arr = array.array(typecode, ""d""); status = t.SetBranchAddress(""name"", arr); print(""Status = %s"" % (status, )); ```; If the branch type is also `double` (like the type of the array indicated by `""d""`), the call to `SetBranchAddress()` would succeed with status code zero.; If the type doesn't match, you now get a clear error instead of garbage values.; ```txt; Error in <TTree::SetBranchAddress>: The pointer type given ""Double_t"" (8) does not correspond to the type needed ""Float_t"" (5) by the branch: a; Status = -2; ```. ### Deprecation of `TPython::Eval()`. The `TPython::Eval()` method is deprecated and scheduled for removal in ROOT 6.36.; Its implementation was fragile, and the same functionality can be achieved with `TPython::Exec()`, using a C++ variable that is known to the ROOT interpreter for crossing over from Python to C++. Example:; ```c++; // Before, with TPython::Eval(); std::string stringVal = static_cast<const char*>(TPython::Eval(""'done'""));; std::cout << stringVal << std::endl;. // Now, with TPython::Exec(). You can set `_anyresult` to whatever std::any you want.; // It will be swapped into the return variable in the end. std::any result;; TPython::Exec(""_anyresult = ROOT.std.make_any['std::string']('done')"", &result);; std::cout << std::any_cast<std::string>(result) << std::endl;; ```. ## Language Bindings. ## JavaScript ROOT. ## Tutorials. ## Class Reference Guide. ## Build, Configuration and Testing Infrastructure.

TTreeReader checks whether the type that you expect can be extracted from the tree's branch and will clearly complain if not.; It reads on demand: only data that are actually needed are read, there is no need for `SetBranchStatus()`, `SetBranchAddress()`, `LoadTree()` or anything alike.; It uses the memory management of TTree, removing possible double deletions or memory leaks and relieveing you from the need to manage the memory yourself.; It turns on the tree cache, accelerating the reading of data.; It has been extensively tested on all known types of TTree branches and is thus a generic, fits-all access method for data stored in TTrees. ### TTreePlayer. - The TEntryList for ||-Coord plot was not defined correctly.

Usability,"'s AST files are loaded ""lazily"" from disk. When an AST file is initially; loaded, Clang reads only a small amount of data from the AST file to establish; where certain important data structures are stored. The amount of data read in; this initial load is independent of the size of the AST file, such that a; larger AST file does not lead to longer AST load times. The actual header data; in the AST file --- macros, functions, variables, types, etc. --- is loaded; only when it is referenced from the user's code, at which point only that; entity (and those entities it depends on) are deserialized from the AST file.; With this approach, the cost of using an AST file for a translation unit is; proportional to the amount of code actually used from the AST file, rather than; being proportional to the size of the AST file itself. When given the `-print-stats` option, Clang produces statistics; describing how much of the AST file was actually loaded from disk. For a; simple ""Hello, World!"" program that includes the Apple ``Cocoa.h`` header; (which is built as a precompiled header), this option illustrates how little of; the actual precompiled header is required:. .. code-block:: none. *** AST File Statistics:; 895/39981 source location entries read (2.238563%); 19/15315 types read (0.124061%); 20/82685 declarations read (0.024188%); 154/58070 identifiers read (0.265197%); 0/7260 selectors read (0.000000%); 0/30842 statements read (0.000000%); 4/8400 macros read (0.047619%); 1/4995 lexical declcontexts read (0.020020%); 0/4413 visible declcontexts read (0.000000%); 0/7230 method pool entries read (0.000000%); 0 method pool misses.

Make sure the file `ExampleData.txt` is available in the directory from; which you started ROOT. Inspect this file now with your favourite; editor, or use the command `less ExampleData.txt` to inspect the file,; you will see that the format is very simple and easy to understand.; Lines beginning with `#` are ignored. It is very convenient to add some; comments about the type of data. The data itself consist of lines with; four real numbers each, representing the x- and y- coordinates and their; errors of each data point. The argument of the method `Draw(""AP"")` is important here. Behind the scenes,; it tells the `TGraphPainter` class to show the axes and to plot markers at the; *x* and *y* positions of the specified data points. Note that this simple; example relies on the default settings of ROOT, concerning the size of; the canvas holding the plot, the marker type and the line colours and; thickness used and so on. In a well-written, complete example, all this; would need to be specified explicitly in order to obtain nice and well; readable results. A full chapter on graphs will explain many; more of the features of the class `TGraphErrors` and its relation to; other ROOT classes in much more detail. ## Histograms in ROOT ##. Frequency distributions in ROOT are handled by a set of classes derived; from the histogram class `TH1`, in our case `TH1F`. The letter `F`; stands for ""float"", meaning that the data type `float` is used to store; the entries in one histogram bin. ``` {.cpp}; root [0] TF1 efunc(""efunc"",""exp([0]+[1]*x)"",0.,5.);; root [1] efunc.SetParameter(0,1);; root [2] efunc.SetParameter(1,-1);; root [3] TH1F h(""h"",""example histogram"",100,0.,5.);; root [4] for (int i=0;i<1000;i++) {h.Fill(efunc.GetRandom());}; root [5] h.Draw();; ```.

Usability,"()` before use. Refer back to the other; example of the use of **`TPython`** that was given in ""Access to Python; from ROOT"". To show in detail how Python access can be used, an example Python; module is needed, as follows:. ``` {.cpp}; print('creating class MyPyClass ... '); class MyPyClass:; def __init__(self):; print('in MyPyClass.__init__'); self._browser = None; def gime(self, what):; return what; ```. This module can now be loaded into a Cling session, the class used to; instantiate objects, and their member functions called for showing how; different types can cross:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TPython::LoadMacro(""MyPyClass.py"");; creating class MyPyClass ...; root[] MyPyClass m;; in MyPyClass.__init__; root[] char* s = m.gime(""aap"");; root[] s; (char* 0x41ee7754)""aap""; ```. Note that the `LoadMacro()` call makes the class automatically; available, such that it can be used directly. Otherwise, a; `gROOT->GetClass()` call is required first. #### Callbacks. The simplest way of setting a callback to Python from Cling, e.g. for a; button, is by providing the execution string. See for example; `tutorials/pyroot/demo.py` that comes with the ROOT installation:. ``` {.cpp}; # [..]; bar = ROOT.TControlBar('vertical','Demos'); bar.AddButton('Help on Demos',r'TPython::Exec(""execfile('demoshelp.py')"");','Click Here For Help on Running the Demos'); bar.AddButton('browser',r'TPython::Exec(""b = Tbrowser()"");','Start the ROOT browser'); # [..]; ```. Here, the callback is a string that will be interpreted by Cling to call; `TPython::Exec()`, which will, in turn, interpret and execute the string; given to it. Note the use of raw strings (the '`r`' in front of the; second argument string), in order to remove the need of escaping the; backslashes. #### Cling Commands. In interactive mode, the Python exception hook is used to mimic some of; the Cling commands available. These are: `.q`, **`.!`**, **`.x`**,; **`.L`**, **`.cd`**, **`.ls`**, **`.pwd`**, **`.?`** and **`.help`**.; Note that ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:18364,simpl,simplest,18364,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['simpl'],['simplest']

In this case, the coroutine frame would include a suspend index that will; indicate at which suspend point the coroutine needs to resume. .. code-block:: llvm. %f.frame = type { ptr, ptr, i32, i32 }. The resume function will use an index to jump to an appropriate basic block and will look; as follows:. .. code-block:: llvm. define internal fastcc void @f.Resume(ptr %FramePtr) {; entry.Resume:; %index.addr = getelementptr inbounds %f.Frame, ptr %FramePtr, i64 0, i32 2; %index = load i8, ptr %index.addr, align 1; %switch = icmp eq i8 %index, 0; %n.addr = getelementptr inbounds %f.Frame, ptr %FramePtr, i64 0, i32 3; %n = load i32, ptr %n.addr, align 4. br i1 %switch, label %loop.resume, label %loop. loop.resume:; %sub = sub nsw i32 0, %n; call void @print(i32 %sub); br label %suspend; loop:; %inc = add nsw i32 %n, 1; store i32 %inc, ptr %n.addr, align 4; tail call void @print(i32 %inc); br label %suspend. suspend:; %storemerge = phi i8 [ 0, %loop ], [ 1, %loop.resume ]; store i8 %storemerge, ptr %index.addr, align 1; ret void; }.

Here is an example of how to set the log; scale for the x-axis on a canvas with four sub-pads:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCanvas MyCanvas(""MyCanvas"",""My Canvas""); root[] MyCanvas->Divide(2,2); root[] MyCanvas->cd(1); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(2); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); root[] MyCanvas->cd(3); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); ```. ### WaitPrimitive method. When the `TPad::WaitPrimitive()` method is called with no arguments, it; will wait until a double click or any key pressed is executed in the; canvas. A call to `gSystem->Sleep(10)` has been added in the loop to; avoid consuming at all the CPU. This new option is convenient when; executing a macro. By adding statements like:. ``` {.cpp}; canvas->WaitPrimitive();; ```. You can monitor the progress of a running macro, stop it at convenient; places with the possibility to interact with the canvas and resume the; execution with a double click or a key press. ### Locking the Pad. You can make the **`TPad`** non-editable. Then no new objects can be; added, and the existing objects and the pad can not be changed with the; mouse or programmatically. By default the **`TPad`** is editable. ``` {.cpp}; TPad::SetEditable(kFALSE); ```. ## Graphical Objects. In this paragraph, we describe the various simple 2D graphical objects; defined in ROOT. Usually, one defines these objects with their; constructor and draws them with their `Draw()` method. Therefore, the; examples will be very brief. Most graphical objects have line and fill; attributes (color, width) that will be described in ""Graphical objects; attributes"".

This pass performs loop invariant code motion, attempting to remove as much; code from the body of a loop as possible. It does this by either hoisting code; into the preheader block, or by sinking code to the exit blocks if it is safe.; This pass also promotes must-aliased memory locations in the loop to live in; registers, thus hoisting and sinking ""invariant"" loads and stores. Hoisting operations out of loops is a canonicalization transform. It enables; and simplifies subsequent optimizations in the middle-end. Rematerialization; of hoisted instructions to reduce register pressure is the responsibility of; the back-end, which has more accurate information about register pressure and; also handles other optimizations than LICM that increase live-ranges. This pass uses alias analysis for two purposes:. #. Moving loop invariant loads and calls out of loops. If we can determine; that a load or call inside of a loop never aliases anything stored to, we; can hoist it or sink it like any other instruction. #. Scalar Promotion of Memory. If there is a store instruction inside of the; loop, we try to move the store to happen AFTER the loop instead of inside of; the loop. This can only happen if a few conditions are true:. #.

Workspace and factory improvements. The workspace class RooWorkspace has been augmented with several; new features. The import() method now supports a new argument RenameAllVariablesExcept(const char* suffix, const char keepList) which; will rename all variables of the imported function by extended them with a supplied suffix,; except for a given list of variables, which are not renamed.; A new utility function importFromFile() has been added, which is similar to import, except that it take a string; specifier for the object to be imported rather than a reference. The string is expected to be of the form ; fileName:workspaceName:objectName and simplifies import of objects from other workspaces on file. The importFromFile; accepts all arguments accepted by the standard import() method.; Generic objects (inheriting from TObject) can now also be stored in the workspace under an alias name, rather; under their own name, which simplifies management of objects of types like TMatrixD that do not have a settable name. ws.import(matrix,""cov_matrix"") ;. New accessors have been added that return a RooArgSet of all elements of the workspace of a given type, e.g.; allVars(), allPdfs().

While named sets merely group objects logically, methods loadSnapshot and; saveSnapshot allow to make copies of the values, errors and 'constant' status of; sets of variable objects that live in the workspace. A newly added tutorial macro rf510_namedsets.C illustrates the functionality of both; of these features.; Improved printing of contents -- Many operator p.d.f. and function components now show; a more intuitive natural representation of their contents (these changes are mostly in the; respective p.d.f.s, but are most relevant in the context of a workspace). New object factory interface to workspace to facilitate script driven model definition; A object factory has been added to RooFit to simplify the process of creating p.d.f.; and function expressions consisting of multiple objects. The factory has two goals:; the first is to provide a back-end for higher level factories and tools to process; the creation of objects. The second is to provide a simple end-user language to; populate a RooWorkspace with function and p.d.f. objects. For the latter purpose the object creation language is executed through the factory() method; of a workspace object. RooWorkspace w(""w"") ;; RooAbsArg* arg = w.factory(""expression_goes_here"") ;. Basic Syntax; The rules at its simplest level are as follows. Expressions with square brackets create variables (discrete and continuous).

In the following example, ``__counted_by(count)``; annotation expresses the bounds of parameter p using another parameter count.; This model works naturally with many C interfaces and structs because the bounds; of a pointer is often available adjacent to the pointer itself, e.g., at another; parameter of the same function prototype, or at another field of the same struct; declaration. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; // off-by-one error; for (size_t i = 0; i <= count; ++i); p[i] = i;; }. External bounds annotations include ``__counted_by``, ``__sized_by``, and; ``__ended_by``. These annotations do not change the pointer representation,; meaning they do not have ABI implications. * ``__counted_by(N)`` : The pointer points to memory that contains ``N``; elements of pointee type. ``N`` is an expression of integer type which can be; a simple reference to declaration, a constant including calls to constant; functions, or an arithmetic expression that does not have side effect. The; ``__counted_by`` annotation cannot apply to pointers to incomplete types or; types without size such as ``void *``. Instead, ``__sized_by`` can be used to; describe the byte count.; * ``__sized_by(N)`` : The pointer points to memory that contains ``N`` bytes.; Just like the argument of ``__counted_by``, ``N`` is an expression of integer; type which can be a constant, a simple reference to a declaration, or an; arithmetic expression that does not have side effects. This is mainly used for; pointers to incomplete types or types without size such as ``void *``.; * ``__ended_by(P)`` : The pointer has the upper bound of value ``P``, which is; one past the last element of the pointer.

To avoid exposing templated parameter to the users, typedefs are; defined for all types of vectors based on doubles. See in the examples; for all the possible types of vector classes, which can be constructed; by users with the available coordinate system types. #### Coordinate System Tag. The 2D and 3D points and vector classes can be associated to a tag; defining the coordinate system. This can be used to distinguish between; vectors of different coordinate systems like global or local vectors.; The coordinate system tag is a template parameter of the; **`ROOT::Math::`**`DisplacementVector3D` and; `ROOT::Math::PositionVector3D` (and also for 2D classes). A default tag; exists for users who do not need this functionality,; `ROOT::Math::DefaultCoordinateSystemTag`. #### Transformations. The transformations are modeled using simple (non-template) classes,; using double as the scalar type to avoid too large numerical errors. The; transformations are grouped in rotations (in 3 dimensions), Lorentz; transformations and Poincare transformations, which are; translation`/`rotation combinations. Each group has several members; which may model physically equivalent transformations but with different; internal representations. Transformation classes can operate on all type; of vectors by using the operator `() `or the operator `*` and the; transformations can be combined via the operator `*`. The available; transformations are:. - 3D rotation classes. - rotation described by a 3x3 matrix (**`ROOT::Math::Rotation3D`**). - rotation described by Euler angles (**`ROOT::Math::EulerAngles`**). - rotation described by a direction axis and an angle; (**`ROOT::Math::AxisAngle`**). - rotation described by a quaternion (**`ROOT::Math::Quaternion`**). - optimized rotation around `x` (**`ROOT::Math::RotationX`**), `y`; (**`ROOT::Math::RotationY`**) and `z` (",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:72529,simpl,simple,72529,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']

This function illustrates a number of interesting things about the; parser:. 1) It shows how we use the LogError routines. When called, this function; expects that the current token is a '(' token, but after parsing the; subexpression, it is possible that there is no ')' waiting. For example,; if the user types in ""(4 x"" instead of ""(4)"", the parser should emit an; error. Because errors can occur, the parser needs a way to indicate that; they happened: in our parser, we return null on an error. 2) Another interesting aspect of this function is that it uses recursion; by calling ``ParseExpression`` (we will soon see that; ``ParseExpression`` can call ``ParseParenExpr``). This is powerful; because it allows us to handle recursive grammars, and keeps each; production very simple. Note that parentheses do not cause construction; of AST nodes themselves. While we could do it this way, the most; important role of parentheses are to guide the parser and provide; grouping. Once the parser constructs the AST, parentheses are not; needed.

We don't fold this because we don't want to introduce an overlapped live range; of the ivar. However if we can make this more aggressive without causing; performance issues in two ways:. 1. If *either* the LHS or RHS has a single use, we can definitely do the; transformation.

Use this power wisely. Using Classes as Subroutines; ============================. As described in `Simple values`_, a class can be invoked in an expression; and passed template arguments. This causes TableGen to create a new anonymous; record inheriting from that class. As usual, the record receives all the; fields defined in the class. This feature can be employed as a simple subroutine facility. The class can; use the template arguments to define various variables and fields, which end; up in the anonymous record. Those fields can then be retrieved in the; expression invoking the class as follows. Assume that the field ``ret``; contains the final value of the subroutine. .. code-block:: text. int Result = ... CalcValue<arg>.ret ...;. The ``CalcValue`` class is invoked with the template argument ``arg``. It; calculates a value for the ``ret`` field, which is then retrieved at the; ""point of call"" in the initialization for the Result field. The anonymous; record created in this example serves no other purpose than to carry the; result value. Here is a practical example. The class ``isValidSize`` determines whether a; specified number of bytes represents a valid data size. The bit ``ret`` is; set appropriately. The field ``ValidSize`` obtains its initial value by; invoking ``isValidSize`` with the data size and retrieving the ``ret`` field; from th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst:55321,simpl,simple,55321,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,1,['simpl'],['simple']

In; this case, you have to include the appropriate headers in the code and; then exploit the *root-config* tool for the automatic settings of all; the compiler flags. *root-config* is a script that comes with ROOT; it; prints all flags and libraries needed to compile code and link it with; the ROOT libraries. In order to make the code executable stand-alone, an; entry point for the operating system is needed, in C++ this is the; procedure `int main();`. The easiest way to turn a ROOT macro code into; a stand-alone application is to add the following ""dressing code"" at the; end of the macro file. This defines the procedure main, the only purpose; of which is to call your macro:. ``` {.cpp}; int main() {; ExampleMacro();; return 0;; }; ```. To create a stand-alone program from a macro called `ExampleMacro.C`, simply type. ``` {.cpp}; > g++ -o ExampleMacro ExampleMacro.C `root-config --cflags --libs`; ```. and execute it by typing. ``` {.cpp}; > ./ExampleMacro; ```. This procedure will, however, not give access to the ROOT graphics, as; neither control of mouse or keyboard events nor access to the graphics; windows of ROOT is available. If you want your stand-alone application; have display graphics output and respond to mouse and keyboard, a; slightly more complex piece of code can be used. In the example below, a; macro `ExampleMacro_GUI` is executed by the ROOT class `TApplication`. As; a additional feature, this code example offers access to parameters; eventually passed to the program when started from the command line.; Here is the code fragment:. ``` {.cpp}; void StandaloneApplication(int argc, char** argv) {; // eventually, evaluate the application parameters argc, argv; // ==>> here the ROOT macro is called; ExampleMacro_GUI();; }; // This is the standard ""main"" of C++ starting; // a RO",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md:10884,simpl,simply,10884,documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md,1,['simpl'],['simply']

We can now do:; ```; while(...) {; TObjArray arr;; ... update the content of ""arr""; buffer.WriteObject(&arr, kFALSE);; }; ```; where the last argument of WriteObject tells the buffer do *not* remember this object's address and to always stream it. This feature is also available via WriteObjectAny. - Added a new mechanism for providing clean forward-compatibility breaks in a ``TTree`` (i.e., a newer version of ROOT writes a ``TTree`` an older version cannot read). When future versions of ROOT utilize an IO feature that this version does not support, ROOT will provide a clear error message instead of crashing or returning garbage data.

Thus, partitioning; precisely may require introducing at least N^2 new virtual variables,; phi nodes, etc. Each of these variables may be clobbered at multiple def sites. To give an example, if you were to split up struct fields into; individual variables, all aliasing operations that may-def multiple struct; fields, will may-def more than one of them. This is pretty common (calls,; copies, field stores, etc). Experience with SSA forms for memory in other compilers has shown that; it is simply not possible to do this precisely, and in fact, doing it; precisely is not worth it, because now all the optimizations have to; walk tons and tons of virtual variables and phi nodes. So we partition. At the point at which you partition, again,; experience has shown us there is no point in partitioning to more than; one variable.

If you are creating a lot of; repetitive diagnostics and/or have an idea for a useful formatter, please bring; it up on the cfe-dev mailing list. Here are the different diagnostic argument formats currently supported by; Clang:. **""s"" format**. Example:; ``""requires %0 parameter%s0""``; Class:; Integers; Description:; This is a simple formatter for integers that is useful when producing English; diagnostics.

You can use the ""plural"" format specifier to handle such situations. **""select"" format**. Example:; ``""must be a %select{unary|binary|unary or binary}0 operator""``; Class:; Integers; Description:; This format specifier is used to merge multiple related diagnostics together; into one common one, without requiring the difference to be specified as an; English string argument. Instead of specifying the string, the diagnostic; gets an integer argument and the format string selects the numbered option.; In this case, the ""``%0``"" value must be an integer in the range [0..2].

Now, such states are; stored only using an integer, and category names can have arbitrary length. This will use 4 instead of 288 bytes; per category entry in a dataset, and make computations that rely on category states faster. The interface to define or manipulate category states was also updated. Since categories are mappings from state names; to state index, this is now reflected in the interface.

The reason is that we have a; limited performance budget. And I think we should not expect most of the checker; writers to add modeling of language constructs. So, in my opinion, it is ok to; have less nice/more verbose API for language modeling if we can have better; performance this way, since it only needs to be done once, and is done by the; framework developers. **Artem:** These are some great questions, i guess it'd be better to discuss; them more openly.

This can probably by keeping the API as powerful as; necessary while providing a layer of simple ready-made solutions on top of it.; Probably a few reusable components for assembling checkers. And this layer; should ideally be pleasant enough to work with, so that people would prefer to; extend it when something is lacking, instead of falling back to the complex; omnipotent API. I'm thinking of AST matchers vs. AST visitors as a roughly; similar situation: matchers are not omnipotent, but they're so nice. * Separation between core and checkers is usually quite strange. Once we have; shared state traits, i generally wouldn't mind having region store or range; constraint manager as checkers (though it's probably not worth it to transform; them - just a mood).

The major benefit of LCSSA is that it makes many other loop optimizations; simpler. First of all, a simple observation is that if one needs to see all; the outside users, they can just iterate over all the (loop closing); PHI nodes in the exit blocks (the alternative would be to; scan the def-use chain [#def-use-chain]_ of all instructions in the loop). Then, consider for example; :ref:`simple-loop-unswitch <passes-simple-loop-unswitch>` ing the loop above.; Because it is in LCSSA form, we know that any value defined inside of; the loop will be used either only inside the loop or in a loop closing; PHI node.

We will want now to place symmetrically 1000 chambers on a; pad, following a pattern of 20 rows and 50 columns. One way to do this; will be to replicate our chamber by positioning it 1000 times in; different positions of the pad. Unfortunately, this is far from being; the optimal way of doing what we want. Imagine that we would like to; find out which of the 1000 chambers is containing a `(x,y,z)` point; defined in the pad reference. You will never have to do that, since the; modeller will take care of it for you, but let's guess what it has to; do. The most simple algorithm will just loop over all daughters, convert; the point from mother to local reference and check if the current; chamber contains the point or not. This might be efficient for pads with; few chambers, but definitely not for 1000. Fortunately the modeller is; smarter than that and creates for each volume some optimization; structures called `voxels` to minimize the penalty having too many; daughters, but if you have 100 pads like this in your geometry you will; anyway lose a lot in your tracking performance. The way out when; volumes can be arranged according to simple patterns is the usage of; divisions. We will describe them in detail later on.

Naming shape primitive is mandatory only for the primitives used in; Boolean composites (see ""Composite Shapes""). For the sake of simplicity,; we will describe only the constructors in the second form. ### Units. The length units used in the geometry are **arbitrary**.

To make life simple we provide a general function to open any type of; file (except shared memory files of class **`TMapFile`**). This; functionality is provided by the static `TFile::Open()` function:. ``` {.cpp}; TFile *TFile::Open(const Text_t *name,Option_t *option="""",; const Text_t *title="""",Int_t compress,Int_t netopt); ```.

In case a URL; specifies a local file, a **`TFile`** object will be returned (and of; course no login information is needed). The arguments of the `Open()`; function are the same as the ones for the **`TFile`** constructor. Using `ReOpen()` method it is possible to reopen a file with a; different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE,; RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either ""READ"" or; ""UPDATE"". The method returns:. - 0 in case the mode was successfully modified;. - 1 in case the mode did not change (it was already as requ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:94325,simpl,simple,94325,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']

They can be either decimal or; hexadecimal. Decimal integers can be prefixed with - to represent; negative integers, e.g. '``-1234``'. Hexadecimal integers must be; prefixed with either u or s to indicate whether they are unsigned; or signed respectively. e.g '``u0x8000``' gives 32768, whilst; '``s0x8000``' gives -32768. Note that hexadecimal integers are sign extended from the number; of active bits, i.e. the bit width minus the number of leading; zeros. So '``s0x0001``' of type '``i16``' will be -1, not 1.; **Floating-point constants**; Floating-point constants use standard decimal notation (e.g.; 123.421), exponential notation (e.g. 1.23421e+2), or a more precise; hexadecimal notation (see below).

Usability,"--------------------------------------. The Clang compiler frontend, ``clang -cc1``, supports two command line options; for generating and using PCH files. To generate PCH files using ``clang -cc1``, use the option `-emit-pch`:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang -cc1 test.h -emit-pch -o test.h.pch. This option is transparently used by ``clang`` when generating PCH files. The; resulting PCH file contains the serialized form of the compiler's internal; representation after it has completed parsing and semantic analysis. The PCH; file can then be used as a prefix header with the `-include-pch`; option:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang -cc1 -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test.s. Design Philosophy; -----------------. Precompiled headers are meant to improve overall compile times for projects, so; the design of precompiled headers is entirely driven by performance concerns.; The use case for precompiled headers is relatively simple: when there is a; common set of headers that is included in nearly every source file in the; project, we *precompile* that bundle of headers into a single precompiled; header (PCH file). Then, when compiling the source files in the project, we; load the PCH file first (as a prefix header), which acts as a stand-in for that; bundle of headers. A precompiled header implementation improves performance when:. * Loading the PCH file is significantly faster than re-parsing the bundle of; headers stored within the PCH file. Thus, a precompiled header design; attempts to minimize the cost of reading the PCH file. Ideally, this cost; should not vary with the size of the precompiled header file. * The cost of generating the PCH file initially is not so large that it; counters the per-source-file performance improvement due to eliminating the; need to parse the bundled headers in the first place. This is particularly; important on multi-core systems, because PCH file generation serializes the; build when all compilations require the PCH file to be up-to-date",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:1345,simpl,simple,1345,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Use ``__has_feature(objc_fixed_enum)`` to determine whether support for fixed; underlying types is available in Objective-C. Interoperability with C++11 lambdas; -----------------------------------. Clang provides interoperability between C++11 lambdas and blocks-based APIs, by; permitting a lambda to be implicitly converted to a block pointer with the; corresponding signature. For example, consider an API such as ``NSArray``'s; array-sorting method:. .. code-block:: objc. - (NSArray *)sortedArrayUsingComparator:(NSComparator)cmptr;. ``NSComparator`` is simply a typedef for the block pointer ``NSComparisonResult; (^)(id, id)``, and parameters of this type are generally provided with block; literals as arguments. However, one can also use a C++11 lambda so long as it; provides the same signature (in this case, accepting two parameters of type; ``id`` and returning an ``NSComparisonResult``):. .. code-block:: objc. NSArray *array = @[@""string 1"", @""string 21"", @""string 12"", @""String 11"",; @""String 02""];; const NSStringCompareOptions comparisonOptions; = NSCaseInsensitiveSearch | NSNumericSearch |; NSWidthInsensitiveSearch | NSForcedOrderingSearch;; NSLocale *currentLocale = [NSLocale currentLocale];; NSArray *sorted; = [array sortedArrayUsingComparator:[=](id s1, id s2) -> NSComparisonResult {; NSRange string1Range = NSMakeRange(0, [s1 length]);; return [s1 compare:s2 options:comparisonOptions; range:string1Range locale:currentLocale];; }];; NSLog(@""sorted: %@"", sorted);.

JITDylibs are created by; calling the ``ExecutionSession::createJITDylib`` method with a unique name:. .. code-block:: c++. ExecutionSession ES;; auto &JD = ES.createJITDylib(""libFoo.dylib"");. The JITDylib is owned by the ``ExecutionEngine`` instance and will be freed; when it is destroyed. How to remove code; ------------------. To remove an individual module from a JITDylib it must first be added using an; explicit ``ResourceTracker``. The module can then be removed by calling; ``ResourceTracker::remove``:. .. code-block:: c++. auto &JD = ... ;; auto M = ... ;. auto RT = JD.createResourceTracker();; Layer.add(RT, std::move(M)); // Add M to JD, tracking resources with RT. RT.remove(); // Remove M from JD. Modules added directly to a JITDylib will be tracked by that JITDylib's default; resource tracker. All code can be removed from a JITDylib by calling ``JITDylib::clear``. This; leaves the cleared JITDylib in an empty but usable state. JITDylibs can be removed by calling ``ExecutionSession::removeJITDylib``. This; clears the JITDylib and then puts it into a defunct state. No further operations; can be performed on the JITDylib, and it will be destroyed as soon as the last; handle to it is released. An example of how to use the resource management APIs can be found at; ``llvm/examples/OrcV2Examples/LLJITRemovableCode``. How to add the support for custom program representation; --------------------------------------------------------; In order to add the support for a custom program representation, a custom ``MaterializationUnit``; for the program representation, and a custom ``Layer`` are needed. The Layer will have two; operations: ``add`` and ``emit``. The ``add`` operation takes an instance of your program; representation, builds one of your custom ``MaterializationUnits`` to hold it, then adds it; to a ``JITDylib``.

USING MARKERS TO ANALYZE SPECIFIC CODE BLOCKS; ---------------------------------------------; :program:`llvm-mca` allows for the optional usage of special code comments to; mark regions of the assembly code to be analyzed. A comment starting with; substring ``LLVM-MCA-BEGIN`` marks the beginning of an analysis region. A; comment starting with substring ``LLVM-MCA-END`` marks the end of a region.; For example:. .. code-block:: none. # LLVM-MCA-BEGIN; ...; # LLVM-MCA-END. If no user-defined region is specified, then :program:`llvm-mca` assumes a; default region which contains every instruction in the input file. Every region; is analyzed in isolation, and the final performance report is the union of all; the reports generated for every analysis region. Analysis regions can have names. For example:. .. code-block:: none. # LLVM-MCA-BEGIN A simple example; add %eax, %eax; # LLVM-MCA-END. The code from the example above defines a region named ""A simple example"" with a; single instruction in it. Note how the region name doesn't have to be repeated; in the ``LLVM-MCA-END`` directive. In the absence of overlapping regions,; an anonymous ``LLVM-MCA-END`` directive always ends the currently active user; defined region.

(for anyone curious that's AArch64's register naming). The use case here is that we are describing registers. Some are 32 bits wide and some are 64 bits wide. We start by setting a default value of `size` which is 4 (4x8=32 bits) in the class `Register`. Then using a top level `let` we override that value and set it to 8 for all the 64 bit registers at once. So we don't need to do `size=8` over and over again. ## Classes As Class Members.

We simply use a `def` like we have done before. ```tablegen; class Inner {}; def AnInner: Inner {}; class Outer {; Inner i = AnInner;; }; def AnOuter: Outer {}; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class Inner {; }; class Outer {; Inner i = AnInner;; }; ------------- Defs -----------------; def AnInner {	// Inner; }; def AnOuter {	// Outer; Inner i = AnInner;; }. ## Class Template Arguments. Class template arguments are used to pass parameters to classes when you `def` them. ```tablegen; class C <int a, int b> {; int c = a;; int d = b;; }; def X: C<0, 1> {}; ```. ------------- Classes -----------------; class C<int C:a = ?, int C:b = ?> {; int c = C:a;; int d = C:b;; }; ------------- Defs -----------------; def X {	// C; int c = 0;; int d = 1;; }. This means that to `def` a `C` we must now provide 2 arguments that have type `int` (type checking applies here as it does elsewhere). This is going to look familiar if you have written C++. In C++ it might look like:; ```; template<int a, int b>; class C ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/utils/TableGen/jupyter/tablegen_tutorial_part_1.md:10633,simpl,simply,10633,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/utils/TableGen/jupyter/tablegen_tutorial_part_1.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/utils/TableGen/jupyter/tablegen_tutorial_part_1.md,1,['simpl'],['simply']
Usability,"-------. Immutability; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. Clang AST nodes (types, declarations, statements, expressions, and so on) are; generally designed to be immutable once created. This provides a number of key; benefits:. * Canonicalization of the ""meaning"" of nodes is possible as soon as the nodes; are created, and is not invalidated by later addition of more information.; For example, we :ref:`canonicalize types <CanonicalType>`, and use a; canonicalized representation of expressions when determining whether two; function template declarations involving dependent expressions declare the; same entity.; * AST nodes can be reused when they have the same meaning. For example, we; reuse ``Type`` nodes when representing the same type (but maintain separate; ``TypeLoc``\s for each instance where a type is written), and we reuse; non-dependent ``Stmt`` and ``Expr`` nodes across instantiations of a; template.; * Serialization and deserialization of the AST to/from AST files is simpler:; we do not need to track modifications made to AST nodes imported from AST; files and serialize separate ""update records"". There are unfortunately exceptions to this general approach, such as:. * The first declaration of a redeclarable entity maintains a pointer to the; most recent declaration of that entity, which naturally needs to change as; more declarations are parsed.; * Name lookup tables in declaration contexts change after the namespace; declaration is formed.; * We attempt to maintain only a single declaration for an instantiation of a; template, rather than having distinct declarations for an instantiation of; the declaration versus the definition, so template instantiation often; updates parts of existing declarations.; * Some parts of declarations are required to be instantiated separately (this; includes default arguments and exception specifications), and such; instantiations update the existing declaration. These cases tend to be fragile; mutable AST state should be avoided where; possible.

Usability,"-------; VPlan-based vectorization involves three major steps, taking a ""scenario-based; approach"" to vectorization planning:. 1. Legal Step: check if a loop can be legally vectorized; encode constraints and; artifacts if so.; 2. Plan Step:. a. Build initial VPlans following the constraints and decisions taken by; Legal Step 1, and compute their cost.; b. Apply optimizations to the VPlans, possibly forking additional VPlans.; Prune sub-optimal VPlans having relatively high cost.; 3. Execute Step: materialize the best VPlan. Note that this is the only step; that modifies the IR. Design Guidelines; -----------------; In what follows, the term ""input IR"" refers to code that is fed into the; vectorizer whereas the term ""output IR"" refers to code that is generated by the; vectorizer. The output IR contains code that has been vectorized or ""widened""; according to a loop Vectorization Factor (VF), and/or loop unroll-and-jammed; according to an Unroll Factor (UF).; The design of VPlan follows several high-level guidelines:. 1. Analysis-like: building and manipulating VPlans must not modify the input IR.; In particular, if the best option is not to vectorize at all, the; vectorization process terminates before reaching Step 3, and compilation; should proceed as if VPlans had not been built. 2. Align Cost & Execute: each VPlan must support both estimating the cost and; generating the output IR code, such that the cost estimation evaluates the; to-be-generated code reliably. 3. Support vectorizing additional constructs:. a. Outer-loop vectorization. In particular, VPlan must be able to model the; control-flow of the output IR which may include multiple basic-blocks and; nested loops.; b. SLP vectorization.; c. Combinations of the above, including nested vectorization: vectorizing; both an inner loop and an outer-loop at the same time (each with its own; VF and UF), mixed vectorization: vectorizing a loop with SLP patterns; inside [4]_, (re)vectorizing input IR containing vector",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/VectorizationPlan.rst:1892,guid,guidelines,1892,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/VectorizationPlan.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/VectorizationPlan.rst,1,['guid'],['guidelines']
Usability,"------. Python has an elaborate array interface (buffer) specification, but no; standard library array type that completely implements it; instead, the; canonical Python array type is the NumPy one.; cppyy introduces the basic ``LowLevelView`` array class to avoid having a; direct dependency on NumPy and to guarantee zero copy.; The ``LowLevelView`` type gives access to array details such as the size,; type, etc. and allows reading/writing of array elements, both for interactive; use and through the buffer interface to allow NumPy to interface with them.; For more complex operations, it's recommended to copy from the; ``LowLevelView`` inta a NumPy array, or to create a NumPy view (see below,; under :ref:`NumPy Casts <npcasts>`). `C/C++ casts`; -------------. C++ instances are auto-casted to the most derived available type, so do not; require explicit casts even when a function returns a pointer to a base; class or interface.; However, when given only a ``void*`` or ``intptr_t`` type on return, a cast; is required to turn it into something usable. * **bind_object**: This is the preferred method to proxy a C++ address,; and lives in ``cppyy``, not ``cppyy.ll``, as it is not a low-level C++; cast, but a ``cppyy`` API that is also used internally.; It thus plays well with object identity, references, etc.; Example:. .. code-block:: python. >>> cppyy.cppdef(""""""; ... struct MyStruct { int fInt; };; ... void* create_mystruct() { return new MyStruct{42}; }; ... """"""); ... ; >>> s = cppyy.gbl.create_mystruct(); >>> print(s); <cppyy.LowLevelView object at 0x10559d430>; >>> sobj = cppyy.bind_object(s, 'MyStruct'); >>> print(sobj); <cppyy.gbl.MyStruct object at 0x7ff25e28eb20>; >>> print(sobj.fInt); 42; >>>. Instead of the type name as a string, ``bind_object`` can also take the; actual class (here: ``cppyy.gbl.MyStruct``). * **Typed nullptr**: A Python side proxy can pass through a pointer to; pointer function argument, but if the C++ side allocates memory and; stores it in the",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/lowlevel.rst:2119,usab,usable,2119,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/lowlevel.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/lowlevel.rst,1,['usab'],['usable']

Usability,"->Inspect()`, see ""Inspecting Objects"". ### Collections. To store an object in a ROOT collection, it must be a descendent of; **`TObject`**. This is convenient if you want to store objects of; different classes in the same collection and execute the method of the; same name on all members of the collection. For example, the list of; graphics primitives are in a ROOT collection called **`TList`**. When; the canvas is drawn, the `Paint` method is executed on the entire; collection. Each member may be a different class, and if the `Paint`; method is not implemented, **`TObject::Paint`** will be executed. ### Input/Output. The `TObject::Write` method is the interface to the ROOT I/O system. It; streams the object into a buffer using the `Streamer` method. It; supports cycle numbers and automatic schema evolution. See; ""Input/Output"". ### Paint/Draw. These graphics methods are defaults; their implementation in; **`TObject`** does not use the graphics subsystem. The `TObject::Draw`; method is simply a call to `AppendPad`. The `Paint` method is empty. The; default is provided so that one can call `Paint` in a collection. The; method `GetDrawOption` returns the draw option that was used when the; object was drawn on the canvas. This is especially relevant with; histograms and graphs. ### Clone/DrawClone. Two useful methods are `Clone` and `DrawClone`. The `Clone` method takes; a snapshot of the object with the `Streamer` and creates a new object.; The `DrawClone` method does the same thing and in addition draws the; clone. ### Browse. This method is called if the object is browse-able and is to be; displayed in the object browser. For example the **`TTree`**; implementation of `Browse`, calls the Browse method for each branch. The; `TBranch::Browse` method displays the name of each leaf. For the; object's `Browse` method to be called, the `IsFolder()` method must be; overridden to return true. This does not mean it has to be a folder, it; just means that it is browse-able. #",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md:2922,simpl,simply,2922,documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md,1,['simpl'],['simply']

By default the **`TPad`** is editable. ``` {.cpp}; TPad::SetEditable(kFALSE); ```. ## Graphical Objects. In this paragraph, we describe the various simple 2D graphical objects; defined in ROOT. Usually, one defines these objects with their; constructor and draws them with their `Draw()` method. Therefore, the; examples will be very brief. Most graphical objects have line and fill; attributes (color, width) that will be described in ""Graphical objects; attributes"". If the user wants more information, the class names are; given and they may refer to the online developer documentation. This is; especially true for functions and methods that set and get internal; values of the objects described here. By default 2D graphical objects; are created in User Coordinates with (0, 0) in the lower left corner. ### Lines, Arrows and Polylines. The simplest graphical object is a line. It is implemented in the; **`TLine`** class. The line constructor is:. ``` {.cpp}; TLine(Double_t x1,Double_t y1,Double_t x2,Double_t y2); ```. The arguments `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first; and second point. It can be used:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] l = new TLine(0.2,0.2,0.8,0.3); root[] l->Draw(); ```. The arrow constructor is:. ``` {.cpp}; TArrow(Double_t x1, Double_t y1,; Double_t x2, Double_t y2,; Float_t arrowsize, Option_t *option); ```. It defines an arrow between points `x1,y1` and `x2,y2`. The arrow size; is in percentage of the pad height. The `option` parameter has the; following meanings:. ![](pictures/020000A7.jpg) ""\>"". ![](pictures/020000A8.jpg) ""\<|"". ![](pictures/020000A9.jpg) ""\<"". ![](pictures/020000AA.jpg) ""|\>"". ![](pictures/020000AB.jpg) ""\<\>"". ![](pictures/020000AC.jpg) ""\<|\>"".

The set can depend on the input operand values.; This set is empty on x86 and ARM, but can be non-empty on other architectures.; (For instance, on wasm, if any input NaN does not have the preferred all-zero; payload or any input NaN is an SNaN, then this set contains all possible; payloads; otherwise, it is empty. On SPARC, this set consists of the all-one; payload.). In particular, if all input NaNs are quiet (or if there are no input NaNs), then; the output NaN is definitely quiet. Signaling NaN outputs can only occur if they; are provided as an input value. For example, ""fmul SNaN, 1.0"" may be simplified; to SNaN rather than QNaN. Similarly, if all input NaNs are preferred (or if; there are no input NaNs) and the target does not have any ""extra"" NaN payloads,; then the output NaN is guaranteed to be preferred. Floating-point math operations are allowed to treat all NaNs as if they were; quiet NaNs. For example, ""pow(1.0, SNaN)"" may be simplified to 1.0. Code that requires different behavior than this should use the; :ref:`Constrained Floating-Point Intrinsics <constrainedfp>`.; In particular, constrained intrinsics rule out the ""Unchanged NaN propagation""; case; they are guaranteed to return a QNaN. Unfortunately, due to hard-or-impossible-to-fix issues, LLVM violates its own; specification on some architectures:. - x86-32 without SSE2 enabled may convert floating-point values to x86_fp80 and; back when performing floating-point math operations; this can lead to results; with different precision than expected and it can alter NaN values. Since; optimizations can make contradicting assumptions, this can lead to arbitrary; miscompilations. See `issue #44218; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/44218>`_.; - x86-32 (even with SSE2 enabled) may implicitly perform such a conversion on; values returned from a function for some calling conventions.

Usability,". ## Navigation and Tracking. Tracking is the feature allowing the transport of a given particle; knowing its kinematics. A state is determined by any combination of the; position $\vec{r}$ and direction $\vec{n}$ with respect to the world; reference frame. The direction $\vec{n}$ must be a unit vector having as; components the director cosines. The full classification of a given; state will provide the following information: the deepest physical node; containing the position vector, the distance to the closest boundary; along the direction vector, the next physical node after propagating the; current point with this distance and the safety distance to the nearest; boundary. This information allows the propagation of particles inside a; detector geometry by taking into account both geometrical and physical; constraints. We will hereby describe the user interface of **`TGeo`** to access; tracking functionality. This allows either developing a tracker for; simple navigation within a given geometry, either interfacing to an; external tracking engine such as GEANT. Note that the abstract interface; for external trackers can be found in `$ROOTSYS/vmc` folder and it can; be used to run GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA-based simulations (\*) by using; directly a geometry described with ROOT. The interface methods related to tracking are incorporated into; **`TGeoManager`** class and implemented in the navigator class; **`TGeoNavigator`**. In order to be able to start tracking, one has to; define the initial state providing the starting point $\vec{r_0}$; and direction $\vec{n_0}$ .; There are several ways of doing that. ### TGeoNavigator Class. One geometry may have several independent navigators to query to; localize points or compute distances.

More robust interfaces; * Compile-time type safety by default; * Decomposition into layers: logical layer, primitives layer, storage layer; * Separation of data model and live data; * Self-contained I/O code to support creation of a standalone I/O library. Concepts; --------. At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which represents a memory location; storing a value of the given C++ type. These distinguished memory locations are the destinations and sources for the; deserialization and serialization. The (de-)serialization is a mapping from the C++ type to the more simple **column** type system. A column contains; an arbitrary number of fixed-sized elements of a well-defined set of types: integers and floats of different; bit sizes. A C++ type may be mapped to multiple columns. For instance, an `std::vector<float>` maps to two columns,; an offset column indicating the size of the vector per entry, and a payload column with the float data. Columns are partitioned into **pages** (roughly: TTree baskets) of a few kB -- a few tens of kB each.; The **physical layer** (only) needs to provide the means to store and retrieve pages. The physical layer is; decoupled from the high-level C++ logic. The physical layer implements an abstract page storage interface,; so that dedicated implementations for key-value stores and other storage systems are conceivable.; At this point, the only provided backend stores the pages in ROOT files. RNTuples are further grouped into **clusters**, which are, like TTree clusters, self-contained blocks of; con",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md:2248,simpl,simple,2248,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Configure a Clang build as you normally would. It's highly recommended that; you use the Release configuration for this, since it will be used to build; another Clang. Because you need Clang and supporting libraries, you'll want; to build the ``all`` target (e.g. ``ninja all`` or ``make -j4 all``). 2. Configure a Clang build as above, but add the following CMake args:. - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_INSTRUMENTED=IR`` -- This causes us to build everything; with instrumentation.; - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=No`` -- A few projects have bad interactions when; built with profiling, and aren't necessary to build. This flag turns them; off.; - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 1.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang++`` - Same as above. In this build directory, you simply need to build the ``clang`` target (and; whatever supporting tooling your benchmark requires). 3. As mentioned above, this has two steps: gathering profile data, and then; massaging it into a useful form:. a. Build your benchmark using the Clang generated in step 2. The 'standard'; benchmark recommended is to run ``check-clang`` and ``check-llvm`` in your; instrumented Clang's build directory, and to do a full build of Clang/LLVM; using your instrumented Clang. So, create yet another build directory,; with the following CMake arguments:. - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage2/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 2.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage2/clang++`` - Same as above. If your users are fans of debug info, you may want to consider using; ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`` instead of; ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release``.

Usability,". Big endian vector load using ``LDR``. A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped! The zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector. .. figure:: ARM-BE-ld1.png; :align: right. Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the correct ordering. Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than simple which register format to pick. There are two options:. 1. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LDR`` instruction.; 2. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LD1`` instruction. Because ``LD1 == LDR + REV`` and similarly ``LDR == LD1 + REV`` (on a big endian system), we can simulate either type of load with the other type of load plus a ``REV`` instruction. So we're not deciding which instructions to use, but which format to use (which will then influence which instruction is best to use). ..

Fast compiles and low memory use; Expressive diagnostics; GCC compatibility. Utility and Applications:. Library based architecture; Support diverse clients; Integration with IDEs; Use the LLVM 'BSD' License. Internal Design and Implementation:. A real-world, production quality compiler; A simple and hackable code base; A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++,; and Objective C++; Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their; variants. End-User Features. Fast compiles and Low Memory Use. A major focus of our work on clang is to make it fast, light and scalable.; The library-based architecture of clang makes it straight-forward to time and; profile the cost of each layer of the stack, and the driver has a number of; options for performance analysis. Many detailed benchmarks can be found online.; Compile time performance is important, but when using clang as an API, often; memory use is even more so: the less memory the code takes the more code you can; fit into memory at a time (useful for whole program analysis tools, for; example).; In addition to being efficient when pitted head-to-head against GCC in batch; mode, clang is built with a library based; architecture that makes it relatively easy to adapt it and build new tools; with it. This means that it is often possible to apply out-of-the-box thinking; and novel techniques to improve compilation in various ways. Expressive Diagnostics. In addition to being fast and functional, we aim to make Clang extremely user; friendly. As far as a command-line compiler goes, this basically boils down to; making the diagnostics (error and warning messages) generated by the compiler; be as useful as possible.

The functionality of an application can be enriched by embedding Cling. To embed Cling, the main program has to be provided. One of the things this main program has to do is initialize the Cling interpreter. There are optional calls to pass command line arguments to Cling. Afterwards, you can call the interpreter from any anywhere within the application.

Every contribution is considered a donation and its copyright and any other; related rights become exclusive ownership of the person who merged the code or; in any other case the main developers of the ""Cling Project"". We warmly welcome external contributions to the Cling! By providing code,; you agree to transfer your copyright on the code to the ""Cling project"".; Of course you will be duly credited and your name will appear on the; contributors page, the release notes, and in the; CREDITS; shipped with every binary and source distribution. The copyright transfer is; necessary for us to be able to effectively defend the project in case of; litigation. You can send us a patch or a pull request with Github, provided that you follow these two simple rules:. Make sure you follow the Cling coding conventions in your code.; . Make sure you provide a set of tests for your feature/bug fix.; . Often it is useful to contact us first to discuss the code you want to develop or the bug you want to fix. Picking up an Idea . We maintain a set of ""ideas"" for talented scientists and developers to pick up. An ""idea"" can be a sketch of a development project, a functionality, a missing feature we would like to see in our tool.; A list that we propose is the following:. Ideas. Extending and improving the multiline input mode - The multiline mode has to figure out automatically whether the user's input is still incomplete. For example ""if (a < 0) {"" is not fully completed input. Cling should'n try to process the line but to be smart enough to understand that it should wait for continuation. Currently cling switches multiline mode only when there is trailing ""{"". It has to be extended to detect trailing +, unbalanced ',"" and so on. Implementing error recovery verifier - One of the most important parts in cling is the error recovery. The error recovery takes care of reverting clang's internal structures on error in the user input. For instance, user types int",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/www/contribute.html:782,simpl,simple,782,interpreter/cling/www/contribute.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/www/contribute.html,1,['simpl'],['simple']
