Availability," convention as the one used in DataTypeInfo<>. So ```f``` instead of ```float```, ```vector<f>``` instead of ```vector<float>```, ```Vec3d``` instead of ```Vec<3, double>```. Unifying the other way around would have implied to use ```Vec<3, double>``` in our scene templates... which was a bit too much :); With that in mind, the current implementation of DataExchange is behaving exactly as it should. . The unittest you are pointing is showing a normal behavior. This behavior is that the template type that does not have a Name() static method and used in a class that is not implementing GetCustomTemplate will fall back to the automatic generation decoded from the typeid(). But this automatic generation is the code we want to get rid of (if one day someone has enough time to fix that) and not desired behavior to align with. Automatic decoding function to avoid breaking too much things until future evolution. . So currently the DataExchange implementation is using GetCustomClassName in order to implement consistent templates name with the other sofa components and not relying on the automatic generation. . If you are interested in unifying things i would recommend:; short term: implement a way to automatically use the DataTypeInfo<>::name() in the NameDecoder. If I remember well initially we didn't wanted to... because sofa::defaulttype was not a dependency of sofa::helper but now we have cleaned a lot that part it is possible to make something quickly. This would allow to remove all the GetCustomClassName in our code base to directly forward to DataTypeInfo<DataType>::name() when available instead of falling back. middleterm: add deprecation management to the falling back code to warn user it will disapear (when it was done we didn't has deprecation menagement...maybe it is worth having a look at that part nowaydays). longterm: remove all that crappy template DataTypeInfo<DataType>::name() and use the thing introduced in https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3289",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3461#issuecomment-1307815952:1859,avail,available,1859,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3461#issuecomment-1307815952,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability," it was provided as an explicit parameter to the method; * later changes refactored this to add new features (such capturing which level of the class hierarchy is creating each Data), and the actual registration of the `Data*` in the list within Base was moved to the Data constructor, where the `Data*` pointer is available so the one from `initData()` became redundant. The newer similar design for initializing BaseLink did use an `initLink()` method without this pointer. And regarding this change:; * a useful aspect of having the pointer to the Data as the first parameter of `initData()` is to unambiguously know the type of the final `Data<T>`, so that there could be (relatively) good compile errors if the type of the provided default value is not matching it. I'm not sure how this PR is affecting / handling that (i.e. if you set a `float` value as a default to a `Data<int>`, how the gcc/clang/msvc error messages look like?); * one drawback in the current design is that there are sometimes bugs introduced by the multiple overloads of `initData()`, because of the ambiguity between the optional default value and the optional pair of bool flags at the end. In particular, for a `Data<std::string>`, calling `initData(&d, ""mydefaultvalue"", ""mydata"", ""help message"")` will incorrectly use the `initData()` version without default value but with one boolean flag, as `""mydefaultvalue""` is a `const char*` which requires a ""user-defined"" conversion to `std::string`, while `""help message""` is implicitely convertible to `bool` without any ""user-defined"" conversion, so preferred by the compiler. So if we break the compatibility to the current `initData()` API, I would strongly suggest to remove this issue, by removing the two optional bool flags which are seldom used anyway (and can be replaced by a call to `setDisplayed()` or `setReadOnly()`).; * compared to when this code was originally written, c++ now allows to put initializers of member variables in the class declaration direct",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3167#issuecomment-1196855283:1631,error,error,1631,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3167#issuecomment-1196855283,1,['error'],['error']
Availability," just need to parse the link's value, follow the path to the linked component's datafield, check its type and that's it), it is a bit trickier when it comes to outputs:; - During the creation of a PSDE's output field, we don't know yet what it's gonna be linked against, so deriving the type is not possible. We have to wait for the creation of the component that will take the PSDE's output as a link to derive it. This means that the steps to derive an output's datatype are the following:. - in Python, in the `parse()` method, call addNewOuput, and give it a datafield name, but no type and an input value field `addNewInput(""MyName"", value="""")`; - in C++, a new datafield is created, but its datatype is void*. To know that this field has been created from a PSDE output, and is not yet properly connected, an alias is added on the data `addAlias(""psde_output"");`; - The next component is created in the scene, a c++ component this time, that knows the type of its inputs. ; - In its parse method, the link is found to the PSDE's output, but its type is incompatible (void* vs vector<Vec3d> for instance). ; - We check if the linked datafield has an alias ""psde_output"" and if so, remove that datafield and recreate it with the same field name, but this time the good datatype; - We set the newly created field as the parent of the parsed datafield in the component. Done. . To do so it was necessary to:; - Make creation of Data possible through a `getNewInstance()` method in Base; - Make BaseData removable from Sofa components in Base `removeData(BaseData*)`; - add in Binding_Base a method called from `addNewIO()` to find a data's type from its value when a link is provided (`deriveTypeFromParentValue()`) ; - Modify Base::parseField() to handle connecting to a parent value that has incompatible type when necessary; - Modify quite a bit the error handling process in addNewData() and parse() (which I hope to have done properly).

Availability," load all the available plugins. Loading a library in the process memory will have several side effects which are difficult to anticipate before hand. The major one is the evaluation of all the global variables, which will result in populating the `ObjectFactory` with all the components that this library contains. I would suggest something different for this kind of having a list of default plugins that are loaded directly with your application ( here `runSofa` ). - derive a sort of sofa plugin manifest file, which can be generated as a post-build step. This should be an easy to parse file which could contain the various informations exposed by the `getModuleName()`, `getModuleVersion()`... without having to load the library in the process memory. This manifest file must be stored in an easy to find location in your build tree, an be installed properly ( they need also to be bundled when you deploy your application ). That means they should be located with a similar relative path with respect to the application ( `runSofa` ) when in the build tree or in the install tree. There should be a proposal about that to define : ; - the manifest file type ( ie how are we going to parse it ? json xml text ? ); - the manifest file content itself. - any application could then define the list of predefined plugin it wants to load using a simple configuration file. A default configuration can be provided, but it could be easily overriden. With this mechanism, no recompilation is required when you want to change the list of default plugins, you just change the config file. NB : a bit unrelated but there is a small code ""snippet"" that can be used to recover all the components attached to a library in two lines ; ```cpp; const char* getModuleComponentList(); {; /// string containing the names of the classes provided by the plugin; static std::string classes = sofa::core::ObjectFactory::getInstance()->listClassesFromTarget(sofa_tostring(SOFA_TARGET));; return classes.c_str();; }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/253#issuecomment-296982188:2010,recover,recover,2010,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/253#issuecomment-296982188,1,['recover'],['recover']

What is your recommendation?. Quickly: this error is fired because init is not called only once. A ""TopologyDataHandler"" is created in the UniformMass init method. Creating 2 trackers could create real bugs if topologicalChanges are applied (basically changes will be applied twice); I see several options:; - init should not be applied several times in those examples; - If we decide init could be applied several times, we need to change the code to check tracker are not created twice. This should be possible but not as simple as ```tracker != null```.

Availability,"> Could you give us more precisions regarding the need to change from enums to strings for the integration methods?. Two reasons motivated the use of strings : ; 1) Right now when specifying the type of numerical integration method in python or xml scripts the user had to use for instance numericalIntegrationMethod=""3"" which is not descriptive at all.

[polynomial_spring_test.zip](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/files/4540453/polynomial_spring_test.zip). The test ""spring_verification.py"" depicts two points (p1, p2) connected with a spring.

In case of a second option, the external force is computed as (p_control - p2)*k_rest_shape_spring.; During the simulation process, the position ""p2"" and forces ""f2"" for point p2, and also the external force or the position of the control point are saved to data files.; The script ""spring_verification_draw_result.py"" loads all data. The strain for spring is computed as ; (norm(p2-p1) - l0) / l0 for PolynomialSpring or as norm(p2-p1) / l0 for RestShapePolynomialSpring.; I use static solver with many iterations to make spring force equal to external force, but I guess it is also possible to compute the spring force as difference f2 - f_external.; Based on this data, a force-strain relation is plotted and compared with polynomial values.; And this is the end of the test.

It highlights the facts that `EXPECT_MSG_EMIT` works only if `MainGtestMessageHandler` is added to the `MessageDispatcher`. But `logging_test.cpp` calls `clearHandlers`. Since `logging_test.cpp` is now sorted before `FileSystem_test.cpp`, it clears the message handler required by `FileSystem_test.cpp`.

Availability,"@damienmarchal , discussions during the SOFA-dev meeting lead to a question over the developed design and your opinion is needed. . The problem was that some scenes tests where crashing at exit. This is due to the SofaPython3 cache (`s_objectcache` there https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/blob/1b5d271aa21df06c4c5ab75599e364adb0c1e9be/Plugin/src/SofaPython3/DataHelper.cpp#L252C1-L252C73) . The problem was that this is a static object containing python objects and is thus cleaned at the very end of the program exit, after the python interpreter, which is not authorized. . To fix it, following [pybind11 suggestions](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/misc.html) I've added a member to the module Sofa.Core that insured that the cleanup is called while the interpreter is still alive (see the PR https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/pull/425). But is was not enough because the interpreter is not cleaned correctly either : the static method ""Release"" of SofaPython3, in charge of cleaning up python and deleting the interpreter was never called when launching scene in runSofa. . This lead to the need of cleaning up *explicitly* the plugin before exiting the main function. This design was not liked by every dev, some wanting a Raii-like cleanup, in the destructor of some member, which is in my mind not possible because the interpreter instance is static in the SofaPython3 plugin and thus we have no guaranty that it would not be deleted before any other static member.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4828#issuecomment-2233357216:809,alive,alive,809,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4828#issuecomment-2233357216,1,['alive'],['alive']

I personnally believe it's a must-have feature, because, let's say you have a python scene in which you have to create 5 times the same PSDE component, a custom TransformEngine for instance:; - Without this PR, you would have to create 5 separated classes, with the exact same implementation, just a different value in the addNewInput() in parse().

If I am, I would follow up with changes in other loader and components. **Caution**: I couldn't test if it actually works! Because, a function `findfile(filename)` exists to check if file exists. So, to make `fopen()` purposely fail, even after supplying correct filename, I tried changing permissions with `chmod uga-r MeshTrian.cpp`, but it didn't report any error even with sofa's official master version.

Availability,"@francoisfaure It is true that having dense matrix blocks is a must-have for some applications, but I wonder about the API: . - for efficiency reasons, we need the DOF types to be available if we want to implement this proposal; - it is quite difficult to recover actual DOF types *from outside* the mapping/forcefield, except when working with a component at the same graph level as the mapping/forcefield, so it seems restrictive to expect the caller to know the DOF types (or is it not?). Which leaves us with the following: back-inserting typed triplets into a container with `template`/overloaded insertion methods, one for each data chunk type. This way the mapping/forcefield DOF types are not part of the API (only the container type is), yet the mapping/forcefield calls the appropriate container method knowing its own DOF types. Of course, the overloaded insertion method must not be `virtual`, which would defeat the whole point. The container must know how to push typed chunks into its internal state (easy), but also how to use/recover it (harder since it needs to remember the types, e.g. for sorting typed triplets later on). This is not unfeasible, but it is not straightforward either. It also adds some complexity/overhead compared to scalar-only back-insertion. Is this worth it? . In order to remember ""typed contexts"" easily, we can draw inspiration from c++14's `std::variant`, where a small integer stores a type index from a variadic argument list, and this index is used for jumping in a static dispatch table.

Availability,"@ggrosshenny ; Thank you for you PR. Being able to save timing in JSON is a very nice idea and as more and more sofa component are using JSON so it make sense to have that. . Now, some feedback about the implementation:; - There is a lot of new functions but there is not test for any of them. . - The way you handle errors in the binding code is now deprecated as it was not following the python standard. The proper way is that failure in binding code must return NULL (and not Py_RETURN_NONE). You can add an execption and a custom message with PyErr_SetString(...) but you don't need to do that when the failure is because of PyArg_ParseTuple...as it set the message itself so that it is standardized. . So, it should be like that: ; ```cpp; if(!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, ""sO"", &id, &tempNode)); return NULL;; ```; Instead of:; ```cpp; if(!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, ""sO"", &id, &tempNode)); {; PyErr_BadArgument();; Py_RETURN_NONE;; }; ```. - You are commenting the python binding code using doxygen, thank you very much for that ! As these are python functions it would be great if you could also provide python docstrings (as this is the python standard of documenting code). You are using the SP_MODULE_METHOD macro which have and empty docstring by default... sofa is missing a macro one to specify the docstring (it exists for SP_CLASS_METHOD_DOC). So to document you functions you first need to add a new macro close to SP_MODULE_METHOD with:; ```cpp; #define SP_MODULE_METHOD_DOC(MODULENAME,M, D) {#M, MODULENAME##_##M, METH_VARARGS, D},; ```; Then you can document the python code in a way similar to when using ""SP_CLASS_METHOD_DOC"". . - the externals libraries should be in the repository extlibs/* so sofa/helper/json.hpp should be moved there. - I have no opinion whether the JSON output should be activated only when the json.hpp is found or if we should systematically ship this lib with sofa. @hugtalbot probably have better opinion on these aspects as this have connection with the Licens",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/360#issuecomment-322555885:317,error,errors,317,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/360#issuecomment-322555885,3,"['error', 'failure']","['errors', 'failure']"

Availability,"@sescaida I just took a look at the code of the ScriptDataEngine class.; You are partially right, the current implementation is the following:. `// Ok, so in the end we're stuck with using the AnimationBeginEvent? (20.02.2018, sescaida); void PythonScriptDataEngine::handleEvent(Event *event); {; if (AnimateBeginEvent::checkEventType(event)); {; setDirtyValue();; update();; }; }`; Here clearly, update is called everytime a AnimateBegin event is sent to the component. If it were a ""normal component"" (i.e. if it were a BaseObject-based component) that would be the only moment that update() method would be called. But the ScriptDataEngine also inherits core::DataEngine.; This is what I talked about during my presentation at the STC#5:; DataEngine both inherits from DDGNode & BaseObject. The update function is ""manually called"" from handleEvent, but it actually shouldn't be, because this is redundant to how DataEngine works, which is having its update() method called **when and only when** a component, taking as an input the output data of that engine, calls getValue() on that data, WHILE any of the engine's INPUTS are flagged dirty. . So basically, while some people call update() in their handleEvent method, this should never be done, except in some (quite) twisted cases.; Btw, it took me quite some time to understand that.. few months ago, all my engines were calling update() in handleEvent, and I had a lot of problems because of that.. ^^.

Availability,"@sescaida Thanks for the review; The reason why I didn't add examples for this PR is because the current examples themselves, without any modification, demonstrate that it works as-is, thus showing that the call to update() in the handleEvent method was redundant with the default DDGNode's update mechanism. Basically, if your scene is well created (links are properly made between datafields & data are correctly accessed by components lower in the scene graph), everything should work just as well as before. The only difference I would say, is that the user has the hand over the cleanDirty() method, which allows him to fix use cases where a read acces is performed on an input, after setting an output's value has been set, in update(). as for whether it is a good idea to keep that system, I must say, that I agree with you, as we discussed before: Bringing the complexity of the DDGNode's mechanism in Python might be something we want to avoid.; Although, I think that the good approach to fight this issue would rather be to solve the problem on the C++ side (simplifying the Data-Update mechanism) than to diverge from it by simplifying the Python process.; I think @damienmarchal woul be the best placed to give us a feedback on this question, maybe?

After some digging and request for discussions (in issue: https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/130)) my conclusion was that the failure was not because of my code but because that somehow there was implicit instanciation of the function like Vec<4,float>::set(...,...,N...) with N!=4. And as they were instanciated this was causing the static_assert to reject the code when N==4. . I have the feeling that the static_assert in Vec was only working because of side effects on way compiler interleave optimization and instantiation of templates (but I may be totally wrong). Basically all the set(...,) function are present but they were removed because they were not used before the check by static_assert. .

Availability,"A bit of explanation about this PR:; When a attribute is passed to createObject, it is added to the BaseObjectDescription of the component. This means that, in cpp, the parse() method, that takes a BaseObjectDescription in parameter, has this information. The problem is, that in the PythonScriptDataEngine, the parse method calls the python version of the parse() method, which doesn't take this BaseObjectDescription in parameter (maybe that should change btw, since its mainly a simple key/value dictionnary after all...); The datafields could be added directly from the C++, but since most of the error handling in the creation of derived I/Os in #742 is performed in the bindings, it would mean recoding a lot of redundant code.; Since I didn't want to touch the parse() method, I created an additional method, that can (or not) be used in PSDEs, named ""datalinks"". This method is called right after the parse() binding, and takes a filtered version of the BaseObjectDescription as an argument (all datafields already created in the parse() method are removed from the dictionnary). The function then calls addNewInput() on each of the leftover fields. I'm certain there is a cleaner way of doing that.; - I was thinking maybe calling directly the python addNewInput() method from the cpp parse() method, to avoid the creation of this extra module function, but I am not sure I know how to do that. ; - Another idea would be to pass the BaseObjectDescription in the parse() method of the PSDE (as it should be done IMHO), and let the user decide whether or not he wants to loop over those fields to create inputs.. more error prone in my opinion.

As I prefer to specify explicitely in every test case the expected behavior I dont' feel very concerned about that 'default mode'. ; But I think this 'bold' behavior sound nice to me and from the new failure we can see in the test reports this mode is rising interesting issue that requires investigations. About the disable color while testing. I disable it only for the tests to see if it improve the readability. Now red in the console only means that a test have failed and it not obfuscated with the red from an expected error message. (I 'm not sure I'm clear here). You can change that if you prefer :) .

As a general remark I would downvote the very idea of putting actual implementation of Sofa components in that plugin to keep the dependencies of this plugin to the **bare** minimum.

Availability,"FWIW at Anatoscope we've been using exceptions for quite a while now, and we generally `std::throw_with_nested` to provide additional context as exceptions bubble up (this is handy when pulling on long engine/data chains) to help debugging scene issues. One of the main issues is to get proper exception translation across c++/python boundaries (both ways) while retaining as much of the original error as possible. IMHO the ""expected"" approach is currently lacking on ergonomics (unlike say, haskell or rust's equivalents) and will probably put some more pressure on compile times if used widely. On the other hand it does solve some of the pain points with exceptions (types/speed). I recall there was some discussion in the C++ committee a few years back in order to have some kind of lightweight exception mechanism (see e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os7cqJ5qlzo) but this is still mostly future work as far as I can tell.

Availability,"For historical explanations:; * we need to gather the pointers to all Data in a Base instance, so there must be a function somewhere that is called with both the pointer to the `Base*` object and to the `Data*`.; * a simple option could be to have the `Base*` pointer as a parameter of the Data constructor, however most compilers issue a warning if `this` is explicitly used when initializing member variables, as it is not fully constructed yet; * however, compilers are happy with calling a method, which itself use `this`, hence the initial implementation of `initData()` (which was called `dataField()`) had the `this` pointer implicitely, but needed the `Data*` pointer to add if to the ""fields"" map, which is why it was provided as an explicit parameter to the method; * later changes refactored this to add new features (such capturing which level of the class hierarchy is creating each Data), and the actual registration of the `Data*` in the list within Base was moved to the Data constructor, where the `Data*` pointer is available so the one from `initData()` became redundant. The newer similar design for initializing BaseLink did use an `initLink()` method without this pointer. And regarding this change:; * a useful aspect of having the pointer to the Data as the first parameter of `initData()` is to unambiguously know the type of the final `Data<T>`, so that there could be (relatively) good compile errors if the type of the provided default value is not matching it. I'm not sure how this PR is affecting / handling that (i.e. if you set a `float` value as a default to a `Data<int>`, how the gcc/clang/msvc error messages look like?); * one drawback in the current design is that there are sometimes bugs introduced by the multiple overloads of `initData()`, because of the ambiguity between the optional default value and the optional pair of bool flags at the end.

Availability,"Hello François (@fjourdes),. Thank for the long and interesting reply. . Your last comment rise an interesting question related to differentiating unittest to functionnal tests. ; Currently in Sofa we don't make any distinction between unit test and functionnal test but my thinking is that in general utility classes have unit tests while components have functional tests . Making the distinction would be indeed better so the question is how to get there from where we are a now. Here is a proposal. ; In the current PR there is a ```BaseTest``` and ```BaseSimulationTest```, this could actually be transformed without too much effort into UnitTest and FunctionalTest. The tests inheriting from UnitTest shouldn't use the factory in any way and shouldn't have external dependencies. The test in-heriting from FunctionalTest should use the factory and can make the assumption that specific plugins are loaded. We could event go one step further and emphasizing things by having two set of file, ones named *MyClass_unittest.cpp* and *MyComponent_functionaltest.cpp* and in our CMakeLists.txt compile the two set of tests separately with different build targets. This would make things very clear, be compatible with your workflow where unit test are considered as compilation failure, be compatible with our workflow where functional tests are used because they allow to get decent code coverage and last point as it would use the loose coupling approach it would totally cut the dependency at compile time to SofaTest. . Small note, some Functional tests may rely on components implemented in plugins. I have not clear view if we should disable the test if the plugin is not there or if we should make it fails or if we should ""disable"" it at runtime. .

Availability,"Hello François, . Here is a summary of my current understanding of your comments. ; It seems that you want to:; 1 - cut the dependency to SofaTest; 2 - have a clear separation between unittest vs functionaltest; 3 - cut the dependency to SofaFramework (ie not having the test inheriting from SofaFramework/BaseTest or something like that) for the unittests. . Initially this PR was only about -1- cutting the dependency to SofaTest. My thinking is that the SofaTest dependency is a major problem for everyone using the master branch of sofa because of the high impact on code coupling. . About -2- Following your remarks I'm in favor of improving a more clear separation between unit-test and functional test but as this is something new and maybe this should discussed that in the ""issues"" section of github instead of inside a specific PR. . About -3- cutting the dependency to SofaFramework. This is something that was never discussed before and worse than that, up to now the general consensus that, as we are in Sofa, we should inherit from a single BaseTest that install all the may be needed to do the test. A good reason for this scenario is nothing related to Scene/Simulation management but because BaseTest provides a default handler for EXPECT_MSG_EMIT/NOEMIT. Of course if your code is not using at all those elements, then you should feel free to use gtest. . As said in previous comment compared to the current Sofa code base I would be very happy to have -1- and -2- done. . It seems that -3- is not a big deal for people using the CMakelists.txt from Sofa but it may be of importance for your specific workflow in which, if I understand your previous answers, you integrate unittest as compilation failure. Maybe you can provide us more details on your workflow so that we can see the drawback of having the tests written in SofaFramework to be inheriting from a BaseTest (which is also defined in SofaFramework).

Availability,"Hello François,. Thanks for the PR, my bad. To answer your question the CI is compiling Sofa in debug on linux...so this rise the question why we didn't notice that before ? . I look at the code and this bug being un-noticed for so long result from interesting side effect ; so here are the details:; In LCPCalc.cpp I replaced the function afficheResult by resultToString; In LCPCalc.h I forgot to remove the afficheResult; In ConstraintAnimationCode.cpp the calling code is; ```cpp; if (EMIT_EXTRA_DEBUG_MESSAGE); {; msg_info() << ""getF() after setConstraintEquations:"" ;; helper::afficheResult(CP.getF()->ptr(),CP.getSize());; }; ```; The remarquable thing is that this is not and #ifdef but a normal if. So the problematic code *is* compiled and as the definition is in the .h, everything is fine (at compilation time). Let's now have a look at how is defined the condition, there we have:; ```cpp; #define EMIT_EXTRA_DEBUG_MESSAGE false; ```; This means the code is really compiled but that during the optimization pass (that take place before linking) the bloc of code is removed because it is unreachable. So at link time the call is not there anymore. ; To have the link error happens you either need to set the condition to true (it is not connected with debug flags so you have to manually change that in the .cpp) or to use a compiler that does not do unreachable code removal (maybe a compiler option or something). . So your PR really fix the problem . Now to conclude:; - I'm happy to see that the compiled successfully optimize if(true/false) condition so we can use them much more to replace #ifdef / #endif whenever possible (more readable, easier to maintain). ; - the EMIT_EXTRA_DEBUG_MESSAGE is not linked in any way to the debug compilation...should it be ?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/473#issuecomment-336552959:1178,error,error,1178,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/473#issuecomment-336552959,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"Hello Marc, and thanks a lot for your feedback !. I'll address some of your points below:. > **determinism**: as @matthieu-nesme mentionned, the order of initialization of objects with static storage duration is undefined across translation units. This is the first reason why I introduced the init() functions: to make initialization deterministic and reliable. And this is the same reason why it's better to call those functions explicitely, at the right time: the program will work correctly by design, not by coincidence;. To be more explicit: there is no guarantee whatsoever that calling `init` in a `static` RAII constructor will get called *after* every other `static` variable in the shared library is initialized. This can indeed be an issue. I was under the impression that there is exactly one of such RAII per dynamic library loaded by SOFA, so as long as `init` does not involve messing around with other `static` variables in the library we should be safe, right?. > **readability** (or something like that): calling the initialization function ""manually"" makes programs more readable: you can just start from the main() function and understand what code is going to run without actually running the code inside a debugger (or reading the entirety of SOFA's source code);. Come on, we're talking about SOFA here ;-). > **choice** (or whatever): with an explicit call to init(), an application writer gets to decide both whether and when to initialize SOFA. Not sure I agree: when `dlopen`-ing a shared library, I prefer to have it initialized automatically if possible (and safe) as the converse is error-prone. In any case, `cleanup` should really be called in the RAII destructor, otherwise resources will leak in case an exception is thrown and not caught, or somebody calls `std::exit` (which they *can*). And of course, the destructor should not do silly stuff like calling a `MessageDispatcher` that was destructed already.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/168#issuecomment-280066333:353,reliab,reliable,353,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/168#issuecomment-280066333,2,"['error', 'reliab']","['error-prone', 'reliable']"

Availability,"Hello, in my opinion, this bug is related to the actual status of solvers in SOFA. Since CG is a very ""robust"" solver (where ""robust"" means that it constructs solutions which are mathematically not always justifiable), it is used everywhere in examples. However, there are other solvers available in SOFA (even if not used often), such as SparseLDL, SparseLU. I think it might be highly ""surprising"" for someone that while CG calculates some solution (which IMHO is not mathematically justifiable, but let's put this aside), LDL or LU will simply crash on such as simple scene without saying anything clear about the reason of crashing. Or to put it differently -- the above scene is not well-formed (a non-mapped MO in a subnode...), but if using CG, everything looks fine (even IMHO it really should not).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/581#issuecomment-390928123:103,robust,robust,103,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/581#issuecomment-390928123,3,"['avail', 'robust']","['available', 'robust']"

Availability,"Hello,. The issue I have with this approach is that this make it very invasive, as Sofa is adding operators in std namespace for all types, even not its own. So within an application that could also does the same, we would get conflicts / redefinition / ambiguity compiler errors, or worse silently override the application's own operators that could have relied on a different string syntax. I agree that the approach of subclassing the standard containers just to be able to package them within a Data is wrong. In our current branch we are refactoring the approach, relying more on `DataTypeInfo` to generically access features like string parsing, without having to put them in the type itself. But this is work in progress so it is not ready to be pushed yet. So in the meantime this change could be pushed, but with the understanding that it may be a temporary solution only.

Availability,"Hey @maxime-tournier ,. You bring valuable points here. You are absolutely right, it is not that trivial, I'm starting to see it now. Here is what I observed during my tests (I'm working part time on this, it is entirely possible that I come back later to correct those statements of mine :) ). > you need to properly initialize/finalize sofa and core modules (see Main.cpp in the runSofa application). Yes. I'm usually leaning towards making most of the functions available and let the script use what it need. So if I'm writing a _runSofa_ like application in python, I should be able to init the components there, create/set the simulation, add the needed message handlers to the MessageDispatcher, and set the paths (plugin, config, sofa prefix) there. If this complicate too much the python script, than making optional python util scripts that set all of this for the user could be a clean option. But I don't think the library should do this in the user's back without transparency. > you need to handle the case where the loaded scene already has python scripts, and let the PythonEnvironment know the interpreter is being run from the outside when initializing (and maybe deal with all the sys.path / __file__ abuses down there). The PythonEnvironment will create an interpreter if there isn't one (like when launching for a binary executable), or use the one already defined. In this case, PythonEnvironment will use the interpreter that called the script (ex python runSofaPython.py). No new python interpreter nor python thread a created (I've just checked to be sure). > probably have a good fight with the GIL down the road. The current GIL usage in the plugin seems to align correctly with this feature since we ""attach"" the PythonEnvironment to an interpreter instead of initialising a new one. No new threads are created. > how should this feature integrate with existing python scenes? Should it be possible to load scenes from within python scenes?. Yes, it seems to work so far.

Availability,"Hey guys, . so, I checked the PR and I have the following comments:. - The examples of the original PSDE contribution get broken with these commits, so this should be fixed. If you want to provide new examples, that’s also ok! In the case of PSDEExamples/01-basic/ changing the type string in DataEngine.py from 'd' to 'int' already fixes the problem. For PSDEExamples/02-advanced/ I couldn’t find the error immediately. . - Regarding the question of linking and automatic deriving of data-types for Inputs my opinion is similar to Damien’s:. > Sure...what we want to do is to create a new data with the exact same type of the data pointed by a link. So making a clone of an existing data (to get its type) and then initialize its parent would do the trick without needed all the factory and datatypename things. . I also do think that the existing linking mechanism could be complemented by a cloning feature that creates a copy of a BaseData object. Probably just a clone()-function in BaseData. This would avoid the implementation of a “heavy-weight” factory, like Damien said. To add this data to the correct object (the PSDE) it is only necessary to set the owner, I think. Finally, linking is done by using setParent(). In this way the user can program freely in C++ without worrying about whether his newly defined compound type needs to be made available in the factory. - Regarding the question of linking and automatic deriving of data-types for Outputs my ideas are not as concrete, but maybe helpful. For me there exist two cases:. 1) The Output of the PSDE is connected to an Input of a sofa-object that has static datas, e.g., sofa-objects whose code is written in C++. An example for such an object would be MechanicalObject (MO) that always has the same data (position, velocity, force, …). 2) The Output of the PSDE is connected to a scripted sofa-object, like another PSDE or similar. For case 1.:. It could be possible to define a special BaseData with a name but vacant type.

I looked at the way the plugin Image made their ImageData bindings, and I will go for this approach for my datatypes. As for actual byte arrays bindings, that could still be an interesting feature, but what I did wouldn't be the proper way of binding byte arrays: for serialization to python, the size is known thanks to the std::string container, so it is possible to serialize to python the way I did in this pr. But desserialization to c++ would not work out, since there would be no way to know the size of the string to retrieve. If necessary, instead, a new TypeInfo could maybe be added to the interface of AbstractTypeInfo and VirtualTypeInfo, that would provide information about the byte array size, so that desserialization could be implemented.

Availability,"Hi @sescaida @damienmarchal,. I made it possible to pass inputs to PythonScriptDataEngines directly through the call to createObject(), which makes it more similar to how components are created in the SceneGraph normally. the example in PSDEAverageEngine.pyscn show the behavior. There are a few downsides in the current implementation though:; - I didn't investigate the effects on error handling (creating input data fields while the field should actually be considered as an ""unused data field name"" for instance..; - I had to hack my way around, probably because I got a bit lost in the SofaPython codebase, trying to figure out how the bindings worked... so the implementation is probably not the cleanest possible.. :/; - The current implementation of the parse() function binding does not pass the BaseObjectDescription object to python, which makes it impossible to retrieve the ""unused datafields"" that we need for the automatic input bindings. Thus I added a ""datalinks"" function, called after the parse() function in python, that takes the key/values pairs of unused attributes passed to createObject, and creates new inputs from them. I chose to create a separate function for that because I didn't dare modifying the behavior of the parse function itself, but it might be worth passing the attributes directly to the python parse method instead, since it is how it's done on the C++ side of things...?.

Availability,"Hi everyone, Marc here :-). I remember I introduced the `init()` and `cleanup()` functions, so I'll add a few words of explanations. Bear with me, it's actually simpler that the length of my response may suggest. > So unless there is a compelling reason to leave it this way (and I would really like to know it). The trick which consists in using static variables to run dynamic initialization code (or cleanup code, for that matter) is an anti-pattern, for a couple of reasons:. * **determinism**: as @matthieu-nesme mentionned, the order of initialization of objects with static storage duration is undefined across translation units. This is the first reason why I introduced the `init()` functions: to make initialization deterministic and reliable. And this is the same reason why it's better to call those functions explicitely, at the _right_ time: the program will work correctly by design, not by coincidence;. * **readability** (or something like that): calling the initialization function ""manually"" makes programs more readable: you can just start from the `main()` function and understand what code is going to run without actually running the code inside a debugger (or reading the entirety of SOFA's source code);. * **choice** (or whatever): with an explicit call to `init()`, an application writer gets to decide both *whether* and *when* to initialize SOFA. ### Now... In the end, I didn't actually bother to search for any single piece of initialization code in SOFA and move it into the appropriate init() function, so the init() functions are pretty light, but the setup is there. Also, the static-dynamic-initialization trick is used all over the place in SOFA, and what happens in the init() functions is ridiculous compared to all the code that probably runs when SOFA is loaded, so here again it is a drop in the ocean, but, I think, a step in the right direction. ### Anyway... > What I don't understand is why the above code snipped does not simply cleanup() the library in ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/168#issuecomment-280028946:744,reliab,reliable,744,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/168#issuecomment-280028946,1,['reliab'],['reliable']

Availability,"Hi mathieu, ; ; This is a good question. . I recently wrote a lot test for sofa component and it appears to me that more than half of my tests cases are in fact verifying that component correctly rise errors or warnings when they are used improperly. Making these tests is very important to avoid un-detected bugs on the error handling code paths and it bring a lot to the general quality of sofa. . About the fact that the ""error as test failure by default"" is covering 99% of our tests... to me this is an indication that our tests are only covering half of the things they should and I'm not sure we should facilitate this behavior. . This is why I came up to making the things explicit in each test because it force the test writer to specify what are his underlying assumption and expectation for each of his tests making things very clear. In addition it put in front of his eyes what he is testing.. and what he is not testing. . PS: I really like the very detailed test failure that are reported with the explicit approach, we have either the filename & lineno of the failing test as well as the location of the message emission. ; eg: https://ci.inria.fr/sofa-ci/job/ubuntu_gcc-4.8_options/5020/testReport/(root)/DilateEngine_test_0/NormalBehavior/.

In general I write a test once... but investigate failures several time... so I find it worth the effort of spending a bit more time on writing a good test with narrow message catching because they proved to saves time while investigating failure. . This is a totally different story with the time saving of changing the default mode by changing Sofa_test. It saves time as long as we are hesitating on what should be the default mode but after that it will slow down all failure investigations. . So...

The idea was to get an easy way to add/remove plugin binaries in an installed SOFA **without polluting the bin/ folder** which contains stuff I'm not supposed to touch (or scared to touch). The typical use case is: ; I have SOFA binaries (downloaded from sofa-framework.org or provided by someone) and I have a plugin binaries. How to run the examples of the plugin in runSofa?. Many ways to do that:; 1. launch runSofa, open Plugin Manager, load the plugin, open the scene; 2. edit the scene to add `<AddPluginRepository path=""/path/to/the/plugin""/>` and `<RequiredPlugin name=""the_plugin""/>`, launch the scene in runSofa ; 3. copy/paste the plugin binaries (library or complete folder) in the bin/ folder of SOFA, add `<RequiredPlugin name=""the_plugin""/>` or add the_plugin in bin/plugin_list.conf.default, launch the scene in runSofa ; 4. **[NEW]** copy/paste the plugin binaries (library or complete folder) in the plugins/ folder of SOFA, add `<RequiredPlugin name=""the_plugin""/>` or add the_plugin in bin/plugin_list.conf.default, launch the scene in runSofa . (1) is perfect for a new user but becomes heavy quite soon; (2) is more agile but has limitations for plugins that need to be loaded **before** the scene creation (e.g. for Python env init); (3) solves the limitation of (2) if we use plugin_list.conf but, as I said, putting stuff in bin/ is scary; (4) is what I proposed to separate ""plugins that came with SOFA"" from ""plugins I add myself"".

Availability,"Hi,. static const int solves the inheritance of enum class, but cannot really ; be used for the purpose of typing a categorical variable. For instance we can have this :. class NumericalIntegrationMethod { public : static const int methodOne=1;};. class NewNumericalIntegrationMethod : public NumericalIntegrationMethod  ; { public : static const int methodTwo=2; };. but the integration method has to be described as :. int method=NumericalIntegrationMethod::methodOne; or int ; method=NewNumericalIntegrationMethod ::methodTwo;. but not as : NumericalIntegrationMethod method; (which would be done ; with enum). Anyway, the use of string instead of enums is also motivated with the ; issue of having descriptive labels in python or xml files. See my previous comments below :. > Right now when specifying the type of numerical integration method in ; > python or xml scripts the user had to use for instance ; > numericalIntegrationMethod=""3"" which is not descriptive at all.

Or wait that more people gain interest in the same plugin as yourself so that it becomes a priority for us. . I am sorry if this answer is not very helpful, and I wished I could help you more.

Availability,"I believe whatever the approach taken it should allow to keep things pretty clear between ; - unit tests, ie tests that hardly depend on initializing a scene. In these tests you hardly need a concrete instance of node or simulation. If you need this it may be nice to have a class to derive from which does it for you, but then again it should stay optional, because you should really think again about how you designed your component if you need a full fledged simulation to actually make some basic testing on your component. ; No matter what, these tests should be executed at each build (even for devs) and must pass. Failing in this kind of tests must be equal to a compilation error.; In that respect there is something that I am reluctant to allow for this type of tests is a lose coupling approach where you instantiate components using keys from the object factory. You may end up writing tests that in fact do not compile from a scratch build because this allows you to not take care about the dependencies between the libs. That is to say a test may instantiate a component that is not available yet, because it belongs to a library which is deeper in the build dependency tree at the time the unit test is built and executed during the compilation. - Functional tests, that require a working scene with probably more components than the one actually tested. These tests can be longer and therefore should not be mandatory during the compilation. ; They will be run only in ci machines, but can be also easily executed by any developers on its machine mostly to debug what is the nature of a new regression in these kind of tests. ; From our experience at InSimo these kinds of tests regress quite often during the development of a new feature, because you make some optimisation in the code, and you get some epsilon difference, or because you change the approach entirely and the scene is no longer relevant for you and should be changed.

Availability,"I have several objections with this PR. ; - the mechanism relies on a specific symbol lookup. So in order to make a plugin auto-loadable, you need to recompile the plugin which design wise is not so great. ; - It also has the major downside of having to load the library to know if the plugin is auto-loadable, which in the end results in having to load all the available plugins. Loading a library in the process memory will have several side effects which are difficult to anticipate before hand. The major one is the evaluation of all the global variables, which will result in populating the `ObjectFactory` with all the components that this library contains. I would suggest something different for this kind of having a list of default plugins that are loaded directly with your application ( here `runSofa` ). - derive a sort of sofa plugin manifest file, which can be generated as a post-build step. This should be an easy to parse file which could contain the various informations exposed by the `getModuleName()`, `getModuleVersion()`... without having to load the library in the process memory. This manifest file must be stored in an easy to find location in your build tree, an be installed properly ( they need also to be bundled when you deploy your application ). That means they should be located with a similar relative path with respect to the application ( `runSofa` ) when in the build tree or in the install tree. There should be a proposal about that to define : ; - the manifest file type ( ie how are we going to parse it ? json xml text ? ); - the manifest file content itself. - any application could then define the list of predefined plugin it wants to load using a simple configuration file. A default configuration can be provided, but it could be easily overriden. With this mechanism, no recompilation is required when you want to change the list of default plugins, you just change the config file.

For the movement of function in a file...my mistake I should have clean that...I tried other changes (like extern template specialization) that I finally not took into consideration in this PR but forgot to clean the file so they seems to have moved more than what they actually did. . You are right about performance issues and your suggestion for checking the first non-empty char in getUnsignedInteger looks ok so I will make the change. . Now about the getInteger vs atoi aspect my first impression is that there will be a small performance difference at the cost of scarifying correctness and code security so I really advocate for using getInteger/getUnisgnedInteger and not atoi. . To go further we probably have to measure the performance but I wouldn't be surprised to be less than a 10% speed difference so it is not worth the loss of good error reporting to user. If high performance is really an issue I prefer to put energy to implement a raw binary storage of indices because this would make things like 10x or more faster speedup as well as have less memory consumption.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/271#issuecomment-302655856:941,error,error,941,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/271#issuecomment-302655856,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/maxime-tournier/3c59175c9219098d419768d89af8a51e#file-attribute_list-cpp) for a simple prototype (start from the main function at the end). It uses a nifty trick for erasing and recovering type information through a throw/catch, which is a little slow but not slower than string conversion anyway. The one with member function pointers won't fly as it requires e.g. `DefaultPipeline::name` to be public, which is often not the case. I don't see how to come up with a reasonably usable syntax for the last one, since `Node, MechanicalObject` are (possibly dependent) type names. Also, putting them all inside a single `initializer_list` will drop type informations to make type checking possible in `createTree`, so I'm afraid this won't be worth it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/417#issuecomment-335082143:218,recover,recovering,218,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/417#issuecomment-335082143,1,['recover'],['recovering']

Availability,"Thanks for the explanation,. So, when GLOBAL is set the friction coefficient came from the mu parameter and when {MINIMUM, AVERAGE, GEOMETRIC, PRODUCT} is set the friction coefficient is computed from the objects with the corresponding function. . If so, I agree that a GLOBAL flags in addition to MINIMUM, AVERAGE, GEOMETRIC and PRODUCT would make sense. I also agree with maxim's that ""In any case I would favour clamping negative mu to zero together with some warning displayed since mu < 0 is a modelling error anyways."". It could also be nice to display a warning when 'mu' is set while GLOBAL is not to inform users they are maybe mis-understanding something (and provide an advice on how to fix the problem). . Finally I also have the feeling that the ""horizontal"" data field could also be improved by renaming it with something like ""coneProjection"" with two possible values: [""horizontal"" and ""orthogonal""] instead of using a boolean.

Availability,"Thanks for your inputs @fspadoni and @damienmarchal , and sorry for the late response. There are two commits in this PR (two versions of the fix); the first one fixed completely the problem on mac OS X, but may introduce thread race condition as only the constructor of a static variable is thread safe. Since the **messageTypePrefixes** and **messageTypeColors** static arrays are initialized in the ; **formatMessage** method, two threads can collide there. The second one tries to fix that, but isn't working yet (hence the commit name ""temp"").; In this one, the **DefaultStyleMessageFormatter** singleton instantiation doesn't cause a seg fault on mac os x anymore, but the **messageTypeColors** static array fails to instantiate correctly, causing all console messages to be blue. This may be because **Console::BRIGHT_GREEN**, **Console::BRIGHT_YELLOW**, etc. are all, of course, static objects. Since they are initialized in another .cpp, the order of their constructor calls with respect to the **DefaultStyleMessageFormatter** singleton instantiation cannot be predicted (compiler bound).

Availability,"Well after a quick look in the scene you provided:. I'm not surprised the BarycentricMapping is not able to work . . Let's me explain: ; - Object.DoFs is of type Rigid3d; - Object.Mechanical model.collisionDofs is of type Vec3d. What your are specifying by setting the input & output field of BarycentricMapping is that you are driving the collisionDofs(type Vec3d) from the one from the one of type Dofs(type Rigid3). So the corresponding mapping should be Rigid3d, Vec3d (an not Vec3d, Rigid3d). ; The possible available templates shows that this is not supposed to work, because a BarycentricMapping can only have Vec3 as input. Overriding the template values with one that exists in BarycentricMapping will not work because this will lead to a mismatch between the input/output types and thes type manually set in the template. . Now about the BeamLinearMapping...the situation is a bit different. There is a valid template from Rigid3 to Vec3. This is why:; ```xml; <BeamLinearMapping template=""Rigid3d,Vec3d""/>; ```; And; ```xml; <BeamLinearMapping""/>; ```; Work the same. ; You get an error in your case because there is a typo ""@collisionDOFs"" instead of ""@collisionDoFs"".; ; Now I have no idea why the BeamLinearMapping is not working as you expect:; - maybe there is a real issue there ? .

Availability,"Well:; - `doLoad()` was called three times, without clearing the lists (e.g. d_position, d_tetra...). So I had duplicated positions, triangles and tetra in my scene, which caused failures. Those calls seemed to be triggered by `addUpdateCallback` in `MeshLoader`.; - the transforms wasn't called three times, so the last positions were not transformed.... but that's not really important I guess. After digging, I found that using `getWriteOnlyAccessor()` to access the `d_positions`... instead of `beginEdit()`, like it was done in most other loaders, reduced this number of calls, which fixed everything for me.

Availability,"Yes I have an idea... . The problem is probably because currently there is two approaches to interpret the messages send with the Message API as test failure. Fixing should be easily, will do that this evening. . More in-depth... I think this is a good opportunity to discuss how the component messages are interpreted as test...currently we have two different approaches. . One of the approach is a global message handler that interprets all errors as test failure. This handler can be ""explicitely"" deactivated when we don't need this behavior. But if we forgot to do so this behavior propagates to each _test in the same test suite (I think this is what is happening here). . I found this behavior not precise enough so I develop ExpectMessage & MessageAsTestFailure which are RAII classes to finely select which message generates test failure with the granulary of the RAII; (so it is automatically removed when the RAII is destroy). ; The good point about this approach is that:; - we can raise test failure for any kind of message (this depend on the test); - we can raise test failure is a message is expected but not send (like using a wrong filename must generate a message). ; - we behavior is only active during the RAII lifetime. .

Availability,"You suggest to avoid wasting time normalizing a unit vector in order to speed up computations. The solution requires not to slow down the other operations. For example, adding a bool in Vec.h would add an extra instruction on any vector operation that would modify the length of the vector in order to invalidate the current length. I've checked how Eigen handles this. It does not. Eigen has a clever lazy evaluation mechanism (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicLazyEvaluation.html), but I don't think it's used for vector normalization. In practice, it is hard to know that the result of a binary operation on vectors provides a normalized vector or not. For example, the cross product requires that both vectors are orthogonal AND unit. Even if you know for sure that your vectors are unit (e.g. with a bool in Vec.h), you also need to know that they are orthogonal.

Availability,"ance using a tag class:; ; ``` c++; class BaseData {; public:; struct no_init {};; ; protected:; BaseData(no_init) : // ...; };; ```; ; This one should be easy.; 3. Add a public `Data` constructor that only initializes value, something like:; ; ``` c++; template<class T>; class Data {; public: ; Data(BaseData::no_init, const T& value = T() ) : // ...; };; ```; ; Again, easy.; 4. Provide component constructors that do not initialize their `Data` so that optimized components can be derived:; ; ``` c++; Base::Base(BaseData::no_init) : name(BaseData::no_init), //...; BaseObject::BaseObject(BaseData::no_init) : f_listening(BaseData::no_init), //... ; ; // ... BaseMapping, Mapping, etc.; ```; ; this one is tedious but not that hard. Now if all of this can be done, a derived component class will be able to manage its data on a per-class basis, and only initialize data lazily when they are actually needed (i.e. when `findData` or `getDataFields` are called). Adding/removing data would be no-ops or errors in these derived classes. ## Performance. Changing the iteration strategy incurs an extra copy of the existing `DataVec` when accessing data, but since we are likely to iterate the vector anyways there should be no visible change in; complexity. Careful allocation on the caller side should also be able to avoid most allocations during vector copy. Finally, data iteration does not seems to happen during computationally intensive sections. Should this remain an issue, it is always possible to iterate using a callback instead, which is acceptable using c++11 lambdas/`std::function`, but probably too cumbersome using c++98. **To summarize I think the performance hit for current code path is minimal.**. On the other hand, a component using `BaseData::no_init` with per-class data managemenent potentially saves up to 6 heap allocations per data per constructor call, and a fraction of this during destruction. FYI, I counted 10 `Data` members in base class `Mapping<In, Out>` alone, `",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/44#issuecomment-255340923:2309,error,errors,2309,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/44#issuecomment-255340923,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"ely on the call super pattern to work.; ; That said I strongly support the idea of cleaning the data validation mechanism. . Damien,; Nota bene:; I disagree about your saying ""I think this ""true/false implying other data fields"" mechanism is a bad design and for this case no checking solution will be clean. "" . Having complex relationship between input fields is a very common situation in user interfaces and it is not restricted to""true/false implying other data fields"" but also having mutually exclusive fields and other cases. It is so common that UI frameworks have dedicated support for that (QGroupBox (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-widgets-groupbox-example.html in Qt). And from an User interface perspective not exposing such constraints to the user is actually a bad design. So, these kind of constraint are good design, the problem is on how to implement them in Sofa :) . In Sofa the current state is that:; - the constraints resulting from the type are encoded into the read method of the field (eg: RGBAColor accept inputs like #FFAABBCC or ""red"", the input validation and error message reporting is done in the 'read' field, a dynamic cast can be used to display a color selector widget instead of a text field). ; - the ""isRequired"" constraint is encoded with a boolean in the Data field and checked in BaseObject::init(); - the ""isReadOnly"" constraint is encoded with a boolean in the Data field, it is not checked in BaseObject::init() and writing to it is allowed but it used to gray out things in the GUI. ; - other constraints (including one making relation between multiple data) are encoded with if() in the overriden init() and of course these constraints are not visible in the UI. ; - in some case it seems that using a common prefix in the field's name is used to group input together (I have only a vague remembering about that with drawEnable then drawColor and drawLine but I cannot find back the example). For that I have not solution...but we can think about one.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/754#issuecomment-416637832:1389,error,error,1389,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/754#issuecomment-416637832,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"ere the different steps of the solving process for a dynamic solver. Hopefully this could be useful at some point. I have described this further in the documentation of Caribou's backward Euler solver [here](https://caribou.jnbrunet.com/classSofaCaribou_1_1ode_1_1BackwardEulerODESolver.html). The last two equations are the one that will be fully assembled, given any solver other than the SOFA's [un-preconditioned] conjugate gradient (this one doesn't assemble any matrices). We can simplify them for the case of only one Newton iteration, which is the same as the SOFA's EulerImplicit component:. ```; [(1+h r_m)M + hB + h(h+r_k)K] da = [r_mM + B + r_k K] v + [F - T]; (1) (2) (3); ```; where `h = dt`, `F` is the internal force vector computed by the elastic forcefields, and `T` is the external force vector computed by pressure fields, gravitational fields, collisions, etc. Here is what happens during the solve:. (1) A = [(1+h r_m)M + hB + h(h+r_k)K]. Building step:; Here we go down on the current context sub-graph and call :; 1. `ff->addKToMatrix(&A)` and `f->addBToMatrix(&A)` for every force field ""ff"" found.; 2. `pc->applyConstraint(&A)` for every BaseProjectiveConstraintSet ""pc"" found.

Now, the damping and stiffness matrices `B` and `K` are usually sparse. Knowing in advanced that `M` is also sparse (or even diagonal), I would bet that we could optimize these operations `(aM + b B + c K) v`. This is even more important for non-linear systems since a third term of the type `(aM + bB + cK) a` appears and must be computed multiples times per time steps. .

Availability,"ion. . I recently wrote a lot test for sofa component and it appears to me that more than half of my tests cases are in fact verifying that component correctly rise errors or warnings when they are used improperly. Making these tests is very important to avoid un-detected bugs on the error handling code paths and it bring a lot to the general quality of sofa. . About the fact that the ""error as test failure by default"" is covering 99% of our tests... to me this is an indication that our tests are only covering half of the things they should and I'm not sure we should facilitate this behavior. . This is why I came up to making the things explicit in each test because it force the test writer to specify what are his underlying assumption and expectation for each of his tests making things very clear. In addition it put in front of his eyes what he is testing.. and what he is not testing. . PS: I really like the very detailed test failure that are reported with the explicit approach, we have either the filename & lineno of the failing test as well as the location of the message emission. ; eg: https://ci.inria.fr/sofa-ci/job/ubuntu_gcc-4.8_options/5020/testReport/(root)/DilateEngine_test_0/NormalBehavior/. EDIT: Your question make me think that some way to improve the things so maybe we can discuss what are the desirable features and how to expose them to the developpers. This is very hard because it is connected to lack of standardized way our code base reports errors (not exception, some uses error codes ,some uses messages). But I'm very afraid of starting such kind of very impacting discussion (I want to do UI ;)). In the meantime I suggest to use this PR. .

Availability,"it would impact something else. Do you have any idea ? ; 2) Fatal is already part of the default mode. ; 3) I removed Warning&Deprecated by default ; 4) There is no need to change all the tests if in the future if we want to reactivate Warning&Deprecated by default, we will just have to change few lines in Sofa_test.h.; Maybe my scoping examples was not clear but the whole system is scoped per type of message so EXPECT_MSG_NOEMIT(Error) in tests have not consequence on the fact that you can add EXPECT_MSG_NOEMIT(Warning) in Sofa_test to catch all warnings. ; Do you see what I mean ? . About explicit test vs default mode... ; To me if the only aspect we care is how fast we can disable/re-enable tests failures then the default mode in Sofa_test is great. But is this the only aspect we care ? ; What about the fact that default mode is reporting useless filename&line (.../Sofa_test:93). Because of that I loose time each time I have to investigate test failures. On the contrary explicit messages specifications reports real file&line and allow to narrow the problem to very precise code location which save time. And these savings sums up each time someone is looking at tests failures. . In general I write a test once... but investigate failures several time... so I find it worth the effort of spending a bit more time on writing a good test with narrow message catching because they proved to saves time while investigating failure. . This is a totally different story with the time saving of changing the default mode by changing Sofa_test. It saves time as long as we are hesitating on what should be the default mode but after that it will slow down all failure investigations. . So... I made my best to explain why I care of explicit test but the important things to me are:; - what do I have to change so that PR can be be merged so that I can close it and move forward ? ; - do we have the time & courage to fix the 200 failing tests if we activate failure on Warning&Deprecated ?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/213#issuecomment-292681008:1317,failure,failures,1317,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/213#issuecomment-292681008,6,"['down', 'failure']","['down', 'failure', 'failures']"

Availability,"ne.py from 'd' to 'int' already fixes the problem. For PSDEExamples/02-advanced/ I couldn’t find the error immediately. . - Regarding the question of linking and automatic deriving of data-types for Inputs my opinion is similar to Damien’s:. > Sure...what we want to do is to create a new data with the exact same type of the data pointed by a link. So making a clone of an existing data (to get its type) and then initialize its parent would do the trick without needed all the factory and datatypename things. . I also do think that the existing linking mechanism could be complemented by a cloning feature that creates a copy of a BaseData object. Probably just a clone()-function in BaseData. This would avoid the implementation of a “heavy-weight” factory, like Damien said. To add this data to the correct object (the PSDE) it is only necessary to set the owner, I think. Finally, linking is done by using setParent(). In this way the user can program freely in C++ without worrying about whether his newly defined compound type needs to be made available in the factory. - Regarding the question of linking and automatic deriving of data-types for Outputs my ideas are not as concrete, but maybe helpful. For me there exist two cases:. 1) The Output of the PSDE is connected to an Input of a sofa-object that has static datas, e.g., sofa-objects whose code is written in C++. An example for such an object would be MechanicalObject (MO) that always has the same data (position, velocity, force, …). 2) The Output of the PSDE is connected to a scripted sofa-object, like another PSDE or similar. For case 1.:. It could be possible to define a special BaseData with a name but vacant type. This is a kind of “forward declaration” for the Output. Then, by extending the linking mechanism one could think of the following: At the time of parsing, a sofa-object (e.g. MO) will establish the link between one of its Inputs to the Output of a PSDE (i.e. PSDE->MO). Since the type of the Input is clear",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-392689416:1353,avail,available,1353,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-392689416,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"ng a scene. In these tests you hardly need a concrete instance of node or simulation. If you need this it may be nice to have a class to derive from which does it for you, but then again it should stay optional, because you should really think again about how you designed your component if you need a full fledged simulation to actually make some basic testing on your component. ; No matter what, these tests should be executed at each build (even for devs) and must pass. Failing in this kind of tests must be equal to a compilation error.; In that respect there is something that I am reluctant to allow for this type of tests is a lose coupling approach where you instantiate components using keys from the object factory. You may end up writing tests that in fact do not compile from a scratch build because this allows you to not take care about the dependencies between the libs. That is to say a test may instantiate a component that is not available yet, because it belongs to a library which is deeper in the build dependency tree at the time the unit test is built and executed during the compilation. - Functional tests, that require a working scene with probably more components than the one actually tested. These tests can be longer and therefore should not be mandatory during the compilation. ; They will be run only in ci machines, but can be also easily executed by any developers on its machine mostly to debug what is the nature of a new regression in these kind of tests. ; From our experience at InSimo these kinds of tests regress quite often during the development of a new feature, because you make some optimisation in the code, and you get some epsilon difference, or because you change the approach entirely and the scene is no longer relevant for you and should be changed. So you probably do not want too many of these functional tests, but there should be enough so that it is representative of the overall kind of simulations you want to support. ; But anyway it is ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/471#issuecomment-337507243:1097,avail,available,1097,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/471#issuecomment-337507243,1,['avail'],['available']

The custom behavior are the virtual function (eg: fwdMechanicalState). By default these functions do nothing. It is the responsability of the visitors in-heriting from BaseMechanicalVisitor to override them to match implement the behavior they needs. In the drafted code before... you can notice the line:; ```cpp; stopAtMechanicalmapping(node.mapping); ```; This is also a function implemented in BaseMechanicalVisitor that by default, check the data fields in the provided node.mapping to control if the mechanical action has to be done or stopped. . Let's narrow now down to the constraints. To process the constraints different visitors are used, these visitors inherits from BaseMechanicalVisitors without changing the processNodeTopDown() but instead overiding things in the method fwdConstraintSet(), ; - MechanicalGetConstraintResolutionVisitor ; - MechanicalGetConstraintInfoVisitor; - MechanicalGetConstraintViolationVisitor; - MechanicalAccumulateConstraint2; - MechanicalSetConstraint; - MechanicalAccumulateJacobian. These constraint specific methods are called at the end of the processNodeTopDown() these lines are reached only if the call to stopAtMechanicalMapping() returns false. To make that happens ; all these visitors are overriding stopAtMechanicalMapping() so it returns always false. . The storeLambda was the only one not doing that (which is now fixed with the PR).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/854#issuecomment-446583409:2200,down,down,2200,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/854#issuecomment-446583409,1,['down'],['down']

Shall I create a PR like that?. I am currently tracking down some real issue with SOFA crashing on a VTU input, and having this buffer overflow on my way is a distraction. While it's not hard to fix it locally, this thread shows that I am not the first bitten by it, and suggests I won't be the last. It will save everyone time and effort, if we fix trivialities.

Availability,"re used improperly. Making these tests is very important to avoid un-detected bugs on the error handling code paths and it bring a lot to the general quality of sofa. . About the fact that the ""error as test failure by default"" is covering 99% of our tests... to me this is an indication that our tests are only covering half of the things they should and I'm not sure we should facilitate this behavior. . This is why I came up to making the things explicit in each test because it force the test writer to specify what are his underlying assumption and expectation for each of his tests making things very clear. In addition it put in front of his eyes what he is testing.. and what he is not testing. . PS: I really like the very detailed test failure that are reported with the explicit approach, we have either the filename & lineno of the failing test as well as the location of the message emission. ; eg: https://ci.inria.fr/sofa-ci/job/ubuntu_gcc-4.8_options/5020/testReport/(root)/DilateEngine_test_0/NormalBehavior/. EDIT: Your question make me think that some way to improve the things so maybe we can discuss what are the desirable features and how to expose them to the developpers. This is very hard because it is connected to lack of standardized way our code base reports errors (not exception, some uses error codes ,some uses messages).

Availability,"rning if `this` is explicitly used when initializing member variables, as it is not fully constructed yet; * however, compilers are happy with calling a method, which itself use `this`, hence the initial implementation of `initData()` (which was called `dataField()`) had the `this` pointer implicitely, but needed the `Data*` pointer to add if to the ""fields"" map, which is why it was provided as an explicit parameter to the method; * later changes refactored this to add new features (such capturing which level of the class hierarchy is creating each Data), and the actual registration of the `Data*` in the list within Base was moved to the Data constructor, where the `Data*` pointer is available so the one from `initData()` became redundant. The newer similar design for initializing BaseLink did use an `initLink()` method without this pointer. And regarding this change:; * a useful aspect of having the pointer to the Data as the first parameter of `initData()` is to unambiguously know the type of the final `Data<T>`, so that there could be (relatively) good compile errors if the type of the provided default value is not matching it. I'm not sure how this PR is affecting / handling that (i.e. if you set a `float` value as a default to a `Data<int>`, how the gcc/clang/msvc error messages look like?); * one drawback in the current design is that there are sometimes bugs introduced by the multiple overloads of `initData()`, because of the ambiguity between the optional default value and the optional pair of bool flags at the end. In particular, for a `Data<std::string>`, calling `initData(&d, ""mydefaultvalue"", ""mydata"", ""help message"")` will incorrectly use the `initData()` version without default value but with one boolean flag, as `""mydefaultvalue""` is a `const char*` which requires a ""user-defined"" conversion to `std::string`, while `""help message""` is implicitely convertible to `bool` without any ""user-defined"" conversion, so preferred by the compiler.

It's actually even better, because:; - I don't have to create inputs with the fields I pass to the constructor. It could be simple data (addNewData vs addNewInput); - Construction of datafields is more explicit, thus less error-prone; - No need to go search for a decorator function somewhere in SofaPython, or to declare a dictionary of default arguments, everything is performed in the constructor. So, yeah, this PR is now virtually useless.; There's one thing I don't like with this syntax though, it's that the creation of the object is performed at the same time as it is assigned to the scene graph, which, in my opinion is not always desirable.; Something closer to this would be neat:; ```py; rootNode.addObject(PyEng(name='PSDE', positions=loader.findData('position').getLinkPath()); ```.

Availability,"sse,. I'm not fully sure I understand the problem...but extern declaration of template are not related to old version of gcc in any way they are related to wether or not we control where the templated code is instanciated. The default behavior is that any used templates are instanciated and code is generated in each translation unit (so in each .cpp there is the compilation of the full Vec<double, 3>, Vec<real, 3> for every templates used). The consequence is that this generates huge binary (.o) files each containing identical machine code. This duplicated machine code in every .o is removed during the link. So said differently the compiler makes a lot of work to generate machine code then the linked makes a lot of code to remove it and keep only one version. The solution in c++ is to use the ""extern"" keyword to tell the compiler not to instanciate the templated code, extern means that the machine code will be provide elsewhere. To work and not have link error it is the needed to have a least one version of the template instanciated somewhere. This is why in the .cpp files we often instanciate the same template (without the extern). ; The design pattern o use to avoid the redeclaration warnings is a bit tricky so here is an example.; In myclass.h; ```cpp; template<typename T> ; MyClass ; {; /// ...; };. /// here is the trick .. to differentiate when we include the .h everywhere in the codebase where we want the extern from where it is included from myclass.cpp where we don't want it we do the following; #ifndef MY_CLASS_CPP ; extern template MyClass<double> /// d'ont emit machinecode for this one we provides it ""somewhere else""; extern template MyClass<float> /// don't emit machinecode for this one we provides it ""somewhere else""; #endif /// ; ``` .

Having such error indicates that the content of the file you are trying to parse is considere as invalid xml content. .

So I know it is trivial but can you first check that the content of the file is the one from our repository and that it was not changed ? . If it is then maybe it is a more complex issue.; I just checked the file you are trying to load and noticed that it is missing the xml prefix.; ```xml; <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>; ...; ```. Your github account says you are from moscow, so I wonder if this could be a character encoding issue.

Deployability," But I don't think the library should do this in the user's back without transparency. > you need to handle the case where the loaded scene already has python scripts, and let the PythonEnvironment know the interpreter is being run from the outside when initializing (and maybe deal with all the sys.path / __file__ abuses down there). The PythonEnvironment will create an interpreter if there isn't one (like when launching for a binary executable), or use the one already defined. In this case, PythonEnvironment will use the interpreter that called the script (ex python runSofaPython.py). No new python interpreter nor python thread a created (I've just checked to be sure). > probably have a good fight with the GIL down the road. The current GIL usage in the plugin seems to align correctly with this feature since we ""attach"" the PythonEnvironment to an interpreter instead of initialising a new one. No new threads are created. > how should this feature integrate with existing python scenes? Should it be possible to load scenes from within python scenes?. Yes, it seems to work so far. However:. - Loading the SofaPlugin library from within a python script that already imported it should be avoid for now since I'm not sure what side effects this will bring. Right now doing it seems not so bad as, again, we only attach the environment to the already created python environment. ; - A ScriptController will need to be added in order to trigger script events so that the python scene's functions (initGraph, onBeginAnimationStep, etc) are called. The createScene function is called by the SceneLoaderPY so this one is fine. > (I would probably put your feature in a module separate from Sofa for this reason).

Deployability," NG branch](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/tree/ng) on sofa-framework.; Still, all the developments will go through the PR process. Reminder: your feedback is VERY important, we need it to adapt our work and minimize future rollbacks. **Do not hesitate to put any comment in the pull-requests.**. ## Refactoring and adapting SPM for Sofa.Component.Utils. SPM is the set of scripts we use to make our work easily reproducible. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/guparan/sofa2ng). This work made me realize that it will be very hard, if not impossible, to anticipate every subtle change needed by the refactoring.; - Do we want SPM to be an all inclusive script to refactor completely SOFA? ; every refactoring is unique and needs to change SPM ; -> namespace handling ; -> includes refactoring; - Or should we prefer it to be an easy-to-use script to **bootstrap** any refactoring? ; -> very specific changes will have to be done by hand. I propose to go for solution 2 and to provide a git patch covering the work done after SPM job (fixing includes, fixing namespaces, ...). The progress of this task is **85%** since I now have to create the patch and to provide everything in the PR. ## Moving on with Sofa.Helper.Bvh; Following [the latest iteration on NG architecture](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/sofang-v3) and Damien's first draft in his [cleanTheMessStep1](https://github.com/SofaDefrost/sofa/tree/cleanTheMessStep1/ng) branch, I started refactoring SofaFramework with Sofa.Helper.Bvh. This task needed me to heavily change/adapt SPM. It contributed to make me prefer solution 2 above. The progress of this task is **60%**. TODO:; - update the recipe with latest SPM changes (namespace handling); - adapt SPM output for smooth transition from SOFA; - create the patch; - open a PR. ## Next steps; - Finalize and merge Sofa.Component.Utils PR; - Open a new PR: Sofa.Helper.Bvh; - Continue with SofaHelper refactoring. ----------.

Deployability," Pluginization works are possible but they have to be done in-place (not moving the files). This will permit to simplify the dependencies between SOFA modules. . About the NG branch, to avoid big divergence, we propose to merge it with master as soon as some big step is done. The next big step is SofaFramework coverage. ## Bootstrapping scripts. Previously named SPM, the [bootstrapping scripts](https://github.com/guparan/sofa2ng) are now able to handle test folders. ## Process. Here is the process to cover one module:; 1. Create/update a recipe based on an existing one.; 2. Run the bootstrapping scripts with the recipe.; 3. Inspect the output; 4. If something is wrong or missing, edit the bootstrapping scripts and *goto 1*; 5. Do specific changes by hand like namespace aliases; 6. Create a patch of all changes made by hand; 7. Open a pull-request providing the recipe and the patch (previously pushed to sofa2ng). This process will be rewritten in Sofa.Helper.Bvh pull-request. ## Sofa.Component.Utils. The first NG pull-request has been merged to the NG branch. There is still some updates to do though, because the bootstrapping scripts changed. ## Sofa.Helper.Bvh. The recipe has been updated. ; This work will be the base of further contributions. I will detail all the bootstrapping + patching process in the pull-request. ## Next steps; - Pluginize without moving files: use plugins mechanism to work on modules dependencies ; Start with the less dependent ones and progress towards SOFA core.; Objective: simplify dependencies between modules.; - Validate Damien's architecture proposal for SofaFramework: https://github.com/SofaDefrost/sofa/tree/cleanTheMessStep1/ng/kernel/Sofa; Particularly about Sofa.Helper.Types; - Create Sofa.Helper.Bvh pull-request; Will give a clear example and all the process to refactor parts of SofaFramework; - Progress within Sofa.Helper.*; Assign tasks to all volunteers before STC#5. ----------.

Deployability," load all the available plugins. Loading a library in the process memory will have several side effects which are difficult to anticipate before hand. The major one is the evaluation of all the global variables, which will result in populating the `ObjectFactory` with all the components that this library contains. I would suggest something different for this kind of having a list of default plugins that are loaded directly with your application ( here `runSofa` ). - derive a sort of sofa plugin manifest file, which can be generated as a post-build step. This should be an easy to parse file which could contain the various informations exposed by the `getModuleName()`, `getModuleVersion()`... without having to load the library in the process memory. This manifest file must be stored in an easy to find location in your build tree, an be installed properly ( they need also to be bundled when you deploy your application ). That means they should be located with a similar relative path with respect to the application ( `runSofa` ) when in the build tree or in the install tree. There should be a proposal about that to define : ; - the manifest file type ( ie how are we going to parse it ? json xml text ? ); - the manifest file content itself. - any application could then define the list of predefined plugin it wants to load using a simple configuration file. A default configuration can be provided, but it could be easily overriden. With this mechanism, no recompilation is required when you want to change the list of default plugins, you just change the config file. NB : a bit unrelated but there is a small code ""snippet"" that can be used to recover all the components attached to a library in two lines ; ```cpp; const char* getModuleComponentList(); {; /// string containing the names of the classes provided by the plugin; static std::string classes = sofa::core::ObjectFactory::getInstance()->listClassesFromTarget(sofa_tostring(SOFA_TARGET));; return classes.c_str();; }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/253#issuecomment-296982188:1422,install,install,1422,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/253#issuecomment-296982188,3,"['configurat', 'install']","['configuration', 'install']"

Deployability,",. I just had a look in the code and the associated paper ([link](https://hal.inria.fr/file/index/docid/394480/filename/NPF05.pdf)). @alxbilger, there are two `computeStress` methods in TriangularFEMForceField, with the following signatures :; ```; void computeStress(type::Vec<3,Real> &stress, Index elementIndex);; ```; and; ```; void computeStress(type::Vec<3,Real> &stress, const MaterialStiffness &K, const type::Vec<3,Real> &strain);; ```; Only the first one seems to use the same pattern as in `computeForce` (with the call to `computeStrainDisplacement` conditioned by `_anisotropicMaterial`), in case of small deformation, which is - as you pointed out - incoherent with what is in `computeForce`.; However this `computeStress` method with this signature is apparently used only in ; ```; void computeStressAlongDirection(Real &stress_along_dir, Index elementIndex, const Coord &direction);; ```; which itself is used only in both `computeStressAcrossDirection` methods, and (finally) these are apparently not called anywhere.; So, _bottomline_: even though the code in `computeStress` is incoherent with the code in `computeForce`, it's actually not used and - I guess - should be cleaned rather than made coherent. Regarding the initial issue, what I understand from the paper is that the strain-displacement matrix **should be updated at each time step** in case of large deformations. It seems to be clearly stated in the introduction, and demonstrated later in the text (section 2.3). I have a doubt if this is necessary in case of small displacement (for me the paper focuses on large deformation), but even in this case, the current implementation is not coherent (the update should be made in case of large displacement and could be saved in case of small displacement).; I think it's worth highlighting that it was actually the case at first, but it seems to have been changed in this [commit](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/commit/b7d68ef394f703957e7a00037f88d7abeed82d24).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2706#issuecomment-1056847653:1344,update,updated,1344,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2706#issuecomment-1056847653,2,['update'],"['update', 'updated']"
Deployability,",. May was quite quiet for our beloved NG project.; Don't worry, I still have some news for you :wink:. ## Discussions. Pluginization works are possible but they have to be done in-place (not moving the files). This will permit to simplify the dependencies between SOFA modules. . About the NG branch, to avoid big divergence, we propose to merge it with master as soon as some big step is done. The next big step is SofaFramework coverage. ## Bootstrapping scripts. Previously named SPM, the [bootstrapping scripts](https://github.com/guparan/sofa2ng) are now able to handle test folders. ## Process. Here is the process to cover one module:; 1. Create/update a recipe based on an existing one.; 2. Run the bootstrapping scripts with the recipe.; 3. Inspect the output; 4. If something is wrong or missing, edit the bootstrapping scripts and *goto 1*; 5. Do specific changes by hand like namespace aliases; 6. Create a patch of all changes made by hand; 7. Open a pull-request providing the recipe and the patch (previously pushed to sofa2ng). This process will be rewritten in Sofa.Helper.Bvh pull-request. ## Sofa.Component.Utils. The first NG pull-request has been merged to the NG branch. There is still some updates to do though, because the bootstrapping scripts changed. ## Sofa.Helper.Bvh. The recipe has been updated. ; This work will be the base of further contributions. I will detail all the bootstrapping + patching process in the pull-request. ## Next steps; - Pluginize without moving files: use plugins mechanism to work on modules dependencies ; Start with the less dependent ones and progress towards SOFA core.; Objective: simplify dependencies between modules.; - Validate Damien's architecture proposal for SofaFramework: https://github.com/SofaDefrost/sofa/tree/cleanTheMessStep1/ng/kernel/Sofa; Particularly about Sofa.Helper.Types; - Create Sofa.Helper.Bvh pull-request; Will give a clear example and all the process to refactor parts of SofaFramework; - Progress within Sofa.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/543#issuecomment-393927223:1035,patch,patch,1035,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/543#issuecomment-393927223,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,". You have to take the whole picture into consideration, everyone is not using serialization/deserialization as ""pairs"". The actual default serialization format is used in a lot of other software (GUIs, scene processing tools written in python, perl and C++). If you change the behavior of the default serialization mechanism all of them will stop working and required to be updated. This is a very, very, very nasty thing to impose to other users of Sofa. A PR doing has no changes to be accepted. . Actually tests is part of our guard line because they validates the API compatibility and allow us to detect changes that breaks it. The existing tests should be considered as validating the ""the existing"" sofa API. It was normal to have them to fail on your PR because it shows that the PR was breaking the compatibility. . I really like the idea of keeping the old serialization behavior as it is and add the other deserialization as an extra feature. This will make the whole PR transparent for users that don't want to update their code base. It thus it can be merged very quickly. . About the test: ; You are right that it would be better if we had test specific tests to validate the serialization alone.; I personally would like to have tests to validate that getValueString() return ""1 2 3"" and that getValueAsPythonString() return ""[1 2 3]"" . And also as you said having tests to validate against the real values instead of their serialization would be nice. . . About the branches:; The rule is to never work directly on the sofa-framework repository. There is no reason to do so (if you really want to make two PR one in anatoscope and one in sofa ... you need to to that from two branches located in the anatoscope repo). Otherwise this consume a lot of disk space on the CI servers that we have to fix manually. Now fundamentally from my experience in playing with PR and branches I think that making two PR will be very complex for you to handle. Because the PR you issued to anatoscope",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/330#issuecomment-315028626:1203,update,update,1203,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/330#issuecomment-315028626,1,['update'],['update']

This is an important topic that I think should be included into the current discussions to refactor the way SOFA construct its system matrices. Also related: can we detect if a diagonal mass remains diagonal if it gets mass contribution via mappings? Does mapped mass even work in SOFA?.

Deployability,"> I think from a user perspective it is easier to understand names like ""PyScriptableComponent"" or even ""PyComponent"", because that is what they are: components, just like any other in Sofa, with Datas, Inputs and Outputs and a certain behavior. This is not really correct actually:; The pythonScriptController is not really a component (i.e a Sofa class inheriting BaseObject) as it possesses extra features, such as the possibility to create the scene graph from scratch, send events to other controllers etc. It is not a purely simple 1to1 binding of its C++ methods in Python. In that way, I agree with you that calling it a PyController makes more sense than to call it a PyBaseObject for instance, or pyComponent, since it does more.; The current PSDE is actually as far from a Std sofa component (core::objectmodel::BaseObject) as the PythonScriptController: the PSDE is much closer in terms of behaviour to that of Sofa's DataEngine components: the key difference is that DataEngines, contrary to BaseObjects, is a call for action on the modification of one of its input datafield. The update method is not present in a BaseObject or in a PythonScriptController. In that way it completely mimics the behavior of the DataEngines in Sofa.

Could you confirm that your clang-format file complies with [the astyle configuration](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/blob/master/tools/astyle/sofa.astyle)?. Almost... I went through each of the options in the style sheet to make sure, but:; * *--indent-labels*: this is not supported by clang-format. This astyle option indents C-style labels (goto labels) as if it were a normal instruction in its scope. clang-format offers an option `IndentGotoLabels` but it will either align it with the root of its scope (true,) or align them at the first column in the file. for more info on this option:; [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66511380/1376968). But to me, it seems like a bad idea to indent labels the way astyle does. clang-format's makes more sense to me. * *--add-braces*: This one is more problematic: clang-format supports this option since its latest version (clang-format-15.0.0), BUT, here's what they say in the doc:. _**Warning**_. _**Setting this option to true could lead to incorrect code formatting due to clang-format’s lack of complete semantic information. As such, extra care should be taken to review code changes made by this option.**_. Linter tools, like clang-tidy, let you do that also...; Most importantly, clang-format's default package version on ubuntu is v10.0.0. v12 can be found in ubuntu's default package manager, but for v15 you gotta look for the package in external repos or compile it yourself.

[polynomial_spring_test.zip](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/files/4540453/polynomial_spring_test.zip). The test ""spring_verification.py"" depicts two points (p1, p2) connected with a spring. One point (p1) is fixed, another (p2) is moving in space. The external impact (f_external) to the system could be applied using LinearForceField (you need to make target_force as a Data<> object in order to collect its information, but I have this modification) or ControlPoint (third point (p_control), attached with a linear rest shape spring). In case of a second option, the external force is computed as (p_control - p2)*k_rest_shape_spring.; During the simulation process, the position ""p2"" and forces ""f2"" for point p2, and also the external force or the position of the control point are saved to data files.; The script ""spring_verification_draw_result.py"" loads all data. The strain for spring is computed as ; (norm(p2-p1) - l0) / l0 for PolynomialSpring or as norm(p2-p1) / l0 for RestShapePolynomialSpring.; I use static solver with many iterations to make spring force equal to external force, but I guess it is also possible to compute the spring force as difference f2 - f_external.; Based on this data, a force-strain relation is plotted and compared with polynomial values.; And this is the end of the test.

Hi @epernod ! After reviewing my code a bit more, I now remember why MeshLoader doesn't contain a ""generic"" update callback: there's no ""load"" method in MeshLoader, only a set of datafield definitions, then used by other components subclassing it. thus a callback function would not be able to perform any loading operation on input changes. I agree that it is sub-optimal to have to add a specific callback for each meshLoaders (although they have custom behaviors anyway) but as-is I don't see how to better the current system. Ideally, we could imagine having a pure virtual ""load"" method overridden in the subclasses, which would then be callable from a callbackEngine, but that would probably go out of the scope of this PR.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1408#issuecomment-643164248:299,update,update,299,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1408#issuecomment-643164248,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"@damienmarchal , discussions during the SOFA-dev meeting lead to a question over the developed design and your opinion is needed. . The problem was that some scenes tests where crashing at exit. This is due to the SofaPython3 cache (`s_objectcache` there https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/blob/1b5d271aa21df06c4c5ab75599e364adb0c1e9be/Plugin/src/SofaPython3/DataHelper.cpp#L252C1-L252C73) . The problem was that this is a static object containing python objects and is thus cleaned at the very end of the program exit, after the python interpreter, which is not authorized. . To fix it, following [pybind11 suggestions](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/misc.html) I've added a member to the module Sofa.Core that insured that the cleanup is called while the interpreter is still alive (see the PR https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/pull/425). But is was not enough because the interpreter is not cleaned correctly either : the static method ""Release"" of SofaPython3, in charge of cleaning up python and deleting the interpreter was never called when launching scene in runSofa. . This lead to the need of cleaning up *explicitly* the plugin before exiting the main function. This design was not liked by every dev, some wanting a Raii-like cleanup, in the destructor of some member, which is in my mind not possible because the interpreter instance is static in the SofaPython3 plugin and thus we have no guaranty that it would not be deleted before any other static member.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4828#issuecomment-2233357216:983,Release,Release,983,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4828#issuecomment-2233357216,1,['Release'],['Release']

Deployability,@fredroy This is a very good question and definitely worth investigation. . To me this is related to a systematic problem we have regarding the mix between Data update through DDG or updates using toModel and fromModel.

Deployability,"@fredroy what do you think about the feedback from @fjourdes and @JeremieA ? . This topic interests me because it is connected with a usability issue I would like to see solved one day. . Suppose you are using ""BeamAdapter"". After some time you stop using ""BeamAdapter"" and one year later you (or a collegue/successor) want to reload the scene. It will not work and the user has no idea why the scene is not working anymore (he forgot he is no compiling the plugin anymore). . There is no such problem when there is ```<RequirePlugin name=""BeamAdapter"" url=""http://www.experimental.com/BeamAdapter.html""/>``` but people forgot them too often because they are 'silently' loaded by runSofa. . In that view, the autoload system, by facilitating people not to write the ```<RequiredPlugin>``` does not seems very appealling to me making the situation worse. . This is why I suggest to add to add a mechanism that warns users each time a scene is loaded and this scene contains component based on either autoloaded (or loaded from a configuration file) plugins.; A gentle reminder like that would be great: ; ```; Warning(root): This scene is using components (Beam) from the plugin 'BeamAdapter' but ; the plugin is not indicated as required in your scene. ; Please fix your scene by cut&pasting the following line at the beggining. ; <RequiredPlugin name=""BeamAdapter"" url=""http://www.experimental.com/BeamAdapter.html""/> ; ```.

Deployability,@hugtalbot I already give my opinion in #PR 330. ; And it is: please don't merge it now and give us time to find a smoother way of managing the API change. . I re-explain the situation: ; This PR add Python like serialization&deserialization ; - The de-serialization preserve backward compatibility. ; - The serizaliation is changing the behavior on how Sofa is serializing data. The new behavior is implemented in place of the old one and thus is breaking the API. This API exists since years in Sofa. It will thus cost time to fix & update external code-base. The situation is made worse because the API breaks is silent (ie the code will compile but not work as expected). Breaking the API is not mandatory to implement a python like serialization. So I strongly recommend to implement a non breaking solution as a transition... ; Alternative solutions I have in mind are:; - a cheap10 lines python approach based on repr (see previous response) (A PR with this would change two time less files and be a non breaking change).; - a full C++ version in the form of a getStringValueAsPython ; - a full C++ version in the form of an extra parameter to getStringValue; - ...other ?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/332#issuecomment-318173945:535,update,update,535,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/332#issuecomment-318173945,1,['update'],['update']

The update function is ""manually called"" from handleEvent, but it actually shouldn't be, because this is redundant to how DataEngine works, which is having its update() method called **when and only when** a component, taking as an input the output data of that engine, calls getValue() on that data, WHILE any of the engine's INPUTS are flagged dirty. . So basically, while some people call update() in their handleEvent method, this should never be done, except in some (quite) twisted cases.; Btw, it took me quite some time to understand that.. few months ago, all my engines were calling update() in handleEvent, and I had a lot of problems because of that.. ^^. Technically, in the case of the scriptDataEngine, if you remove entirely the call to the update function in handleEvent, and if your dependency graph is well built, you should get the behavior you want",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-407008370:365,update,update,365,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-407008370,8,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"@sescaida Thanks for the review; The reason why I didn't add examples for this PR is because the current examples themselves, without any modification, demonstrate that it works as-is, thus showing that the call to update() in the handleEvent method was redundant with the default DDGNode's update mechanism. Basically, if your scene is well created (links are properly made between datafields & data are correctly accessed by components lower in the scene graph), everything should work just as well as before. The only difference I would say, is that the user has the hand over the cleanDirty() method, which allows him to fix use cases where a read acces is performed on an input, after setting an output's value has been set, in update(). as for whether it is a good idea to keep that system, I must say, that I agree with you, as we discussed before: Bringing the complexity of the DDGNode's mechanism in Python might be something we want to avoid.; Although, I think that the good approach to fight this issue would rather be to solve the problem on the C++ side (simplifying the Data-Update mechanism) than to diverge from it by simplifying the Python process.; I think @damienmarchal woul be the best placed to give us a feedback on this question, maybe?

Deployability,"@sescaida as a reply to you previous comment:. - I think we should indeed remove the call to update from handleEvent, in the dataEngine. Although there are some twisted cases where it is necessary, it is not how it was designed initially I believe. I'd like @damienmarchal 's input on that, though.; Concerning the default value in addNewOutput, I totally agree with you. The only reason I kept it is because it would have even more impact on the error handling codebase in Sofa, which currently forces the existence of a ""value"" field to guarantee that the datatype can be deduced (which we are bypassing for outputs..); Overall, I think there's a decent amount of cleaning to do in this PR before it can be merged, including removing all the warnings that appear because we're working our way around the ""standard"" way to build datafields.; - I also agree with you that we need some reviews on this PR, and maybe also split it in multiple PRs for simpler reviewing.

It could be simple data (addNewData vs addNewInput); - Construction of datafields is more explicit, thus less error-prone; - No need to go search for a decorator function somewhere in SofaPython, or to declare a dictionary of default arguments, everything is performed in the constructor.

After testing a little bit the engines, I noticed that the only case where it wouldn't work (to have all the data updates & cleanDirty() before calling the update() method would be in the very unlikely case where the update() method would fetch an earlier engine in the dependency graph through getContext, and set its output value. this is very unlikely, which means that, apart for some performance reasons, I don't see why it would be important to bind the cleanDirty() method in python.

The problem is that when building with recent VS, VS adds and extra directory (Release or Debug) so the ""../"" in ""../bin"" is ""not enough"" to go to the sofa root install directory which result in searching for plugins in PATH/bin/bin instead of PATH/bin and PATH/bin/share instead of PATH/share. 2) The problem is specific to people that are using Visual Studio build solution for their builds as VS adds Release/Debug subdirectory to the build directory. The problem was probably existing before but it was made very obvious since PR #518 & PR #502 as now we always use the relative location to the executable to find the files like plugins or resoures. 3) I assume that the problem was not visible in our CI because for windows builds we are using Ninja with VC compiler; as we don't use a real VS solution the Release/Debug extra path were not added. . 4) Erwan is working on a fix, to force CMake not to emit the extra subdirectories when using VS solution, it is currently in a private branch : ). @ErwanDouaille please complete the summary is needed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/561#issuecomment-358042600:360,Release,Release,360,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/561#issuecomment-358042600,4,"['Release', 'install']","['Release', 'install']"

Deployability,"Agreed, I don't like adding a Data in every component just for this.; I think the underlying issue of having an empty scene bounding box when there is not visual models could also by fixed relatively simply and without introducing much cost by:; - including the collision models top-most bounding boxes that are already computed during each time step (in fact this could be the only information used by default, as it is cheaper in practice to obtain than the visual bounding boxes because it's already computed for the broad phase); - and/or having a flag in `DrawTool` to look at the given coordinates to compute a bounding box of all non-visual but visible elements. As the DrawTool API is quite inefficient anyway the overhead may be insignificant, and it will disappear in cases where there is no debug information visualised. To me this could be controlled by one of the master component in the root node, either the `AnimationLoop` (as the issue is when `UpdateBBox` happens and how it is implemented, bonus point is that this component would then have the ability to schedule it in parallel with the other computations), or the `VisualManager` (as the current use cases for bounding boxes are currently exclusively to setup the scene rendering bounds and/or show bounds of a subgraph).

Deployability,"Dear @faichele ,. Following the SOFA dev meeting 25/01/2017.; Multi-threading plugin proposed by @faichele. Your new plugin implements a static scheduling for collision detection. The implementation does not require any change of the existing collision components of SOFA. The bounding volume hierarchy methods is parallelized. It should be easy to use. Compared to the approach used in the MultiThreading plugin using the ""work-stealing"" scheduling pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing), Fabian's implementation is based on ""conventional"" work-sharing, with a ""round-robin"" assignment of collision pair checks per thread. One extension is the fact that worker threads are persistent: they do not terminate after processing all assigned tasks, and no new threads are spawned when new collision pair check tasks are added to the thread pool. Instead, worker threads enter a ""sleeping"" state to avoid using CPU cycles when no tasks are processed. This avoids unnecessary respawning of threads every 10 to 50 ms, since the collision detection is typically called very often and in quick succession. @faichele , you mentioned it will be released under open-source license and with standalone for beta testing. Tests on potential performance gains remain to do (number of per checks).; Do not hesitate to correct me. In the context of the recent coding sprint, some new feature around multithreading were added in a branch ( https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/tree/issofa_multithreading ), not merged yet. This should be discussed and merged at the upcoming STC. @JeremieA , would you agree to prepare a short illustration/explanation of the API changes of your multithreading feature branch?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/24#issuecomment-275074830:1149,release,released,1149,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/24#issuecomment-275074830,1,['release'],['released']

Since the release of sofapython3, I'm waiting someone having interest on that topic so we can modernize the prefab's using the added feature of sp3 and experience gained since sofapython2. . Short answers to your questions: ; - should they be located in the SofaPython3 plugin?; It is unclear to me about what you are talking about, prefab are already in SofaPython3. Are you in fact talking about the prefab that are in stlib ? ; If this is the case, it make sense to have prefab in SofaPython3 to demonstrate a ""standard"" way of doing a prefab through ""examples"", there could also have a standard prefab library, but I see no problem in having that in stlib or any other third party plugin. That's said, I don't consider the prefab in stlib mature enough for such move, first, because they are still implemented as they were back to python2 time, and up to now, not a lot of people have expressed interest in changing that to move forward; . - should we create many level of abstractions/prefabs?; From the experience in stlib there is always a trade-off between abstraction and usability and the overhead of modularization. But yes, there is always an interest in being able to build prefab from other prefab to make complex systems. . - definition of current prefabs, e.g. ElasticObject using a UniformMass?; Prefab just means you have an ""all-in-one"" object. There is no more constraint except from that. So it the choice of the one that make a prefab to decide prefabricating ""what"". That's said it is highly desirable to have set of prefabs that shares common structures and idioms so they are interoperable in the same scene. . Additional point:; - the prefabs implementation in SofaPython3 is only partially working and some fix are required; - there is a far too much limited support for prefab in our user interface, if we are going for generalize their use then additional support should be added.(eg: right-click navigating itno prefab s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/4206#issuecomment-1740442279:61,release,release,61,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/4206#issuecomment-1740442279,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Hello @alxbilger,. Thank for the careful review, I will integrate that if the feature is considered worth for inclusion. . About the ""addTargetName"" question. . The initial version proposed was using automatic registration of the target name and I can revert back to this one. ; But I proposed a second, explicit, approach for two reasons:; - the automatic mecanism force the deployement of the new approach for all the sofa code components at once... which I was not sure we agreed at this point. ; - the existing mecanism to define the target in ObjectFactory.h is buggy because two identical ObjectFactory::register<XX> compiled in different compilation units produces different getTarget() functions. There was an agreement we should remove it, so this PR was a good opporunity to trying such a thing. . Hope this clarify things. EDIT:; I just found a funny bug related to the automatic registration. Because it rely on the use of a backward macro expansion. There is currently more than 20 components that does not have their target properly set.; Eg: DataDisplay.cpp the code is like that:; ```cpp; #include <sofa/core/ObjectFactory.h>; #include <sofa/defaulttype/VecTypes.h>. #include <SofaOpenglVisual/config.h>; #include <SofaOpenglVisual/DataDisplay.h>; #include <sofa/core/visual/VisualParams.h>. namespace sofa::component::visual::model; {; int DataDisplayClass = core::RegisterObject(""Rendering of meshes colored by data""); .add< DataDisplay >();; }; ```. The problem is that the ```SOFA_TARGET``` macro is used in ```ObjetFactory``` but is actually initialized in ```<SofaOpenglVisual/config.h>```; To fix the code it is needed to move the inclusion of the config.h before the one of ObjectFactory so that RegisterObject behave as expected. ; ```cpp; #include <SofaOpenglVisual/config.h>; #include <sofa/core/ObjectFactory.h>; #include <sofa/defaulttype/VecTypes.h>. #include <SofaOpenglVisual/DataDisplay.h>; #include <sofa/core/visual/VisualParams.h>; ```.

Deployability,"Hello François, . Here is a summary of my current understanding of your comments. ; It seems that you want to:; 1 - cut the dependency to SofaTest; 2 - have a clear separation between unittest vs functionaltest; 3 - cut the dependency to SofaFramework (ie not having the test inheriting from SofaFramework/BaseTest or something like that) for the unittests. . Initially this PR was only about -1- cutting the dependency to SofaTest. My thinking is that the SofaTest dependency is a major problem for everyone using the master branch of sofa because of the high impact on code coupling. . About -2- Following your remarks I'm in favor of improving a more clear separation between unit-test and functional test but as this is something new and maybe this should discussed that in the ""issues"" section of github instead of inside a specific PR. . About -3- cutting the dependency to SofaFramework. This is something that was never discussed before and worse than that, up to now the general consensus that, as we are in Sofa, we should inherit from a single BaseTest that install all the may be needed to do the test. A good reason for this scenario is nothing related to Scene/Simulation management but because BaseTest provides a default handler for EXPECT_MSG_EMIT/NOEMIT. Of course if your code is not using at all those elements, then you should feel free to use gtest. . As said in previous comment compared to the current Sofa code base I would be very happy to have -1- and -2- done. . It seems that -3- is not a big deal for people using the CMakelists.txt from Sofa but it may be of importance for your specific workflow in which, if I understand your previous answers, you integrate unittest as compilation failure. Maybe you can provide us more details on your workflow so that we can see the drawback of having the tests written in SofaFramework to be inheriting from a BaseTest (which is also defined in SofaFramework).

Deployability,"Hello,. Before I explain the bug, let me give a bit of context (it is a bit long, but I hope it is useful ;)). The point of this change was to make it transparent which topology is used by which state, and allow for correct initialization and most importantly topological changes propagation. One issue with the initial implementation, associating a state to the first topology found in its parents and then ignoring it if it is not in the same context (hopefully in all codes using state->m_topology, but who checked?), is that this make it impossible to share the same topology (and topological changes) with multiple states in different (children) nodes. One such example is when you use an IdentityMapping (or a Rigid <-> Vec3 mapping or any other mapping that produce the same number of outputs as its inputs), previously to get correct topology association and changes propagation you would need to replicate the topology (and the topological mappings) with a topology both before and after the mapping (but beware if they end up with different sizes, or updated in the wrong order...). With our changes, there is a clear(er) method BaseContext::getActiveMeshTopology() that you can call from any context and will give you the topology that is relevant for this context, i.e. either the topology at this exact node, or from a parent node but only if there is no mapping in between (or if there are only mappings whose sameTopology() method returns true). Using this method, state->l_topology is initialized (and you can inspect its result in the GUI), and if it is not NULL it will be used by all computations for the state without extra hidden checks. Now back to this bug, the last issue here was that the tested mapping (TetrahedronVolumeMapping) was not preserving the topology, but its output state was somehow linked to its input topology. The solution is not to go back to the old (broken) behavior, but instead to understand what is the actual root cause here. Theoretically, if the logi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/243#issuecomment-335477201:1061,update,updated,1061,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/243#issuecomment-335477201,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"Hello,. Here are a few remarks and suggestions regarding this topic:. 1. I would be wary about relying on performance measurements from a blog post that is 8 years old and does not mention the exact platform and compilers used. Thread Local Storage (TLS) is highly dependent on OS, ABI, compiler, flags. Here is for instance a quick test using compiler explorer: https://godbolt.org/z/6ObfHR.; 2. one usage requiring ExecParams to have a thread-local storage was to be able to do asynchronous loops (mainly simulation and rendering) with full access to the scene graph without copies, by using copy-on-write for large Data and having each thread be assigned a ""version"" (called ""aspect"" per the published work that was used). See the MultithreadGUI for an example of this mechanism.; 3. As far as I know, all asynchronous/external rendering engines integrations that are used with Sofa relied instead on a design where the Sofa scene graph is not exposed but only visual meshes (based on SofaPhysicsAPI), therefore this feature was never enabled/tested in real applications so it can make sense to remove it.; 4. It would be interesting to measure if there are any performance gained from just removing the TLS qualifier (as done in PR #1129). I expect it to not be measurable, but performances can be surprising, which is why any optimization efforts should measure before and after ;); 5. If the TLS part of ExecParams is removed, then you should also remove everything that depends on it: MultithreadGUI, ExecParams::threadID, aspectID, AspectPool, *AspectVisitor, DDGNode::currentAspect()/copyAspect()/..., and all the aspect-related features in Data and Link. Otherwise all these code will be silently broken by the change.; 6. Note that this also makes ExecParams itself a bit pointless. The initial rational was that this provides a thread-safe way to set parameters controlling all codes in such a way that even if it is not explicitly passed in to all API calls, it can be queried with ExecPa",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/1147#issuecomment-532775748:849,integrat,integrations,849,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/1147#issuecomment-532775748,1,['integrat'],['integrations']
Deployability,"Hello,. We had a very similar problem in a slightly different context (relying on python virtualenv on Linux).; The root cause was that the multiarray native lib is apparently expecting to be run from an executable that already export the python API symbols, either from the executable itself, or with libpython loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag. So the solution on Linux (found by @Ngautier) was to add a call to `dlopen(""<LIBPYTHONSONAME>"", RTLD_LAZY | RTLD_GLOBAL)` before initializing the embedded python interpreter (replacing LIBPYTHONSONAME by the internal name of the python library, such as `libpython2.7.so.1.0`).

By using the DDG machinery you can have the choice of when the updates is done... when A.componentState is changed or when B is needed ... (thanks the lazy DDG update mechanism). Finally if using the DDG it too heavy, it is also possible to use the DataTracker, this allows to detect data change (eg: A.componentState has changed) when you need to invalidate the cache.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4625#issuecomment-2042182871:245,update,updated,245,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4625#issuecomment-2042182871,3,['update'],"['update', 'updated', 'updates']"

Deployability,"Here is an update on our efforts to perform an automatic parallelization on Sofa. **Parallelism at the Visitor level :** . **General idea :**; Some visitors execute functions on multiple components (example : BaseMechanicalVisitor launches MechanicalVisitor::fwdForceField on a list of BaseForceFields).; The implementation of the function can vary depending on the actual type of the component. Usually, a function executing on different components will access the same data vectors while executing on each component (for example MechanicalVisitor::fwdForceField, calls addForce or addDForce on each component, each one modifying the force vector).; We define a **Parallel Section** as the execution of a given visitor function on a list of components.; We define a **Task** as the execution of a visitor function on a component. Therefore a parallel section is decomposed in an ordered list of tasks.; Each task accesses a given set of vectors (read or write accesses), and a given set of locations in these vectors. We can split the tasks in **phases** such that each phase accesses a subset of the vector locations. To facilitate this, we decompose the vectors into **blocks**, and we look at the vector blocks accessed by each task phase.; Then we can have phases of different tasks that do not accesses the same locations, and so are independent and can run in parallel.; Then we model the dependencies between the tasks phases, and we use the dependency graph to schedule the parallel executions of the phases, keeping the sequential order of the operations. . All the user should have to do is to flag visitors that can be launched in parallel on the components : use a parallel version of Visitor::for_each / for_each_r to enable parallel execution of the components. **Steps performed at runtime:**. 1. Creation of « parallel visitors » using a parallel version of Visitor::for_each functions; - parallel version of for_each starts a parallel section, and creates tasks; - a task is defined ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/24#issuecomment-330557289:11,update,update,11,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/24#issuecomment-330557289,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"Hey @alxbilger , thanks for this benchmark. My guest would be that solving one big system (the merge of both objects) is slower than solving to smaller system. However, solving two system independently should, I think, produce incorrect results as . 1. You are applying the interactions (for example, contact forces) at different solving states. For example, the first object is solved, its node positions are updated to the step t+1. Collisions are then computed. But the state of the second object is still at the time step t. Oscillation will therefore probably happen and the convergence will be delayed. ; 2. In addition, the solution state with both objects merged under the same system takes into account the interaction between the two objects. For example, when both objects are merged into a same system, you can create entries inside the system matrix to create a relationship between a node in the first object and a node in the second object. This is not possible when the two objects are separated. **TLDR**: Solving two objects independently is faster than solving one big system containing both objects. However it will take longer to converge to a steady solution (in number of steps), and even probably converge to an incorrect solution.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2089#issuecomment-842947771:410,update,updated,410,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2089#issuecomment-842947771,1,['update'],['updated']

Taking another look at this issue, and I realized that :; - contacts are created as SUB-nodes and connected to the associated object though a mapping; - then (if `response='default'` meaning Penality approach is chosen for the ContactResponse), a PenalityContactForceField is added in the root node with a BarycentricPenalityContact which distributes the spring forces on the SUB-node MechanicalObject.

Meaning we need to recompute the output from new input value. . But as several mechanisms are required for this design, the `update `method is calling the method `doUpdate `which has to be implemented in each specific engine in middle of other code.

Deployability,"Hi @alxbilger @courtecuisse . We understand what this function was used for in BaseFF. However, the API for topological changes introduced by @epernod more than a year ago now uses callbacks. Such callbacks appear to me like the appropriate way to implement an optimized update of the local stiffness (only on the updated elements). This PR proposed to remove a function, which had no implementation in the core. No feature in the code base, so it was polluting the code base and making it harder for new developers to read the API. @alxbilger had explicitly asked for feedback, and the above discussion led to the confirmation of this deletion.; However, you make a point: SOFA should indeed include examples (scenes and code) of 3D cutting and such contributions are most expected.

To have more insight I just made a quick test with the following result: ; The time to create 200 000 (empty) component (without calling the init function):; - with 6 Data field is 1.10sec; - with 10 Data field is 1.55sec; So one data field added to a component cost 0.05ms at component creation (it is higher than what I expected). ; Now for a more realistic scenario with 200 SphereModel created and initialized one extra data field rise the cost from 3.1 ms 3.2ms and that this is 'dialuated' in all the other cost (collision detection, mechanics). . About your suggestion to set everything to persistent by default and have each component decide what is good to save or not. This is what SOFA actually does and this behave terribly. ; I see two reason for that:; - there is a lot of component that 'forgot' to set/unset the persistent values.; - it is very hard to identify what is relevant to save, IMO because what is relevant to save is a matter of context of use, a Data 'useless' for one may be very useful for someone else. . This is why I choose to do things in the reversed way and let the client code to select what to save (so that you may eventually implement dedicated widgets to let the user select what to save). . I see at least to different context of use and thus saving strategies. . For my context of use it is more important to save scenes that are as close as possible as the one written by the user.

Deployability,"Hi Thomas,. Currently it seems there is some problem in compiling it, but fundamentally I think this is a great objective. ; Thank you very much to tackling this. . If I understand correctly now we can have the two syntax to read vectors (the one from Python and the historical one). +Backward compatibility is preserved and you added tests to validate the new behavior. This all looks great to me. . You also changed the getStringValue...here I think this is a problem as it will break a lot of third party code. This is why you had to fix a lot of failing test. Instead of changing the behavior of an existing function it would be much better to offer a second function to serialize to python format (or adds a parameter to the existing one to control the behavior eg: getStringValue(SerializingMode mode=SerializingMode::ClassicSofa)). The underlying idea is that by default old code will function as usual and ""awared"" users can take profit of the existing function getStringValueAsPython() or getStringValue(SerializingMode::Python). . I'm sorry because I think it probably took you a lot of time to update the failing tests but the tests shouldn't have been changed, only new one should have been added to validate the new syntax and corner case. . Minor details: ; There is some msg_error(""(S)Vector"") in vector shouldn't it be vector<> instead ?. ; Maybe you will find this pattern usefull: ; ```cpp; namespace sofa {; namespace helper {; namespace logging {; inline bool notMuted(const sofa::helper::io::MeshVTK* ){ return true; }; inline ComponentInfo::SPtr getComponentInfo(const sofa::helper::io::MeshVTK*); {; return ComponentInfo::SPtr(new ComponentInfo(""MeshVTK"")) ;; }; } /// logging; } /// helper; } /// sofa; ```.

Deployability,"Hi Thomas,. You said:; ""As long as the deserialization operator is compatible with the serialization one, I do not see any issue. And no example scene is failing because of that."". You have to take the whole picture into consideration, everyone is not using serialization/deserialization as ""pairs"". The actual default serialization format is used in a lot of other software (GUIs, scene processing tools written in python, perl and C++). If you change the behavior of the default serialization mechanism all of them will stop working and required to be updated. This is a very, very, very nasty thing to impose to other users of Sofa. A PR doing has no changes to be accepted. . Actually tests is part of our guard line because they validates the API compatibility and allow us to detect changes that breaks it. The existing tests should be considered as validating the ""the existing"" sofa API. It was normal to have them to fail on your PR because it shows that the PR was breaking the compatibility. . I really like the idea of keeping the old serialization behavior as it is and add the other deserialization as an extra feature. This will make the whole PR transparent for users that don't want to update their code base. It thus it can be merged very quickly. . About the test: ; You are right that it would be better if we had test specific tests to validate the serialization alone.; I personally would like to have tests to validate that getValueString() return ""1 2 3"" and that getValueAsPythonString() return ""[1 2 3]"" . And also as you said having tests to validate against the real values instead of their serialization would be nice. . . About the branches:; The rule is to never work directly on the sofa-framework repository. There is no reason to do so (if you really want to make two PR one in anatoscope and one in sofa ... you need to to that from two branches located in the anatoscope repo).

Deployability,"Hi all, . Just a quick update asked by @hugtalbot on how we handled this issue at Anatoscope. It's been a while so our fork drifted quite a bit since the opening of this issue:. - `Data` are only allowed in `BaseObject` instances (i.e. `Nodes` have no data), which simplified many things; - We removed `initData/initLink` altogether, most constructors are now `(BaseObject* owner, const char* name, const char* doc, const T& value = {})`. A pleasant consequence in c++17 is that you may directly declare datas in the class like this:; ```c++; class Object: public BaseObject {; public:; Data<double> foo = {this, ""foo"", ""a foo that bars"", 1.0};; };; ```; - `BaseData` now maintains shareable information (like name/doc/etc) in a shared object, which can be shared between several data instances. In practice doing so is still very ad-hoc so we don't use it much, but it is possible in case we want to optimize dynamic component creation; - Dependency relations between `DDGNodes` no longer use the `Link` mechanism. ; - In fact component links and `Links` in general are mostly gone, and will be removed in the future as they're yet another dependency graph and we would like *everything* to use the data/engine graph instead; - Our `Data` have at most one input (another data or its owner engine), so we may move the `inputs` handling of `DDGNode` to derived classes to avoid needless allocations for `Data`. It's not done yet though.

The idea was to get an easy way to add/remove plugin binaries in an installed SOFA **without polluting the bin/ folder** which contains stuff I'm not supposed to touch (or scared to touch). The typical use case is: ; I have SOFA binaries (downloaded from sofa-framework.org or provided by someone) and I have a plugin binaries. How to run the examples of the plugin in runSofa?. Many ways to do that:; 1. launch runSofa, open Plugin Manager, load the plugin, open the scene; 2. edit the scene to add `<AddPluginRepository path=""/path/to/the/plugin""/>` and `<RequiredPlugin name=""the_plugin""/>`, launch the scene in runSofa ; 3. copy/paste the plugin binaries (library or complete folder) in the bin/ folder of SOFA, add `<RequiredPlugin name=""the_plugin""/>` or add the_plugin in bin/plugin_list.conf.default, launch the scene in runSofa ; 4. **[NEW]** copy/paste the plugin binaries (library or complete folder) in the plugins/ folder of SOFA, add `<RequiredPlugin name=""the_plugin""/>` or add the_plugin in bin/plugin_list.conf.default, launch the scene in runSofa . (1) is perfect for a new user but becomes heavy quite soon; (2) is more agile but has limitations for plugins that need to be loaded **before** the scene creation (e.g. for Python env init); (3) solves the limitation of (2) if we use plugin_list.conf but, as I said, putting stuff in bin/ is scary; (4) is what I proposed to separate ""plugins that came with SOFA"" from ""plugins I add myself"".

For instance we can have this :. class NumericalIntegrationMethod { public : static const int methodOne=1;};. class NewNumericalIntegrationMethod : public NumericalIntegrationMethod  ; { public : static const int methodTwo=2; };. but the integration method has to be described as :. int method=NumericalIntegrationMethod::methodOne; or int ; method=NewNumericalIntegrationMethod ::methodTwo;. but not as : NumericalIntegrationMethod method; (which would be done ; with enum).

This being said, because SOFA is an open-source project, you can contribute by updating it yourself and the making pul-requests to give you fix to the community ! Or wait that more people gain interest in the same plugin as yourself so that it becomes a priority for us. . I am sorry if this answer is not very helpful, and I wished I could help you more.

In addition graying things out is part of the user interface which, if well done should be separated as much as possible from your the functional logic of the component. Consequently I'm not sure that refactoring the internal logic of a component to please the GUI level is the way to go. . The difficulty with Sofa is that the components's data field (BaseObject) coherency checking is done by the component during init/reinit and the logic behind can be really complex (i.e. not just exclusive relation). We don't want to duplicate this logic at the GUI level.

Deployability,"I have an implementation suggestion, but it depends on the update callback mechanism (that we haven't yet merged into SOFA:; - We could plug in callbacks in the sofa::simulation::Node methods to guarantee that all bboxes in child nodes and child objects are connected to the bounding box field of their parent nodes; - We could use isPersistent() instead of isSet() to check for user input override (because isSet() doesn't tell you whether the user wrote down a value or not, but just whether or not the datafield has been modified. ANY call to beginEdit() basically sets the isSet flag to true... ); - We could leave the updateBoundingBoxVisitor as-is (except for swapping the isSet check for a isPersistent).

Deployability,"I see. :) What do you guys think about a CMake option for explicitly allowing to include non-LGPL parts in the SOFA build (default ON to stay compatible, and maybe even tag it as advanced option)? The idea is that if this switch is off, all the non-LGPL parts (or non-compatible parts) like the applications and a few plugins don't even show up for configuration anymore (technically the add_directory() call into these directories is never made in that case). Currently I have to bundle our own SOFA tarball for the purpose of getting rid of the non-LGPL parts and patch the build system a little bit to, in a nutshell, accept that parts are missing. I can continue to do so, but I'm also interested in contributing something like that. I imagine to follow the license rule mentioned in the top-level readme file: Exclude a few directories in principle and dynamically lookup the plugins if they are LGPL or not. This way, plugin developers wouldn't need to add a list entry somewhere depending on the license. They would just need to follow a convention in order to make the license determinable by the script. Could be as simple as a LICENSE.txt file or even the implementation of the getModuleLicense() function, which should be easy to parse (and is only missing in a single plugin at the moment).

Deployability,"In f93e2b9 I wanted to restore the default behavior of ca0402d which had PluginRepository initialised with ; - the current working directory ( hence the ""./"" ) of the applications since on windows platform. By default, on windows the dlls are located in the same directory as the application. For example `runSofa` and `SofaPython.dll` are both in the same directory; - the `../lib` directory for other platforms like linux, where the plugins are usually stored in a `lib` sub folder of the parent directory where the application reside. For example from the directory where the `runSofa` executable is, you can look for the directory where `SofaPython.lib` is located by doing `cd ../lib`. These paths are relative and are compatible both with a build tree and an install tree. Prior to f93e2b9 the PluginRepository was empty by default, leaving all the executables the responsibility to fill it with these values. Behavior which was changed multiple times compared to ca0402d for a reason yet to be explained. The side effect this change introduced was the requirement to have every unit test executable which attempts to load a plugin to explicitly fill the PluginRepository with the paths where the libraries are located with respect to the executable. This requirement was covered by having most of the unit tests depend on SofaGTest which initialize these default paths for you, so that test scenes that use a ` RequiredPlugin` component do not utterly fail. ; Unless a **valid** argument is raised, the aforementioned paths should be the default ones to use to initialize the `PluginRepository` global object. ; I strongly believe that would these paths have been properly restored by f93e2b9 (my bad), this PR would have never existed on the first place.

Deployability,"Indeed, in the paper they say that they use the initial volume of each element, instead of recomputing it. I'm not sure I understand it correctly, but it seems to me that this is not actually 'the good way', just something made possible by the fact that the volume can be directly multiplied to the Strain Displacement matrix, without creating artificial torque. So you can make the assumption that the volume of the element doesn't change much, and that using its initial volume during the whole deformation is a good approximation, which saves computational time.; It would be better if someone could comment on this, because I really don't know if I'm right. That being said, when looking in the code of `TriangleFEMForceField`, the area of the triangles seems to be recomputed anyway in `computeStrainDisplacement`, with:; ```; Real determinant = b[0] * c[1]; // Surface * 2; ```; which is used to update the Strain Displacement matrix at each time step. By comparison, the difference with `computeStrainDisplacement` in `TriangularFEMForceField` is juste the next line; ```; determinant = b[0] * c[1];; triangleInf[elementIndex].area = determinant*0.5f;; ```; Following the paper, I think the computation of `determinant` at each time step should also be replaced by the triangle initial area. Or alternatively, follow the same version as in `TriangularFEMForceField` and update the triangle's area to make use of the computation. Finally, but not related, the 'area' used in the material behaviour matrix of `TriangleFEMForceField` is actually a 'volume' with a default thickness of 1.

Deployability,"It is probably using the rest area since it is working with a Lagrangian formulation. This is also what we use in other FEM code (tetra and hexa) where the integral is computed on the rest (undeformed) domain. For linear elements (triangle, tetra), it will multiply the integrand with the initial volume (or area for triangle) to get the integral result over an element. For trilinear or higher degree elements, it will use Gauss integration points where derivatives of the shape function, and the determinant of the jacobian of the transformation matrix are computed at the initial (undeformed) domain. Kinematics quantities from the current state are transformed into the initial domain using a transformation matrix. . I would therefore think that the `TriangleFEMForceField ` is the ""good"" one in the sens that it is following the big majority of SOFA code with a Lagrangian formulation. .

Deployability,"It should be zero by default in my opinion. ; There is also a little confusion because there are currently two ways to specify the rayleigh damping parameters. ; If you use `EulerImplicitSolver` rayleigh damping is specified at the solver level. ; However both the `ForceField` and `Mass` API in SofaCore also implements rayleigh damping... provided you use `kfactorIncludingRayleighDamping` instead of `kfactor` when assembling the stiffness and the mass. This changed was introduced quite a long time ago, because in the Compliant plugin, the solvers for time integration do not implement global Rayleigh damping, but a more ""local"" one, delegated to each of the `Mass` and `Forcefield` components. ; So short answer is : yes should be zero. But it could break a **lot** of scenes that extensively rely on the default damping values to actually work... which mostly happens when you do not pay attention about the unit system you want to use in your scene ( e.g meters and kilograms versus millimetres and grams ) . I would also like to have the opinion of someone knowledgeable in that particular area. Rayleigh stiffness factor, contrary to Rayleigh mass factor, is not unit less.

To me this kind of first step can be make without breaking anything in sofa and with great benefit. ; Let me explaine: the include path can have SofaStandard so that external code using the ""modules"" (eg: #include<SofaMiscFem/TheFEMILike.h>) don't need to be updated and only adding something like find_package(SofaStandard) or more specifically find_package(SofaStandardMiscFem). . The immediate benefit of that is:; - people that don't want all the stuff in SofaStandard can disable the plugin (and compile sofa in 1min). ; - people that want only the minimal set of good component component in SofaStandard compile sofa with the componentset ""light"" (and compile sofa in 3 min); - people that want the existing sofa with all the deprecated (but still working) compile it with the SofaStandard plugin and componentset ""full"" (and compile sofa in 30 min). Of course doing this easy step shouldn't prevent us from further refactoring, people that likes the SofaStandard components can re-organize and clean things. But this can be done incrementally when ones have time to devote to that. .

Didn't compile it though, but the cmake shouldn't crash at least. So I suggest you to delete your cloned repositories and clone them again and then directly checkout v21.12. . Your issue is due to the fact that you are adding the project using this macro `sofa_add_subdirectory` which didn't exist at the time. I think the closes one was `sofa_add_plugin`. But using this macro is not mandatory, you can add such plugins with `SOFA_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES` if you don't have to much of them... . Sometimes, cloning first master then switching branch can generate issues, if so you can use this command line instead `git clone -b v21.12 --single-branch git@github.com:sofa-framework/sofa.git`.

Deployability,"Plugin SofaCoreAsync; https://github.com/SofaDefrost/sofa/blob/pluginSofaCoreAsync/applications/plugins/SofaCoreAsync/Sofa/Core/Async/tests/AsyncComponentTracker_test.cpp. Associate to the component a Data<'state'>. This data state can be used to keep track of component state change and propagate lazy update so that the component that depend on other can be updated appropriately. The general design was attempting to combine both synchonous and asynchronous components in the same scene so that ""normal"" Sofa object can still interact with the one using asynchronous updates. . In the following example a change in python1,2,3 file is reloaded and the ImplicitFeldRenderer & MeshGeneration are updated, each in an asynchronous way. ; ```qml; Node : {; ImplicitField : { name : ""python1"", src : ""python1.py"" }; ImplicitField : { name : ""python2"", src : ""python2.py"" }; ImplicitField : { name : ""python3"", src : ""python3.py"" }; ; ImplicitFieldRenderer : { src : ""@python1"" }; ImplicitFieldRenderer : { src : ""@python2"" }; ImplicitFieldRenderer : { src : ""@python2"" }. TetrahedralMeshGeneration : { src : ""@python1"", name = ""mesh1"" }; SurfaceMeshGeneration : { src : ""@python2"", name = ""mesh2"" }; TetrahedralMeshGeneration : { src : ""@python1"", name = ""mesh3"" }; ; MechanicalFEM3D : { src : ""@mesh1"" }; MechanicalFEM2D : { src : ""@mesh2"" }; MechanicalFEM3D : { src : ""@mesh3"" }; }; ```. Note 1: When used in asyncrhonous mode, the current approach does not guarante that a change is propagated immediately. So one change in a component at a given IDLEEvent may be updated in this or an other IDLEEvent. It depend on ""when"" the dependencies checks the validity of their input. . Node 2: To fix that a queue may be used to keep track of what still needs to be done.

Deployability,"So I took a look at the SleepController. It simply puts context to sleep where the mechanical object has a max velocity under a certain threshold. Then wake them up again only when a collision occurs with another object that is moving. ; Three remarks : ; - Being put to sleep disables any mechanical visitor to be applied on the node and deactivates its constraint corrections. So no more computing (no system build, no integration, only collision detection); - This works well only for scenes where external interaction only arise between two objects colliding, neither by the mean of a change of external forces (dynamic vector field for instance), or of constraint state changes not managed by the collision pipeline (for instance statically defined interaction constraints such as cable constraints). ; - The code seems overly complicated for what it performs but certainly does what it says it does. I didn't try it but it looks ok. .

Deployability,"Sorry for the delay !. First, I have some precisions regarding Fred's remark: with the modification I suggested, I see a critical performance drop in the caduceus scene, going from ~150-200 FPS before the change, to ~25 FPS after. I expect that, indeed, the barycentric mapping accesses the `m_positions` field of the `OGLmodel`, consequently causing extensive triggering of the callback at each time step. So the solution I first suggested should be discarded anyway. @hugtalbot, using the `m_restPositions` field for the callback doesn't have the same performance issue. However I believe that this field is not used in the rendering process of the `OglModel`. Or, at least, calling `initVisual()` after a change of `m_restPositions` doesn't change the visual. So this solution doesn't solve the initial issue I had. I tried to look into how the `BarycentricMapping` works in details, but I'm afraid it is a bit too complexe for me with the time I have at the moment... My idea was to find how the barycentric mapping makes sure that the visual OGLModel is updated at each time step, and mimick this. If someone is familiar with the process ?. In the meantime, regarding the specific scenario I was working on, I'm using another workaround. Instead of dynamically changing the source file of the loader, I'm creating as many loaders as mesh files I have, and I dynamically change the loader I need at a given time during the simulation.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2925#issuecomment-1137038775:1059,update,updated,1059,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2925#issuecomment-1137038775,1,['update'],['updated']

If you are going to create extra directories in usr/include when installed, I would suggest naming them in lowercase, as for example Eigen does.

Deployability,"Thank for your feedback, . As you I don't understand the SofaKernel/SofaFramework stuff and I'm always searching for the right component in the wrong place so I fully support you on that, the reason is that Misc vs Advanced vs NG have different meaning for different person so it is a totally arbitrary segmentation. . But I'm not really talking about this here. What I have in mind is more or less orthogonal to this aspect (and it is fully compatible with the existing scheme or one you could define in the future grouping stuff like Qt). What I would like to discuss is more about how do we management the components life-time (from integration to deprecation) and not where to put them. I'm not sure I'm very clear sorry for that. . Here is our working branch: ; https://github.com/SofaDefrost/sofa/tree/deprecating_components. You can see there that there is no more CMakeLists than what we have now (or what we could have in some future if some serious cleaning and refactoring is done to organize the component 'à la Qt'...but I have no time for that ;)). . The goods I see of the proposed approach, in addition to be orthogonal to the other concerns, is that it is very progressive. It change nothing for existing user of Sofa while at the same time we can progressively deprecated components from Sofa by just moving them from one set to one other (and updating the scenechecker). In a symetric way we can also progressively integrate in the core set of components the one that have been ""elected"" by the SofaNG workgroup. And for the other component...well nothing change. . My dream is that by doing so we could small step after small step, remove 50% of the components that should be deprecated and that, combined with the pluginization lighten sofa.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/346#issuecomment-332175148:636,integrat,integration,636,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/346#issuecomment-332175148,2,['integrat'],"['integrate', 'integration']"

As only the dataField can be saved...these attributes are ""lost"". ; The solution was to stop doing with a minimal number of changes the Sofa behavior. . third (quirck stuffs on pile of quirck stuffs):; some important XML attributes are interpreted on the fly and have very specific meaning but there is no associated data field.

Deployability,"These two components were added as a tool to smooth the transition between the use of hard-coded alias in our code base to ""no alias"" at all. The underlying idea was to propose our users, and more specifically the one complaining about the disappearance of the alias they are using, a simple way to restore it (if they don't want to update their complete scene base). . About the fact is it not used... this is not surprising as we are not removing the aliases as it was planned and when we do it we are updating all the scenes in our code base (removing the need for MakeAlias). I personally think that the approach proposed in (#PR 2512: https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2512) is much elegant compared to the MakeAlias (and would advocate to remove MakeAlias when something similar to 2512 is merged) .

Once it passes, no need to change the ""origin/master"" since it contains your automatically merged SP3 PR. If you don't do it, then upgrades in SP3 (bug fixes, new features) that do not have a related PR in SOFA won't be taken into account unless we go do a PR in SOFA to update this pointer. I can guarantee you that nobody will think of doing it. Which means that fetching SP3 within SOFA has great chance to be pointing to an old version.

And here's what happens in the base class:. - The SOFAOR_CALLBACK_SYSTEM is a macro that creates a callback functor:; ```; class CallbackFunctor; {; public:; virtual void call(sofa::core::objectmodel::BaseData* o) = 0;; };. #define SOFAOR_CALLBACK_SYSTEM(T) \; typedef T SOFAOR_CLASS; \; class Callback : public sofaor::common::CallbackFunctor \; { \; typedef void (SOFAOR_CLASS::*Func)(sofa::core::objectmodel::BaseData * o); \; \; SOFAOR_CLASS* m_obj; \; Func m_func; \; \; public: \; Callback(SOFAOR_CLASS* _this, Func f) : m_obj(_this), m_func(f) {} \; void call(sofa::core::objectmodel::BaseData* data = 0) \; { \; (m_obj->*m_func)(data); \; } \; }. #define SOFAOR_ADD_CALLBACK(data, callback) \; addDataCallback(data, new Callback(this, callback)). #define SOFAOR_ADD_INPUT_CALLBACK(data, callback, trackOnly) \; addInput(data, trackOnly, new Callback(this, callback)); ```. When reinit is called on the component, all callbacks are called and the update class is called (maybe it's a mistake, maybe only the callbacks should be called..). Then outputs are set to dirty, and an IdleEvent visitor is propagated:; ```; void ImplicitDataEngine::reinit(); {; cleanTrackers();; update();; setDirtyOutputs();; sofa::core::objectmodel::IdleEvent ie;; sofa::simulation::PropagateEventVisitor v(; sofa::core::ExecParams::defaultInstance(), &ie);; this->getContext()->getRootContext()->executeVisitor(&v);; }; ``` . This allows for a complete and instant refresh of all components taking as an input the dirty outputs without calling the previous components in the pipeline again.; Limitations are that those following components have to be initialized AFTER (in terms of scene graph, so either in subnodes, or after the current engine, in the same node). Another feature that I don't like much but that was requested by someone who was supposed to use and contribute to my plugin but never did, is the ""autolink"" feature:. <MySofaORComponent name=""mycomp"" autolink",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/597#issuecomment-367473816:2332,update,update,2332,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/597#issuecomment-367473816,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"backup discussion for logs:. here is the call stack of sphereLoader:; ```; SphereLoader::load; SphereLoader::load END; SphereLoader::updateFileNameAndTransformPosition; - m_filename changed: 1; - d_translation changed: 0; - d_rotation changed: 0; - d_scale changed: 0; SphereLoader::load; SphereLoader::load END; SphereLoader::applyTransform; SphereLoader::applyTransform END; SphereLoader::Callback exit with load(); ```. So as you can see the file is loaded once at parse time (because of the ```canLoad``` mechanism of the Loader) but the m_filename is still flaged as changed in the tracker so it will call the method load a second time when the Data position/radius are pulled from other components. . This was avoided in my previous version by adding ```m_internalEngine[""filename""].cleanDirty();``` at begining of the Load method. . However it is not looping anymore like in the initial version. Maybe we can say that this double call of load is special due to the Loader mechanism at parse stage (which should be replaced by a nice Data grah update...); For the log from epernod@sophia.inria.fr . Loader are loading file/mesh at parse stage to ensure they are ready and all their data are filled before any other component start linking and using the loader data.

When reinit is called on the component, all callbacks are called and the update class is called (maybe it's a mistake, maybe only the callbacks should be called..). Then outputs are set to dirty, and an IdleEvent visitor is propagated:; ```; void ImplicitDataEngine::reinit(); {; cleanTrackers();; update();; setDirtyOutputs();; sofa::core::objectmodel::IdleEvent ie;; sofa::simulation::PropagateEventVisitor v(; sofa::core::ExecParams::defaultInstance(), &ie);; this->getContext()->getRootContext()->executeVisitor(&v);; }; ``` . This allows for a complete and instant refresh of all components taking as an input the dirty outputs without calling the previous components in the pipeline again.; Limitations are that those following components have to be initialized AFTER (in terms of scene graph, so either in subnodes, or after the current engine, in the same node). Another feature that I don't like much but that was requested by someone who was supposed to use and contribute to my plugin but never did, is the ""autolink"" feature:. <MySofaORComponent name=""mycomp"" autolink=""true"" />. This field allows you to *implicitely* link your data, so that you could avoid setting dozens of fields in your scene description file. The way if works is quite basic:; If autolink is true, then when calling addInput, the internal code checks if the variable has been set. If it has been it doesn't do anything, but if it has:; a previous ImplicitDataEngine in the graph is searched for and if it contains a matching variable with a similar name, it binds them together by calling setParent() on the data.

Deployability,"e to point out specifically the most problematic points in which you think that the remplacement will not do the work so that I can propose solutions to be closer to the ""semantic you want"". . I looked into the Flexible/Compliant and it seems to me that only a dozen of replacement (out of hundreds) are not equivalent to the old code. . If you take time pointing me which one are causing you troubles I will gladely help in how fixing them to use the msg_api AND and preserving the existing behavior. To convince you that this is worth the effort I took examples from Flexible/Compliant to illustrate the benefit of the changes. ; ==== ====; ```cpp; - if(this->f_printLog.getValue()==true); - std::cout << SOFA_CLASS_METHOD << std::endl;; + dmsg_info() << SOFA_CLASS_METHOD ;; ```; - Is functionnaly equivalent to the old code (if the application have installed an handler routing the message to std::cout); - It will print message in a totally consistant way with other sofa componant (which very important for users); - It is shorter to write (very important for the developer :)), ; - It benefit from the message dispatcher/handler (so it can be logger or routed or sended or whatever GUI in the end user application); - All developpers immediately know that the message is not for the end user of Sofa but for a developers. Consequently the message can be very drafty. It can also be remove by setting SOFA_DEVTOOLS to false and thus it should have a zero cost in a release . A second example: ; ```cpp; - if(this->f_printLog.getValue()) if(pos.size()) ; - std::cout<<""TopologyGaussPointSampler: ""<< pos.size() <<"" generated samples""<<std::endl;; +msg_info_when(pos.size()!=0) << "" topologyGaussPointSampler: ""<< pos.size() <<"" generated samples"" ;; ```; - Is functionnaly equivalent to the old code; - Shorter to write; - Consistant behavior with other component,; - It benefit from the message dispatcher/handler (so it can be logger or routed or sended into Backlog depending on the end user a",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/190#issuecomment-285637960:1131,install,installed,1131,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/190#issuecomment-285637960,1,['install'],['installed']

This is why I'm searching for a way to fix SingleLink/MultiLink to make it forward declaration friendly. . More fundamentally the Link implementation is interesting but it is also very complex. This complexity and its consequence in term of maintainability (very few of the sofa developpers can understand it easily) and compilation cost make me wonder if we shouldn't investigate/consider simpler approach. .

Deployability,"fferently labeled commands invoke different function"". . "" Another problem with putting the same command on multiple name is that it misleads users into believing that the application is more complex than it really is"". On my side I not that Jeff Johson is right and this is exactly the behavior I observed with new-comers to sofa. They are always puzzled and annoyed but the alias and this generates a lot of troubles and frustration. . So I think from an usability point of view this a bigger deal than what we, as developper, are thinking. . To improve the situation maybe we could: ; - each time an alias is used print a message using msg_info. This message should say:. ```; [INFO] Using of the data ""rest_position"" which is an alias (http://thedoctosofa/alias) pointing to the ""position' data field. To remove this message you can replace in myscele.xml:30 :; ""<MechanicalObject rest_position='0 1 2 3 '> with ""<MechanicalObject 'position'=; ```; - each time an alias is used to for backward compatibility from previous name we should print a message using msg_warning:. ```; [WARNING] Using of the data ""rest_position"" is now deprecated. ; To remove this message you must update your scene and replace in myscele.xml:30 : ""<MechanicalObject rest_position='0 1 2 3 '> with ""<MechanicalObject 'position'=; ```; - indicate in the GUI the alternative names (because some user may search the alias name in the GUI) ; - we could also totally remove the addAlias from the sofa core (unless for developement convenience) and implement a component that explicitely give data alias in a scene (I don't know if this is hard to implement) ; Maybe something like:. ```; <DataAlias src='@position.postion' 'rest_position'> ; <ComponentAlias src='OGLModel' dest='VisualModel'>; ```. At the beginning of a scene with OGLModel and ""rest_position"" would be enough to make the alias obvious to the user preserving the convenience of Alias to the developpers.

Deployability,"if it is not explicitly passed in to all API calls, it can be queried with ExecParams::defaultInstance(), with the guarantee that this will always provide exactly the correct values (as there is a single copy per thread). For instance, this could allow to change the ExecMode in order to trace/profile a specific part of the computation. Without TLS, all calls done in parallel in other threads would now share the same mode. But as ExecMode was only ever used for KAAPI support (now removed), it is possible to decide to remove this as well without losing much.; 7. As a final point, one alternative fix (that I would personally prefer, but I am no longer involved directly so it is not up to me) would be to redesign this such that checkValidStorage() is no longer needed. The core issue is more related to the multithread TaskScheduler, where if a MechanicalParams (or another child of ExecParams) is copied from one thread to another as part of a Task, we can have functions that are called with the wrong ""storage"" pointer belonging to the calling thread. This is a very bad situation because the other thread might have moved on to other codes that changed the values, and more importantly ExecParams::defaultInstance() method used in many placed would see a different set of values. Currently this is fixed manually by calling mparams.update() at the beginning of the Task, but this is not always done, hence the check in the visitors as many Sofa computations end up using visitors somewhere. But if that could be the responsibility of the Task/TaskScheduler, they we could remove this check. This could be done for example by adjusting the ExecParams handling in a way that guarantees that inter-thread copies are by value of the storage (i.e. the value of ExecMode/.. but excluding threadID) instead of by reference, and known to the scheduler so that the parameters are correctly copied in the thread executing each runTask() without relying on manual updates. I hope this helps,.

Deployability,"ment a new library dedicated to the abstraction api for testing with sofa, ie a kind of lightweight SofaTest library.; I was not really aware that there was code inside SofaKernel libraries that directly depend on gtest, I thought it was still kept ""optional"" (ie that gtest has become mandatory on master for some time, wether or not you build and execute unit tests). ; We are still used to developping with the ""idea"" that gtest is optional, even though in reality there is no use case were we do not include it. Coming back at this PR, to be honest I don't believe there is a functionality in the BaseTest classes (apart from the fact that it removes dependencies) that I would like to use, because mostly : ; - we do not currently have a use for message api, or at least we do not have any idea about why it could be beneficial for us to start using it.; - I d like to discourage the use of one size fits all epsilon and comparison values for floating points arithmetic, since I prefer people to actually think about the quantities they want to compare. Comparing floats in a consistent fashion is harder than it looks, with the exception when you expect that the quantities you want to compare to be strictly equal. So having a Base test class which provides these comparison facilities is also not something I am particularly looking for. There are some abstractions attempts in SofaTest that I find interesting ( linearisation tests for the most part ) but it got snowed under a dependency bloat. . However that being said, the only thing I'd like, is that if I implement a test just using the ""vanilla"" gtest library, it can be merged, built and run easily on the master. With the current state of things, integrating a new test in `framework_test`, requires you to build all sofa, and not just `SofaCore` as I would have expected. So in return you have to wait a loooong time before you can actually check that the functionality you want to integrate in master actually works as you expect.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/471#issuecomment-338710224:1848,integrat,integrating,1848,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/471#issuecomment-338710224,2,['integrat'],"['integrate', 'integrating']"

Deployability,"nment know the interpreter is being run from the outside when initializing (and maybe deal with all the sys.path / __file__ abuses down there). The PythonEnvironment will create an interpreter if there isn't one (like when launching for a binary executable), or use the one already defined. In this case, PythonEnvironment will use the interpreter that called the script (ex python runSofaPython.py). No new python interpreter nor python thread a created (I've just checked to be sure). > probably have a good fight with the GIL down the road. The current GIL usage in the plugin seems to align correctly with this feature since we ""attach"" the PythonEnvironment to an interpreter instead of initialising a new one. No new threads are created. > how should this feature integrate with existing python scenes? Should it be possible to load scenes from within python scenes?. Yes, it seems to work so far. However:. - Loading the SofaPlugin library from within a python script that already imported it should be avoid for now since I'm not sure what side effects this will bring. Right now doing it seems not so bad as, again, we only attach the environment to the already created python environment. ; - A ScriptController will need to be added in order to trigger script events so that the python scene's functions (initGraph, onBeginAnimationStep, etc) are called. The createScene function is called by the SceneLoaderPY so this one is fine. > (I would probably put your feature in a module separate from Sofa for this reason). I think this should be entirely a part of the SofaPython plugin in order to keep what is related to sofa in python there. > what happens when Sofa.cleanup() gets called but python objects still hold c++ objects that are to be destructed when python exits ?. This is a good question. PythonEnvironment::Release is called when python exits (called by the static raii destructor...). I'll have to check this. > But I am really all for it, so good luck with that :-).

Deployability,"not so great. ; - It also has the major downside of having to load the library to know if the plugin is auto-loadable, which in the end results in having to load all the available plugins. Loading a library in the process memory will have several side effects which are difficult to anticipate before hand. The major one is the evaluation of all the global variables, which will result in populating the `ObjectFactory` with all the components that this library contains. I would suggest something different for this kind of having a list of default plugins that are loaded directly with your application ( here `runSofa` ). - derive a sort of sofa plugin manifest file, which can be generated as a post-build step. This should be an easy to parse file which could contain the various informations exposed by the `getModuleName()`, `getModuleVersion()`... without having to load the library in the process memory. This manifest file must be stored in an easy to find location in your build tree, an be installed properly ( they need also to be bundled when you deploy your application ). That means they should be located with a similar relative path with respect to the application ( `runSofa` ) when in the build tree or in the install tree. There should be a proposal about that to define : ; - the manifest file type ( ie how are we going to parse it ? json xml text ? ); - the manifest file content itself. - any application could then define the list of predefined plugin it wants to load using a simple configuration file. A default configuration can be provided, but it could be easily overriden. With this mechanism, no recompilation is required when you want to change the list of default plugins, you just change the config file. NB : a bit unrelated but there is a small code ""snippet"" that can be used to recover all the components attached to a library in two lines ; ```cpp; const char* getModuleComponentList(); {; /// string containing the names of the classes provided by the plugin",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/253#issuecomment-296982188:1194,install,installed,1194,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/253#issuecomment-296982188,2,"['deploy', 'install']","['deploy', 'installed']"

Deployability,"ok here is the new call stack with your version @hugtalbot :; ```; SphereLoader::load; SphereLoader::load END; SphereLoader::updateFileNameAndTransformPosition; - m_filename changed: 1; - d_translation changed: 0; - d_rotation changed: 0; - d_scale changed: 0; SphereLoader::load; SphereLoader::load END; SphereLoader::applyTransform; SphereLoader::applyTransform END; SphereLoader::Callback exit with load(); ```. So as you can see the file is loaded once at parse time (because of the ```canLoad``` mechanism of the Loader) but the m_filename is still flaged as changed in the tracker so it will call the method load a second time when the Data position/radius are pulled from other components. . This was avoided in my previous version by adding ```m_internalEngine[""filename""].cleanDirty();``` at begining of the Load method. . However it is not looping anymore like in the initial version. Maybe we can say that this double call of load is special due to the Loader mechanism at parse stage (which should be replaced by a nice Data grah update...); For the log from epernod@sophia.inria.fr . Loader are loading file/mesh at parse stage to ensure they are ready and all their data are filled before any other component start linking and using the loader data.

Mixing the python and c++ code was actually very simple thanks to the cython ability to generate dual-bindings... where a c++ function is exposed in python as well as having python functions exposed to C++ (so a .h is generated to include and use the python code in your c++ code base). ; That's said cython is not magic and the generated .cpp/.h are containing 100% python C-api ...so everything implemented in cython could be implemented exactly the same using the C-python API. ; It is just 10x longer to write an equivalent code. . As you ask I pushed a branch (https://github.com/SofaDefrost/sofa/tree/sofa_refactorSofaPython) with the implementation don't expect the branch to compile today as it contains irrelevant code that are wip to support the buffer protocol for seamless integration with numpy. . For the syntax about Data...everything is implemented in 'Binding_Data.cpp'. ; The function SofaData_asMapping_ass_subscript is the one called when using the [aaa] = operation. ; ```cpp; static int SofaData_asMapping_ass_subscript(PyObject *o, PyObject *key, PyObject *value); {; ....; /// This line is actually calling the ""python"" part implementation because I was too lazy; /// to implement it using C-Python API. So the function is really implemented partially with python ; /// and partially with c++ :) ; if( Data_ass_subscript(o,key,value) ); return 0;; ; /// after that it is a lot of ugly c-python api code. ; ....; ```. And the corresponding cython code (in Binding_DataArray.pyx); ```python; def sliceToRange(c, end):; start = 0; stop = end; if c.start != None:; start = c.start; if c.stop != None:; stop = c.stop; return xrange(start, stop) . cdef public bool Data_ass_sub",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/767#issuecomment-419024819:1699,integrat,integration,1699,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/767#issuecomment-419024819,1,['integrat'],['integration']

These factors define how to bring back the results of the constraint problem (Lagrange multipliers ) as position or velocity field.

Deployability,"👍 for removing sofa::helper::io::Mesh*. There is however an issue that the support for loading texture coordinates was removed from MeshObjLoader, so the OglModel version on the master can only have textures when using these deprecated loaders.

Reminder: your feedback is VERY important, we need it to adapt our work and minimize future rollbacks. **Do not hesitate to put any comment in the pull-requests.**. ## Refactoring and adapting SPM for Sofa.Component.Utils. SPM is the set of scripts we use to make our work easily reproducible. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/guparan/sofa2ng). This work made me realize that it will be very hard, if not impossible, to anticipate every subtle change needed by the refactoring.; - Do we want SPM to be an all inclusive script to refactor completely SOFA? ; every refactoring is unique and needs to change SPM ; -> namespace handling ; -> includes refactoring; - Or should we prefer it to be an easy-to-use script to **bootstrap** any refactoring? ; -> very specific changes will have to be done by hand. I propose to go for solution 2 and to provide a git patch covering the work done after SPM job (fixing includes, fixing namespaces, ...). The progress of this task is **85%** since I now have to create the patch and to provide everything in the PR. ## Moving on with Sofa.Helper.Bvh; Following [the latest iteration on NG architecture](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/sofang-v3) and Damien's first draft in his [cleanTheMessStep1](https://github.com/SofaDefrost/sofa/tree/cleanTheMessStep1/ng) branch, I started refactoring SofaFramework with Sofa.Helper.Bvh. This task needed me to heavily change/adapt SPM. It contributed to make me prefer solution 2 above. The progress of this task is **60%**. TODO:; - update the recipe with latest SPM changes (namespace handling); - adapt SPM output for smooth transition from SOFA; - create the patch; - open a PR. ## Next steps; - Finalize and merge Sofa.Component.Utils PR; - Open a new PR: Sofa.Helper.Bvh; - Continue with SofaHelper refactoring. ----------.

The [CentralDifferenceSolver](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/blob/6b475afc63841f10e4990b56c7b837892fb735dd/modules/SofaGeneralExplicitOdeSolver/src/SofaGeneralExplicitOdeSolver/CentralDifferenceSolver.h#L36) simply **assumes** that the mass is diagonal. Hence using this component with non-diagonal mass will result in wrong simulations.; 3. Implicit solver could use the knowledge of a diagonal mass to efficiently compute `m M + b B + k K`, but they do not... This is an important topic that I think should be included into the current discussions to refactor the way SOFA construct its system matrices. Also related: can we detect if a diagonal mass remains diagonal if it gets mass contribution via mappings? Does mapped mass even work in SOFA?.

Energy Efficiency,"> If I understood correctly, the group manager would help the performances compared to a single system. Here, we compare to two systems (one per cube). I'll add a third scene in this benchmark with a single system, to be more rigorous. I expect the same result from ""single system"" and ""two systems + group manager"". I expect better performances only in case the two cubes are not in contact, am I right?. Well, if I understood correctly, the group manager is doing just that: take two objects usually solved with their own solver, and merge them into one. So in this case, your third scene should produce the same result as the one with a group manager.

Energy Efficiency,"@damienmarchal , discussions during the SOFA-dev meeting lead to a question over the developed design and your opinion is needed. . The problem was that some scenes tests where crashing at exit. This is due to the SofaPython3 cache (`s_objectcache` there https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/blob/1b5d271aa21df06c4c5ab75599e364adb0c1e9be/Plugin/src/SofaPython3/DataHelper.cpp#L252C1-L252C73) . The problem was that this is a static object containing python objects and is thus cleaned at the very end of the program exit, after the python interpreter, which is not authorized. . To fix it, following [pybind11 suggestions](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/misc.html) I've added a member to the module Sofa.Core that insured that the cleanup is called while the interpreter is still alive (see the PR https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/pull/425). But is was not enough because the interpreter is not cleaned correctly either : the static method ""Release"" of SofaPython3, in charge of cleaning up python and deleting the interpreter was never called when launching scene in runSofa. . This lead to the need of cleaning up *explicitly* the plugin before exiting the main function. This design was not liked by every dev, some wanting a Raii-like cleanup, in the destructor of some member, which is in my mind not possible because the interpreter instance is static in the SofaPython3 plugin and thus we have no guaranty that it would not be deleted before any other static member.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4828#issuecomment-2233357216:1011,charge,charge,1011,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4828#issuecomment-2233357216,1,['charge'],['charge']

This PSDEFactory (Actually a DataFactory) may be an attribute of PythonEnvironment. . Now about merging the PSDE with the PythonFactory, this sound is a different issue to me. As far as I can say the PythonFactory is in charge of generating the python binding of the 'right' type for an object (so a BaseObject* to the right SofaPython.Binding_SpecificObject) while the PSDEFactory is more in charge of allocating the right Data<> type (a string to Data<something>). I think a closer factory to look is how the Data<> are converted to and from python type (eg when we are accessing them with the getattr/findData). . I didn't investigated to much but I also have several worries about the existing PythonFactory: ; - the long sequence of if-else to detect among a set of ""hard code"" (why those ones, why there is an implicit ordering), ; - the complexity to match a type seems to be linear with the number of type (so the more type there will be in the factory the slowest it will be).; - this linear search is done *each time* an object is crossing the Sofa to Python border (which means each time we use Python to access Sofa object we pay this price).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-389395402:397,charge,charge,397,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-389395402,2,['charge'],['charge']

Energy Efficiency,"Dear @faichele ,. Following the SOFA dev meeting 25/01/2017.; Multi-threading plugin proposed by @faichele. Your new plugin implements a static scheduling for collision detection. The implementation does not require any change of the existing collision components of SOFA. The bounding volume hierarchy methods is parallelized. It should be easy to use. Compared to the approach used in the MultiThreading plugin using the ""work-stealing"" scheduling pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing), Fabian's implementation is based on ""conventional"" work-sharing, with a ""round-robin"" assignment of collision pair checks per thread. One extension is the fact that worker threads are persistent: they do not terminate after processing all assigned tasks, and no new threads are spawned when new collision pair check tasks are added to the thread pool. Instead, worker threads enter a ""sleeping"" state to avoid using CPU cycles when no tasks are processed. This avoids unnecessary respawning of threads every 10 to 50 ms, since the collision detection is typically called very often and in quick succession. @faichele , you mentioned it will be released under open-source license and with standalone for beta testing. Tests on potential performance gains remain to do (number of per checks).; Do not hesitate to correct me. In the context of the recent coding sprint, some new feature around multithreading were added in a branch ( https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/tree/issofa_multithreading ), not merged yet.

Energy Efficiency,"Here is a doc for you to start from:. Forward declaration; ===============; To reduce the amount of file inclusion in Sofa and thus compilation time it is possible to use forward declaration. ; A forward declaration is a an incomplete type ta complete definition is not provided. ; ```cpp; class AClass; ///< this is a forward declaration of a type. /// This is the full declaration + definition of a type; class AClass ; {; public:; }; ```; Forward declaration can be used in place of the complete type (declaration+definition) when the ""inner"" details of the type are not needed. A classical scenario is the following; ```cpp; #include <sofa/core/objectmodel/BaseObject>; bool myFunction1(BaseObject* a); {; return doSomethingWith(a);; }; ```; As we are manipulating the 'a' object via a pointer and passing it to the doSomethingWith function there is no need to know any details of the BaseObject to compile that properly. Using a forward declaration for BaseObject would save us from the inclusion of the file ```#include <sofa/core/objectmodel/BaseObject>```. Where to put forward declaration; --------------------------------------------; Forward declaration must be in a file called ```fwd.h```. The fwd.h can be located at the module root directory.; Eg:; ```; sofa/core/fwd.h; ```; If there is a lot of forward declaration it is allowed to have a per sub-module ```fwd.h``` file. ; Eg:; ```; sofa/core/objectmodel/fwd.h; sofa/core/behavior/fwd.h; ```; In that case it is mandatory that the module file contains them all. In our example ; ```cpp; sofa/core/fwd.h; #include<sofa/core/objectmodel/fwd.h>; #include<sofa/core/behavior/fwd.h>; ```. Opaque API ; =========; When it is not desirable to have access the full type definition it is possible to make or use what is called an opaque API. The Opaque API mimmics the methods provided by a class but relying only on forward declaration. ; Exemple of the ""transparent"" API: ; ```cpp; #include <Context>; #include <BaseNode>; namespace sofa::s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1764#issuecomment-780848561:79,reduce,reduce,79,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1764#issuecomment-780848561,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Also, wouldn't it make sense to completely override the datatype::name() string for the python style typename, already in the sofa DataTypeInfo, not just in the python factory?; It would break scenes that explicits template types, but it would be more consistent.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi Mathieu,. Thank you for the feedback... the GLSL stuff is a mistake... I didn't knew that pull-request was for a branch and not for a specific commit. So i continued to to work in this branch (I will not do the same mistake in the future). . Now to answer your question...the overhead is near zero. ; - The GLSLListener is triggered by the file FileMonitor. ; - FileMonitor is using the event based ""select"" system API and is not actively 'polling' the files. AFAIK this is the most efficient way to monitor files. ; - If your application don't call FileMonitor::update(0) then this cost nothing. Currently only runSofa is calling FileMonitor::update(0) when started with the -i (for interactive) command line option. . So the different scenarios is:; - runSofa -i & changing the file (this cost the reload of the shader); - runSofa -i & not changing the file (this cost calling the select system call) ; - runSofa as usual...this cost nothing. . I hope I answer you question and yet again, thank you for your feedback on this PR. . Now about FileListener... it is part of the FileMonitor API that is already in Sofa. .

Energy Efficiency,"Hi mathieu,. The provided code force a reload of the dependencies *each* time the runFile function is called. . I see two problem with this approach: ; - there is a large 'un-needed' overhead that will be linear with the number of PythonScriptController in the scene as well as in the amount of modules to reload (the depth of import dependency graph). . - there is *possibly* memory problems here. Let's me explain, normally all PythonScriptController are binded to functions that are from the same module set (the groupe of imported modules), this is made possible because python is caching the imported modules. In the PR we flush the module set at each runFile so each PythonScriptController will be binded to its own reloaded (""private"") version of the module. . So for the moment I think that adding a single PythonEnvironment object automatically in a scene with a cleanup function to unload the module will be either conceptually cleaner and more efficient. .

What if we would set a `Check()` method (and maybe also a `Parse(), Init(), fwdInit(), bwdInit()` and all other method that kind of expect a ""call super"" code smell to work...) in `SOFA_ABSTRACT_CLASS_DECL`, similar to this:. ```cpp; #define SOFA_ABSTRACT_CLASS_DECL \; [...]; void doCheck() { this->check(); static_cast<Inherit1*>(this)->doCheck(); }	\; virtual void Check() { this->doCheck(); }; ```; ; `Check()` would be a virtual method, so that when called from a casted `BaseObject` ptr or from a visitor, the child's method would be called.; `check()` and `doCheck()` on the other hand would not be virtual, so that when called from `this` casted as `Parent*`, the method of the current pointer cast would be called, thus triggering the recursion when static_casting the pointer. . It's the same as the ""call super"" pattern, with the exception that it is this time bug-free, because the API's user is not in charge of calling manually the parent's method.

Energy Efficiency,"It should be zero by default in my opinion. ; There is also a little confusion because there are currently two ways to specify the rayleigh damping parameters. ; If you use `EulerImplicitSolver` rayleigh damping is specified at the solver level. ; However both the `ForceField` and `Mass` API in SofaCore also implements rayleigh damping... provided you use `kfactorIncludingRayleighDamping` instead of `kfactor` when assembling the stiffness and the mass. This changed was introduced quite a long time ago, because in the Compliant plugin, the solvers for time integration do not implement global Rayleigh damping, but a more ""local"" one, delegated to each of the `Mass` and `Forcefield` components. ; So short answer is : yes should be zero. But it could break a **lot** of scenes that extensively rely on the default damping values to actually work... which mostly happens when you do not pay attention about the unit system you want to use in your scene ( e.g meters and kilograms versus millimetres and grams ) . I would also like to have the opinion of someone knowledgeable in that particular area. Rayleigh stiffness factor, contrary to Rayleigh mass factor, is not unit less. It is s^-1 as far as I can remember.

Energy Efficiency,Many thanks Matthieu for the time you spend on carefully reviewing this PR I appreciate. . For the movement of function in a file...my mistake I should have clean that...I tried other changes (like extern template specialization) that I finally not took into consideration in this PR but forgot to clean the file so they seems to have moved more than what they actually did. . You are right about performance issues and your suggestion for checking the first non-empty char in getUnsignedInteger looks ok so I will make the change. . Now about the getInteger vs atoi aspect my first impression is that there will be a small performance difference at the cost of scarifying correctness and code security so I really advocate for using getInteger/getUnisgnedInteger and not atoi. . To go further we probably have to measure the performance but I wouldn't be surprised to be less than a 10% speed difference so it is not worth the loss of good error reporting to user. If high performance is really an issue I prefer to put energy to implement a raw binary storage of indices because this would make things like 10x or more faster speedup as well as have less memory consumption.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/271#issuecomment-302655856:1021,energy,energy,1021,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/271#issuecomment-302655856,2,"['consumption', 'energy']","['consumption', 'energy']"

If we use the `implicit=""1""` in the UniformVelocityDampingForceField from the [DampingForceField](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/blob/master/examples/Component/SolidMechanics/FEM/DampingForceField.scn) example, we find a vertex point (node ""uniform (green)"") moving according to the following equation of motion:. $$ \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + 0.1 \frac{dx}{dt} = 0 $$. Given the initial conditions:. $$ x(0) = 0 $$. $$ v(0) = \frac{dx}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = 1.0 $$. This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.

Energy Efficiency,"The problem with this function is that you cannot trust the returned value forever due to pointer invalidation. `std::vector` allocates dynamically the memory depending of the need. At creation, it allocates a small chunk of memory. If the memory is full when you try to insert an element, it will allocate a bigger chunk of memory and move everything in this new memory space. Everything that was in the previous memory space is invalidated. It stills points to something, but it is invalid. And using it leads to a crash.

Energy Efficiency,"The rational of the PR is sounded and the existing design in sofa that mix the base class with a kind of hardcoded singleton/registry is bad and should be refactored (thank for the PR so). . From my experience the refactoring step in such situation depends if the static part is actually implementing kind of singleton or a kind registry of instances. But in both case the refactoring consists in moving all the static methods and static attributes in a new class with the sole purpose of handle the registry/singleton. . In your PR you are moving the static method and the singleton into TaskSchedulerFactory. ; If found using ""factory"" is confusing as to me a factory's roles (and design pattern) is to map to different construction methods and not holding the created instances. In order to keep the registry separated from the factory part I recommend keeping the two concerns separated in different classes. . To me a clean layout separating implementions and concerns is the following:; ```cpp; class TaskScheduler {}; // The base class for a scheduler; class TaskSchedulerRegistry:: {}; // The class implementing a registry of taskschedulers; class TaskSchedulerFactory:: {}; // The class implementing a factory for taskscheduler; class MainTaskSchedulerRegistry::{}; // The ""static"" class which contains a singleton of a TaskSchedulerRegistry ; // and public static methods to manipulate it (with mutex in each of them) ; class MainTaskSchedulerFactory::{} // The ""static"" class which contains a singleton of a TaskSchedulerFactory; // and pubic static methods to manipulate it. ; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3480#issuecomment-1324884905:1049,schedul,scheduler,1049,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3480#issuecomment-1324884905,1,['schedul'],['scheduler']

So I had duplicated positions, triangles and tetra in my scene, which caused failures. Those calls seemed to be triggered by `addUpdateCallback` in `MeshLoader`.; - the transforms wasn't called three times, so the last positions were not transformed.... but that's not really important I guess. After digging, I found that using `getWriteOnlyAccessor()` to access the `d_positions`... instead of `beginEdit()`, like it was done in most other loaders, reduced this number of calls, which fixed everything for me.

Energy Efficiency,"ese tests should be executed at each build (even for devs) and must pass. Failing in this kind of tests must be equal to a compilation error.; In that respect there is something that I am reluctant to allow for this type of tests is a lose coupling approach where you instantiate components using keys from the object factory. You may end up writing tests that in fact do not compile from a scratch build because this allows you to not take care about the dependencies between the libs. That is to say a test may instantiate a component that is not available yet, because it belongs to a library which is deeper in the build dependency tree at the time the unit test is built and executed during the compilation. - Functional tests, that require a working scene with probably more components than the one actually tested. These tests can be longer and therefore should not be mandatory during the compilation. ; They will be run only in ci machines, but can be also easily executed by any developers on its machine mostly to debug what is the nature of a new regression in these kind of tests. ; From our experience at InSimo these kinds of tests regress quite often during the development of a new feature, because you make some optimisation in the code, and you get some epsilon difference, or because you change the approach entirely and the scene is no longer relevant for you and should be changed. So you probably do not want too many of these functional tests, but there should be enough so that it is representative of the overall kind of simulations you want to support. ; But anyway it is still nice to have a record of the regressions that occur during the overall development, because you can then document better when you actually introduced changes in the code that are significant, which certainly is hard to track by unit tests only, unless you have a coverage of 100%, which is a target that in my opinion is a waste of energy to aim at, provided you have some functional tests also.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/471#issuecomment-337507243:2485,energy,energy,2485,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/471#issuecomment-337507243,1,['energy'],['energy']

Energy Efficiency,"if it is not explicitly passed in to all API calls, it can be queried with ExecParams::defaultInstance(), with the guarantee that this will always provide exactly the correct values (as there is a single copy per thread). For instance, this could allow to change the ExecMode in order to trace/profile a specific part of the computation. Without TLS, all calls done in parallel in other threads would now share the same mode. But as ExecMode was only ever used for KAAPI support (now removed), it is possible to decide to remove this as well without losing much.; 7. As a final point, one alternative fix (that I would personally prefer, but I am no longer involved directly so it is not up to me) would be to redesign this such that checkValidStorage() is no longer needed. The core issue is more related to the multithread TaskScheduler, where if a MechanicalParams (or another child of ExecParams) is copied from one thread to another as part of a Task, we can have functions that are called with the wrong ""storage"" pointer belonging to the calling thread. This is a very bad situation because the other thread might have moved on to other codes that changed the values, and more importantly ExecParams::defaultInstance() method used in many placed would see a different set of values. Currently this is fixed manually by calling mparams.update() at the beginning of the Task, but this is not always done, hence the check in the visitors as many Sofa computations end up using visitors somewhere. But if that could be the responsibility of the Task/TaskScheduler, they we could remove this check. This could be done for example by adjusting the ExecParams handling in a way that guarantees that inter-thread copies are by value of the storage (i.e. the value of ExecMode/.. but excluding threadID) instead of by reference, and known to the scheduler so that the parameters are correctly copied in the thread executing each runTask() without relying on manual updates.

Integrability," (mainly simulation and rendering) with full access to the scene graph without copies, by using copy-on-write for large Data and having each thread be assigned a ""version"" (called ""aspect"" per the published work that was used). See the MultithreadGUI for an example of this mechanism.; 3. As far as I know, all asynchronous/external rendering engines integrations that are used with Sofa relied instead on a design where the Sofa scene graph is not exposed but only visual meshes (based on SofaPhysicsAPI), therefore this feature was never enabled/tested in real applications so it can make sense to remove it.; 4. It would be interesting to measure if there are any performance gained from just removing the TLS qualifier (as done in PR #1129). I expect it to not be measurable, but performances can be surprising, which is why any optimization efforts should measure before and after ;); 5. If the TLS part of ExecParams is removed, then you should also remove everything that depends on it: MultithreadGUI, ExecParams::threadID, aspectID, AspectPool, *AspectVisitor, DDGNode::currentAspect()/copyAspect()/..., and all the aspect-related features in Data and Link. Otherwise all these code will be silently broken by the change.; 6. Note that this also makes ExecParams itself a bit pointless. The initial rational was that this provides a thread-safe way to set parameters controlling all codes in such a way that even if it is not explicitly passed in to all API calls, it can be queried with ExecParams::defaultInstance(), with the guarantee that this will always provide exactly the correct values (as there is a single copy per thread). For instance, this could allow to change the ExecMode in order to trace/profile a specific part of the computation. Without TLS, all calls done in parallel in other threads would now share the same mode. But as ExecMode was only ever used for KAAPI support (now removed), it is possible to decide to remove this as well without losing much.; 7.

Integrability," :** Model the Data accesses using ORWL's concepts + high level task parallelism (coarse grain parallelism); - use abstract Data accesses stored in FIFOs to extract parallelism : thread safe data accesses allowing concurrent reads.; - ensures that the semantic of the program is preserved.; - tasks defined at Visitor level : a Task is defined as the execution of a Visitor on a component.; - this strategy should apply to all visitors and components, as it does not depend on the nature of the component. **Issues :** ; - We wanted to use the Data class, since all accesses to a data object in sofa should be done using this class. Problem : this is not true, some components use vectors directly, or use Data methods / ReadAccessor / WriteAccessor not as intended (this is possible since for now some methods such as Data::endEdit do nothing) -> we would need to look at all sofa components to make sure that the Data are properly used; - To properly model the data accesses using ORWL's concepts we need to slightly modify the API of the Data class; - sofa Engine mecanisms are complex to handle using FIFOs; - it is difficult to predict the data dependencies as the Visitors are launched dynamically and can launch Visitors -> we can't predict the data accesses in a preprocessing phase, so we need to adapt ORWL.; - This approach would not induce significant performance gains on simulations with only 1 object or with 1 ""main"" object since all the computationally intensive tasks inside a given object access the same Data object (Write access) and thus are inherently sequential. **Conclusion :** the potential speedup is not good enough to invest more time on this strategy given the difficulty. **Second strategy :** finer-grain parallelization; To extract parallelism from highly data-dependent tasks we need to divide these tasks into less-dependent subtasks.; To achieve that, we are currently implementing parallel vectors to allow some kind of domain decomposition.; Work in progress...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/24#issuecomment-304903792:1875,depend,dependent,1875,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/24#issuecomment-304903792,2,['depend'],['dependent']

However:. - Loading the SofaPlugin library from within a python script that already imported it should be avoid for now since I'm not sure what side effects this will bring. Right now doing it seems not so bad as, again, we only attach the environment to the already created python environment. ; - A ScriptController will need to be added in order to trigger script events so that the python scene's functions (initGraph, onBeginAnimationStep, etc) are called.

Integrability," Pluginization works are possible but they have to be done in-place (not moving the files). This will permit to simplify the dependencies between SOFA modules. . About the NG branch, to avoid big divergence, we propose to merge it with master as soon as some big step is done. The next big step is SofaFramework coverage. ## Bootstrapping scripts. Previously named SPM, the [bootstrapping scripts](https://github.com/guparan/sofa2ng) are now able to handle test folders. ## Process. Here is the process to cover one module:; 1. Create/update a recipe based on an existing one.; 2. Run the bootstrapping scripts with the recipe.; 3. Inspect the output; 4. If something is wrong or missing, edit the bootstrapping scripts and *goto 1*; 5. Do specific changes by hand like namespace aliases; 6. Create a patch of all changes made by hand; 7. Open a pull-request providing the recipe and the patch (previously pushed to sofa2ng). This process will be rewritten in Sofa.Helper.Bvh pull-request. ## Sofa.Component.Utils. The first NG pull-request has been merged to the NG branch. There is still some updates to do though, because the bootstrapping scripts changed. ## Sofa.Helper.Bvh. The recipe has been updated. ; This work will be the base of further contributions. I will detail all the bootstrapping + patching process in the pull-request. ## Next steps; - Pluginize without moving files: use plugins mechanism to work on modules dependencies ; Start with the less dependent ones and progress towards SOFA core.; Objective: simplify dependencies between modules.; - Validate Damien's architecture proposal for SofaFramework: https://github.com/SofaDefrost/sofa/tree/cleanTheMessStep1/ng/kernel/Sofa; Particularly about Sofa.Helper.Types; - Create Sofa.Helper.Bvh pull-request; Will give a clear example and all the process to refactor parts of SofaFramework; - Progress within Sofa.Helper.*; Assign tasks to all volunteers before STC#5. ----------.

Integrability," convention as the one used in DataTypeInfo<>. So ```f``` instead of ```float```, ```vector<f>``` instead of ```vector<float>```, ```Vec3d``` instead of ```Vec<3, double>```. Unifying the other way around would have implied to use ```Vec<3, double>``` in our scene templates... which was a bit too much :); With that in mind, the current implementation of DataExchange is behaving exactly as it should. . The unittest you are pointing is showing a normal behavior. This behavior is that the template type that does not have a Name() static method and used in a class that is not implementing GetCustomTemplate will fall back to the automatic generation decoded from the typeid(). But this automatic generation is the code we want to get rid of (if one day someone has enough time to fix that) and not desired behavior to align with. Automatic decoding function to avoid breaking too much things until future evolution. . So currently the DataExchange implementation is using GetCustomClassName in order to implement consistent templates name with the other sofa components and not relying on the automatic generation. . If you are interested in unifying things i would recommend:; short term: implement a way to automatically use the DataTypeInfo<>::name() in the NameDecoder. If I remember well initially we didn't wanted to... because sofa::defaulttype was not a dependency of sofa::helper but now we have cleaned a lot that part it is possible to make something quickly. This would allow to remove all the GetCustomClassName in our code base to directly forward to DataTypeInfo<DataType>::name() when available instead of falling back. middleterm: add deprecation management to the falling back code to warn user it will disapear (when it was done we didn't has deprecation menagement...maybe it is worth having a look at that part nowaydays). longterm: remove all that crappy template DataTypeInfo<DataType>::name() and use the thing introduced in https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3289",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3461#issuecomment-1307815952:1620,depend,dependency,1620,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3461#issuecomment-1307815952,1,['depend'],['dependency']
Integrability," data vectors while executing on each component (for example MechanicalVisitor::fwdForceField, calls addForce or addDForce on each component, each one modifying the force vector).; We define a **Parallel Section** as the execution of a given visitor function on a list of components.; We define a **Task** as the execution of a visitor function on a component.

The newer similar design for initializing BaseLink did use an `initLink()` method without this pointer. And regarding this change:; * a useful aspect of having the pointer to the Data as the first parameter of `initData()` is to unambiguously know the type of the final `Data<T>`, so that there could be (relatively) good compile errors if the type of the provided default value is not matching it. I'm not sure how this PR is affecting / handling that (i.e. if you set a `float` value as a default to a `Data<int>`, how the gcc/clang/msvc error messages look like?); * one drawback in the current design is that there are sometimes bugs introduced by the multiple overloads of `initData()`, because of the ambiguity between the optional default value and the optional pair of bool flags at the end. In particular, for a `Data<std::string>`, calling `initData(&d, ""mydefaultvalue"", ""mydata"", ""help message"")` will incorrectly use the `initData()` version without default value but with one boolean flag, as `""mydefaultvalue""` is a `const char*` which requires a ""user-defined"" conversion to `std::string`, while `""help message""` is implicitely convertible to `bool` without any ""user-defined"" conversion, so preferred by the compiler. So if we break the compatibility to the current `initData()` API, I would strongly suggest to remove this issue, by removing the two optional bool flags which are seldom used anyway (and can be replaced by a call to `setDisplayed()` or `setReadOnly()`).; * compared to when this code was originally written, c++ now allows to put initializers of member variables in the class declaration direct",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3167#issuecomment-1196855283:1637,message,messages,1637,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3167#issuecomment-1196855283,1,['message'],['messages']
