Safety,"@amadio thanks for the comments. How this solves the CMS problem is illustrated by the example callback I included. That wraps the merge operation with an `std::promise()`, does a `task_arena::enqueue()` with that functor to the existing CMS framework TBB task arena, and then waits for the promise to complete. `task_arena::enqueue()` guarantees that the functor is executed by an existing member of the arena's thread pool. If the calling thread is not part of the arena, it cannot join it, so it cannot execute the functor itself. AFAICT, `task_arena::enqueue()` is the only interface that guarantees this; with other interfaces like `task_arena::execute()` or `task_group::run()`, the calling thread can temporarily join the arena, which would violate our framework's scheduling assumptions. wrt the interface change, my previous version added a second callback instead of modifying the existing one. From a functionality standpoint, the wrapper callback is a superset of the completion callback, but I do see the virtue of keeping the completion callback safe and having a separate callback for the riskier operation of wrapping the merge. I can certainly make that change if that would be more acceptable. I initially tried to do this with the `TTaskGroup`; unfortunately, with a `TTaskGroup` the calling thread can end up temporarily joining the task arena, which wasn't acceptable to us. It seems we have to use `task_arena::execute()`, which requires access to the framework task arena, which is how I ended using a callback for this.

Safety,"@sawenzel I get your point about thread safety, and agree that even the previous version was thread-unsafe, so I will deal with this later. The current version introduces a rather large critical section in `TGeoParallelWorld::InitSafetyVoxel` that blocks all concurrent threads even if they want to update the cache of different voxels, I would have pushed that lock a bit below where the update of the cache actually happens. But since this does not run in MT mode this is not critical now. Could you also do clang-formatting using ROOT style for the `bvh` part only (The entirety of TGeo is not yet formatted, but we will do it at some point), however the new files should be formatted. I looked and the internal thread pool is actually used for building the BVH in parallel, which is cool, but there may still be some unused headers, such as `sphere.h` - could you cross-check that and remove whatever is not needed?. The compilation errors on Mac are unrelated to your PR. Still, the compilation on alma8 with gcc8.5 fails, although it should not because the standard is set correctly to C++17 and the header <numeric> is included. ; ```; Error: /github/home/ROOT-CI/src/geom/geom/inc/bvh/v2/vec.h:99:17: error: ‘transform_reduce’ is not a member of ‘std’; ```; So @dpiparo what do we do about this since the `gcc` compliance with C++17 is known to be stable only starting with the gcc9 series?

Safety,"@sazio, as I said on the other PR, you originally based your local work on the `latest-stable` branch, which is only used by users to get the latest release, but not to check in new content into ROOT's repository. As you see in the change diff, there are lots of changes that are not meant to be there (that you should also have seen before creating the pull request, in the ""Review changes"" section). Also there are a number of merge conflicts. You must solve this locally before creating the PR. You must rebase your commits on top of `master`, otherwise this is not going to work. Here's what I would recommend, provided that your actual commits are on a local branch called `latest-stable`:; ```bash; $ git branch -m latest-stable tmva-variable-plotter # Renames your local branch; $ git fetch origin master:master; $ git checkout tmva-variable-plotter. # Rebase your 'tmva-variable-plotter' branch onto 'master', provided that the fork point of your branch was 'origin/latest-stable'.; # The default editor will open showing a number of 'pick' lines; just verify that those commits are part of your work. You may; # need to fix any merge conflict that might happen here.; $ git rebase --interactive --onto master origin/latest-stable. # If you mess up at some point while rebasing, you can revert to the previous state issueing `$ git rebase --abort`. # Then push your changes to GitHub and open a new pull-request; $ git push ...; ```. Afterward, you can open a new pull request with origin on `sazio:tmva-variable-plotter` targetting `root-project:master`.

Safety,"@vgvassilev if ""not exception safe"" here means w.r.t. `bad_allocs`, ROOT in general does not care (nothing works in that case anyway). If ""not exception safe"" means ""might leak if constructors of elements throw"", I don't think we care too much:. - RVec is mostly used with fundamental types ; - anyway that's not a situation in which analyses can/want to keep running, typically. Regarding your alternative proposals: we can't use a vanilla `std::vector` as a workhorse because we want to be able to adopt existing memory buffers. That would require std::vector + a custom allocator (like in the current implementation of RVec) which is fairly tricky to implement correctly (in fact, the current implementation has [broken usecases](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6796)), and the more complex class layout makes it harder for RNTuple to perform I/O. `std::vector<bool>` weirdness complicates matters (and I/O) further. So the alternative is basically re-implementing vector-with-adoption-and-sbo ourselves. All considered I think we could be ok with leaving the object in a ""bad"" state in case the construction of vector elements throws (which I think is what ""not exception safe"" means in this context), for the two reasons mentioned above -- but I'd like @Axel-Naumann to make the call.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7502#issuecomment-818905333:30,safe,safe,30,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7502#issuecomment-818905333,3,['safe'],['safe']

Safety,"After upgrading ROOT to 6.30, one of our applications also started giving us the error mentioned in this thread; ```; Fatal in <operator new>: with std::align_val_t is not implemented yet; ```; A little research led me to this: https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/aborting-with-std-align-val-t-is-not-implemented-yet-rhel-9-2/55989. If I understand correctly, this is the situation:. - `TMapFile` requires linking with libNew; - libNew is broken with -std=c++17 or higher (missing `operator new` overload); - ROOT 6.30 requires C++17; - Hence `TMapFile` (and actually all of `libNew`) is currently unusable in ROOT 6.30. There are no workarounds. Please elaborate if I am missing something. This is a bit of an issue. You do realize that EPEL 9 provides just such a broken version (ROOT 6.30.02 with -std=c++17). Hence, on RHEL 9/Alma 9 etc. (i.e. the current go-to version of Linux at many labs), anyone who needs to use `TMapFile` (or `libNew`) must downgrade to ROOT 6.28 and, possibly, compile by hand with -std=c++14. Additionally, on the latest version of macOS, Sonoma, only ROOT 6.30+ is supported. Hence, any code that uses `TMapFile` is inevitably broken at this time on the current version of macOS. The only ""workaround"" would be to downgrade (i.e. reinstall) the OS.; ; If I might make a suggestion: I would mention, or better: highlight, such regressions in the [release notes](https://root.cern/doc/v630/release-notes.html#release-6.3004) of a new version. Or better yet, not consider a new release ready until such significant regressions are resolved.

Safety,"Ah, sorry, I was looking at the numbers for ReadUnLock. The differences between Std14 and Std17 are at least partly noise I think. I also have an implementation working now based on ```tbb::enumerable_thread_specific``` (https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/tbb-documentation/top/intel-threading-building-blocks-developer-reference/thread-local-storage/enumerablethreadspecific-template-class.html) . Now in principle what tbb is doing underneath should not so different from ``` TTHREAD_TLS_DECL```, at least for the explicit pthread-based version, so we can think about whether this is really safe from deadlocks, but the numbers looks pretty good. In the test output below ""TBB"" is using ```tbb::enumerable_thread_specific<LocalCounts>``` and ""TBBUnique"" is using ```tbb::enumerable_thread_specific<LocalCounts, tbb::cache_aligned_allocator<LocalCounts>, tbb::ets_key_per_instance>``` which is limited to a small number of instances per process (but not strictly to 1).

So the general penalty from the shared_mutex appears to compensate for avoiding the exclusive lock in ReadLock(). This could be further optimized by using the shared_mutex only in RecurseCountsShared, but given the results, the tbb-based solution looks rather promising.

Safety,"FYI a related discussion from back then:. ""Should TTreeProcessor disable ParTreeProcessing once Process() is done? If so, maybe these functions should be an RAII instead of a pair of enable/disable (also to restore correctly to the *previous* state instead of enable/disable). This was discussed during the parallelisation meetings, and the point here is that it is safer to activate it the first time Process() is called and never deactivate it. The reason is people might call this method from different threads, and if we do activate-deactivate there could be interleaving of the two Process() calls. This could potentially deactivate the locks in one call when they are still needed in the other call. Sounds like you just need an atomic use count?

This guarantees that if CMSSW has N output modules, there will be at most N queued merge operations and while the merge are going on only 1 thread is used for it (and the other N-1 can be used for other CMSSW work). e) We need to implement a queuing of the merge operations tasks without relying on the ROOT global write lock.

Meaning that if you have an extendible pdf, it will automatically do an extended fit (i.e., a Poisson term to constrain the number of predicted events is added). However, if you have weights this is not meaningful anymore. I guess you don't even want to do an extended fit in your case. You can explicitly pass `RooFit::Extended(false)` to get back the old behavior:; ```c++; using namespace RooFit;.

This class inherits from RooAbsPdf, and a pdf in RooFit is forced to be positive everywhere. Therefore, you can't fit the your data with the negative bin contents at all. You need to create a RooAbsReal-derived function, maybe a [RooRealSumFunc](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooRealSumFunc.html). Or maybe can you avoid the negative bin content all together? Where does it even come from, from subtracting a background? IN this case this is the wrong thing do do for statistical analysis.

In part I have succeeded, because now the cache optimization will now always be skipped in the construction in batch mode is enabled. So I don't need a `_originallyCacheOptimized` flag to remember if the optimization has to be reverted after the construction which was not the nicest hack anyway. Still, I could not do without a new `_batchMode` flag in `RooAbsTestStatistic` because the cache optimization can also happen after the construction via `RooAbsTestStatistic::constOptimizeTestStatistic`. Adding a batch mode flag to the constructor also required me to change all the constructor signatures of `RooAbsTestStatistic` and derived classes. I took that opportunity to revisit how the configuration parameters are passed such that if the future it will be much easier to add a new parameter.

The limit is in the dCache storage system (xrootd.grid.surfsara.nl), not on the client side. This limit is there for a reason: it prevents the storage pools from being overloaded with transfers and crashing. When hadd tries to open all files at once, it tries to read more files concurrently than the limit per dCache storage pool allows. The first files are served, but the rest of the transfers are queued. This means, that they remain open but zero bytes are served, until some of the other transfers finish. But hadd never finishes those because it insists on reading from all files at the same time. So it gets stuck into a deadlock situation. If hadd would detect this situation (I'm getting data for some files but zero bytes for other files), it would make sense to stop reading all files concurrently, but instead continue reading from all files that it can, close those files, and then receive data for the other files. If hadd could do that, such a deadlock would be prevented, while performance would still be the maximum available.

Your examples of `sqlite3` or Python files are misplaced, none of those is leaking memory like ROOT.

Safety,"Hi @ynikitenko, thanks for the request! There are several reasons for not supporting PyPy. PyROOT, which is building on top of cppyy, is very deeply connected to the CPython implementation of CPyCppyy. Just like the CPython version of cppyy, PyROOT consists of a Python module and a compiled CPython extension (`libROOTPythonization`). And you can't use CPython extensions in PyPy. So to support PyPy, we would have to rewrite [all this code](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/pyroot/pythonizations/src), and work closely with the cppyy team to make sure it's PyPy implementation also provides the interfaces that PyROOT expects. That would be a *huge* amount of work with no usecase to justify it. And there are so many alternative of fast analysis frameworks that people are trying out right now: RDataFrame, NumPy, numba, awkward arrays, etc. And let's not forget that pypy has it's limitations! It only supports a restricted subset of Python, and it would require large efforts to port PyROOT to this. One final point: the future of PyPy development is not very clear. Right now, they don't support Python 3.11 yet, for example. Builds are only available for [Python 3.9 and Python 3.10](https://www.pypy.org/download_advanced.html). So investing in PyPy compatibility is also risky because of that. Imagine we would spend half a year trying to support it, and then PyPy would not be maintained anymore :(.

Safety,"Hi Enric, ; Thank you very much! ; Indeed it is a kind of problem; I rely on pickling in my project for two cases:. 1. implicitely, where I use the `parallel python`/`multiprocess`/`multiprocessing`/`pathos` to split the task into subtasks that can be executed in parallel in different processes or even on different nodes. Behind the scene such stuff relies on serialization/deserialization of objects via `pickle` or `dill`; 2. explicitely where I store my data into custom `shelve`-like database, that relies on serialization of objects via pickling. - for (1) I do not know if I can properly inject ""import ROOT"" into the code flow at all vital occurances. ; - for (2) of course I can pre-import `ROOT` for all manipulations with custom database, but it is rather unnatural solution. E.g. opening a (originally `ROOT`-blind) database I need to know that it contains some `ROOT`-objects, and in this case use `import ROOT` before accessing objects from the database.

This description does not need to be a long text but a short synopsis of the utility. Adding example invocations would greatly increase its usefulness.; 4) You do not need to parse the header.

Safety,"Hi Patrick, thanks a lot for these excellent developments! I will start the Jenkins tests to see if the CI can build it. To successfully integrate these developments, we should split the changes up into smaller PRs, as discussed in the RooFit weekly meeting. We could, for example, chunk it like this:. 1. First PR with changes to `math` only (`mathcore` and `minuit2`). Please ensure that no commit in this PR doesn't touch both math packages at the same time if not necessary. As far as I understood, the changes to `mathcore` and `minuit2` factorize, and you can make a commit for `mathcore` and then one or more for `minuit2`.; 2. Second PR with the new `roofit` packages `multiprocess` and `roofitZMQ`, again with separate commits for the individual packages. I guess you'd have to exclude the multiprocessing test that depends on roofit at that point, though. In this PR, we can also discuss in more detail how to manage the zero MQ dependency.; 3. Third PR with the rest, integrating the new `multiprocess` and `roofit/ZMQ` packages into RooFit. Feel free to split it up further if you think that's better. Some general things to consider in the new PRs:. * It seems unfeasible to rewrite the commit history in this PR to something that factorizes as proposed above. I guess you need to create new commits from the diff that only affect single packages.; * Please avoid mixing code formatting changes with actual changes in the same commit.; * Even better, avoid code formatting changes altogether. We want to eventually use a well-defined clang-format style (specified in [this file](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/.clang-format)), so changing the formatting in your PRs to something that is not compliant with the clang-format style is not meaningful.; * If your developments introduce new files (in particular the new `roofit` packages), please apply the ROOT clang-format style, so we don't have to touch these files again later just for the sake of reformatting.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294#issuecomment-854587983:1371,avoid,avoid,1371,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294#issuecomment-854587983,2,['avoid'],['avoid']
Safety,"Hi Patrick, thanks for the explanation, things make more sense for me now! Interesting that you also experimented with making the full RooAbsMinimizer templated. I agree that making the RooAbsMinimizer a templated class is not the best solution, but I still think we can even avoid the templated constructor, making the code more clear and reducing compile time/binary size. You already have this nice `FcnMode` enum class which I think is great because enum class is typesafe while enum is not. Taking this enum, you could have a RooMinimizer constructor with the signature:; ```; RooMinimizer(RooAbsReal &function, FcnMode fcnMode);; ```; Then depending on `fcnMode`, you can create the correct function instance. You would not even have to check for the `logic_error`, because with the enum class is is ensured that the value is either `classic` or `gradient`. You would just need a little helper struct to make the `RooMinimizer::create()` function work, something to translate from the function class to the FcnMode:. ```C++; class RooMinimizer { ; ; ... ; private: ; ; template <typename MinimizerFcn ; struct GetFcnMode { ; static const FcnMode value = FcnMode::classic; ; }; ; ; ... ; ; } ; ; ; template<> ; struct RooMinimizer::GetFcnMode<RooGradMinimizerFcn> { ; static const FcnMode value = FcnMode::gradient; ; }; ; ; ; // static function ; template <typename MinimizerFcn> ; std::unique_ptr<RooMinimizer> RooMinimizer::create(RooAbsReal &function) { ; return std::make_unique<RooMinimizer>(function, GetFcnMode<MinimizerFcn>::value); ; } ; ```. Would this approach also work with your upcoming developments?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596#issuecomment-879770741:276,avoid,avoid,276,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596#issuecomment-879770741,1,['avoid'],['avoid']
Safety,"Hi Philippe,; ; > it might be impossible to avoid synonyms that are semantically distincts ... a good example is two free standings (not attached to any directory) histograms that happens to have the same name in two distinct and independent part of the code (e.g. two CMSSW modules). Good point. I admit that did not really think to this case. > The other major problem is that it unnecessary tie (via that global mutex) all the 'parallel' histogram, this means that the overall scalability is inherently decreased. > Rather than a completely global state, wouldn't it make sense to have a wrapper object (for example TThreadedObject) be the holder of the lock and list for a single set of related histogram.; > This would both reduce contention and guarantees that the histograms are really related. I agree on this and TThreadedObject could be the place where to control this. The drawback is that we would then not have a solution outside TThreadedObject, i.e. we will have to find a way to force the use of TThreadedObject in MT cases. > A 3rd significant problem (but fixeable) is that the operation covered by the ReadWrite lock are not atomic (and/or trivial) and for the look of it could plausibly indirectly request the ROOT global lock and thus can lead to deadlocks (from some other code that hold the ROOT global locks and request the Write part of the ReadWrite lock). Not sure to understand, you mean FindObject?; I will have a closer look. > A 4th deficiency is that once activated for one histogram it seems to apply to all histogram. i.e. as far as can tell if you one parallel histograms and 10,000 single-thread histograms, filling the single-thread histogram still has to go through the multi-thread registration/mechanism. Ok, a solution 'per histogram' would also address this.

Safety,"Hi Vincenzo,. So one thing I didn't mention is that in this case, we were also building Python 3.11, and it seems that the key is that it was being built with assertions enabled, unlike the default Fedora 38 python3 build.

It seems that it's possible to reproduce the issue without building anything by using the F38-packaged `root` and `python3-debug`, and then running my reproducer with `python3-debug` (which has assertions enabled) rather than python3. . ```; $ cat test.py ; import ROOT. f= ROOT.TFile(""test.root"",""RECREATE""); $ python3 test.py # succeeds; $ python3-debug test.py #fails; python3-debug: /builddir/build/BUILD/Python-3.11.5/Objects/typeobject.c:1210: subtype_traverse: Assertion `type->tp_dictoffset' failed.; *** Break *** abort ; ....; ```.

I have created a PR for that:. https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39867. Indeed, it appears I introduced a bug with recent developments where the overhead when using the `RooFit::Range()` argument blew up. But I suggest you remove this argument to begin with, because the range was the same that is used to define the `InvMass` variable to begin with. So in any case it's better for you to not use `Range()`, and then you also don't hit the code path that has the bug (and you will have less overhead once the bug is gone).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11637#issuecomment-1292750664:110,avoid,avoid,110,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11637#issuecomment-1292750664,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

The standard way of do this in ROOT is to use [TParameter](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v612/classTParameter.html) or an `std::` container, as also discussed here:; https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/writing-simple-variable-in-root-files/11094/5.

A package manager can install wherever it wants and can make its own; adjustment (simply copy over the two files, or put symlinks); this will; affect users building from source. I don't worry about package managers,; only about the latter users.

Safety,"Hi,; I double-checked the behavior of `TTree::Draw` and `TTreeReader` when reading ""misaligned"" friends in a number of situations: as `TTrees`/`TChains`, friends longer/shorter than the main tree, friends with/without a `TTreeIndex`. With the path at https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7131, which avoids an infinite loop with `TTreeReader` + indexed friend tree, `TTreeReader` and `TTree::Draw` behave the same in all cases except the one reported here. This means e.g. that switching from using a `TTree` to using a `TChain` to read the same data can change the number of entries `TTreeReader` reads in case of a friend that's larger than the main `TTree`. The problematic logic is that of `TTree::LoadTree(entry)`, which does not return an error if `entry` is larger than the number of entries in the main tree as long as the friend tree has enough entries (again note that `TChain` behaves differently, ending the event loop as soon as the main tree entries are over, and `TTree/TChain::Draw` also behaves like that). In particular, these lines are what causes `TTree::LoadTree` to not return an error:. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/8d616f45e399d3a918b6a78edf98aa54219eb5d2/tree/tree/src/TTree.cxx#L6447-L6452. <hr>.

It is indeed a reasonable thing to check if the font files exist before object's json is sent over to the client --- but creating a font during the streaming traversal would be pushing it a bit. Is it possible to register custom prefixes and callbacks from REveManager (via RWebWindow) so they can be handled when requests come in? Like: http://server/sdf-fonts/. I went through the code a bit (but clearly do not have the full picture) ... one way would be to add THttpServer::fActiveLocations, where instead of replacement string one provides a lambda [](TString& prefix, TString& reminder, THttpRequest& req, THttpServer &srv) so one can then do appropriate lookup in the callback, potentially generating the font, and then calling srv->SendFile() (or sending back the default font, if the desired one can not be found/generated). I think this functionality could be useful for other cases in REve, where semi-static data needs to be provided. The font-generation code in REveText invokes TGL generator through the interpreter now, via gROOT->ProcessLine(), to avoid dependency of REve on RGL.

Safety,"I am a little concerned about the basic idea. If I understood correctly, there is a (unique) global registry where the histogram are identified based on their 'full path name' (beside the fact that GetNameForRanges seems both brittle and currently seems on first reading 'wrong'/'not-as-intended'). I see two major problems, one is that the 'full path name' may never be really unique i.e. it might be impossible to avoid synonyms that are semantically distincts ... a good example is two free standings (not attached to any directory) histograms that happens to have the same name in two distinct and independent part of the code (e.g. two CMSSW modules). The other major problem is that it unnecessary tie (via that global mutex) all the 'parallel' histogram, this means that the overall scalability is inherently decreased. Rather than a completely global state, wouldn't it make sense to have a wrapper object (for example TThreadedObject) be the holder of the lock and list for a single set of related histogram.; This would both reduce contention and guarantees that the histograms are really related. A 3rd significant problem (but fixeable) is that the operation covered by the ReadWrite lock are not atomic (and/or trivial) and for the look of it could plausibly indirectly request the ROOT global lock and thus can lead to deadlocks (from some other code that hold the ROOT global locks and request the Write part of the ReadWrite lock). A 4th deficiency is that once activated for one histogram it *seems* to apply to all histogram. i.e. as far as can tell if you one parallel histograms and 10,000 single-thread histograms, filling the single-thread histogram still has to go through the multi-thread registration/mechanism. And that remind me, that another challenge for the 'unique registry' solution is to understand its scalability where reaching 10 to 100 thousands histograms.

Safety,"I figured out the reason of my apparent 'instability' in results. Rather than a problem with the ROOT build, it was actually a variation in the way I generated/created the library needed to emulated the ATLAS libraries. The original 2 files contains respectively 1 and 2 ATLAS classes derived from the RooAbsPdf and because the objects of that type are added to a compiled list, they must be created properly (otherwise you get type detection errors .. in part because RooAbsPdf is an abstract class). In order to generate this library, I use TFile::MakeProject (which almost works, I have to add an implementation for the abstract functions by hand). Part of the this MakeProject is to generate a LinkDef file. Because the output of MakeProject should not depend on the ROOT version, I generated the libraries with an arbitrary version of ROOT (and did not pay attention which one at the time, but it was different on different machine and upon seeing the weird crash, I may have regenerated the project on the machine I was using at the time).

The second created by libCling loaded with RTLD_DEEPBIND. (By design, RTLD_DEEPBIND links to libstdc++ first before checking the global namespace, so it does not see the copy-relocated symbol.).

In the end I have not moved the return after `StackTrace`, so with this solution we don't print the stack trace for an unexpected `SIGABRT`. In the case of an assert, the assert failure itself is still notified with a message that tells you the file and line where it happened, so perhaps we don't need a stack trace. > When on the prompt, should it recover or stop the process? (probably stop the process but then again we don't stop the process for other 'bad' state: SigBus, SigSegmentationViolation, SigIllegalInstruction, SigFloatingException). The current solution stops the process. If a `SIGABRT` was thrown it's because a critical (unrecoverable) error happened, so it makes sense to stop.

Safety,"I see your issue with thread safety. However, your proposed solutions will not work for the following reasons. The assignment of the static variable in GetRootSys depends on the environment variable ROOTSYS (as does the others since they depend on GetRootSys). If the static variables are assigned at initialization time, these assignments will be done when the program is loaded before the program starts. But at this point the value of the ROOTSYS environment variable is not always set to the correct value. If the program is started without ROOTSYS set, TUnixSystem::Init will initialize it. The assignment of the static variable in GetRootSys must therefore be done after this. I have added calls to all the functions in the TROOT constructor, after the call to InitSystem. This way all the static variables get assigned by the TROOT constructor (which I believe is run single threaded).

Safety,"I tested offline @hahnjo 's proposal, as it would have had the nice advantage of avoiding the backwards-incompatible change brought by the current status of this PR. A summary of the insights I gathered:. 1. There are some technical obstacles, the main one being that we don't have a single, coherent code path for all data sources. Crucially, `TTree` is handled differently from any other data format (i.e. it doesn't use the `RDataSource` mechanism). This practically means that I cannot create a lazy `RDataSource` to handle them all. But in first approximation this could have been solved with one extra branching; 2. It is not straightforward to know where exactly to trigger the inferring of the data source. Practically, this is needed at the very latest in `RLoopManager::Run`, i.e. right before the start of the event loop. But it can also be needed before that, namely whenever a node of the computation graph is created it might need to know about the column names it uses, so the dataset schema must be gathered thus the data source type must be inferred. Admittedly, this is also another fixable problem with a better documentation or cleaner code to explain exactly at what point of any RDataFrame application the loop manager would need the dataset schema in place; 3. Probably the greatest obstacle posed by this idea is that it indeed fixes one backwards-incompatible change, but introduces another one. RDataFrame allows some operations to run without triggering the computation graph, actually without even needing to populate the computation graph at all.

Not quite, I meant simply an overall average, i.e. simply keeping `total_number_of_bytes` and `total_number_of_compressed_bytes` for each column and then average compression ration is a simple division. But ... actually ... closer to the original proposal is simply the ""total_number_of_bytes_in_all_flushed_clusters"" and ""corresponding_compressed_size"" (i.e. a per RNtuple running total). However this makes me thing of another (potential more noticeable) instability. If there is 2 columns; column A with an constant/average compression ration of 100 and column B with a constant/average compression ration of 1 (or 1.1 :) ) but both columns are collections. If for most of the entries (for more proposal) or only the last cluster (for the PR's proposal), column A has a lot of data and column B has very little data, then the compression ration use for prediction will be 100 (ish). If suddenly the cardinality flip/flop and column A has very little data but column B has a lot of data, then the compression ration of that cluster will be 1 but it would still contains `100 * target_cluster_size_in_compressed_bytes`, namely in this case 100 times larger (on disk) than any other cluster. Obviously this is an extreme example but it points to the benefit of using `per column` compression ratio rather than overall compression ratio (whether it is whole-ntuple or last (few) clusters). The cost for implementation seems to be that after each `Fill`, each column would have to increment a (global-per-RNtuple) counter with `data_written / estimated_compression_ratio` which:; * for collection column should be a small over-head; * for single value column should be a large over-head. however conversely, an accurate estimate is ""only important"" for collection column, so maybe an hybrid solution is a workable compromise?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8703#issuecomment-920229853:1012,predict,prediction,1012,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8703#issuecomment-920229853,1,['predict'],['prediction']

Safety,"Intentional. An `std::string` has a single-char array representation underlying it, which is a Python `bytes` object, not a `str`, which is unicode. The point of `repr()` is to be able to provide a `str` object from which the original object can be reconstructed. That, therefore, has to be a `bytes` representation. The point of `str()` is to provide something that looks pretty and informational, which in practice is more likely to be a decoded `str`, hence that choice. Specifically, b/c unicode isn't properly implemented in any C++ standard string class, it's common practice to place an encoded unicode string into `std::string`. Regardless, even if it contains unencoded ASCII, whenever a C++ `std::string` is represented as a Python `str`, it needs decoding. However, no information is available on the encoding scheme. It's typically safe to assume an UTF-8 encoding b/c ASCII is a subset, but there's no guarantee. Hence the current implementation tries to avoid decoding as much as possible and only does so when absolutely necessary (e.g. when doing string comparisons or, as in this example, when calling `str()`). The implementation of `std::string` has been Pythonized so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement wherever a `str` object is expected, with the exception of when you do anything type specific, such as `repr()`, `type()`, and `isinstance()`, where it will represent as an `std::string`, which it is. For CERN, none of this is likely to matter as all European languages are encodable UTF-8 AFAIK. The most common language, in my experience, where this assumption fails is Chinese. (Edit: I read up on it and turns out that *all* languages are encodable in UTF-8, it's just that that encoding is designed to be space-efficient for Latin languages, but is rather inefficient for Asian languages, hence the common choice of different encodings there.)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15153#issuecomment-2040504962:844,safe,safe,844,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15153#issuecomment-2040504962,2,"['avoid', 'safe']","['avoid', 'safe']"

Safety,"Just a short summary of our discussion in https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/issues/1495. 1. Threads in xrootd client:. - `XRD_PARALLELEVTLOOP` is by default set to 1, and is the number of event-loop threads handling the async I/O; in some cases e.g. if the xrootd client is interacting with many servers (as it does in case of XCache) a single event loop can become CPU bound and in those scenarios it makes sense to use multiple event-loops; - `XRD_WORKERTHREADS` is by default set to 3, and is the number of threads in the thread-pool used to call completion handlers; - there is also the `TaskManager` thread, which runs various timers, amongst others responsible for the request timeouts; - in case of `xrdcp` there is also the main execution thread. 2. `XRD_PARALLELEVTLOOP`; The XRD_PARALLELEVTLOOP, it is the parallel number of event loops the client is using. In case of single event loop, all socket I/O events are processed by a single thread, in general this is good because we avoid context switching (as opposed to synchronous I/O). However in some cases this can lead to a situation where the client becomes CPU bound. For example imagine xrdcp is copying data between two very fast servers (say 100GE, with ramdisk or optane). In a setup like this the event-loop will be receiving new I/O events faster than it is able to process them and as a results will limit the transfer rate. If we use 2 event-loops on the other hand, the source and the destination I/O events will be handled by separate threads/event-loops which could result in 2x faster I/O event processing (I measured 2.5GB/s vs 4.5GB/s).

Safety,"My 2 cents:. 1. It is extremly weird/ a bug that the webgui needs to depend on `TObject`.; 2. `RBrowserDataCleanup` derives from `TObject`, so it *must* have a `ClassDef` as per https://root.cern/manual/io_custom_classes/#the-classdef-macro . I am not sure about what using `ClassDefInline` as suggested by @pcanal would change; 2a. Can `RBrowserDataCleanup` just avoid inheriting from `TObject` completely? ; 3. `RBrowserData` has a dictionary and allows I/O, as it is defined in `LinkDef.h`, so it is only natural that its data members need a dictionary as well. As @hahnjo commented, the particular error coming from a `std::tuple` is due to the fact that the class uses ` std::unique_ptr<RBrowserDataCleanup>`. Bottom line, to me everything looks very clear and I don't understand the comments regarding looking for a deeper reason behind the error.

Safety,"My reasoning for removing usage of `std::string_view` is that using `const std::string&` avoids copying memory and only requires C++11, while `std::string_view` requires C++17 or a backport. Moreover, along with the extra requirements of `std::string_view`, when it is passed by value it uses a pointer + length, which means possibly twice the size of just a reference. If we are not using the editing potential of `std::string_view`, or even worse, are just using it to actually make a copy of the data inside, then I see no real advantage in using it relative to just using a reference to `std::string` in the interface that basically does the same job better without adding the extra requirements of a higher C++ standard and/or a backport.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/804#issuecomment-318633601:89,avoid,avoids,89,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/804#issuecomment-318633601,1,['avoid'],['avoids']

Safety,"Now I'm doing another thing, and return again to this issue. I want to make a 3-dimensional fit, but some pdfs depend only on z, so I multiply them by uniform pdfs on x and y. I mean RooUniform for the whole domain of a variable, not what I proposed in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7880. So I create a uniform distribution like that. RooUniform u_nt_x(""u_nt_x"", ""u_nt_x"", x);; RooUniform u_nt_y(""u_nt_y"", ""u_nt_y"", y);; RooProdPdf uxy_nt(""uxy_nt"", ""uxy_nt"", RooArgList(u_nt_x, u_nt_y));. So I have 5 pdfs for which I need to create a separate uniform distribution on (x, y), which in turn requires creation of new pdfs on x (and on y), which are all uniform and absolutely the same.

Safety,"OK thanks. I believe that ""there is no other way to get reliable results"" is a bit of an exaggeration - many numerical libraries and programs do not turn fp exceptions on. IEEE 754 allows them to survive just fine the cases you are hunting down, because (as you certainly know) IEEE 754 brings defined behavior to ""degenerate"" (not in the IEEE 754 sense) cases. As a matter of fact, I believe you have just proven to yourself that ""there is no other way to get reliable results"" is also incorrect, as the optimizer might change fp operations. Yes, GCC tries to keep them ""fp-safe"" but that might change in any of the upcoming versions, just like it did for instance for clang, the Intel compiler, and - if I remember correctly - MSVC. Our approach is not to rely on fp exceptions but on coverage in regression tests. That has limited reach (as would fp exceptions) but it allows us to detect when results change in a visible, ""unreliable"" way.

Safety,"Ok so there are few different issues here. Leaving aside the question of why the template error isn't detected, the reason why it's not even printed to the console is because the problematic instantiation occurs via the LookupHelper which calls ```setSuppressAllDiagnostics``` by default. The stack trace leading up to the instantiation looks as below*. So as a workaround at least the user can call from python ```ROOT.gDebug = 6``` to get the full output from clang. Maybe the defaults need to be reconsidered here. The optimal solution here for pyroot/cppyy in general is maybe a bit involved. What is probably desired is; 1) Don't print the clang output, but store any errors or warnings during template instantiation attempts e.g. using ```cling::utils::DiagnosticsStore```; 2) If no template is successfully instantiated then print the stored warnings and errors for each case; 3) If a template is successfully instantiated, but had warnings, at least print those for the successful case.

Safety,"Ok, I've had a first quick look. This is rather a feature than a bug. During alignment, some bounding boxes and voxels need to be recomputed (see the logic in [TGeoPhysicalNode::Align](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/7c81a10d9fa965b25f35b0ec709d6095a209ac16/geom/geom/src/TGeoPhysicalNode.cxx#L293#L306)). Since a given volume may be changed by many physical node alignments, their bounding boxes and voxels are only marked to be recomputed, otherwise the operation takes too long for complex cases. This lazy recomputation occurs only when any navigation function is called for the given volume, but not when calling just the getter of the box dimensions. So the behavior runtime should be OK, even if you see that some bounding boxes appear to be zero just after alignment. The recomputation of boxes/voxels can be however triggered manually using the following code:; ```; TIter nextv(gGeoManager->GetListOfVolumes());; TGeoVolume *vol;; while ((vol = (TGeoVolume*)nextv())) {; if (vol->IsAssembly()) vol->GetShape()->ComputeBBox();; auto finder = vol->GetVoxels();; if (finder && finder->NeedRebuild()) {; finder->Voxelize();; vol->FindOverlaps();; }; }; ```; I guess this code could be automatically called inside TGeoManager::RefreshPhysicalNodes() which needs to be called anyway by the user to recover pointer consistency after all alignments are applied.

Safety,"Removed the false comment and moved the `unique_ptr` declaration above `TextInputHolder`, in case `TextInputHolder::~TextInputHolder()` still access it (in the future). However, I am thinking about enhancing CLI completion support of cling. Such as tab completion. Currently cling only prints completion suggestion but does not complete the input buffer for the user when only single unambiguous completion exists. Also the completion does not recognize meta command like `.x`, `.L` so it does not try to complete its arguments (paths). And the path does not expand `~` to home dir.; @Axel-Naumann , do you think it is a good idea for cling to adopt `llvm::LineEditor` ? (https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1LineEditor.html) ; Or building cling's own readline/libedit wrapper? ; `core/textinput/src/textinput/doc/textinput.txt` states that `textinput` is created to avoid depending on readline/libedit in year 2011.; Is it still true today 2022? cling highly depends on llvm now so it should be fine to adopt `llvm::LineEditor` (created in 2013. `textinput` predates it).; I have a prototype cling with the above enhanced completion support based on libedit but I will only create PR if cling (and all root components currently using `textinput` ) are open to such changes and dependency.

Safety,"So I finally managed to get back to this and try a few things and as a result in my tests I managed to go from 82 MB of overhead to 62 MB. See https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13641 for the actual code. While there is still a few things to cleanup, I think what I have is fairly general and quite self contained change, so I would appreciate feedback and if people like it, instructions on how to proceed to make sure this ends up upstream. The solution is based on a newly introduced `PagedVector<T>` which allows registering callbacks which get invoked whenever the associated range is accessed the first time. At such point, the range is actually allocated and each element of the range is passed to the callback. Initially I developed a mechanism to be general enough to do complex initialisations of the elements, however I later realised this is not actually needed. In order to optimise the issue with the large vectors `TypesLoaded` and `DeclsLoaded` one only needs to have something which does the default construction of their elements for ranges which are small enough to avoid to large upfront allocations. The code which is currently there in root / clang is already smart enough to lazily initialise only the elements which are actually needed, so the whole issue is to find a good tradeoff between number of ranges and sparse enough ones. A few caveats:. - `PagedVector` is a bad name, I agree. Suggestions are welcome.; - At the moment the implementation allows generic callbacks for ranges, however as I said we only need default initialisation. Removing such flexibility should buy another 1 MB from my test.; - In case `DeclID*` and `QualType` can default to all 0, one could probably achieve the same result in a more elegant way using calloc / realloc.; - There are probably other vectors which can be optimised in the same way, in particular IdentifiersLoaded as already mentioned by @vgvassilev.

The problem is that one can detect easily if ROOT was built with -Druntime_cxxmodules=On, however, the system can have a module which cannot load successfully (due to for example missing requirements). In that case, the implementation will switch back to non-modules. Short answer, yes we can provide such API, however, that would not be 100% reliable. A reliable API should work on per-library basis.

Safety,"Synopsis of the original error report:. Description. I had thought that our `art v3_09_01` based art passed all of our validation tests but I missed a single histogram that failed. I discovered it yesterday. I traced it back to the following. We have a file. `/pnfs/mu2e/scratch/users/brownd/workflow/default/outstage/44170899/00/00000/dig.brownd.CeEndpointMix.MDC2020b.001201_00000000.art`. It was written by `art v3_06_03`. One of the data products is of type `std::vector<StepPointMC>`, where `StepPointMC` is a class in our code base. The class contains 4 data members of type `CLHEP::Hep3Vector`:. https://github.com/Mu2e/Offline/blob/da4772bcb99f7b42bd401c3b15d56a211124553a/MCDataProducts/inc/StepPointMC.hh#L209. The `art::InputTag` is `""compressDigiMCs:virtualdetector""` . When I write a small job using `art v3_09_01` to read this data product and print out it's data members, all 4 of the `Hep3Vector` are `(0,0,0)`. When I run the same job using `art v3_06_03` all of the printout is correct. Remember that between `art v3_06_03` and `art v3_09_01` there was a schema change in `CLHEP::Hep3Vector`. You already fixed one bug related to that. I will prepare a stripped down example and add it to this issue. To reproduce. Unwind the following tar file on a machine that sees `/pnfs/mu2e and /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org`; ```; tar xzf /mu2e/app/users/kutschke/Bugs/Hep3Vector/artv3_09.tar.gz ; cd artv3_09; source /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/setupmu2e-art.sh; source setup.sh; scons -j 8; mu2e -c bug.fcl; ```; This prints most of the content of the the `StepPointMCs`. The bug is that the 4 `Hep3Vectors` are **all zero**. It's OK that the non-ionizing and visual energy depositions are zero; this data product captures steps in a virtual detector embedded inside a volume with a vacuum of `10^{-4} torr`. This uses the deprecated Mu2e ""Satellite release"" system to build on top of the Offline tag v10_00_00 on /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/Offline/v10_00_00/SLF7/prof/Offline .",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8428#issuecomment-875583779:1758,detect,detector,1758,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8428#issuecomment-875583779,1,['detect'],['detector']
Safety,"T'` it will fail. That's what I mean when I say that by relying on `PYTHONPATH` only one version will work. > we need to continue to support using multiple ROOT versions with python, also outside conda. That is always possible, but it requires setup scripts. I'm usually talking here about the situation in which you do `yum install root`, and it should work out of the box, without any extra setup. Same for other distributions. This is already the case in Fedora, but they have to go through hoops to make it work, like using alternatives for `libPyROOT.so` in `/etc/alternatives`. That's what I'd like to address. > we must not run setup.py as part of a ROOT installation. This makes it much harder to do the right thing during installation in order for things to work properly. PyROOT is a python package afterall, so what's the problem in using Python's native methods of installation as part of `make install`?. > It would be great if import ROOT can auto-detect which libPython (python2 or python3) to load; that would take care of the multi-python case after source thisroot.sh. At the moment, `libPyROOT.so` can only work with either Python 2.x or 3.x, not both. We need to change compile-time checks into runtime checks to make the same library work with both Python 2.x and 3.x (there are many `#ifdef`s on the Python version, for example). Finally, `thisroot.sh` is totally evil and should be deprecated. It messes up the environment when sourcing it, by potentially removing things from the path that should not be removed. It also assumes things about how ROOT was installed, so if ROOT's libraries are not in `$ROOTSYS/lib` (e.g., if they are in `$ROOTSYS/lib64`, or `$ROOTSYS/root/lib` with `gnuinstall=ON`) the script won't work. It also uses a colon for separator in `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, which is separated by semicolons, among other problems. My advice to people is to just stop using the script.

During the development of POSIX.1-2017, it was decided to change all buffer lengths to size_t, which appears at face value to make sense. When dual mode 32/64-bit systems came along, this choice unnecessarily complicated system interfaces because size_t (with long) was a different size under ILP32 and LP64 models. Reverting to int would have happened except that some implementations had already shipped 64-bit-only interfaces. The compromise was a type which could be defined to be any size by the implementation: socklen_t. I am not sure how to approach this, because the standardization of `socklen_t` seems fairly recent, but in the long run, avoiding this whole types dance altogether and simply using explicit `socklen_t` seems to make most sense and will make for a simpler code.

Safety,"Thank you. So if I understand correctly : ; for n_s times RooHistPdf, it behaves as for the case RooHistPdf for the method : getVal() ; -> OK : it gives a result ""normalized to 1"". But if we decide *not to normalize* the RooDataHist used to create the RooHistPdf,; the RooHistPdf -> getVal() will return a value normalized to the number of events of the RooDataHist : so in this case it gives a *non-normalized result*. This is strange since it is stated : ""The histogram distribution is explicitly normalized by RooHistPdf and can have an arbitrary number of real or discrete dimensions. "". Indeed, with my minimum example where you may put the option option_normalize_hist=0 (with the fix that you kindly found of <=55 bins); we get :; value_pdf total=39.9713; which represents : pdf->getVal()*bin_width. so in this case, we don't need to multiply by the number of events to obtain a prediction !!; The value of the pdf is not inside [0, 1]. So, depending whether the RooDataHist that was used in order to construct the RooHistPdf, was normalized or not normalized, the RooHistPdf->getVal() returns a normalized or a not normalised result,; in contradiction with the sentence that roofit is expected to do it : the sentence : ""The histogram distribution is explicitly normalized by RooHistPdf and can have an arbitrary number of real or discrete dimensions.

Safety,"Thanks to Axel digging into clang's code generation, we understood that what clang doesn't deal with very well is a large amount of variable instantiations of types with non-trivial destructors in the same function body. In this scenario the list of exception-handling ""landing pads"" grows to sizes that make compilation times blow up when generating code that deals with calling the destructors of these variables in case an exception is thrown in the function body. Presumably gcc suffers from a similar issue. * on our side, a workaround seems possible: we can avoid allocating many temporary `std::string`s and `std::vector<std::string>`s by generating code of the form `Jit{Filter,Define}Helper(..., const char*[]{""col1"", ""col2""}, ...)` rather than `Jit{Filter,Define}Helper(..., std::vector<std::string>{""col1"", ""col2""}, ...)`. I'm working on a patch so Stefan can try this out on the original usecase.; * now that the mechanism behind the long compile times is understood, Axel will work on a standalone reproducer to try to push for a fix in upstream clang (and possibly gcc if we see the patch reduces gcc compile times too)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7604#issuecomment-804843292:564,avoid,avoid,564,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7604#issuecomment-804843292,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"The issue needs to be looked at from the C++ and PyROOT perspective with a programming model in mind. But let me start from the technical answers, which are easier:; 1) The memory taken by the ""entry number custom column"" is one 64 bit integer per slot, so negligible; 2) Correct: Both slot and entry number are available at the TDF level, the difficulty is to percolate them in the actual function in the define/filter. Focussing only on C++, one could think about a ""TDF::EntryNumber"" type. We could detect it if used as first argument of the function passed and pass the entry. Such type will be transparently convertible to a 64-bits integer. As a side note, also the slot could be treated similarly. The issue will be in PyROOT, with filters and defines expressed as strings which are then jitted: these types make sense only if present in the signature of the function. If we go for the custom column solution, we know exactly what to do, we tested heavily all the components involved but we have to choose a name: ""__TDF_iEntry"", ""__Entry"", ""__iEntry"" .; Certainly starting with a ""__slot"" and ""__entry"" could be very attractive since it will provide ; a.

Safety,"The problem is that RDF tries to open the file to check that it's valid. The logic for the file opening is at https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/962009b8c2057199c2229c3ef9938ac4d315d10a/tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx#L1133 . In particular, because of the presence of the `?` token, the string is parsed as a glob. Now in many cases that would be harmless albeit a tiny overhead (it would just return the same file name to open), but in this particular case it triggers a faulty behaviour. The glob parsing attempts at traversing the remote xrootd directory (see [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/962009b8c2057199c2229c3ef9938ac4d315d10a/tree/tree/src/InternalTreeUtils.cxx#L471)), but since the permission is just for the single file with the token and not for the entire directory, it leads to the `user access restricted` error you post above. Now, I believe the most sane course of action would be to refine the logic that checks whether the input file name is a glob. I could simply add a check for the `xrd.wantprot` token, but probably we want to have a more authoritative list of all the tokens that should make the file name not be parsed as a glob. This probably includes not only xrootd tokens but also anything https-related. Or we could adopt a different strategy for glob detection altogether.

Safety,"To summarize the current intent of the PR and my understanding of the comments here. The PR targets at limiting cling to find modulemap files all over the place. We have advanced the infrastructure so that this is feasible. If we pick up all possible modulemaps on the include paths we have less control and rootcling goes in the opposite direction -- to be able to control much better the environment in which it works (in a previous PRs we have limited the set of flags it can take). As a side effect of this it will fix the module redefinition errors seen in the LCG builds and when ROOT is installed. IIUC the comments are reasonable and suggesting to move away from the ROOT static configuration for the essential directories such as the etcdir, libdir, incdir and so on. IMO, this not part of the PR even though it touches these functions. I support fixing these issues, however, if we want to fix them we will have to write quite a bit of utility functions which already exist in libLLVMSupport.

Safety,"Updates on the failing tests:; * Centos8/multicore: Failure because the same wrong mechanism of changing files happens in `FinalizeSlot` instead of `Finalize` in `SnapshotHelperMT`. Weirdly this didn't happen on my machine with 8 threads but it does on this node with 16 threads, still not sure what's the real difference there.; * MacOS: Both failures happen in the dataframe test, but in the **single threaded** Snapshot, that is in the `Finalize` method of the `SnapshotHelper` class. At first this PR wasn't even considering the single threaded case, that's also why `SnapshotHelper` wasn't modified. So there was this difference between the single threaded Snapshot that still used the weird ChangeFile behaviour (although it shouldn't have triggered a segfault anyway since it's using a plain TFile), and the multithreaded Snapshot that got its behaviour changed to avoid the issue. Considering both types of failures, and the fact that a coherent behaviour across the two Snapshot modes is desirable, I would refactor the usage of `TTree::SetMaxTreeSize` inside of RDF Snapshot in a single common point that both single-thread and multi-thread operations have to go through, if that exists.
