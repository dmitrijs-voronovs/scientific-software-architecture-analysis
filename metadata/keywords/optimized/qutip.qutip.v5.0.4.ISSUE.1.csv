Deployability,"Required due to changes in scipy 1.6.1. Using an explicit dtype will make matrix construction more robust. Fixes qutip Issue #1451. Tested on Debian unstable, with this patch tests/test_sparse.py now passes with scipy 1.6.1. **Description**. scipy 1.6.1 changed the API for constructing sparse matrices with `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` (affecting the COO format). This caused qutip TestDicke tests in test_piqs.py (test_lindbladian, test_lindbladian_dims, test_liouvillian) to fail. . This patch avoids the problem by setting the dtype explicitly to np,complex128. . **Related issues or PRs**. fixes #1451. **Changelog**; Provide explicit dtype=np.complex128 when constructing sparse matrixes with csr_matrix.

Deployability,"This has been going on for a while now - `test_diag_liou_mult` fails about ~5-10% of the time on Travis runs, with only 1 or 2 elements of the huge matrix differing by a small relative tolerance. I _think_ this started around the time that scipy 1.5 was released, which changed how `scipy.linalg.eigh` chose its underlying LAPACK driver, and broke a load of tests that relied on our custom `eigh` functions reproducing the `scipy` behaviour exactly (#1299). At the time we fixed those tests (#1298, #1301), but this intermittent failure of `test_diag_liou_mult` may have slipped through. Equally, at the same time on `dev.major` I think I was moving the `brtools` internals to use the new `CSR` types, which involved rewriting things like `diag_liou_mult`. I don't think this is the cause (though I may have done at the time), because we see the intermittent test failures still on `master`, which does not use the new types yet. I'm not absolutely certain the `eigh` changes are the cause, which is why I don't want to just bump up `atol`/`rtol` in the test without going through and calculating what the acceptable tolerance _should_ be.

Deployability,"This is causing test failures in all CI builds against scipy 1.5 currently. The other failing tests on scipy 1.5 are due to changes to the handling of `csr` matmul operations, which is fixed in patch #1298. As far as I can see, there is no way to recover the exact same behaviour as existed in scipy < 1.5 (there's optimisations of the `lwork` input to the LAPACK routine), and consequently we are not getting the exact same set of eigenvectors for problem dimensions > 32. This does not mean that `brtools` is suddenly doing something wrong. It just means that the test assumed we would have the exact same output as `scipy`, and we don't any more. . This is an annoying problem to fix, I think. Two possible methods:. 1. attempt to ""trick"" scipy into doing the same pre-1.5 behaviour. Possibly this would involve monkey-patching out the ability of `eigh` to optimise the `lwork` parameters (i.e. stubbing out `scipy.linalg.lapack._compute_lwork` to always return `lwork=18*nrows`, `lrwork=24*nrows` and `liwork=10*nrows` to match `qutip.cy.brtools.ZHEEVR`).; 2. do some linear algebra work to determine that the eigenvectors we have returned are equivalent to the ones scipy has returned. 2 is a better solution, but harder to implement, especially in the presence of degenerate or near-degenerate eigenvalues (of which there are likely a lot around 0). 1 is very unsatisfying, but might be enough. In general, this problem will hopefully be solved a bit more thoroughly when `brmesolve` is updated to use the new data layer types, and we standardise the calculation of eigenvalues and -vectors across QuTiP.

Deployability,"This moves our entire testing apparatus over to GitHub Actions, since Travis has changed its pricing model and we can no longer rely on it. This actually has several advantages for us right now:; - better integration with other GitHub Actions workflows; - more concurrent jobs; - more access to Windows and macOS machines; - easier job dependency graphs within our resources. This first commit does not add in any Windows tests because they're currently known to fail, but the intention is to turn them on. The blocking issue is currently a failure of the multiprocessing capabilities, which also affects mcsolve. We can now reasonably run coverage reporting on every test run, and upload all of them to Coveralls at the end, so we get accurate stats on what lines were actually tested. I've also turned pytest's timer, so it reports all tests that took longer than a second to run. This should really help identify where the real problems in our testing are - right now you should see that there's a `correlation` test that takes around 2 minutes to run, which is a very sizable chunk of the entire test suite. We can concentrate on rewriting the longest tests to make sure we're still testing all the behaviour, without excessively long runtimes. I've been fairly conservative with the number of tests I set in motion. On the free GitHub plan we can have 20 concurrent VMs running across the whole QuTiP organisation, which I think spreads across all repositories and all test runs. With no Windows tests currently active this is 6 test runs plus the documentation build. If we want more, we could consider spending some money ($4/user/month) to convert into a Teams account which gets us 60 concurrent VMs, but I don't see any need to do this right now. All the test runners now start up almost instantly, which really solves a lot of the slowdown we were getting on Travis. The actual speeds of the Linux VMs seem to be similar to what we had on Travis - the walltimes are slightly longer because ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1551:205,integrat,integration,205,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1551,1,['integrat'],['integration']
Deployability,"This patch obsoletes #1429, by applying the packaging changes to the current version of `master` rather than needing the new structure on `dev.major`. This patch should (mostly) apply cleanly to `dev.major` as well, so merging this up will be easy - the new automated systems in `setup.py` also mean that the distribution can handle both the current `master` and the `dev.major` package layouts with no changes. The rest of this text is very similar to the original message in #1429. ---. This patch overhauls how QuTiP is packaged and distributed. Once this patch is merged, there will be an option on QuTiP's GitHub Actions tab for people who have write permission on qutip/qutip to build all wheels and optionally release the build to PyPI, making it available on `pip` as a binary release. The major changes are in the files `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg` and `.github/workflows/build.yml`, while `MANIFEST.in` and a new file `VERSION` were also touched. ### Distribution changes:; - there is a GitHub Action which will build all the wheels for CPython 3.6+ on Linux (`manylinux1` x86 and x86_64), macOS and Windows (32- and 64-bit). This action is triggered manually, and the wheels will be available for download afterwards. Optionally, the action will push to PyPI, making the version immediately available on `pip` by binary release.; - `.cpp` files are now distributed with the wheels but not added to source control. This is a step towards a full Cython-free delivery of the QuTiP source (binary releases never require Cython), but right now I think our `setuptools` machinery doesn't quite handle that. ### Changes to `setup.py`; - all package metadata is moved out into `setup.cfg`, which is easier to read and change, and modern `setuptools`' preferred way of doing things; - all directory-tree access is done in a completely platform-agnostic manner, rather than just hoping that Unix-style paths will work on Windows; - the file is tidied and structured into a small script, ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1465:5,patch,patch,5,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1465,6,"['patch', 'release']","['patch', 'release']"

Deployability,"Two small bugs appeared in floquet steadystate in v5, this is a quick patch. **Description**; Two bugs:. 1) Small minus sign error in one of the terms (comparing to v4.7 and what is written in the old toolbox guide). 2) Some kind of data copying confusion with the S and T operators when updating their data contents with the results. Just initiating these two separately seems to fix it. other minor fix: updated the link to the toolbox guide. Some other minor niggles that I didn't fix:; - some of the optional solver methods dont work (seem not to support square right hand sides in '_data.solve()'. I didn't dig much on fixing these though. - the 'splu' method fails for a couple of reasons. I can get it to work by removing the choice of warnings as errors in 'solve.py' (which make it fail in other instances as well i suppose, like with normal steadystate()), making sure the solver option is not passed to steadystate(), and making sure that S and T are always converted back to CSR() after being updated in the iterative bit (in `steadystate_floquet()' they get returned as dense from _data.solve). I did not include those changes here though as the docstrings dont actually indicate support for splu anyway, so perhaps not needed. I am marking this as draft at the moment as I also want to update the test to be sensitive to these bugs (its a bit too coarse at the moment), and double check that the results from this solver are now correct. **Related issues or PRs**; fix #2386",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2393:70,patch,patch,70,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2393,4,"['patch', 'update']","['patch', 'update', 'updated']"

Deployability,"We have been talking about pulse level control in the `qip` device simulator for a while, but I just released that we didn't really define it in as separate ""pulse"". I find it really important and therefore I rewrite the data part of the `qip` numerical simulator as a new class `Pulse`. It's quite interesting that I end up to define a class very similar to `EvoElement` in `Qobjevo` (I called it `_EvoElement` for internal use, cannot find a better name). Instead of the full Hamiltonian, I only save the target qubits label and the non-trivial Hamiltonian (e.g. `sigmaz()` instead of `tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2)`). It is defined in this way for easy inspection after initialized, such as adding noise. `_EvoElement` consists of; - Hamlitonian; - Target qutbis label; - `tlist`; - `coeff`. `Pulse` consists of. - ideal part: `_Evoelement`; - coherent noise: list of `_Evoelement`; - lindblad noise: list of `_Evoelement`. The advantages are:; - A list of `Pulse `is easier to understand and manipulate compared to the old design: a list of H and a list of `coeff`. Now different `tlist `can also be defined for different pulses.; - Adding noise is much easier as we now can get the non-trivial part of the Hamiltonian and the targets of each pulse, instead of only a huge Hamiltonian in `QobjEvo`. One can now define noise for each Pulse.

Deployability,"While solving some time-dependent Hamiltonians, I decided to refactor the list-style definition of my Hamiltonian and completely get rid of all ```partial``` calls which made my code much cleaner. In particular, I implemented a small class to construct the time-dependent components that go into the Hamiltonian and overwrote the ```__call__``` method to make my class object directly callable by Qutip. However, this was rejected by Qutip as an ""Incorrect Hamiltonian specification"" due to the format check. Since, as far as I know, subclassing the built-in FunctionType ```function``` is not possible in Python, and subclasses of FunctionType would not be accepted by Qutip either (```_td_format_check``` calls ```isinstance``` and not ```issubclass```), I suggest that Qutip also accepts general objects which have the ```__call__``` attribute defined.

I am just comparing the behavior between two environments. The first one correctly diagonalizes the Pauli X operator with a Hadamard, and the second does not. The ""correct"" environment uses a standard numpy 1.26.2 install, with qutip installed with conda. The ""incorrect"" environment uses the `accelerate` numpy install, and qutip installed with pip. Each environment has the same `qutip.about()` return string. In reality, my use case is more complex than this, but I managed to boil down the error to faulty matrix diagonlization. I also want to add that I do indeed get a factor of ~4 speedup in pure numpy examples (like those linked in the SE post), so it's only when integrating with QuTiP that something goes awry. It might be the case that there really is some compatibility issue, and using `pip` doesn't really fix anything.

I would suggest making them both call their own `start` method to omit an additional call of start by the user right after initialization. This would also make both classes be in line with the usage suggested by the docstring of `BaseProgressBar.` Otherwise I would suggest to include the call to start in said docstring.

Deployability,"and `dW_factors` are properties of the classes, but not available to overwrite through the function interface. ; - The multiples end condition (`target_tol`, `timeout`) are added.; - The `solver` keyword is now `method` options, as it is in other solver.; - The method that was referring the homodyne or heterodyne detection is now the `heterodyne` keyword. ie before `method=""heterodyne""` now `heterodyne=True`.; - The default integration method is now `rouchon`, instead of `taylor1.5`. ie the method coming from a physic paper and not a mathematics textbook. . - The stochastic integration methods have been spitted in smaller chunk instead of the huge classes in _stochastic.pyx. I kept most methods, only skipping the taylor order 2.0 method. The python interface is kept very similar to the `Integrator` as `SIntegrator`, the main difference being that `set_state` and `get_state` use an extra random number generator with the time and state. The integration methods are usually 5%~10% slower than they where for medium size problems (shape ~100). Most method are computed the same way as before, but the rouchon method no longer use super operator, but keep the density matrix as a matrix and not an oper-ket. - The derivative computation for used by the integration method has also been split into multiple functions and made only available for `smesolve`. For there methods to be valid, the each diffusion contribution must commute. For `smesolve`, this means that each `sc_ops` must commute, as documented. For `ssesolve`, each `sc_ops` must not only commute, but also commute with other `sc_ops`'s adjoint, this last part being missing from v4's documentation. It also meant that the sc_ops needed to commute with it's own adjoint when using heterodyne detection... - `ssepdpsolve`, `smepdpsolve`, `photocurrent_mesolve`, `photocurrent_sesolve` removed. They are all less efficient variants of `mcsolve`. `mcsolve` already include the photocurrent in the output. - `general_stochastic`, rem",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2131:1283,integrat,integration,1283,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2131,1,['integrat'],['integration']

The syntax of output of command ; ```; sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string; ``` ; has been changed. The output for previous MacOS: ; ```; $ sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string; Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5257U CPU @ 2.70GHz\n; ```. The updated output; ```; $ sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string; VirtualApple @ 2.50GHz processor\n; ```. Therefore, the function [`_mac_hardware_info`](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/cb201690a2ca3a9c904bc642ef6600f2ef54f763/qutip/hardware_info.py#L48) of file `hardware_info.py` cannot parse the frequency of CPU correctly. The popped error information is attached below. ```; ValueError: could not convert string to float: ' 2.50GHz proces'; ```. This pull request fix this problem and compatible with both syntax of hardware information. . Since the unit tests of file or function are not found, I do not add test files for this change. I attach python code below to prove the correctness of the implementation. ```python; # before change; old_str = 'Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5257U CPU @ 2.70GHz\n'; new_str = 'VirtualApple @ 2.50GHz processor\n'; # parse old hardware message; int(float(old_str.split('@')[1].split(' ')[1].replace('GHz', ''))*1000); # parse new hardware message; int(float(new_str.split('@')[1].split(' ')[1].replace('GHz', ''))*1000); ```. **Related issues or PRs**; No related issue. **Changelog**; Fixed error parsing hardware information for MacOS Big Sur (Apple M1 chip)",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1401:337,update,updated,337,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1401,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"build all the wheels for CPython 3.6+ on Linux (`manylinux1` x86 and x86_64), macOS and Windows (32- and 64-bit). This action is triggered manually, and the wheels will be available for download afterwards. Optionally, the action will push to PyPI, making the version immediately available on `pip` by binary release.; - `.cpp` files are now distributed with the wheels but not added to source control. This is a step towards a full Cython-free delivery of the QuTiP source (binary releases never require Cython), but right now I think our `setuptools` machinery doesn't quite handle that. ### Changes to `setup.py`; - all package metadata is moved out into `setup.cfg`, which is easier to read and change, and modern `setuptools`' preferred way of doing things; - build requirements are moved into `pyproject.toml` including listing `setuptools` as the build method, in accordance with PEP 517. Any PEP 517-complaint installation and build process will now _enforce_ the presence of `numpy`, `scipy` and `cython` (and `setuptools`) before attempting the build, so no more need for attempted import guards.; - packages are now discovered rather than explicitly stated, using standard `setuptools` machinery; - Cython extension modules are now discovered rather than explicitly stated, using globbing; - version information is now stored in a single-line file `VERSION`. This is mostly for CI reasons; it's much easier to parse and override at the CI level when it's a single file, rather than attempting `sed s/.../.../ setup.py` or something crazy like that. The validity of the version string is tested by regex.; - local version information is now _always_ appended, even if `git` isn't present - the local version is just then ""nogit"" rather than the git shorthash; - `setup.py` gained a new `--release` flag or environment variable `CI_QUTIP_RELEASE`; the only effect right now is to suppress the local identifier on the version information, replacing the old `ISRELEASED` boolean flag in the cod",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429:1772,install,installation,1772,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429,1,['install'],['installation']

This makes it hard to plot e.g. the GKP position wavefunction which requires a lot of Fock states to converge. The bug starts to appear for Fock state n=43. Below I have only plotted n = 47 because that's the first time it becomes very noticeable. . The (crappy) code snippet I provided seems to fail around n = 151. . ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; import qutip as qt; from qutip.distributions import HarmonicOscillatorWaveFunction; from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermval; import math. def harmonic_oscillator_wavefunction(psi, xvecs, omega0=1.0):; n_coeff = []; for n in range(psi.shape[0]):; n_coeff.append(pow(omega0 / np.pi, 0.25) / \; np.sqrt(2.0 ** n * math.factorial(n)) ; * psi.data[n, 0]); return hermval(xvecs[0], n_coeff)* np.exp(-xvecs[0] ** 2 / 2.0). xmax = 12; steps = 3000; x = np.linspace(-xmax,xmax,num=steps). # choose a fock state; n = 47; state = qt.basis(n+1,n). wav_fn = HarmonicOscillatorWaveFunction(state, omega=1, extent=[-xmax,xmax], steps=steps); y_qutip = wav_fn.data; y_good = harmonic_oscillator_wavefunction(state,[x]). plt.plot(x,y_qutip,label=""qutip""); plt.plot(x,y_good,':',label=""homebrew fn""); plt.plot(x,y_qutip-y_good,label= ""qutip - homebrew""); plt.legend(); plt.title('Harmonic Oscillator Wave Function n = '+str(n)); plt.xlabel('position'); ```. ### Code Output. _No response_. ### Expected Behaviour. <img width=""627"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/qutip/qutip/assets/2394563/3b3fa3eb-c08c-46ed-abf9-972d59283344"">. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.7.2; Numpy Version: 1.25.1; Scipy Version: 1.11.1; Cython Version: None; Matplotlib Version: 3.7.2; Python Version: 3.11.4; Number of CPUs: 8; BLAS Info: OPENBLAS; OPENMP Installed: False; INTEL MKL Ext: False; Platform Info: Darwin (arm64); ```. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2286:1961,Install,Installed,1961,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2286,1,['Install'],['Installed']

Once this patch is merged, there will be an option on QuTiP's GitHub Actions tab for people who have write permission on qutip/qutip to build all wheels and optionally release the build to PyPI, making it available on `pip` as a binary release. The major changes are in the files `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg` and `.github/workflows/build.yml`, while `MANIFEST.in` and a new file `VERSION` were also touched. ### Distribution changes:; - there is a GitHub Action which will build all the wheels for CPython 3.6+ on Linux (`manylinux1` x86 and x86_64), macOS and Windows (32- and 64-bit). This action is triggered manually, and the wheels will be available for download afterwards. Optionally, the action will push to PyPI, making the version immediately available on `pip` by binary release.; - `.cpp` files are now distributed with the wheels but not added to source control. This is a step towards a full Cython-free delivery of the QuTiP source (binary releases never require Cython), but right now I think our `setuptools` machinery doesn't quite handle that. ### Changes to `setup.py`; - all package metadata is moved out into `setup.cfg`, which is easier to read and change, and modern `setuptools`' preferred way of doing things; - all directory-tree access is done in a completely platform-agnostic manner, rather than just hoping that Unix-style paths will work on Windows; - the file is tidied and structured into a small script, with separated components; - build requirements are moved into `pyproject.toml` including listing `setuptools` as the build method, in accordance with PEP 517. Any PEP 517-complaint installation and build process will now _enforce_ the presence of `numpy`, `scipy` and `cython` (and `setuptools`) before attempting the build, so no more need for attempted import guards.; - packages are now discovered rather than explicitly stated, using standard `setuptools` machinery; - Cython extension modules are now discovered rather than ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1465:1517,release,releases,1517,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1465,1,['release'],['releases']

Deployability,"dnorm tests have historically been very flaky, and for as long as we're using random tests (which we possibly shouldn't be), we always run the risk of temperamental failures. In particular, the semidefinite solvers used in dnorm fail every now and again on random states; we historically haven't treated this as a bug, since it's pretty similar to an integration failing to converge because the system was too stiff. It means that the user has to adjust some settings and try again. To prevent this sort of error from failing our test suite, however, we can mark the tests as being allowed to rerun twice on a failure. We had a relatively small sample to judge the test failure rate by, but my very very approximate guess is that we'd have a failure about 1 in 10 runs on Travis. We counter this with two strategies:. 1. parametrise the tests in pytest style, so each random repetition is a separate instance, and known to pytest (some of this was done in earlier commits); 2. allow 2 reruns of every dnorm test. The two of these together should remove all random failures; since all random loops have been moved into pytest-handled repeats, there are far fewer calls to dnorm handled within each test. This means less chance that an individual test run will fail, but a slightly higher chance the entire suite will. Now with the test re-running a single failure point is tried again up to twice more, to determine if it was just a one-off, or if the test is truly broken. The reruns are handled by a pytest plugin pytest-rerunfailures. It's quite nontrivial behaviour to hook this in to the pytest mechanism, so better to use an external dependency to do it than to vendor in a custom version. The dnorm problems have resurfaced a little after lying dormant for a long time, because #1463 reactivated them. Before that, they'd not actually been running because none of the test runners had cvxpy installed.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490:351,integrat,integration,351,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490,2,"['install', 'integrat']","['installed', 'integration']"

Deployability,"e object satisfy the numpy `__array__` interface and can be converted by calling `np.array(netket_operator)` or `np.asarray(netket_operator)`. We can also obtain sparse representations (but there is no nice api to do that, so we simply provide a method `netket_operator.to_sparse()`. Variational states can also be converted to vectors or matrices (kets and density operators) as they also support the `__array__` interface. I would like our users to be able to call `Qobj(netket_operator)` or `Qobj(netket_state)` and obtain the corresponding qutip object. We could, in principle support a `netket_operator.to_qobj()` conversion method, but I am strongly opposed to that as this is an ugly design pattern: a way to construct a `Qobj` already exists, it's `Qobj(...)`, and the simplest-to-use api is, in my opinion, to overload this constructor to perform the conversion.; This is a standard design pattern in Julia, which I believe has the best ecosystem inter-compatibility thanks to a standardisation of this pattern through (multiple)dispatch. Numpy too, does the same, through the `__array__` interface: any object that defines a `__array__(self, dtype=None)->np.ndarray` method will be supported by `np.asarray` and `np.array`. Proposal: I would like QuTiP to support a `__qobj__` interface, meaning that your `Qobj` constructor should check if an object has this method, and if it has, then use it to convert it to a Qobj.; It should be relatively simple and involve adding another else-if in [your constructor](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/624405e7c49f7c25d0623451cff5a5a5d0544559/qutip/qobj.py#L333). ```; if isinstance(inpt, Qobj):; ...; elif inpt is None:; ...; ...; elif hasattr(inpt, ""__qobj__""):; data = input.__qobj(options); self.shape = data.shape; ...; ```; The only thing to do would be discussing the interface itself and document what it should return. This will allow other software in the future to integrate with qutip, too, and I believe will help shape the ecosystem.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508:3013,integrat,integrate,3013,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

Deployability,"e](http://qutip.org/docs/4.1/guide/guide-bloch.html#animating-with-the-bloch-sphere) of how to do an animation of a Bloch sphere by saving the frames of the movie using a for loop like so:. ```python; b = Bloch(); b.vector_color = ['r']; b.view = [-40,30]; for i in range(len(sx)):; b.clear(); b.add_vectors([np.sin(theta),0,np.cos(theta)]); b.add_points([sx[:i+1],sy[:i+1],sz[:i+1]]); b.save(dirc='temp'); ```. With `b.clear()` we erase the points and vectors in the image, which is nice for updating the data, but What if I want to update also the attributes of the Bloch sphere?. To give an example let's say that I want the viewing angle of the Bloch sphere to smoothly change throughout the animation. I can define a function like so:. ```python; def bloch_camera_path(t, dt, azim_0, azim_f, elev_0, elev_f):; azim = ((azim_f-azim_0)/dt)*t+azim_0; elev = ((elev_f-elev_0)/dt)*t+elev_0; return [azim, elev]; ```. This function changes the viewing angle across time from the initial `[azim_0, elev_0]` configuration to the final `[azim_f, elev_f]` configuration in a linear manner. So I thought that by doing. ```python; b = Bloch(); b.vector_color = ['r']; for i in range(len(t)):; b.clear(); b.view = bloch_camera_path(t[i], t[-1]-t[0], -80, -70, 45, 40); b.add_vectors([np.sin(theta),0,np.cos(theta)]); b.add_points([sx[:i+1],sy[:i+1],sz[:i+1]]); b.save(dirc='temp'); ```; My animation would had that change in position of the ""camera"", but the result is just as if `b.view` wouldn't update. The only way I can make this work is by making a new bloch sphere on each iteration and defining all the attributes again and again (which I find highly inconvenient in terms of speed), like so;. ```python; import os. for i in range(len(t)):; b = Bloch(); b.vector_color = ['r']; b.view = bloch_camera_path(t[i], t[-1]-t[0], -80, -70, 45, 40); b.add_vectors([np.sin(theta),0,np.cos(theta)]); b.add_points([sx[:i+1],sy[:i+1],sz[:i+1]]); b.save(os.getcwd()+'/temp/bloch_'+str(i)+'.png', dirc='temp'); b.c",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1106:1052,configurat,configuration,1052,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1106,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"ean that the distribution can handle both the current `master` and the `dev.major` package layouts with no changes. The rest of this text is very similar to the original message in #1429. ---. This patch overhauls how QuTiP is packaged and distributed. Once this patch is merged, there will be an option on QuTiP's GitHub Actions tab for people who have write permission on qutip/qutip to build all wheels and optionally release the build to PyPI, making it available on `pip` as a binary release. The major changes are in the files `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg` and `.github/workflows/build.yml`, while `MANIFEST.in` and a new file `VERSION` were also touched. ### Distribution changes:; - there is a GitHub Action which will build all the wheels for CPython 3.6+ on Linux (`manylinux1` x86 and x86_64), macOS and Windows (32- and 64-bit). This action is triggered manually, and the wheels will be available for download afterwards. Optionally, the action will push to PyPI, making the version immediately available on `pip` by binary release.; - `.cpp` files are now distributed with the wheels but not added to source control. This is a step towards a full Cython-free delivery of the QuTiP source (binary releases never require Cython), but right now I think our `setuptools` machinery doesn't quite handle that. ### Changes to `setup.py`; - all package metadata is moved out into `setup.cfg`, which is easier to read and change, and modern `setuptools`' preferred way of doing things; - all directory-tree access is done in a completely platform-agnostic manner, rather than just hoping that Unix-style paths will work on Windows; - the file is tidied and structured into a small script, with separated components; - build requirements are moved into `pyproject.toml` including listing `setuptools` as the build method, in accordance with PEP 517. Any PEP 517-complaint installation and build process will now _enforce_ the presence of `numpy`, `scipy` and `cython` (and `setuptools`)",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1465:1344,release,release,1344,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1465,1,['release'],['release']

Here I made things as hard as possible for the sparse routine (all elements non-zero), so this is probably the limit of the speed-up. ![1_local_vector_adaptive_backend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47875526/101932409-91f44900-3b8f-11eb-8b5b-7a00dabec2e4.png). **Other notes**; 1. I am a contractor for NASA, and they required a slight change to the license for the code I added. This is why I made two new files for this work specifically (instead of putting it in e.g. gates.py), which now includes a Copyright NASA sentence. I will talk privately with someone about this. 2. ~~I actually think that we could make a wrapper function `local_multiply` which can additionally take a backend 'sparse', so that it is easier to compare the above code, to one using the default sparse way (e.g. using the `expand_operator` type functions). I didn't do this yet as thought i'd see what thoughts are on this -- I can easily add this.~~ **Update (20/12/20)**: I just added some basic functionality for this. Will need to add more tests and maybe re-work it a bit still. 3. Currently the input local operator is expected to be square, and we do not take output dimension arguments. This means it keeps the system dimensions the same. This can be relaxed easily, but we probably need an additional output dimension list, which needs to be consistent with the input operator. Again, this is easy to do, but was not sure if it is needed. If I get time I might add this anyway. 4. There are some examples of the code in the docstring to see how to run it (and also in the tests of course). I also have offline a script to perform certain speed comparisons (vs the sparse routine), I can share some more results of that. I figured this type of script shouldn't go into the project, but I can also add this. **Changelog**; Added a local multiplication routine, to speed up certain dense matrix operations.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405:2592,Update,Update,2592,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405,1,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"en setting an options. It is only used for `use_cython` which will error when trying to set it to `True` without cython installed. Otherwise, it will fail when trying to use the options. *Solver's options*; Each solver has it's option class (SeOptions, MeOptions, etc.) with only needed keys.This somewhat feel overkill since they are all the some for now, until mcsolve is merged. Each integrator also has an associated options and the solver options contain an integrator options. Conversion between options type will raise an error. When creating a solver options, it read the `method` key and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `bdf`. There is also a generic `Options` class that accept any keys used by integrator or solver and can be converted to any specific solver options:; ```; Options(futur_cupy_ode_specific_options=True) # Will work; Options(not_an_options=True) # Error; # For most solver:; __solve(..., opt=Options()); ```; Once options are associated to a solver, they are frozen:; ```; opt = SeOptions(); solver = SeSolver(..., opt); opt['...'] = ... # Ok, but solver has a copy and is unaffected.; solver.options['...'] = ... # Error; solver.options = opt; ```; This is because changing options without the solver knowing will not take effect.

I assume python has some buffer after the array; H = qtip.Qobj(np.identity(dim),dims=[[dim],[dim]]); rho0 = np.random.random([dim**2]); rho0 = qtip.Qobj(rho0.flatten(),dims=[[dim],[dim]]) # This fails; # rho0 = qtip.Qobj(rho0.reshape([dim,dim]),dims=[[dim],[dim]]) # This works; qtip.mesolve(rho0=rho0,H=H,tlist=np.linspace(0,10,1),progress_bar=qtip.ui.EnhancedTextProgressBar()); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; [ 0% ] Elapsed 0.00s / Remaining 00:00:00:00[1] 3281154 segmentation fault (core dumped); ```. ### Expected Behaviour. The code should exit without failure or throw a python error elaborating on the issue. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.6.2; Numpy Version: 1.21.4; Scipy Version: 1.6.0; Cython Version: 0.29.21; Matplotlib Version: 3.4.3; Python Version: 3.9.7; Number of CPUs: 4; BLAS Info: OPENBLAS; OPENMP Installed: False; INTEL MKL Ext: False; Platform Info: Linux (x86_64); Installation path: /home/lala5th/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/qutip; ```. ### Additional Context. I ran the code through `gdb` to somewhat narrow down the cause of the issue. It seems that `dense2D_to_fastcsr_fmode` causes the segmentation fault, but the parameters passed to it seem fine at first glance, since I expect `ncols = 10000`.

The reason the tests are a little bit slow compared to, e.g., the tests in `TestMESolveTDDecay` is the computation of the fidelity of the states at all the different times. If you think the tests are too slow, i can change them, and for example only check the fidelity of the final state. As a side note: As I wrote this new functionality, I also ran some simple tests comparing a pure python implementation of the right hand side for `_mesolve_const` to the cython implementation (I did this because I was considering how much cython code I had to write, or if a pure python implementation of the new functionality would suffice). I actually found that a pure python implementation was as fast (or maybe slightly _faster_) than the cython implementation. The pure python implementation of the right hand side is simply (see lines 767-769 of mesolve.py). ``` python; def _ode_rho_test(t, rho, data):; # for performance comparison of cython code; return data*(np.transpose(rho)); ```. Here is a plot of the performance compare to the standard cython implementation for a very simple test. The benchmark was a damped-cavity JC-model with Hilbert space dimension 4 for the cavity, integrated up to ""integration time"". ""run time"" is the real run time on my laptop. ![benchmark](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2354542/11615553/48fe8604-9c32-11e5-83b9-2de366bd3cef.png). Since there is no big difference between the cython implementation and the pure python implementation (if anything, the pure python implementation is slightly faster), maybe it makes sense to replace the call to `cy_ode_rhs` with a call to `_ode_rhs_test` (see lines 744 to 747 in mesolve.py)? This makes the code a tiny bit easier to read. Of course, this was a single, very simplistic test. Sorry about all the merge commits. I'm still learning good workflow for this type of feature branch. Will use rebasing more in the future.

Deployability,"et yesterday (#2500), which was kindly addressed, recommending that I uninstall cvxpy to remove conflict. I did that and was able to import qutip.; I then ran the duplicate script, but got a different result from 3 years ago. If you compare the output at block 23, you'll see it deviates significantly from the corresponding block in the old script. I have changed nothing in hte duplicated script, other than uninstalling cvxpy to make it run.; I then reinstalled cvxpy with upgrade and then qutip again. This time I can still import qutip, but with a warning. I ran the script with no problem, but still got the same deviated behavior from 3 years ago. [codes.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16367713/codes.zip). The 3-year-old script is included only to show the previous results. It is not meant to be run. I suspect if you run it with your likely different setup, you might get the same deviation as I did, or even yet another different deviation. I cannot recall the state of installation I had from 3 years ago. I believe I did it through conda. I just realized that I cannot include qutip scripts with this report. I included a zipped folder containing these two files. Please let me know if it didn'tgo through. Thank you! . ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; Old code in ""Ikonen First Shot New Unitary Trans States 2 level Full H Gated Test 2 - Copy.ipynb""; New code in ""Test.ipynb""; Both attached.; These two codes are exactly identical.

Deployability,"for plotting**; In [the code](http://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/modules/qutip/bloch.html) for the add_points function it is written that. ```; meth : str {'s', 'm', 'l'}; Type of points to plot, use 'm' for multicolored, 'l' for points; connected with a line.; ```. First of all, it is not true that `meth = 'l'` gives points connected by lines (which in pyplot would be done with the `linestyle='-'` and `marker='o'` parameters) but it gives lines without the point markers (`linestyle='-'` and `marker='None'` in pyplot). But this is not important since it is just a comment on a function. The thing that matters is that it would be great if we had a `b.linestyle` and `b.marker` methods for the Bloch sphere instead of a `meth` parameter which can only show either points or lines without them, just like/similar to the [line styles](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/linestyles.html) and [marker styles](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/markers_api.html) of pyplot. Or any other idea that could allow the user to create more complicated graphs on the Bloch sphere. _______________________________________________________________. **3) Adding edge color parameter for plotted points**; The `b.point_color` method changes the color of the points but it doen't change the edge color of those marker points. This is important since right now one can only choose between two restrictive options; either we plot the points with large sizes ([like in this image](https://i.imgur.com/pGhU55e.png)) so the chosen color can be seen, or we have to see the dots as black points if we chose a smaller size for them ([like in thsi image](https://i.imgur.com/5Ql5sKM.png)). What I mean is that if I want to plot small points in red I just can't do it, since the black edge will dominate. Just like in pyplot, it would be good to have an option to toggle the edge or choose the edge color. Or if that is too complicated, maybe you could make the marker edge color the same as `b.point_color`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1105:3125,toggle,toggle,3125,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1105,1,['toggle'],['toggle']

Deployability,"g Description. It seems that the measurement in `dev.major` does not truncate the probabilities correctly. It is probably caused by some changes in the last month and leads to [a test failing in `qutip-qip`](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-qip/actions/runs/3610116105/jobs/6083718885). The last test running was 24 days ago and was successful. I don't see any code in the measurement that manually tidies up the state. In `qutip-4.7` it is also directly compared to `0`.; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/5a47ee3b8dd817d4c6c36cc84a952c41305cdcb5/qutip/measurement.py#L101-L108. So my guess is that, in `dev.major`, the final states fail to be automatically truncated. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```python; from qutip.measurement import measurement_statistics; import qutip; measurement_ops = [qutip.basis(2,0), qutip.basis(2,1)]; state = qutip.Qobj([[1-1.e-12], [1.e-12]]); print(measurement_statistics(state, measurement_ops)); ```. ### Code Output; dev.major; --------; ```shell.

While it's working fine as is, there are few point to discuss:; - Freezing options associated to solver work fine, but I see 2 alternatives:; - Options know they are used by a solver and inform it when modified. More complex but give the image that it just work. ; - All options instance are read-only. To change a key, you create a new options. Simple for us. To modify an existing options we could make it callable: `updated_options = old_options(atol=1e-5)`.; - Passing bad options keys or wrong options types (`mesolve(..., SeOptions)`) raise error, should we be less strict?; - Should we flatten SolverOptions.ode: ; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; And associated to it, where do we store default for integrators, per solver or per integrator.; - Do we add more sanity check to options values, or do we move `use_cython` to setting and remove the feature?. **Related PR**; It will cause conflict with #1710 and #1644. **Changelog**; Options classes using inheritance.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812:4023,integrat,integrators,4023,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812,2,['integrat'],"['integrator', 'integrators']"
Deployability,"ges in `matplotlib` the current implementation is deprecated and will return errors in a few minor releases. We could quickly fix this by passing `shading='auto'` to the call of `ax.pcolor()` in the [visualization.py](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/82c6704c6fea8a2801492865ad1ef7c1d73c8840/qutip/visualization.py#L1313). However, this raises another UserWarning that the center points are not monotonically sorted. The cleanest way to fix this bug would be to pass the edges of the quadrilaterals to `pcolor()`. But we can not calculate them exactly from the given points in `theta, phi`. Hence, we would need to redesign the interface to this function and to related functions like `plot_spin_distribution_3d` and `spin_q_function`. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import qutip as qt; import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. j = 5; psi = qt.spin_coherent(j, np.random.rand() * np.pi, np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi); rho = qt.ket2dm(psi). theta = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 50); phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 50). Q, THETA, PHI = qt.spin_q_function(psi, theta, phi); fig, ax = qt.plot_spin_distribution_2d(Q, THETA, PHI); plt.show(); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: shading='flat' when X and Y have the same dimensions as C is deprecated since 3.3. Either specify the corners of the quadrilaterals with X and Y, or pass shading='auto', 'nearest' or 'gouraud', or set rcParams['pcolor.shading'].

Deployability,"he initial floquet modes, computing the propagator over one period, then using these to compute at other time, recomputing the propagator up to that time. When the modes at multiple times were needed, we could compute a list of them over one period using `floquet_modes_table`, but at least 2 computations over a period were needed. With the and the `Propagator` memoize capacities added in v5, only one computation of the propagator is required. Also with the table computation of v4, if a mode was not included in the table, the closest one was used. `fmesolve ` and `fsesolve` computed 100 slices over the period. It did not used the values in `tlist` and caused artifacts in the result. With `FloquetBasis`, the mode are always computed at the exact time. . I left the v4's functions with warnings. The construction of the floquet tensor was done using 2 functions: `floquet_master_equation_rates` which returned 4 tensors and `floquet_master_equation_tensor`. I added `floquet_tensor` which computed the tensor in one call and split `floquet_master_equation_rates` in 4 functions, one for each of the outputs. Floquet, like `brmesolve`, need a function for the noise power spectrum. Unlike `brmesolve`, string are not supported, only functions. We should have them match, but supporting string is quite heavy since coefficient are not a great fit. `fsesolve` have been rewritten without the class interface. As an integrator, the floquet method has no advantage since the propagator much be computed using another method. `fmesolve` work similarly to other solver. The `e_ops` are always in the laboratory basis. The result states are also in the laboratory basis. The option `""store_floquet_states""` is used to store the states in the floquet basis in `result.floquet_states`. In v4, there it an option for the environment temperature, but no tests for it. I kept the feature, but it's still untested.; Also all tests for `fmesolve` are either for constant systems or without collapse operator.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2034:1734,integrat,integrator,1734,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2034,1,['integrat'],['integrator']

Also, in the future we may apply again to [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). . ## Future Opportunities; Several senior researchers and team leaders have aired the desire to contribute to the project more actively. Setting up a space where they can propose projects, even on their own funding resources (most probably together with the development of research projects), in coordination with the lead development team, could help foster development in a more sustainable way. . ## Proposal; I propose to help sustain available projects in a more structural way than what is done now. This is an example of a what we could call a **QEP, or ""QuTiP Enhancement Proposal"".**. - One thing that could be done is to simply expand the existing Wiki. The downside of taking only this action is that only organization members can modify the wiki. So this could work, but mainly as a more static and cleaner staple. . - I propose to integrate the Wiki with Issues that contain the projects, adding a `projects` (or similar) label. This is in the spirit also of other large quantum open source projects such as Qiskit, which has even an ad-hoc `qiskit-community` repository, https://github.com/qiskit-community/. In QuTiP case, we could create a new repository similar to the notebooks one, e.g., https://github.com/qutip/qutip-community/. The downside is that in general the division is subfolders is not advised for easiness of maintainability. So one could just open issues with open projects. Of course, for physics questions, sometimes spilling in to PRs and Issues, qutip already has a Google Group forum, where I advise that this new capabilities may be advertised with a proper thread.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1132:2660,integrat,integrate,2660,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1132,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

A difficulty in the implementation is that the weights depend on the total number of trajectories in different ways. For example, the no-jump trajectory has a fixed weight that never changes, but all other trajectories come with prefactors $(1-p_0) / (N-1)$ where $p_0$ is the probability of the no-jump trajectory, and $N$ the total number of trajectories (including the one no-jump trajectory). For this reason, I separate weights into *absolute weights* (like $p_0$) and *relative weights* (like the others). The average is performed as follows:. $$ \bar\rho = \sum_{T: \text{abs}} w_a(T) w_r(T) \rho(T) + \frac{1}{N_{\text{rel}}} \sum _{T: \text{rel}} w_r(T) \rho(T) $$. where the first sum is over all trajectories T that have absolute weights, and the second sum over all other trajectories. Here, $w_a(T)$ and $w_r(T)$ are the absolute and relative weights, $\rho(T)$ the state associated with a trajectory, and $N_{\text{rel}}$ the number of trajectories that have not been assigned absolute weights. Intuitively, the idea is that absolute weights are for trajectories where the contribution to the full state is known exactly, and the trajectories without absolute weights are the stochastic part. **Things to do**; - [x] Update tests and create new ones; - [x] Update photocurrent to work with weights; - [x] Update target tolerance calculation to work with weights; - [x] Think about how result objects should be added if both contain trajectories with absolute weights; - [x] Double-check that this creates no problems for stochastic solvers; - [x] Towncrier entry. **Related issues or PRs**; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2235",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2369:2418,Update,Update,2418,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2369,3,['Update'],['Update']

I added the capacity to add a safety check when setting an options. It is only used for `use_cython` which will error when trying to set it to `True` without cython installed. Otherwise, it will fail when trying to use the options. *Solver's options*; Each solver has it's option class (SeOptions, MeOptions, etc.) with only needed keys.This somewhat feel overkill since they are all the some for now, until mcsolve is merged. Each integrator also has an associated options and the solver options contain an integrator options. Conversion between options type will raise an error. When creating a solver options, it read the `method` key and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `bdf`. There is also a generic `Options` class that accept any keys used by integrator or solver and can be converted to any specific solver options:; ```; Options(futur_cupy_ode_specific_options=True) # Will work; Options(not_an_options=True) # Error; # For most solver:; __solve(..., opt=Options()); ```; Once options are associated to a solver, they are frozen:; ```; opt = SeOptions(); solver = SeSolver(..., opt); opt['...'] = ... # Ok, but solver has a copy and is unaffected.; solver.options['...'] = ..",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812:1806,integrat,integrator,1806,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812,1,['integrat'],['integrator']

Deployability,"jor`), there will be an option on QuTiP's GitHub Actions tab for people who have write permission on qutip/qutip to build all wheels and optionally release the build to PyPI, making it available on `pip` as a binary release. The major changes are in the files `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg` and `.github/workflows/build.yml`, while `MANIFEST.in` and a new file `VERSION` were also touched. The patch also contains two commits that remove unused OpenMP code and remove a particularly problematic C struct from some inner Python code; the struct and the presence of the dead code caused portability problems, and they in no way change the behaviour of the package. ### Distribution changes:; - there is a GitHub Action which will build all the wheels for CPython 3.6+ on Linux (`manylinux1` x86 and x86_64), macOS and Windows (32- and 64-bit). This action is triggered manually, and the wheels will be available for download afterwards. Optionally, the action will push to PyPI, making the version immediately available on `pip` by binary release.; - `.cpp` files are now distributed with the wheels but not added to source control. This is a step towards a full Cython-free delivery of the QuTiP source (binary releases never require Cython), but right now I think our `setuptools` machinery doesn't quite handle that. ### Changes to `setup.py`; - all package metadata is moved out into `setup.cfg`, which is easier to read and change, and modern `setuptools`' preferred way of doing things; - build requirements are moved into `pyproject.toml` including listing `setuptools` as the build method, in accordance with PEP 517. Any PEP 517-complaint installation and build process will now _enforce_ the presence of `numpy`, `scipy` and `cython` (and `setuptools`) before attempting the build, so no more need for attempted import guards.; - packages are now discovered rather than explicitly stated, using standard `setuptools` machinery; - Cython extension modules are now discovered rather t",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429:1163,release,release,1163,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429,1,['release'],['release']

However, QuTiP currently does not warn if `filelock` is missing, and the dependency does not seem to be documented anywhere. Instead, QuTiP silently defaults to a `StrFunctionCoefficient`, i.e., to using `eval`. This behavior comes from here:. https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/7892453dd3ae03ce8ac17caffc0457df200a69ec/qutip/core/coefficient.py#L256-L264. The default value of `use_cython` is therefore set to `False` if `filelock` is missing. The result is the following:. ```python; $ git clone git@github.com:qutip/qutip.git .; $ conda create -n qutip-tmp python cython numpy scipy setuptools packaging wheel pytest ipython matplotlib; $ conda activate qutip-tmp; $ python setup.py install; $ cd ~; $ ipython; 	import qutip; 	coeff = qutip.coefficient(""sin(t)""); 	type(coeff); 	> qutip.core.cy.coefficient.StrFunctionCoefficient; 	exit(); ```. Since cython is installed and there was no warning or error, I think it would be reasonable for the user to assume that the coefficient would be compiled, but it is not. Only when `use_cython` is explicitly enabled, we get an error:. ```shell; In [5]: coeff = qutip.coefficient(""sin(t)"", compile_opt=qutip.CompilationOptions(use_cython=True)); ---------------------------------------------------------------------------; NameError Traceback (most recent call last); Cell In[5], line 1; ----> 1 coeff = qutip.coefficient(""sin(t)"", compile_opt=qutip.CompilationOptions(use_cython=True)).

It uses the local numpy configuration (`np.__config`), testing the availability of various attributes in the numpy config, in the form of ; ```; if hasattr(config,'mkl_info') ...; elif hasattr(config,'openblas_info'); ```. MKL was not used to build debian's numpy package, and I don't have it installed. So mkl_info is not detected. OpenBLAS was not used to to build numpy either, but it is installed, so I want look closer at the logic. config (i.e. `np.__config__`) does indeed have an openblas_info. But it is empty (`{}`). Nevertheless `hasattr(config,'openblas_info')`returns True, since the empty dict is there. As far as MKL goes, mkl_info is indeed not there, so qutip does not detect MKL BLAS. But there is a `blas_mkl_info` attribute, and `hasattr(config,'blas_mkl_info')` returns True, same as with openblas_info. numpy provides a summary of its configuration in `np.show_config()`:; ```; numpy.show_config(); blas_armpl_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; blas_mkl_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; blis_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; openblas_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; accelerate_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_3_10_blas_threads_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_3_10_blas_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_blas_threads_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_blas_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; blas_info:; libraries = ['blas', 'blas']; library_dirs = ['/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu']; include_dirs = ['/usr/local/include', '/usr/include']; language = c; define_macros = [('HAVE_CBLAS', None)]; blas_opt_info:; define_macros = [('NO_ATLAS_INFO', 1), ('HAVE_CBLAS', None)]; libraries = ['blas', 'blas']; library_dirs = ['/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu']; include_dirs = ['/usr/local/include', '/usr/include']; language = c; lapack_armpl_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; lapack_mkl_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; openblas_lapack_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; openblas_clapack_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; flame_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_3_10_threads_info:",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2053:1685,configurat,configuration,1685,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2053,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Pass the keyword argument auto_add_to_figure=False and use fig.add_axes(ax) to suppress this warning.

The warnings themselves suggest fixes, however some care needs to be taken; I suspect that the additional keyword `auto_add_to_figure` might be new in matplotlib 3.4 (not sure about the `.M` attribute). We want to keep compatibility with at least `matplotlib>=3` (we don't want to picky so it's easy to use QuTiP with other packages), so it might be necessary to include a version test using `packaging.version.parse`.

Deployability,"me detail information for the GSoC 2020 project ""Error mitigation in QuTiP"". Unfortunately, I don't have writing access to the QuTiP GitHub Wiki page. I post it here so if anyone finding it nice could copy it to the Wiki page. I add some details based on the original description:. -----------------------------------; ## 1. Error mitigation in QuTiP; From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. . This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate. This part is gonna involve some physics and study of commonly used hardware platforms.

Deployability,"method` options, as it is in other solver.; - The method that was referring the homodyne or heterodyne detection is now the `heterodyne` keyword. ie before `method=""heterodyne""` now `heterodyne=True`.; - The default integration method is now `rouchon`, instead of `taylor1.5`. ie the method coming from a physic paper and not a mathematics textbook. . - The stochastic integration methods have been spitted in smaller chunk instead of the huge classes in _stochastic.pyx. I kept most methods, only skipping the taylor order 2.0 method. The python interface is kept very similar to the `Integrator` as `SIntegrator`, the main difference being that `set_state` and `get_state` use an extra random number generator with the time and state. The integration methods are usually 5%~10% slower than they where for medium size problems (shape ~100). Most method are computed the same way as before, but the rouchon method no longer use super operator, but keep the density matrix as a matrix and not an oper-ket. - The derivative computation for used by the integration method has also been split into multiple functions and made only available for `smesolve`. For there methods to be valid, the each diffusion contribution must commute. For `smesolve`, this means that each `sc_ops` must commute, as documented. For `ssesolve`, each `sc_ops` must not only commute, but also commute with other `sc_ops`'s adjoint, this last part being missing from v4's documentation. It also meant that the sc_ops needed to commute with it's own adjoint when using heterodyne detection... - `ssepdpsolve`, `smepdpsolve`, `photocurrent_mesolve`, `photocurrent_sesolve` removed. They are all less efficient variants of `mcsolve`. `mcsolve` already include the photocurrent in the output. - `general_stochastic`, removed. It is a mostly generic stochastic equation solver.

Deployability,"n. qutip keeps configuration (e.g. for openmp) in a config file handled in configrc.py. The default location is in the home dir, with; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/d2f1ed57d13bd35055d72f3f6b3418c962491bd9/qutip/configrc.py#L36; setting the dir to `~/.qutip` and; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/d2f1ed57d13bd35055d72f3f6b3418c962491bd9/qutip/configrc.py#L38; setting the config file to `~/.qutip/qutiprc`. This forces Linux distributions to do more work when building in a chroot. For instance Debian build chroots set the ""home"" directory to `/nonexistent`, and then building docs fails with; ```; PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/nonexistent'; ```; since it can't create `/nonexistent/.qutip`. In practice that's not a great problem since when building docs for the package, we can set `HOME=$BUILDDIR` to place the config location in the build dir (which is writable) instead of `/nonexistent`. However there is a standardized location for config files which might be worth considering instead. The freedesktop.org specification at https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html identifies locations for config and data files. Config files can be located under (one of) `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` for system configuration, or under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` for user configuration. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. _No response_. ### Code Output. _No response_. ### Expected Behaviour. In python XDG is accessible from the xdg package (in debian, the python3-xdg package). So the XDG equivalent of ; ```; qutip_conf_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser(""~""), '.qutip'); ```; could be done with; ```; from xdg import XDG_CONFIG_HOME; ...; qutip_conf_dir = os.path.join(XDG_CONFIG_HOME, '.qutip'); ```; A more sophisticated method could be set up to also check XDG_CONFIG_DIRS instead (XDG_CONFIG_HOME is the first entry in the list defined in XDG_CONFIG_DIRS). ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.7.0; ```. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1876:1278,configurat,configuration,1278,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1876,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"o see if the list of observables is valid ; - `Measurement.measurement_comp_basis(self, state)` : This adds measurement statistics for specific qubit measurements in the computational basis and also returns the collapsed states (without changing the dimensions). ; - `QubitCircuit.run(self, state, cbits)`: Given a ket input to the circuit, applies gates and measurements from the circuit and returns the resultant ket. . Right now, the measurement module is very bare-bones and splintered between the previous code ; from @hodgestar and the new code added by me. The eigenstate based measurements are slightly different than the measurements usually used on circuits (or I might be missing something). Ofc, in the case of measurements on all qubits, they amount to the same result. I have not added tests yet but I have added a basic quantum teleportation notebook. It will be nice to get feedback on testing methods as well as what kind of notebooks the community is interested in. Also, any other feature requests on this module would also be appreciated. . PS: I have also added measurement code from Simon's PR here so maybe we can either add him as a contributor to this PR or figure out something else. ; ; Update: . 1. Addressing some concerns about the PR containing multiple diverging pieces of code, I think classical registers, measurement on the circuit and the classically-controlled gates are best grouped together as they all rely on each other in some ways. The valid concern is that of the Measurement class encapsulating all projective style measurements. I also want to point out that it was raised by @BoxiLi that we may want to move the Gate class and Measurement class completely to qutip.qip.operations to which I agree but I believe that should be addressed in a clean-up PR with naming changes suggested by @ajgpitch. . **Related issues or PRs**; Adds to #1090. **Changelog**; Adds partial and complete measurements to state vectors/density matrices and a basic run function",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1274:2626,Update,Update,2626,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1274,1,['Update'],['Update']

Over the years, the QuTiP project has enabled a large ecosystem of supported libraries, such as `Krotov` (cc @goerz and others), `pyEPR` (cc @zlatko-minev), `scqubits` (cc @jkochNU), and many others. . With this governance model, we'd like to keep doing what we're doing, with the support, since 2018, of @NumFOCUS, which supports scientific open source projects, and, from now on, the additional support of @unitaryfund, a non-profit that supports open-source projects in quantum technologies. . Below we reproduce a governance document that we will add to a new repository at [github.com/qutip/governance](https://github.com/qutip/governance). We are looking forward to help the growth of the user community, engage it with code contributions and bug reports, and make this awesome scientific open-source project even more sustainable. We will update all related information at [github.com/qutip/governance](https://github.com/qutip/governance), on QuTiP website's news section (http://qutip.org/news.html) and on the QuTiP google group (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/qutip). . Below it is reported how we got there and the text we're adding to the governance. Before making any more official announcements, we thought it nice to ping the community watching this repository. . **Timeline regarding governance talks**:; * April 2018: QuTiP Joins NumFOCUS as an Affiliated Project (and since then participates in Google Summer of Code).; * September 2018: a slide presentation is shared among lead developers with ideas on QuTiP development and governance. ([Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lBfS7v4WxduvWy-rf1Vd-hSEeNOK4at91ALuaH58AnQ/edit?usp=sharing)); * February 2019: The first QuTiP developers workshop is held in RIKEN, Wako, Japan, to discuss development and roadmap ([Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lBfS7v4WxduvWy-rf",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1373:1921,update,update,1921,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1373,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"ps://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.quantum_info.average_gate_fidelity.html relating the average gate fidelity to the process fidelity, and https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.quantum_info.process_fidelity.html#qiskit.quantum_info.process_fidelity to compute that from a superoperator. I think it would be better to use that direct formula if the input is not already in Kraus form!. There is also a function `process_fidelity` in Qutip, but I'm having a hard time understanding what it's intended for. It doesn't seem to be the process fidelity explained in the Qiskit docs above. The arguments of Qutip's `process_fidelity` are called `U1` and `U2` suggesting they are expected to be unitary, but this is not checked. It is computed as `(U1 * U2).tr()`, which is not between 0 and 1, and doesn't give 1 as I'd expect if `U1==U2`. Does someone know the intended use of that function? If not, I'd implement the process fidelity as described in the Qiskit docs here, with several version depending on whether the input is Kraus, a superoperator, and maybe a chi matrix. Lastly, there is an issue with the tests - the lines; ```; class Test_dnorm:; # Skip dnorm tests if we don't have cvxpy or cvxopt available, since it; # depends on them.; cvxpy = pytest.importorskip(""cvxpy""); cvxopt = pytest.importorskip(""cvxopt""); ```; actually skip all the tests in the file if cvxpy is not available, not just the ones in the `Test_dnorm` class. The test output, if `cvxpy` is not installed, is; ```; $ pytest qutip/tests/test_metrics.py ; ============================= test session starts ==============================; platform linux -- Python 3.9.7, pytest-6.2.4, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1; rootdir: /home/florian/code/qutip/qutip/qutip/tests, configfile: pytest.ini; plugins: rerunfailures-10.1; collected 0 items / 1 skipped ; ```; That issue seems to be addressed on the dev.major branch.

Deployability,"ptions that `Qobj` with a shape of `(1,1)` with be a `Dimensions(Field, Field)` and not a `Field`. . Some previously valid and used list format are no longer accepted. Playing with of tensor of super operators, `permute` and `reshuffle`, you could make object with dims as `[[[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]], [[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]]` which can be interpreted as the tensor of 3 super operators. But then `[[[2, 2], [3, 3]], [[2, 2],[3, 3]]]` can both be interpreted as tensor of super operator or super operator of tensor spaces, so : ; - `[[[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]], [[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]]`: Error; - `[[[2, 2], [4, 4]], [[2, 2], [4, 4]]]`: list representation of dimensions of `to_super(tensor(oper, oper))`; - `[[[2], [2], [3], [3]], [[2], [2], [3], [3]]]`: list representation of dimensions of `tensor(to_super(oper), to_super(oper))`. Dimensions object have a `type` and `shape` set a initialization. There is a check when creating/ modifying a `Qobj` with between the data's shape and dims's shape and an error is raise when they are not matching. . Since operator-ket have a `superrep`, I added the `superrep` parameter to the Superspace instead of the dimensions, for now. But a better look at super operator representation is needed. At the present state, `Qobj.dims` take and return a list, keeping the dimension object internally. From there, minimal adjustment were made so test pass. The eigenstate fix in #1820 is already merged since it would create `Qobj` which dims and shape did not match. ToDo:. - [x] Tensor using dimension directly instead of list.; - [x] QobjEvo.dims use dimension object.; - [x] state and operator accept dimension.; - [ ] Super operator representation.; - [ ] Ptrace, partial_transpose and permute use dimension object (supported with enr states).; - [ ] Flags / new types for rectangular operator?; - [ ] List dimension manipulation function in dimension.py should support the class/ be integrated in it / removed. **Related issues or PRs**; #1476. **Changelog**",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1826:2799,integrat,integrated,2799,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1826,1,['integrat'],['integrated']

Deployability,"qutip.testing.run() returns ""Ran 0 tests in 0.000s \ OK"" after installing QuTip 2.2.0 with f90 solver on OSX 10.8. This was reproducible on two macs. Before installing with fortran solver the QuTip installation and testing function normally. After installation with fortran solver the testing returns the above message. The installation seems to be fine though: mcsolve_f90 ran successfully in my simulation, and QuTip examples appear to work normally. To get fortran to compile I installed Xcode developer tools, and gfortran for OSX Mountain Lion from HPC following instructions from http://web.mit.edu/mfloyd/www/computing/mac/gfortran/",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/46:63,install,installing,63,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/46,6,['install'],"['installation', 'installed', 'installing']"

With `b.clear()` we erase the points and vectors in the image, which is nice for updating the data, but What if I want to update also the attributes of the Bloch sphere?. To give an example let's say that I want the viewing angle of the Bloch sphere to smoothly change throughout the animation. I can define a function like so:. ```python; def bloch_camera_path(t, dt, azim_0, azim_f, elev_0, elev_f):; azim = ((azim_f-azim_0)/dt)*t+azim_0; elev = ((elev_f-elev_0)/dt)*t+elev_0; return [azim, elev]; ```. This function changes the viewing angle across time from the initial `[azim_0, elev_0]` configuration to the final `[azim_f, elev_f]` configuration in a linear manner. So I thought that by doing. ```python; b = Bloch(); b.vector_color = ['r']; for i in range(len(t)):; b.clear(); b.view = bloch_camera_path(t[i], t[-1]-t[0], -80, -70, 45, 40); b.add_vectors([np.sin(theta),0,np.cos(theta)]); b.add_points([sx[:i+1],sy[:i+1],sz[:i+1]]); b.save(dirc='temp'); ```; My animation would had that change in position of the ""camera"", but the result is just as if `b.view` wouldn't update. The only way I can make this work is by making a new bloch sphere on each iteration and defining all the attributes again and again (which I find highly inconvenient in terms of speed), like so;. ```python; import os. for i in range(len(t)):; b = Bloch(); b.vector_color = ['r']; b.view = bloch_camera_path(t[i], t[-1]-t[0], -80, -70, 45, 40); b.add_vectors([np.sin(theta),0,np.cos(theta)]); b.add_points([sx[:i+1],sy[:i+1],sz[:i+1]]); b.save(os.getcwd()+'/temp/bloch_'+str(i)+'.png', dirc='temp'); b.clear(); ```. Could Qutip be modified so that attributes (such as viewing angle or the color of vectors) can be updated in the way I showed before? So that we don't have to create a new bloch sphere on each iteration of the animation?",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1106:1537,update,update,1537,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1106,2,['update'],"['update', 'updated']"

Deployability,"reaking changes to QuTiP:; - `Qobj.data` is no longer an instance of `scipy.sparse.spmatrix`, but the new abstract ""data-layer type"" `core.data.Data`; - `bra * ket` now returns a scalar, not a `Qobj` (no need to do `(bra * ket).data[0, 0]` or `(bra * ket).tr()`) any more; - 1D subspaces in `Qobj.dims` are now never contracted silently (they were, but inconsistently before), but the new function `Qobj.contract()` can be called to do this explicitly; - `Qobj` no longer defines `__array__`, and so cannot be treated as if it is a numpy array. Having this led to inconsistent behaviour when `Qobj` was used in arithmetic with numpy arrays from the left and right, and allowed simple code to become `Qobj.dims`-unsafe _implicitly_. To get the full array view now, you must be explicit and call `Qobj.full()` - it is not enough to do `np.array(qobj)`, and this behaviour is consistent with `scipy.sparse` matrices.; - `eseries` and `essolve` are removed; - OpenMP is temporarily removed (but should be added back in before the release); - most functions marked deprecated as of version 4.5.2 are removed (e.g. in `qutip.correlation`); - `vec2mat` and `mat2vec` are renamed away from the terse MATLAB-compatible syntax to the more QuTiP-consistent `vector_to_operator` and `operator_to_vector`. Non-breaking changes:; - the internal file layout of the code is more organised, with physical ""packages"" `qutip.core` and `qutip.solve` containing the core code and the solvers respectively, but these packages export all their names to the full `qutip` namespace, so there are no user-facing changes; - `Qobj` is a bit more strict about enforcing `Qobj.type`-safety with input types to arithmetic operations, particularly with 1D subspaces; - `Qobj` understands the `@` operator to mean matrix multiplication (it still understands `Qobj * Qobj` to be matrix multiplication as well); - `Qobj` instantiation is massively faster (lower-bounded by ~5µs compared to the previous ~70µs) in internal use and when ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1278:2884,release,release,2884,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1278,1,['release'],['release']

I added the capacity to add a safety check when setting an options. It is only used for `use_cython` which will error when trying to set it to `True` without cython installed. Otherwise, it will fail when trying to use the options. *Solver's options*; Each solver has it's option class (SeOptions, MeOptions, etc.) with only needed keys.This somewhat feel overkill since they are all the some for now, until mcsolve is merged. Each integrator also has an associated options and the solver options contain an integrator options. Conversion between options type will raise an error. When creating a solver options, it read the `method` key and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `bdf`. There is also a generic `Options` class that accept any keys used by integrator or solver and can be converted to any specific solver options:; ```; Options(futur_cupy_ode_specific_options=True) # Will work; Options(not_an_options=True) # Error; # For most solver:; __solve(..., opt=Options()); ```; Once options are associated to a solver, they are frozen:; ```; opt = SeOptions(); solver = SeSolver(..., opt); opt['...'] = ... # Ok, but solver has a copy and is unaffected.; solver.options['...'] = ... # Error; solver.options = opt; ```; This is because changing options without the solver knowing will not take effect.

Deployability,"s to suppress the local identifier on the version information, replacing the old `ISRELEASED` boolean flag in the code. ### Notes on the wheels. Currently I build only for CPython. I haven't tried to build pypy wheels, but we _may_ support it - Cython does in theory, but I think complex numbers and raw pointers aren't handled completely smoothly, and we make heavy use of both. We get `manylinux1` builds for Linux, which is the oldest `manylinux` spec. This can be updated in the future, but I'm not sure I see a need; all our heavy mathematical lifting is either done by custom code (which is mostly immune) or BLAS/LAPACK (which we link to dynamically), so I don't think there's much to be gained. I don't know if the macOS images will run on the new M1 chips, but if not, there's not much that can be done there until GitHub Actions adds the necessary cross-compilation headers and libraries to their CI. ### Examples. You can see the result of this upload on the testing PyPI server: https://test.pypi.org/project/qutip-jakelishman (version 5.0.0a1 failed to upload due to previous testing, and 5.0.0a2 has a broken OpenMP configuration so won't run). I ran the CI action from my fork, with a temporary commit that changed the server to the testing archive (and the package name). Here's a screenshot of what the deployment screen will look like:. <img width=""1440"" alt=""GitHub Actions screen when triggering the build and deploy action"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5968590/106396051-8e49a980-63fd-11eb-867d-48a5ff2527f9.png"">. ### Further action needed. The GitHub Action won't become available until this is merged, _and_ `dev.major` is merged into `master`. This is because GitHub only makes workflows on the default branch available. ~We also need to generate a PyPI secret token with write access to the `qutip` package, and add it to the qutip/qutip repository secrets with the name `PYPI_TOKEN` (as defined in `.github/workflows/build.yml`).~ *edit: Done 2021-02-15.*",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429:3868,configurat,configuration,3868,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429,3,"['configurat', 'deploy']","['configuration', 'deploy', 'deployment']"

Deployability,"specific to some methods. SInce new integrators could be added by project such as qutip-cupy, `Options` can no longer be the place to list all supported options. It become little more that a dict. So I propose deprecating it. The documentation of `sesolve`, `mesolve`, etc. now list the options used by the solver and most common ode options and link the the integrator documentation. The class interface has the options property which document the options used by the solver and the integrators have the same. In the online documentation, the integrator api entries only contain the description of the method and the supported options. Since users don't need to call them directly, other methods are hidden and will be included in the dev documentation only. Usage will look like this, for functions:; ```; sesolve(H, psi, tlist, options={""store_states"": True, ""method"": ""lsoda"", ""atol"": 1e-5}); ```; and for the class interface:; ```; solver = SeSolver(H, options={""store_states"": True, ""method"": ""lsoda"", ""atol"": 1e-5}); solver.run(...); solver.options[""atol""] = 1e-9; solver.run(...) # run with the new tol.; solver.options = {""atol"": 1e-2} # only change the affected items. ; solver.run(...) # Also run with the new tol.; solver.options[""method""] = ""adams"" # reset all ode options, including ""atol"" supported by both.; solver.options = {""method"": ""bdf"", ""atol"": 1e-2} # reset all ode options then apply the new atol ; ```. Inside solvers, options are stored in a `_SolverOptions` which is a dict with frozen keys and feedback (chaging atol will reset the integrator).; ; Some `Intergrator` are slip so one method correspond to one integrator. Otherwise, `method` was an options used by both the solver to know which integrator to use and by some integrators. `Options` and `SolverOptions` still both exist for backward compatibility: they raise a warning but return the dict of the same options so the change should not immediately break any code. **Related issues or PRs**; Alternative to #1947",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1955:1834,integrat,integrator,1834,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1955,4,['integrat'],"['integrator', 'integrators']"

Deployability,"stance on my system (debian unstable), `python3 -c ""import qutip; qutip.about()""` reports; ```; BLAS Info: OPENBLAS; ```. However, I think the logic behind BLAS Info is not robust. For context, debian builds packages against generic libblas.so (libblas-dev package). The various optimised BLAS implementations are supposed to be binary compatible, such that the system administrator can install the preferred implementation for use at runtime (the identity of libblas.so is controlled using debian's alternatives mechanism). On my system, OpenBLAS is indeed installed. But taking a closer look, I'm not sure it was detected for the right reason.; The blas configuration is identified by the `_blas_info()` function in qutip/utilities.py. It uses the local numpy configuration (`np.__config`), testing the availability of various attributes in the numpy config, in the form of ; ```; if hasattr(config,'mkl_info') ...; elif hasattr(config,'openblas_info'); ```. MKL was not used to build debian's numpy package, and I don't have it installed. So mkl_info is not detected. OpenBLAS was not used to to build numpy either, but it is installed, so I want look closer at the logic. config (i.e. `np.__config__`) does indeed have an openblas_info. But it is empty (`{}`). Nevertheless `hasattr(config,'openblas_info')`returns True, since the empty dict is there. As far as MKL goes, mkl_info is indeed not there, so qutip does not detect MKL BLAS. But there is a `blas_mkl_info` attribute, and `hasattr(config,'blas_mkl_info')` returns True, same as with openblas_info. numpy provides a summary of its configuration in `np.show_config()`:; ```; numpy.show_config(); blas_armpl_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; blas_mkl_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; blis_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; openblas_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; accelerate_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_3_10_blas_threads_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_3_10_blas_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_blas_threads_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; atlas_blas_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; blas_info:; libraries = ['bla",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2053:1121,install,installed,1121,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2053,1,['install'],['installed']

Deployability,"t there's a `correlation` test that takes around 2 minutes to run, which is a very sizable chunk of the entire test suite. We can concentrate on rewriting the longest tests to make sure we're still testing all the behaviour, without excessively long runtimes. I've been fairly conservative with the number of tests I set in motion. On the free GitHub plan we can have 20 concurrent VMs running across the whole QuTiP organisation, which I think spreads across all repositories and all test runs. With no Windows tests currently active this is 6 test runs plus the documentation build. If we want more, we could consider spending some money ($4/user/month) to convert into a Teams account which gets us 60 concurrent VMs, but I don't see any need to do this right now. All the test runners now start up almost instantly, which really solves a lot of the slowdown we were getting on Travis. The actual speeds of the Linux VMs seem to be similar to what we had on Travis - the walltimes are slightly longer because I now install _all_ optional dependencies in most runners, so slightly more gets tested than before. Currently there's also a slowdown on several machines because `cvxpy` doesn't build many wheels, and none at all for Linux, on `pip`. I install all our dependencies except BLAS/LAPACK stuff that way, since it's easiest to read out the dependencies like that. We can potentially save some build time (maybe ~3 minutes?) if we install that from conda-forge instead. I also fixed a minor point of how environment variables are read within `setup.py` (in the end I didn't actually use the new behaviour in the action, but I did during testing), and added a warning filter on dnorm tests to account for a deprecated Numpy alias being used within `cvxpy` code. Also of note: this [should allow us to have commits that skip the testing stages](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-08-github-actions-skip-pull-request-and-push-workflows-with-skip-ci/) (though possibly not codeclimate).

Deployability,"t's a single file, rather than attempting `sed s/.../.../ setup.py` or something crazy like that. The validity of the version string is tested by regex.; - local version information is now _always_ appended, even if `git` isn't present - the local version is just then ""nogit"" rather than the git shorthash; - `setup.py` gained a new `--release` flag or environment variable `CI_QUTIP_RELEASE`; the only effect right now is to suppress the local identifier on the version information, replacing the old `ISRELEASED` boolean flag in the code. ### Notes on the wheels. Currently I build only for CPython. I haven't tried to build pypy wheels, but we _may_ support it - Cython does in theory, but I think complex numbers and raw pointers aren't handled completely smoothly, and we make heavy use of both. We get `manylinux1` builds for Linux, which is the oldest `manylinux` spec. This can be updated in the future, but I'm not sure I see a need; all our heavy mathematical lifting is either done by custom code (which is mostly immune) or BLAS/LAPACK (which we link to dynamically), so I don't think there's much to be gained. I don't know if the macOS images will run on the new M1 chips, but if not, there's not much that can be done there until GitHub Actions adds the necessary cross-compilation headers and libraries to their CI. ### Examples. You can see the result of this upload on the testing PyPI server: https://test.pypi.org/project/qutip-jakelishman (version 5.0.0a1 failed to upload due to previous testing, and 5.0.0a2 has a broken OpenMP configuration so won't run). I ran the CI action from my fork, with a temporary commit that changed the server to the testing archive (and the package name). Here's a screenshot of what the deployment screen will look like:. <img width=""1440"" alt=""GitHub Actions screen when triggering the build and deploy action"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5968590/106396051-8e49a980-63fd-11eb-867d-48a5ff2527f9.png"">. ### Further action needed",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429:3206,update,updated,3206,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"tion purposes. The integral type used as the indices in the `CSR` type is now done by simple typedef in the files `qutip/core/data/base.{pyx,pxd}`, so changes it in those two files at compile-time will allow you to switch between 32-bit and 64-bit. The C++ backing source file `zspmv.cpp` and its associated header are renamed to `matmul_csr_vector` to match the new data-layer naming conventions, but more importantly, the functions are now templated over integral types so they will ""magically"" work at either size. In general, `setuptools` likes to link dynamically (on Linux and Mac, but not Windows), and so the templates have to be made explicit, rather than allowing Cython to generate only the necessary one. _Note:_ I'll make a PR to push deprecation warnings onto `eseries`, `essolve` and all other removals or renames that don't already have one in `master`, ready for when we drop QuTiP 4.6.0. -----------. _Original top comment:_. Not a complete switch-over to `CSR` from `fast_csr_matrix`, but this goes a really long way to achieving that. `Qobj` is done completely, but `QobjEvo` is pretty difficult to disentangle, and that really slowed me down a lot, and I'm not at all sure I've got it right there yet. OpenMP is ignored for now as low-priority. We'll need to get it working before a QuTiP 5.0 release, but I'm not working on it at the moment. `CQobjEvo` has been absolutely stripped bare. All its variants are gone, since the data layer types will handle this instead. `QobjEvo` is basically managed by shim at the moment, and needs a huge tidy up to bring it up to speed with the new data layer, and keep it maintainable. The data layer types have been taught to pickle themselves safely and automatically, and so consequently `QobjEvo` is magically pickle-able (aside from the OpenMP types). This PR includes all the commits from #1296 as well, but it's still a pretty giant PR as it stands right now.

The exceptions is the location of the .qutip folder which is a setting but can be changed. The base for the options is a dict with fixed keys and default values. As before, options can be set as keywork at initialization or when setting items. The default can be changed using context (mainly for tests) or setting items at the class:. ```; SolverOptions['method`] = 'bdf' # Set default method ; with SolverOptions(atol=1e-5):; opt = SolverOptions(store_state=True); opt['progress_bar'] = False; print(opt). progress_bar : False; store_state : True; method : 'bdf'; atol : 1e-5; ...; ```; The option can also be initialized from a dict or another options instance, it will make a copy. I added the capacity to add a safety check when setting an options. It is only used for `use_cython` which will error when trying to set it to `True` without cython installed. Otherwise, it will fail when trying to use the options. *Solver's options*; Each solver has it's option class (SeOptions, MeOptions, etc.) with only needed keys.This somewhat feel overkill since they are all the some for now, until mcsolve is merged. Each integrator also has an associated options and the solver options contain an integrator options. Conversion between options type will raise an error. When creating a solver options, it read the `method` key and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `b",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812:1312,install,installed,1312,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812,1,['install'],['installed']

This is part 1/3, but contain some change in core that would come later in the Solver PR:. - Add manual cython dispatched function. Used by vern ODE method. - Add `to` to `QobjEvoFunc` and some check. Used by brmesolve rework. - Add a version to string Coefficient, a 'try_parsing' options, partial arguments update and basic cleaning function.; This comes mostly from talk with @jakelishman.; When updating coefficient with new argument, it no longer require all coefficient to be given, but will simply update those available. ; Since those change must overwrite old version of the coefficient, a version tag is added to the coefficient folder and a function to erase the old version. It use it's own `COEFF_VERSION`, not qutip version since I don't expect most qutip update will not touch `coefficient.pyx` so we need not to force user to recompile. But it raise the risk of forgetting to change it when working on them. ; Lastly, I added an option to disable the string coefficient parsing since there seems to have some reservation in the last meeting.; But there is a weakness when using that form if unused args are passed: the `key = args['key']` code could be generated for those extra `args` but will not affect the hash name. . **Related issues or PRs**; Will replace part of #1409.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1461:1670,update,update,1670,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1461,2,['update'],['update']

It now does the snapshot: compute the expectation values, save the state, compute trajectories average, etc. . `Evolver` is qutip's ODE solver interface: the states are `Data` object and the function is `QovjEvo`(or `QobjEvoFunc`). There are multiple type of evolver wrapping different scipy's ode solver and a few of our own. The wrapper around scipy's zvode that was previously used in qutip's is `EvolverScipyZvode`, but we now have our own cython solver based on [Verner's method](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/) that accept any Data type as state. Different evolver based on different ODE method are interchangeable and have their dispatcher `evolver_collection`, allowing to easily add new methods. . With this, time-dependent system are managed by `QobjEvo`, ODE by `Evolver`, therefore the solvers can concentrate more closely on the physic. **Evolver:**; Method supported with this PR: `adams`, `bdf`, `dop853`, `lsoda`, `vern7`, `vern9`, `diag`. The 4 first are from `scipy.integrate.ode`, the 3 last are ours. `vern7` and `vern9` are runge-kutta methods of 7th and 9th order using [verner's most efficient coefficient](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/) with dense output. `diag` diagonalize a constant system and solve the ODE in that basis.; The minimum that must be given for a new evolver are the `prepare`, `set_state`, `get_state` and `step` methods. `evolver_collection` work as a dispatcher over evolvers. Solvers obtain their evolver instance using `evolver_collection[method, rhs]` with both `method` and `rhs` taken from the options. `evolver_collection` keep a list of description, used options and capacities for each member. It can list the available method matching desired condition.

Deployability,"ture using options. . The best signature I believe is `f(t, **args)` since it allows to use more natural function call using kwargs (`f(t, w=0, a=1)`). However, it is the slowest in the #1123 implementation (up to 10x): some items are added to `args` for internal use and they need to be filtered at each call. It could be brought to 2.5x with some work, but no better. `f(t)` is about 2x slower than `f(t, args)`. But it's less agile: if the Hamiltonian use `f(t, w1=0)`, we cannot add a c_ops using `f(t, w2=0)`, both function must accept `w1` and `w2`. `args` could just hide unused items. Which ever we choose as the main one will be 2~3x faster than the other. We can have automatic detection of the signature if we want to be fancy. Which signature do you think is better?. Second, these function can depend on the state with the option `rhs_with_state`. Thus the coefficients are `f(t, state, args)` with `state` a 1D numpy array.; When making QobjEvo, I added special `args`' keys that indicate that the value should be updated with the state: setting `args = {""val=Qobj"":psi0, ""val"":psi0}` would tell `args[""val""]` to be updated with the state at each use in the solver. The state can be obtained as Qobj, np.array or the args could be updated to be the expectation value of another Qobj.; There are some bug for it in master presently but it will work with PR #1127. Using these special keys for this work well but they need to be removed for the new signature candidate (`f(t, **args)`). Also you cannot remove / fix to a constant them once declared. Since they are not used/working yet, now is the time to change to something better. I could see 2 other options:; - reserved keys: `args = {""state_vec"":psi0}`, this will always be the state (np.array) if available.; -- collapse are less practical this way.; - special values: `args = {""state_vec"":qt.feedback(""vec"")}`. This seems the most natural to me since the value is what change. . I would appreciate feedback and ideas on the issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1136:1610,update,updated,1610,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1136,3,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"ule to dynamically determine the number of available processors and limited the number of worker processes to avoid overwhelming the host system. This approach helps in balancing load and performance. 2. **Error Handling and Robustness**:; - Enhanced the resilience of the parallel computation by encapsulating the worker function’s body in a try-except block, ensuring that failures in one computation do not impact the overall execution.; - Ensured the stability of the test environment by restoring the original function state after the test execution, preventing side effects on subsequent tests. 3. **Testing**:; - **Extended Test Coverage**: Developed new test cases to validate both the parallel and sequential execution paths of the function. Tests ensure that both modes produce equivalent results, thereby confirming that the parallelization did not introduce computational errors.; - **Integration with Existing Tests**: Integrated the new tests into the existing pytest framework used for QuTiP, making use of fixtures and parameterization to test different scenarios and system setups effectively. ### Implementation Details. - **Concurrency**: The parallel execution is managed through a pool of processes, where each process is responsible for a subset of the total computations. This method is particularly effective for operations that can be divided into independent, smaller tasks.; - **Compatibility**: Ensured that the enhancements are backward-compatible with existing code by modifying only the internal execution strategy of the `correlation_2op_1t` function and by maintaining the original API signature.; - **Performance Considerations**: The parallel implementation can significantly reduce computation times, particularly for larger systems or longer `taulist` arrays, by leveraging multiple CPU cores concurrently. ### Conclusion. The enhancements to the `correlation_2op_1t` function in QuTiP are designed to harness the capabilities of modern multi-core processors, ther",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2395:1974,Integrat,Integration,1974,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2395,2,['Integrat'],"['Integrated', 'Integration']"

I added the capacity to add a safety check when setting an options. It is only used for `use_cython` which will error when trying to set it to `True` without cython installed. Otherwise, it will fail when trying to use the options. *Solver's options*; Each solver has it's option class (SeOptions, MeOptions, etc.) with only needed keys.This somewhat feel overkill since they are all the some for now, until mcsolve is merged. Each integrator also has an associated options and the solver options contain an integrator options. Conversion between options type will raise an error. When creating a solver options, it read the `method` key and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `bdf`. There is also a generic `Options` class that accept any keys used by integrator or solver and can be converted to any specific solver options:; ```; Options(futur_cupy_ode_specific_options=True) # Will work; Options(not_an_options=True) # Error; # For most solver:; __solve(..., opt=Options()); ```; Once options are associated to a solver, they are frozen:; ```; opt = SeOptions(); solver = SeSolver(..., opt); opt['...'] = ... # Ok, but solver has a copy and is unaffected.; solver.options['...'] = ... # Error; solver.options = opt; ```; This is because changing options without the solver ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812:1867,integrat,integrator,1867,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812,1,['integrat'],['integrator']

Deployability,"will push to PyPI, making the version immediately available on `pip` by binary release.; - `.cpp` files are now distributed with the wheels but not added to source control. This is a step towards a full Cython-free delivery of the QuTiP source (binary releases never require Cython), but right now I think our `setuptools` machinery doesn't quite handle that. ### Changes to `setup.py`; - all package metadata is moved out into `setup.cfg`, which is easier to read and change, and modern `setuptools`' preferred way of doing things; - all directory-tree access is done in a completely platform-agnostic manner, rather than just hoping that Unix-style paths will work on Windows; - the file is tidied and structured into a small script, with separated components; - build requirements are moved into `pyproject.toml` including listing `setuptools` as the build method, in accordance with PEP 517. Any PEP 517-complaint installation and build process will now _enforce_ the presence of `numpy`, `scipy` and `cython` (and `setuptools`) before attempting the build, so no more need for attempted import guards.; - packages are now discovered rather than explicitly stated, using standard `setuptools` machinery; - Cython extension modules are now discovered rather than explicitly stated, using globbing; - version information is now stored in a single-line file `VERSION`. This is mostly for CI reasons; it's much easier to parse and override at the CI level when it's a single file, rather than attempting `sed s/.../.../ setup.py` or something crazy like that. The validity of the version string is tested by regex.; - local version information is now _always_ appended, even if `git` isn't present - the local version is just then ""nogit"" rather than the git shorthash; - `setup.py` gained a new `--release` flag or environment variable `CI_QUTIP_RELEASE`; the only effect right now is to suppress the local identifier on the version information, replacing the old `ISRELEASED` boolean flag in the cod",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1465:2183,install,installation,2183,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1465,1,['install'],['installation']

To implement the above system, I used the following code (fully time-dependent, no rotating-wave approximation):; ```python; from numpy import pi, cos, sqrt, linspace; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; from qutip import (; sigmax, sigmaz, fock_dm, mesolve, ; basis, Qobj). omega0 = 100*2*pi # TLS atom level spacing; omega1 = omega0 # 1st tone, resonant with the TLS; omega2 = omega0 -1*2*pi # 2nd tone, detuned from TLS; omegaR1 = 1*2*pi # Rabi freq of 1st tone; omegaR2 = 1*2*pi # Rabi freq of 2nd tone; gamma21 = 1 # spontaneous emission rate. H0 = -sigmaz()/2*omega0; H1, H2 = sigmax()*omegaR1, sigmax()*omegaR2; t = linspace(0,10,501); def H1_coeff(t, args):; return cos(omega1*t); def H2_coeff(t, args):; return cos(omega2*t). H = [H0, [H1, H1_coeff], [H2, H2_coeff]]; c_ops = [Qobj([[0,1],[0,0]])*sqrt(gamma21)]; e_ops = [fock_dm(2,0), fock_dm(2,1)]; psi0 = basis(2,0); result = mesolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, e_ops). plt.plot(t, result.expect[1]); plt.ylim(0,1); ```; One can directly run the above code to produce a perpetual oscillation, which seems unphysical to me. If one suppresses either tone (e.g. by setting `omegaR1` or `omegaR2` to zero), or set the 2nd tone's detuning to zero (i.e. `omega2 = omega0`), one gets the expected damping behavior at large times.; ![Untitled](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/assets/29622362/26578e8e-6665-4852-92a6-d9fe0e888fdb).

Energy Efficiency," calculate the difference between two unitary channels, a very efficient implementation exists. This makes use of an unproved theorem on page 29 of [1]. I have proved this theorem and elaborated an efficient algorithm to calculate the diamond distance between two unitaries as part of my masters thesis. . The current qutip implementation makes use of the semi-definite program formulation in [3] and only uses a simplified calculation on 2 qubit unitary differences. The implementation of this novel approach is very simple - the hardest step involves diagonalising a unitary. Although time complexity is still exponential in the number of qubits, this implementation is far more efficient than the more general implementation. The Choi representation of the quantum channel isn't used and there is no need to solve a complicated semi-definite program (meaning I can do away with the `cvxpy` dependency). ## Empirical testing; Results of empirical testing on my machine are reported below. | | 3 qubit | 4 qubit |; |---------|---------|----------|; | current implementation | 5.22 s | 3min 21s |; | hyper-efficient implementation | 924 µs | 1.11 ms |. ## Proposition; Given the popularity of the circuit model and unitary-based quantum computation, I believe a very efficient implementation of the diamond distance for unitaries would be incredibly valuable for the research community. Given how simple the change is (current tests already cover the test case), I think it would be a simple and worthwhile addition to qutip. ## Citations. [1] D. Aharonov, A. Kitaev, and N.

Without pybuild-plugin-pyproject installed, the Debian build was invoking; ```; /usr/bin/python3.10 setup.py build --with-openmp; ```; using setup.py and specifying `--with-openmp`. A successful build log for this method can be found at https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=qutip&arch=amd64&ver=4.6.2-3&stamp=1641397514&raw=0. With pybuild-plugin-pyproject installed, the Debian build invokes a wheel build (command line given below). But `--with-openmp` causes the build to fail. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; python3.10 -m build --skip-dependency-check --no-isolation --wheel --outdir /build/qutip/.pybuild/cpython3_3.10_qutip --with-openmp; ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; usage: python -m build [-h] [--version] [--sdist] [--wheel] [--outdir OUTDIR] [--skip-dependency-check] [--no-isolation] [--config-setting CONFIG_SETTING] [srcdir]; python -m build: error: unrecognized arguments: --with-openmp; ```. ### Expected Behaviour.

PEP517 support is new for Debian. It is possible the pybuild build tool needs to be adapted to handle setup.py options like `--with-openmp` in the context of PEP517. But I've tried to pose the issue here in terms of the underlying python3 build commands without needing to consider pybuild as such.

Energy Efficiency," minimal number of CNOT gates) and matches the hardware topology. The scheduler includes two methods, ""ASAP"", as soon as possible, and ""ALAP"", as late as possible. The later is commonly used in quantum computation because of the finite lifetime of qubits. **Methods**. - The scheduler first generates a quantum gates dependency graph, containing information about which gates have to be executed before some other gates because they do not commute. The graph preserves the mobility of the gates, i.e. commuting gates are not dependent on each other, even if they use the same qubits. ; - Next, it computes the longest distance of each node to the start and end nodes. The distance for each dependency arrow is defined by the execution time of the instruction (By default, it is 1 for all gates). This is used as a priority measure in the next step. The gate with a longer distance to the end node and a shorter distance to the start node has higher priority.; - In the last step, it uses a list-schedule algorithm with hardware constraint (e.g. gates using the same qubits) and priority and returns a list of cycles for gates.; - Since it's heuristics, sometimes it does not find the optimal. It offers an option that randomly shuffles the gates (if commuting) and repeats the scheduling a few times to get a better result. For scheduling quantum instructions, of which the runtime of different gates might differ, an additional step is required to compute the scheduled start time of each instruction.; It adds the additional dependency caused by hardware constraint to the graph and recomputes the distance of each node to the start and end node. This distance is then converted to the start time of each instruction. **Example**; ```python; >>> from qutip.qip.circuit import QubitCircuit; >>> from qutip.qip.scheduler import Scheduler; >>> circuit = QubitCircuit(7) ; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SNOT"", 3) # gate0; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 5, 3) # gate1; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 4, 3) # gate2; >>> ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1273:1454,schedul,schedule,1454,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1273,1,['schedul'],['schedule']
Energy Efficiency," number. The dimensions types should be available for advanced users (to allow them to access the full parsing speed-ups), but should not be presented as the standard choice. I propose we place the types inside a nested namespace, such as `qutip.dims` (logically - physically it would be `qutip/core/dims.py`), to allow the form `from qutip.dims import *` where appropriate without forcing the user to do the modern bad practice left over from our MATLAB past `from qutip import *`. ## User impact. In principle, nothing will change for the normal QuTiP user compared to the 4.x branch. You will still be able to supply the `dims` argument to the `Qobj` constructor as lists in the exact same format, and they will be parsed in the same way. Users _do not_ need to type out the new computer-friendly dimensions objects, but they will be available for advanced users who frequently make `Qobj` using the raw constructor with funny dimensions. We will publicly provide `qutip.dims.parse` to turn a list into the new form, so even advanced users do not need to type out all the nonsense. `Qobj` factory functions that take a `dims` parameter should now also accept the new form. Since almost all of them just pass this directly to the `dims` argument in the `Qobj` constructor, this likely won't involve any developer effort. `Qobj` construction overhead should be reduced to near-zero when passed a new dimensions object, which we will always do within the library. Compared to the 4.x branch, the overhead of `Qobj` will shrink from ~100µs to ~1µs in library code, even for functions where the `Qobj` type cannot be cleanly inferred from the input types. ## Particular points worth commenting on. 1.

Energy Efficiency," the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. . This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate. This part is gonna involve some physics and study of commonly used hardware platforms. The related code can be found in `qutip.qip.device` and `qutip.qip.compiler`; - Refactoring the circuit compiler to allow simple pulse scheduling, e.g. Restriction one pulses that can be turned on at the same time.; - Features to perform error mitigation techniques in QuTiP, such as zero-error extrapolation.; - APIs to allow import quantum circuits from other software packages or commonly used language e.g. th",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1184:1377,schedul,schedule,1377,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1184,1,['schedul'],['schedule']
Energy Efficiency,"## Preliminaries; The diamond norm [1] is a commonly used metric in quantum information theory for calculating the distance between two quantum channels. It has a number of useful properties making it the gold standard [2] in the field for several applications. In general, a complex semidefinite program is required to calculate the diamond norm. Although elegant, this approach is very inefficient. Unfortunately, no alternative method has been discovered for calculating the diamond norm in the general case of CPTP channels. However, in the special case where we are trying to calculate the difference between two unitary channels, a very efficient implementation exists. This makes use of an unproved theorem on page 29 of [1]. I have proved this theorem and elaborated an efficient algorithm to calculate the diamond distance between two unitaries as part of my masters thesis. . The current qutip implementation makes use of the semi-definite program formulation in [3] and only uses a simplified calculation on 2 qubit unitary differences. The implementation of this novel approach is very simple - the hardest step involves diagonalising a unitary. Although time complexity is still exponential in the number of qubits, this implementation is far more efficient than the more general implementation. The Choi representation of the quantum channel isn't used and there is no need to solve a complicated semi-definite program (meaning I can do away with the `cvxpy` dependency). ## Empirical testing; Results of empirical testing on my machine are reported below. | | 3 qubit | 4 qubit |; |---------|---------|----------|; | current implementation | 5.22 s | 3min 21s |; | hyper-efficient implementation | 924 µs | 1.11 ms |. ## Proposition; Given the popularity of the circuit model and unitary-based quantum computation, I believe a very efficient implementation of the diamond distance for unitaries would be incredibly valuable for the research community.

Energy Efficiency,"### Bug Description. Hey! I've noticed there's a significant slowdown in executing the same codes for obtaining `steadystate` solutions in `v4.7` vs `v5.0` with iterative scipy solvers, especially while using `use_rcm=True`. After spending some time, I believe the main key difference between both versions comes from permutation done in the `_permute_rcm`, where indices are permuted with the indices obtained from the `reverse_cuthill_mckee` function, and this prevents us from getting the preconditioner efficiently. In `v5.0`, for permuting, we use `_data.permute.indices` for the Liouvillian matrix `L`. This gives us different results from what we used in `v4.7`, i.e.,`sp_permute` with the same permuting indices. . As per my understanding, `_data.permute.indices` performs somewhat the following - ; ``` py; A = L.copy(); A.indices = perm.take(A.indices); A = A.tocsc(A); A.indices = perm.take(A.indices); ```; where, we previously, the following was being done; ``` py; L[perm[:,None], perm]; ```; with `perm` are obtained from `reverse_cuthill_mckee`. . I am not sure which behavior is the correct one, but the performance degradation is quite a lot (more than 10x) and prevents reaching sufficient enough tolerance. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import numpy as np; from qutip import (about, destroy, qeye, steadystate, tensor). # Paramaeters; # -----------; Nc, Nm = 4, 30; E, kappa = 0.1, 0.3; gamma, delta = 3e-4, -0.43. # Operators; # ----------; a = tensor(destroy(Nc), qeye(Nm)); b = tensor(qeye(Nc), destroy(Nm)). # Hamiltonian; # ------------; H = -delta * (a.dag() * a) + (b.dag() * b) + 2.4 * kappa * (b.dag() + b) * (a.dag() * a) + E * (a.dag() + a). # Collapse operators; # -------------------; cc = np.sqrt(kappa) * a; cm = np.sqrt(2 * gamma) * b; cp = np.sqrt(gamma) * b.dag(); c_ops = [cc, cm, cp]. precond_options = {'permc_spec': 'NATURAL', 'diag_pivot_thresh': 0.1, 'fill_factor': 100, 'options': {'ILU_MILU': 'smilu_2'}}; solver_options = {""use_precond"": False",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2443:507,efficient,efficiently,507,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2443,1,['efficient'],['efficiently']

The description of ""m_ops"" in the [stochastic solver options](https://qutip.org/docs/latest/apidoc/classes.html#qutip.stochastic.StochasticSolverOptions) states:. > List of operators representing the measurement operators. However, it is clear from the example given [here](https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-stochastic.html) that ""m_ops"" represents the observable being measured and not the measurement operator. . The distinction is that the term ""measurement operator"" usually refers to an (efficient) quantum operation that brings a pure state to a pure state. The measurement operators are the operators that generate the stochastic evolution and are akin to ""sc_ops"", not to ""m_ops"". The operators ""m_ops"" used by the stochastic solver define the POVM elements, i.e., they define the probabilities of measurement outcomes. This is not the same as a measurement operator. .

Energy Efficiency,"### Problem Description. The `improved_sampling` option was recently added to `mcsolve`. It might also be useful to have in `nm_mcsolve`, but adaptations to the code are required to make it work. Currently, we have disabled this option for the `NonMarkovianMCSolver`, see [PR 2234](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2234). Since `NonMarkovianMCSolver` inherits from `MCSolver`, one might expect this option to work ""out of the box"". The technical reason why it does not is that `nm_mcsolve` calculates the value of an influence martingale, which is factored into the calculation of expectation values in the custom result class `NmmcResult`. If `improved_sampling` is enabled, the result class `McResultImprovedSampling` is used instead, which is not aware of the martingale. ### Proposed Solution. Both the improved sampling algorithm and `nm_mcsolve` give trajectories a *weight*. In the former case, the weight is related to the probability of the trajectory without jumps; in the latter case it is the influence martingale. I imagine it might be useful to give `McResult` itself the capability to handle weighted trajectories. ; This capability would be useful for one additional purpose: if we want to allow mixed initial conditions for `mcsolve` in the future. In this case, the trajectories would need to be weighted with a correction factor, because the fraction $f_i$ of trajectories starting in a state $i$ will generally not be equal to the corresponding eigenvalue $p_i$ of the density matrix $\rho = \sum p_i |i \rangle\langle i|$. (Hence, the correction factor would be $p_i / f_i$.). If people think this would be useful (including the mixed initial states), I will try to implement this proposal once I can find some time to do so. ### Alternate Solutions. Alternatively, we could leave things as they are now and not support the improved sampling for `nm_mcsolve`. Another less invasive option would be copying the improved sampling algorithm to `nm_mcsolve` (adding a `NmmcResultIm",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2235:142,adapt,adaptations,142,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2235,1,['adapt'],['adaptations']

Energy Efficiency,"**Description**. The aim of this project is to enhance the capabilities of qutip's HEOM implementation by introducing a set of tools that offer the option to simulate arbitrary spectral densities or correlation functions. . To achieve this the main idea is to fit our wanted spectral density by a set of underdamped Drude-Lorentz spectral densities or correlation functions. The idea is that the user will supply his desired spectral density or correlation function and the tools will automatically do the fit and construct the corresponding HEOM bath. Guesses ffor the fit and the number of terms will be decided automatically if the user does not specify them. To decided on the number of terms, we will used the normalized root mean square error as a measure of the goodness of the fit. . I also added functions to bosonic bath to quickly obtain the correlation function, power spectrum and spectral density for the existing bosonic baths . **Note**. Those tests fail because mpmath is not in the requirements, it is needed because the scipy version of the Rienmann zeta function doesn't take complex arguments (https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9182). **Related issues or PRs**.

Energy Efficiency,"**Description**; A gate (pulse) scheduler for quantum circuits (instructions). It schedules a `QubitCircuit` or a list of instructions to reduce the total execution time by exciting them parallelly. It uses heuristic methods mainly from https://doi.org/10.1117/12.666419. The scheduler aims at pulse schedule and therefore does not consider merging gates to reduce the gates number. It assumes that the input circuit is optimized at the gate level (e.g. has a minimal number of CNOT gates) and matches the hardware topology. The scheduler includes two methods, ""ASAP"", as soon as possible, and ""ALAP"", as late as possible. The later is commonly used in quantum computation because of the finite lifetime of qubits. **Methods**. - The scheduler first generates a quantum gates dependency graph, containing information about which gates have to be executed before some other gates because they do not commute. The graph preserves the mobility of the gates, i.e. commuting gates are not dependent on each other, even if they use the same qubits. ; - Next, it computes the longest distance of each node to the start and end nodes. The distance for each dependency arrow is defined by the execution time of the instruction (By default, it is 1 for all gates). This is used as a priority measure in the next step. The gate with a longer distance to the end node and a shorter distance to the start node has higher priority.; - In the last step, it uses a list-schedule algorithm with hardware constraint (e.g. gates using the same qubits) and priority and returns a list of cycles for gates.; - Since it's heuristics, sometimes it does not find the optimal. It offers an option that randomly shuffles the gates (if commuting) and repeats the scheduling a few times to get a better result. For scheduling quantum instructions, of which the runtime of different gates might differ, an additional step is required to compute the scheduled start time of each instruction.; It adds the additional dependency caus",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1273:32,schedul,scheduler,32,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1273,8,"['reduce', 'schedul']","['reduce', 'schedule', 'scheduler', 'schedules']"

Energy Efficiency,"**Description**; Currently, result objects store a reference to the solver object that created them. I think this is an accident. The options field of a solver is an instance of `_SolverOptions` (see [here](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/454b61529d7bf3c37f74c17925a749fcb046c364/qutip/solver/solver_base.py#L312)), which gets stored in the result [here](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/454b61529d7bf3c37f74c17925a749fcb046c364/qutip/solver/solver_base.py#L147). `_SolverOptions` has a `_feedback` field which is assigned an instance method of the solver and thus keeps a reference to the solver. I noticed this issue when I called `qsave` on a result object and the resulting file was ~100 MB instead of the expected ~100 KB. Setting `result.options._feedback = None` before calling `qsave` reduced the file size by a factor ~2000. But also without pickling, I think that this is a memory leak where solver objects can't be garbage collected. The fix I am submitting here makes results create a copy of the options passed to it, setting `_feedback` to `None` if it exists. I considered converting `_SolverOptions` objects to plain `dict`s in the result class, but that would discard a little bit of information. (Note however that in many places, the `options` passed to the results are plain `dict`s anyway, [for example](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/454b61529d7bf3c37f74c17925a749fcb046c364/qutip/tests/solver/test_results.py#L30).)

Energy Efficiency,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**; In the device simulator of QuTiP (`qutip.qip.device`), a quantum computing device is characterized by the class `Processor` and its subclasses. It contains information about the available control pulses. In addition, a compiler is used to compile a set of universal quantum gates (e.g. RX, RY and ISWAP) into the corresponding control pulses. Together, they can automatically compiler an arbitrary quantum circuit into control pulses, create the time-dependent Hamiltonian representation and run the simulation using QuTiP solvers. However, in the current version, this compilation is done for each gate sequentially. At each time step, there is only one control pulse active. In practice, it is inefficient because usually several gates can be performed parallelly (e.g. X gate on qubit 0 and qubit 1). To make the compilation more practical, it is necessary to introduce a scheduler that schedules the control pulses. A similar example is https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/pulse.html#schedules. **Describe the solution you'd like**; There is existing research (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00023.pdf) on gate-level scheduling. It studies which gates can be performed at the same time. In the most general case, however, gate-level scheduling is not enough, since different gates often have different runtime (.e.g. CNOT usually takes longer time than X gate). Despite the difference, pulse-level scheduling can be done in a similar way as gate-level scheduling by generating a graph (see the reference above). The difference is that each pulse will have its own duration. The possible implementation in `qutip.qip` could be in two steps:; - Modernize the current compiler and create an `Instruction` class representing each compiled control instruction (pulse, qubit index, amplitude, duration).; - Implement the scheduling algorithm similar as in the above reference.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1243:943,schedul,scheduler,943,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1243,8,['schedul'],"['scheduler', 'schedules', 'scheduling']"
Energy Efficiency,"*Methods**. - The scheduler first generates a quantum gates dependency graph, containing information about which gates have to be executed before some other gates because they do not commute. The graph preserves the mobility of the gates, i.e. commuting gates are not dependent on each other, even if they use the same qubits. ; - Next, it computes the longest distance of each node to the start and end nodes. The distance for each dependency arrow is defined by the execution time of the instruction (By default, it is 1 for all gates). This is used as a priority measure in the next step. The gate with a longer distance to the end node and a shorter distance to the start node has higher priority.; - In the last step, it uses a list-schedule algorithm with hardware constraint (e.g. gates using the same qubits) and priority and returns a list of cycles for gates.; - Since it's heuristics, sometimes it does not find the optimal. It offers an option that randomly shuffles the gates (if commuting) and repeats the scheduling a few times to get a better result. For scheduling quantum instructions, of which the runtime of different gates might differ, an additional step is required to compute the scheduled start time of each instruction.; It adds the additional dependency caused by hardware constraint to the graph and recomputes the distance of each node to the start and end node. This distance is then converted to the start time of each instruction. **Example**; ```python; >>> from qutip.qip.circuit import QubitCircuit; >>> from qutip.qip.scheduler import Scheduler; >>> circuit = QubitCircuit(7) ; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SNOT"", 3) # gate0; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 5, 3) # gate1; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 4, 3) # gate2; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 2, 3) # gate3; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 6, 5) # gate4; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 2, 6) # gate5; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SWAP"", [0, 2]) # gate6; >>>; >>> scheduler = Scheduler(""ASAP""); >>> scheduler.schedule(circuit, gates_schedule=Tru",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1273:1736,schedul,scheduling,1736,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1273,1,['schedul'],['scheduling']

This distance is then converted to the start time of each instruction. **Example**; ```python; >>> from qutip.qip.circuit import QubitCircuit; >>> from qutip.qip.scheduler import Scheduler; >>> circuit = QubitCircuit(7) ; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SNOT"", 3) # gate0; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 5, 3) # gate1; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 4, 3) # gate2; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 2, 3) # gate3; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 6, 5) # gate4; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 2, 6) # gate5; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SWAP"", [0, 2]) # gate6; >>>; >>> scheduler = Scheduler(""ASAP""); >>> scheduler.schedule(circuit, gates_schedule=True) ; [0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4]; ```; The result list is the cycle indices for each gate. It means that the circuit can be executed in 5 gate cycles:; ```; gate0; gate1; gate3, gate4; gate2, gate5; gate6; ```; Notice that gate3 and gate4 commute with gate2, therefore, the order is changed to reduce the number of cycles. **Related issues or PRs**; Solve #1243 . **Changelog**; Add a gate(pulse) scheduler for quantum circuit. **Others**; @sarsid Maybe you will be interested in it.

I don't really know anything about the theory here, and just went with what the `matlab` documentation said: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/symrcm.html. In commit 0ce36d00 it is clear that the functions in `qutip.graph` were meant to be distinct from `Qobj`, so ideally they would be beyond our purview in this package. This actually has already lead to problems with the documentation, since the docstrings in; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/graph.py#L50-L53; and; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/graph.py#L71-L74; are out-of-date. I find that the only uses of `qutip.graph` are in `qutip.steadystate`, which uses `reverse_cuthill_mckee` and `weighted_bipartite_matching`. The former can be replaced directly with the `scipy` version, at the cost of ~10% speed. The latter is not yet in `scipy`, so we ought to perhaps keep it, since it is used and documented for `qutip.steadystate.steadystate`. All other functions in `qutip.graph` are not used, and not documented (and in `scipy` anyway). While obviously I don't want to trample on anybody's code, I think it might be worth considering how we can reduce the package complexity of `qutip`, especially while significant new complexity is frequently being added in the interests of speed. We only have a finite amount of resources to maintain the codebase, and it's already quite difficult to get a handle on bug reports, documentation, testing (what I'm working on in #1181), and keeping old features up-to-date with the new. In the tracking down of these points, I can also strongly advocate for a stricter policy on `git` commit messages and keeping the commit history tidy and descriptive, but I'll live to fight another day on that one!",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203:3714,reduce,reduce,3714,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Energy Efficiency,"Currently QuTiP solvers are pure batch jobs. One calls a function, e.g. `mesolve`, which then runs until the state has been propagated to all requested time steps and then the function returns the result. There are a variety of use cases where having access to results as they are calculated can be useful:. * Implementing a progress bar; * Limiting how long a solver runs for; * Stopping a solver early if a steady state or other desired or undesired state is detected.; * Implementing adaptive solvers where parameters are changed depending on the current state. We're currently refactoring the QuTiP solvers for QuTiP v5, so perhaps now is a good time to consider whether this feature will see enough use to be worth the effort. Implementation options:. * The solver could call a `callback function` each time a new result becomes available.; * The solver could `yield` each time a new result becomes available.; * The solver could do something asynchronous (I think this is not worth supporting natively in QuTiP -- either of the others would allow something asynchronous to be implemented by a QuTiP users themselves if they wanted). Probably these are not mutually exclusive. To make porting easier, it should still be possible to call some solve function without a callback or yielding as one can do now.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi QuTiP users,. I am not quite sure how I should introduce the issue that I have, but basically it comes down to the fact that my Hamiltonian and a particular function seems to require >500 GB of RAM for some parameters used. For the desired parameters, this can even become Terabytes which is hard to implement. . The main parameters by the way is N, which is the dimension of the Hilbert Space. The maximum is N=111 when running the program on the 500 GB node. The memory usage fits very good to a RAM (MB) = 0.0008804*N^4 dependence. A strange thing is that Slurm's MaxRSS command says that only 133,690 MB was needed to run the program, which is not close to the 500 GB. The memory profiler said that one function required 145,766.2 MiB (152,846.9 MB) at some point, and 327,769.4 MiB (343,691.1 MB) was freed. Together this comes close to the 500 GB, although I don't understand the numbers. I have no profound knowledge of the memory allocation in Python and QuTiP, but I would like to check if this can be improved. I went to two IT consultants who are in charge of the National Supercomputer in the Netherlands, and they also found no errors in my code. One of their suggestions was to ask you for advice on this topic. Of course, I can provide you with more details (the whole code, the outcome of the memory profiler, the meaning of the parameters and the infrastructure), but I don't want to overwhelm you. I look forward to hearing from you. Best regards,.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi,. There is a [manual integration](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/floquet.py#L602-L624) using rectangles method in `qutip.floquet` file which sometimes fail. Problem is that the number of timesteps, `nT`, is hardcoded and not accessible to the user. In my case, `nT = 100` does not seem to be enough and the integral is wrong. A quick and dirty fix is to have an extra `nT=100` keyword argument to `floquet_master_equation_rates`, so that user can overload it. Still, it does not seem to be the most efficient way of doing it. I have a quick fix I can contribute which is using `scipy.integrate.simps` instead. This requires keeping an array of values to integrate in memory (which is less memory-efficient) but I could keep `nT=100` and get the correct integral by using this method. I guess the best option would be to use [`scipy.integrate.quad`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.quad.html#scipy.integrate.quad), as it uses an adaptive algorithm.

Energy Efficiency,"In #1332 there is a huge drop in reported test coverage by Coveralls. This is because large tracts of the most-tested Python files were either severely reduced in length, or converted to Cython files, and it seems that Coveralls does not correctly handle Cython; it reports the existence of a `x.py` file for every `x.pyx` file that exists, with the `.py` file having 7 lines, all of which are apparently untested. The new data-layer types _are_ tested albeit not as completely as they will be once they're finished, but Coveralls has reported a huge drop in coverage. I don't know if any coverage estimators exist for Cython (I would expect not due to their compiled nature), but it's perhaps something we should consider. Also, Coveralls counts the test files as part of its coverage indicator. By my rough count, there are 42,223 SLOC in `qutip` (i.e. excluding comments and whitespace but unfortunately including docstrings), of which 11,259 are in `qutip/tests`. Aside from a couple of skipped tests, 100% of the lines in `qutip/tests` will be run, so if we produce a modified coverage report, having 61% of the SLOC covered in _all_ of `qutip` is equivalent to; ```python; >>> (0.61*42_223 - 1.00*11_259) / (42_223 - 11_259); 0.4681898; ```; **46.8% true coverage**.

Energy Efficiency,"In the mcsolver function, it seems that (read from tutorial) the **quantum jumps** happen when a random number is generated larger than **(1-dp)**, where **dp** is no jump probability. And this is the only option for jumping in the algorithm. . In theory, there is another strategy to choose **jump**--that is to use the concept of **waiting time** (see Dum and Zoller's PRA **45** (7), 1992 paper, for example). That is to say, we check the no jump time **t** to see if it is longer than the waiting time $\tau$: if **t** is longer, then a quantum jump happens; otherwise, there is no jump. . Could anyone make the mcsolver flexible enough to let users freely to choose which strategy to use in the algorithm? Each of these two strategies have different meanings and their own advantages: the jumping probability strategy is good for simulating measurement models; the waiting time is more efficient if one just wants to know the averaged result. . If currently none can implement this idea, could you provide a direction for me to write another mcsolver to use the counterpart strategy of jumping? Thanks.

Energy Efficiency,"Looking through the commit history, @nonhermitian wrote the graph functions back in 2013: see fd4920d. Since then, he contributed a lot of the same code to `scipy` in `scipy.sparse.csgraph`: see https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/3751. I suggest we consider dropping most of them, and consequently their surrounding `Cython` code to ease maintainability and reduce code bloat of the repository. First, a couple of arguments against doing so:; - the versions in `scipy` and `qutip` did subsequently diverge in some form, because they no longer universally give the same results, possibly as a result of #654.; - the `qutip` version of `reverse_cuthill_mckee` is about 10% faster than the `scipy` version; - people may be using them. I think the main argument in favour of removal is that they're now also in `scipy` as `scipy.sparse.csgraph`. For the speed argument, for 1000 by 1000 matrices we're talking 780us vs 850us per matrix difference, so it's unlikely to be a limiting factor, and I think the ability to remove a large chunk of Cython code and maintainability cost outweighs this. I began investigating this because I was looking at `qutip.graph.reverse_cuthill_mckee`, since some of its tests are incorrect. The error is here:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/tests/test_graph.py#L91-L108; Line 105 is broken: it should read; ```python; assert np.all(ans_perm == perm); ```; to test if _all_ the elements match. As it stands, it currently tests that _not all are different_, or in other words, it would only fail if not a single element in the two arrays matched. On fixing this line, we then learn that the test is actually a failing test, because the expected and actual results do not match (though they do however have equal bandwidths). I also note that `qutip` and `matlab` are in disagreement for the test case there: for the matrix; ```python; np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],; [0, 1, 0, 1",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203:359,reduce,reduce,359,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

See [1][Nineteen Dubious Ways to Compute the Exponential of a Matrix, Twenty-Five Years Later∗](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/cv/ResearchPDF/19ways%2B.pdf). In a quantum optics, the displacement operator is one of the most basic. It is used to create coherent states from vacuum and forms one of the two gates for universal control of a cavity (Displacement + SNAP gates) [2] [Efficient cavity control with SNAP gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14256). When we want to write an optimisation routine that finds best displacement parameters in a routine similar to the paper above [2], it would be nice if we can compute the operator faster without doing matrix exponentiation as qutip does now:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/operators.py#L732. I have some notes from a colleague who calculated an analytical formula to compute the matrix elements of the displacement operator without having to do matrix exponentiation [3]: ; [Displacement_operator.pdf](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/4791455/Displacement_operator.pdf). A PR to implement this in QuTiP would be great. We could first write a `_displace_analytical` function that calculates the displacement matrix using the [Scipy Laguerre polynomial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.genlaguerre.html) and have it as an option as `displace(N, alpha, offset, method=`analytical` )`. Could it also come in handy for optimal control? @ajgpitch .

Energy Efficiency,"Measuring the statistics of electron transport though nanostructures has been found to be a powerful experimental tool to gather information about such structures. The functions in countstat.py return the first two cumulants of a transport process, which are associated with measuring the current and shot noise, respectively. However at the moment they are a little buggy, and the current noise function fails sometimes, depending on the dimensionality of the system. As well as fixing this issue, there a couple of enhancements that can be done:. 1) Making the current noise function frequency dependant. This just requires adding a list of frequencies to return, and calculating the noise power for each given frequency ( at the moment it returns the zero frequency current noise). 2) Adding higher-order current cumulants. This is a straightforward generalization of the current noise function, though for very high orders the expansion of a given cumulant in terms of pseudo-inverse and current operators can be a little complicated. An iterative method for generating these can be found in C. Flindt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 150601 (2008). and C. Flindt, T. Novotny, A. Braggio, and A.-P. Jauho, Phys. Rev. B 82, 155407 (2010). 3) Calculate the large-deviation function of the current.

Energy Efficiency,"The internal data type for storing dynamics generators (Hamiltonians), propagators, and the time evolution can now be set as Qobj. When using Qobj the propagators are computed using qutip methods for expm. Resolves #370; The default for small systems remains ndarray, as this provides much faster execution (factor of 10 approx). However, it is assumed, but not yet tested, that for larger systems the Qobj propagation will be faster, and certainly less memory consumptive. The internal data type (if not specified) is chosen automatically using the same criteria Qobj.expm() uses to determine whether to use the (cython) sparse method.; The main motivation for implementing this change is for users developing their own custom fidelity and gradient measures which use the partial trace method. Consequently, preserving the dimensions is important. This has been shown (by colleagues testing) to be more efficient than recreating the Qobjs from ndarrays.; The internal operator processing methods and attributes have been renamed with underscores preceding to indicate that these will be of the internal operator data type. Accessors have been added that will always provide Qobj representations of the operators.; Theoretically any operator data type that supports the dot() method could be used, e.g. some other sparse matrix type, however this has not been extensively tested and should be considered an experimental feature.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/397:904,efficient,efficient,904,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/397,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

Energy Efficiency,"This relaxes the amount of sorting required in the `add_csr` operation. In the current version in `dev.major`, both the left and right matrices are sorted in all cases. This PR makes `add_csr` an `Accumulator` operation, which straight away reduces the number of sorts required to one. Second, I add a track inside `scatter` to know whether the scatters were in sorted order; if so, there's no need to sort within `gather`, which removes the other sort from `add_csr`. Effectively, this means that `add_csr` is O(n) when both input matrices are sorted (the most common) and O(n lg(n)) when either isn't, and we don't actually have to perform a separate test to decide between them. In practice, this is around a 2x speedup for most common sparse matrices, and goes up from there. I have also made `Accumulator` a C struct, and all the operations on it header-file only. This allows them to be operated on without holding the GIL (though threaded access to the same one would be unsafe anyway), and it also allows them to be inlined - if they are defined in the `pyx` file, then they will be compiled into a separate object and so must be called. We had talked about making `CSR` have a ""guarantee"" that it is always sorted, but I haven't implemented that here. Because of the changes to `scatter`, that would no longer give an algorithmic speedup in this case for matrices that are sorted (although we could avoid the use of `Accumulator` which would be more efficient). All of the operations I have written return a sorted matrix, so generally matrices will tend to become sorted over time anyway.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1362:241,reduce,reduces,241,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1362,2,"['efficient', 'reduce']","['efficient', 'reduces']"

Energy Efficiency,"_Edited 2020-08-10_. This is now a complete switch-over to the new `CSR` type, from `fast_csr_matrix`. There are huge changes and knock-on effects all across QuTiP. Most notably for user code is that arithmetic on `Qobj` is now massively faster for small `Qobj`. The instantiation cost of `Qobj` is reduced an awful lot, and internal functions which return `Qobj` now supply `dims` and `type` information to the constructor so that instantiation time is down from ~50-100µs to about ~5µs. Notable removals:; - `eseries` and `essolve` are completely gone; - OpenMP is temporarily removed (though this will be added back in to the data layer later); - all functions in `correlation` and `qobj` which were marked ""deprecated"" are now actually removed; - `vec2mat` and `mat2vec` have been renamed to `vector_to_operator` and `operator_to_vector`; - all ""legacy"" files have been completely removed; - all previous scipy-CSR-like Cython code is completely gone (replaced by the data layer); - `Qobj` no longer defines `__array__`, and so will not automatically turn itself into one. Having this produced very inconsistent behaviour when multiplying by numpy arrays, or otherwise dealing with numpy functions. If you _need_ `Qobj` to be array, be explicit and call `Qobj.full()`. Notable changes in `Qobj`:; - matrix multiplication now contracts to a scalar if doing `bra @ ket`; - matrix multiplication no longer contracts 1D subspaces, but the new `Qobj.contract()` will do this; - arithmetic operations are much more strict about enforcing `Qobj.type`-safety; - `Qobj` understands the `@` operator to mean matrix multiplication, but also maintains the same behaviour of treating `Qobj * Qobj` as matrix multiplication. Package organisation:; - the solvers are now physically contained in `qutip.solve`, but are still logically available in the `qutip` namespace.

Energy Efficiency,"ains either an array result.expect of expectation values for the times specified by tlist, (...), or nothing if a callback function was given in place of operators for which to calculate the expectation values. So to work with callback function, we need to manage the storage by ourselves, for example by defining a global list, as it is done in [this example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-8-Adiabatic-quantum-computing.ipynb#Evolve-the-system-in-time). **Describe the solution you'd like**. Currently when we pass a list of operators such as. ```python; e_ops = [sigmax(), sigmay(), sigmaz()]; result = mesolve(H, rho0, e_ops=e_ops); ```. We will be able to access expectation value of `sigmax()` in `result.expect[0]`, of `sigmay()` in `result.expect[1]` and of course `sigmaz()` in `result.expect[2]`. Why not capture the custom measurement in similar way?. ```; def customMeasurement(tau, psi):; exp_x = expect(sigmax(), psi); exp_y = expect(sigmaz(), psi); exp_z = expect(sigmay(), psi); energy = expect(H, psi); fidelity = np.abs(psi_ref.overlap(psi))**2.; return [exp_x, exp_y, exp_z, energy, fidelity]; ```. Now it is possible to still get expectation values as before, but in addition we can take more custom measurements (in this example energy and fidelity of state) and access them in exactly the same way for the convenience. The only thing user needs to keep track of is order of operators returned from the callback function. So now it is as before but in addition `result.expect[3]` contains energy and `result.expect[4]` contains fidelity and no custom managed global external lists required as it was in the [example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-8-Adiabatic-quantum-computing.ipynb#Evolve-the-system-in-time). **Describe alternatives you've considered**.

The full aim, however, is to have QuTiP 5 support many different data representations as the backing of `Qobj`, and use the most suitable representation for the given data. This will not require every single QuTiP function to have an exponential number of versions for every possible combination of inputs, but only to have specialisations for the most common data combinations. This concept is the ""data layer"". All code examples in this PR are prefixed with. ```python; >>> from qutip.core import data; ```. ## Specification. The core to achieving this is fast, fully specified inter-conversion between all known data types, and efficient multiple-dispatch for mathematical operations. There are then four principle components of the data-layer:. 1. a creation routine which returns an appropriate data-layer type given some arbitrary Python object (`data.create`); 2. a routine which can perform the conversion from any data-layer type to any other data-layer type (`data.to`); 3. completely specialised mathematical operations (e.g. `data.add_csr_dense_dense(CSR, Dense) -> Dense`); 4. an object which provides multiple dispatch operations on its input arguments to use an exact specialisation (defined in item 3) if known, or uses the conversion routine (item 2) to convert the inputs into ones matching a specialisation if not: `data.Dispatcher`. The exported mathematical functions will all be instances of this type. The minimum work needed to define a new data-layer type is to provide `data.to` with two conversion functions; one into the new type from a current data-layer type, and one which con",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1338:1176,efficient,efficient,1176,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1338,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

There are multiple type of evolver wrapping different scipy's ode solver and a few of our own. The wrapper around scipy's zvode that was previously used in qutip's is `EvolverScipyZvode`, but we now have our own cython solver based on [Verner's method](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/) that accept any Data type as state. Different evolver based on different ODE method are interchangeable and have their dispatcher `evolver_collection`, allowing to easily add new methods. . With this, time-dependent system are managed by `QobjEvo`, ODE by `Evolver`, therefore the solvers can concentrate more closely on the physic. **Evolver:**; Method supported with this PR: `adams`, `bdf`, `dop853`, `lsoda`, `vern7`, `vern9`, `diag`.

For scheduling quantum instructions, of which the runtime of different gates might differ, an additional step is required to compute the scheduled start time of each instruction.; It adds the additional dependency caused by hardware constraint to the graph and recomputes the distance of each node to the start and end node. This distance is then converted to the start time of each instruction. **Example**; ```python; >>> from qutip.qip.circuit import QubitCircuit; >>> from qutip.qip.scheduler import Scheduler; >>> circuit = QubitCircuit(7) ; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SNOT"", 3) # gate0; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 5, 3) # gate1; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 4, 3) # gate2; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 2, 3) # gate3; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 6, 5) # gate4; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 2, 6) # gate5; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SWAP"", [0, 2]) # gate6; >>>; >>> scheduler = Scheduler(""ASAP""); >>> scheduler.schedule(circuit, gates_schedule=True) ; [0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4]; ```; The result list is the cycle indices for each gate. It means that the circuit can be executed in 5 gate cycles:; ```; gate0; gate1; gate3, gate4; gate2, gate5; gate6; ```; Notice that gate3 and gate4 commute with gate2, therefore, the order is changed to reduce the number of cycles. **Related issues or PRs**; Solve #1243 . **Changelog**; Add a gate(pulse) scheduler for quantum circuit. **Others**; @sarsid Maybe you will be interested in it.

Energy Efficiency,"eld for several applications. In general, a complex semidefinite program is required to calculate the diamond norm. Although elegant, this approach is very inefficient. Unfortunately, no alternative method has been discovered for calculating the diamond norm in the general case of CPTP channels. However, in the special case where we are trying to calculate the difference between two unitary channels, a very efficient implementation exists. This makes use of an unproved theorem on page 29 of [1]. I have proved this theorem and elaborated an efficient algorithm to calculate the diamond distance between two unitaries as part of my masters thesis. . The current qutip implementation makes use of the semi-definite program formulation in [3] and only uses a simplified calculation on 2 qubit unitary differences. The implementation of this novel approach is very simple - the hardest step involves diagonalising a unitary. Although time complexity is still exponential in the number of qubits, this implementation is far more efficient than the more general implementation. The Choi representation of the quantum channel isn't used and there is no need to solve a complicated semi-definite program (meaning I can do away with the `cvxpy` dependency). ## Empirical testing; Results of empirical testing on my machine are reported below. | | 3 qubit | 4 qubit |; |---------|---------|----------|; | current implementation | 5.22 s | 3min 21s |; | hyper-efficient implementation | 924 µs | 1.11 ms |. ## Proposition; Given the popularity of the circuit model and unitary-based quantum computation, I believe a very efficient implementation of the diamond distance for unitaries would be incredibly valuable for the research community. Given how simple the change is (current tests already cover the test case), I think it would be a simple and worthwhile addition to qutip. ## Citations. [1] D. Aharonov, A. Kitaev, and N.

Energy Efficiency,"g. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. . This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate. This part is gonna involve some physics and study of commonly used hardware platforms. The related code can be found in `qutip.qip.device` and `qutip.qip.compiler`; - Refactoring the circuit compiler to allow simple pulse scheduling, e.g. Restriction one pulses that can be turned on at the same time.; - Features to perform error mitigation techniques in QuTiP, such as zero-error extrapolation.; - APIs to allow import quantum circuits from other software packages or commonly used language e.g. through quantum assembly language (qasm); ----------------------------------------------------------------.

QuTiP just got selected and there is the opportunity for students projects over the winter. I will begin with proposing mine, but this is an opportunity also for mentors to propose their projects, beginning in priority from the lead developers. . ## Other Funding Schemes; Similarly, I have been writing NumFOCUS [small development grants](https://numfocus.org/blog/fall-2018-open-source-development-grants), which have a different goal but can be set up similarly. Also, in the future we may apply again to [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). . ## Future Opportunities; Several senior researchers and team leaders have aired the desire to contribute to the project more actively. Setting up a space where they can propose projects, even on their own funding resources (most probably together with the development of research projects), in coordination with the lead development team, could help foster development in a more sustainable way. . ## Proposal; I propose to help sustain available projects in a more structural way than what is done now. This is an example of a what we could call a **QEP, or ""QuTiP Enhancement Proposal"".**. - One thing that could be done is to simply expand the existing Wiki. The downside of taking only this action is that only organization members can modify the wiki. So this could work, but mainly as a more static and cleaner staple. . - I propose to integrate the Wiki with Issues that contain the projects, adding a `projects` (or similar) label. This is in the spirit also of other large quantum open source projects such as Qiskit, which has even an ad-hoc `qiskit-community` repository, https://github.com/qiskit-community/.

Energy Efficiency,"he initial floquet modes, computing the propagator over one period, then using these to compute at other time, recomputing the propagator up to that time. When the modes at multiple times were needed, we could compute a list of them over one period using `floquet_modes_table`, but at least 2 computations over a period were needed. With the and the `Propagator` memoize capacities added in v5, only one computation of the propagator is required. Also with the table computation of v4, if a mode was not included in the table, the closest one was used. `fmesolve ` and `fsesolve` computed 100 slices over the period. It did not used the values in `tlist` and caused artifacts in the result. With `FloquetBasis`, the mode are always computed at the exact time. . I left the v4's functions with warnings. The construction of the floquet tensor was done using 2 functions: `floquet_master_equation_rates` which returned 4 tensors and `floquet_master_equation_tensor`. I added `floquet_tensor` which computed the tensor in one call and split `floquet_master_equation_rates` in 4 functions, one for each of the outputs. Floquet, like `brmesolve`, need a function for the noise power spectrum. Unlike `brmesolve`, string are not supported, only functions. We should have them match, but supporting string is quite heavy since coefficient are not a great fit. `fsesolve` have been rewritten without the class interface. As an integrator, the floquet method has no advantage since the propagator much be computed using another method. `fmesolve` work similarly to other solver. The `e_ops` are always in the laboratory basis. The result states are also in the laboratory basis. The option `""store_floquet_states""` is used to store the states in the floquet basis in `result.floquet_states`. In v4, there it an option for the environment temperature, but no tests for it.

Energy Efficiency,"in place of operators for which to calculate the expectation values. So to work with callback function, we need to manage the storage by ourselves, for example by defining a global list, as it is done in [this example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-8-Adiabatic-quantum-computing.ipynb#Evolve-the-system-in-time). **Describe the solution you'd like**. Currently when we pass a list of operators such as. ```python; e_ops = [sigmax(), sigmay(), sigmaz()]; result = mesolve(H, rho0, e_ops=e_ops); ```. We will be able to access expectation value of `sigmax()` in `result.expect[0]`, of `sigmay()` in `result.expect[1]` and of course `sigmaz()` in `result.expect[2]`. Why not capture the custom measurement in similar way?. ```; def customMeasurement(tau, psi):; exp_x = expect(sigmax(), psi); exp_y = expect(sigmaz(), psi); exp_z = expect(sigmay(), psi); energy = expect(H, psi); fidelity = np.abs(psi_ref.overlap(psi))**2.; return [exp_x, exp_y, exp_z, energy, fidelity]; ```. Now it is possible to still get expectation values as before, but in addition we can take more custom measurements (in this example energy and fidelity of state) and access them in exactly the same way for the convenience. The only thing user needs to keep track of is order of operators returned from the callback function. So now it is as before but in addition `result.expect[3]` contains energy and `result.expect[4]` contains fidelity and no custom managed global external lists required as it was in the [example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-8-Adiabatic-quantum-computing.ipynb#Evolve-the-system-in-time). **Describe alternatives you've considered**.

([Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lBfS7v4WxduvWy-rf1Vd-hSEeNOK4at91ALuaH58AnQ/edit?usp=sharing)); * February 2019: The first QuTiP developers workshop is held i",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1373:1900,sustainab,sustainable,1900,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1373,1,['sustainab'],['sustainable']
Energy Efficiency,"method` options, as it is in other solver.; - The method that was referring the homodyne or heterodyne detection is now the `heterodyne` keyword. ie before `method=""heterodyne""` now `heterodyne=True`.; - The default integration method is now `rouchon`, instead of `taylor1.5`. ie the method coming from a physic paper and not a mathematics textbook. . - The stochastic integration methods have been spitted in smaller chunk instead of the huge classes in _stochastic.pyx. I kept most methods, only skipping the taylor order 2.0 method. The python interface is kept very similar to the `Integrator` as `SIntegrator`, the main difference being that `set_state` and `get_state` use an extra random number generator with the time and state. The integration methods are usually 5%~10% slower than they where for medium size problems (shape ~100). Most method are computed the same way as before, but the rouchon method no longer use super operator, but keep the density matrix as a matrix and not an oper-ket. - The derivative computation for used by the integration method has also been split into multiple functions and made only available for `smesolve`. For there methods to be valid, the each diffusion contribution must commute. For `smesolve`, this means that each `sc_ops` must commute, as documented. For `ssesolve`, each `sc_ops` must not only commute, but also commute with other `sc_ops`'s adjoint, this last part being missing from v4's documentation. It also meant that the sc_ops needed to commute with it's own adjoint when using heterodyne detection... - `ssepdpsolve`, `smepdpsolve`, `photocurrent_mesolve`, `photocurrent_sesolve` removed. They are all less efficient variants of `mcsolve`. `mcsolve` already include the photocurrent in the output. - `general_stochastic`, removed. It is a mostly generic stochastic equation solver. The user to define their equations to integrate, but the results are forced into `Results` with expectation values and dims checks, making it hard to use.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2131:2213,efficient,efficient,2213,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2131,1,['efficient'],['efficient']
Energy Efficiency,"ocesses to avoid overwhelming the host system. This approach helps in balancing load and performance. 2. **Error Handling and Robustness**:; - Enhanced the resilience of the parallel computation by encapsulating the worker function’s body in a try-except block, ensuring that failures in one computation do not impact the overall execution.; - Ensured the stability of the test environment by restoring the original function state after the test execution, preventing side effects on subsequent tests. 3. **Testing**:; - **Extended Test Coverage**: Developed new test cases to validate both the parallel and sequential execution paths of the function. Tests ensure that both modes produce equivalent results, thereby confirming that the parallelization did not introduce computational errors.; - **Integration with Existing Tests**: Integrated the new tests into the existing pytest framework used for QuTiP, making use of fixtures and parameterization to test different scenarios and system setups effectively. ### Implementation Details. - **Concurrency**: The parallel execution is managed through a pool of processes, where each process is responsible for a subset of the total computations. This method is particularly effective for operations that can be divided into independent, smaller tasks.; - **Compatibility**: Ensured that the enhancements are backward-compatible with existing code by modifying only the internal execution strategy of the `correlation_2op_1t` function and by maintaining the original API signature.; - **Performance Considerations**: The parallel implementation can significantly reduce computation times, particularly for larger systems or longer `taulist` arrays, by leveraging multiple CPU cores concurrently. ### Conclusion. The enhancements to the `correlation_2op_1t` function in QuTiP are designed to harness the capabilities of modern multi-core processors, thereby improving the efficiency of quantum correlation computations.

Energy Efficiency,"r gates because they do not commute. The graph preserves the mobility of the gates, i.e. commuting gates are not dependent on each other, even if they use the same qubits. ; - Next, it computes the longest distance of each node to the start and end nodes. The distance for each dependency arrow is defined by the execution time of the instruction (By default, it is 1 for all gates). This is used as a priority measure in the next step. The gate with a longer distance to the end node and a shorter distance to the start node has higher priority.; - In the last step, it uses a list-schedule algorithm with hardware constraint (e.g. gates using the same qubits) and priority and returns a list of cycles for gates.; - Since it's heuristics, sometimes it does not find the optimal. It offers an option that randomly shuffles the gates (if commuting) and repeats the scheduling a few times to get a better result. For scheduling quantum instructions, of which the runtime of different gates might differ, an additional step is required to compute the scheduled start time of each instruction.; It adds the additional dependency caused by hardware constraint to the graph and recomputes the distance of each node to the start and end node. This distance is then converted to the start time of each instruction. **Example**; ```python; >>> from qutip.qip.circuit import QubitCircuit; >>> from qutip.qip.scheduler import Scheduler; >>> circuit = QubitCircuit(7) ; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SNOT"", 3) # gate0; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 5, 3) # gate1; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 4, 3) # gate2; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 2, 3) # gate3; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 6, 5) # gate4; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 2, 6) # gate5; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SWAP"", [0, 2]) # gate6; >>>; >>> scheduler = Scheduler(""ASAP""); >>> scheduler.schedule(circuit, gates_schedule=True) ; [0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4]; ```; The result list is the cycle indices for each gate.

Energy Efficiency,"r.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-8-Adiabatic-quantum-computing.ipynb#Evolve-the-system-in-time). **Describe the solution you'd like**. Currently when we pass a list of operators such as. ```python; e_ops = [sigmax(), sigmay(), sigmaz()]; result = mesolve(H, rho0, e_ops=e_ops); ```. We will be able to access expectation value of `sigmax()` in `result.expect[0]`, of `sigmay()` in `result.expect[1]` and of course `sigmaz()` in `result.expect[2]`. Why not capture the custom measurement in similar way?. ```; def customMeasurement(tau, psi):; exp_x = expect(sigmax(), psi); exp_y = expect(sigmaz(), psi); exp_z = expect(sigmay(), psi); energy = expect(H, psi); fidelity = np.abs(psi_ref.overlap(psi))**2.; return [exp_x, exp_y, exp_z, energy, fidelity]; ```. Now it is possible to still get expectation values as before, but in addition we can take more custom measurements (in this example energy and fidelity of state) and access them in exactly the same way for the convenience. The only thing user needs to keep track of is order of operators returned from the callback function. So now it is as before but in addition `result.expect[3]` contains energy and `result.expect[4]` contains fidelity and no custom managed global external lists required as it was in the [example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-8-Adiabatic-quantum-computing.ipynb#Evolve-the-system-in-time). **Describe alternatives you've considered**. Alternatively we could establish that custom measurement callback function must return only single value and user would be able to pass mixed list of operators and functions in the `e_ops`. **Additional context**.

Energy Efficiency,"speed-efficiency here, since we expect there to be few data-layer types, but for the calls to happen millions of times. The converters returned by single-key access (e.g. `data.to[data.Dense]`) are constructed individually on a call to `__getitem__`, and are instances of the private type `data.convert._partial_converter`, which internally stores a reference to every ""full"" converter, and dispatches to the correct one when called. The entire `data.to` object and all subsidiary `_converter` and `_partial_converter` objects are `pickle`-able. . #### Efficiency notes. From an efficiency perspective, there is very little benefit to using the key-lookup syntax. Internally, `to(to_type, data)` effectively calls `to[to_type, type(data)]`, so storing the object elides the creation of a single tuple and a dict lookup, but the cost of this is generally less than 500ns. Using the one-argument lookup (e.g. `to[Dense]`) is no more efficient than the general call at all, but can be used in cases where a single callable is required and is more efficient, concise and descriptive than `functools.partial`. ### `data.Dispatcher`: arbitrary multiple-dispatch operations. ```python; >>> import scipy.sparse; >>> import numpy as np; >>> a = data.CSR(scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(np.random.rand(5, 5))); >>> b = data.Dense(np.random.rand(5, 5)); >>> data.add(a, b); Dense(shape=(5, 5), fortran=True); >>> data.add(a, b, out=data.CSR); CSR(shape=(5, 5), nnz=25); ```. ```python; >>> data.add[data.CSR, data.Dense]; <indirect specialisation (CSR, Dense, Dense) of add>; >>> data.add[data.CSR, data.CSR, data.CSR]; <direct specialisation (CSR, CSR, CSR) of add>; ```. #### Basic usage. A `Dispatcher` provides a single mathematical function for _all_ combinations of types known by `data.to`, regardless of whether the particular specialisation has been defined for the input data types. In the first example above, the operator `data.add` currently only knows two specialisations; it knows how to add `CSR + CSR ->",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1338:6724,efficient,efficient,6724,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1338,2,['efficient'],['efficient']

Why not capture the custom measurement in similar way?. ```; def customMeasurement(tau, psi):; exp_x = expect(sigmax(), psi); exp_y = expect(sigmaz(), psi); exp_z = expect(sigmay(), psi); energy = expect(H, psi); fidelity = np.abs(psi_ref.overlap(psi))**2.; return [exp_x, exp_y, exp_z, energy, fidelity]; ```. Now it is possible to still get expectation values as before, but in addition we can take more custom measurements (in this example energy and fidelity of state) and access them in exactly the same way for the convenience. The only thing user needs to keep track of is order of operators returned from the callback function. So now it is as before but in addition `result.expect[3]` contains energy and `result.expect[4]` contains fidelity and no custom managed global external lists required as it was in the [example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-8-Adiabatic-quantum-computing.ipynb#Evolve-the-system-in-time). **Describe alternatives you've considered**. Alternatively we could establish that custom measurement callback function must return only single value and user would be able to pass mixed list of operators and functions in the `e_ops`. **Additional context**. Correct me if I'm wrong, based on the docs and examples I referenced above I have impression there is no better way to do it, but maybe I just missed it?

New specialisations can be added to a pre-existing dispatcher with the `Dispatcher.add_specialisations` method. This is very similar in form to `data.to.add_conversions`; it takes lists of tuples, where the first elements of the tuple define the types in the specialisation, and the last is the specialised function itself. For example, a user might need to multiply `Dense @ CSR` frequently and get a `Dense` output. Currently, there is no direct specialisation for this:; ```python; >>> data.matmul[Dense, CSR, Dense]; <indirect specialisation (Dense, CSR, Dense) of matmul>; ```; The user may then choose to define their own specialisation to handle this case efficiently:; ```python; >>> def matmul_1(left: Dense, right: CSR) -> Dense:; ... # [...]; ... return out; ```; They would give this to `data.matmul` by calling; ```python; >>> data.matmul.add_specialisations([; ... (Dense, CSR, Dense, matmul_1),; ... ]); ```; Now we find; ```python; >>> data.matmul[Dense, CSR, Dense]; <direct specialisation (Dense, CSR, Dense) of matmul>; ```. Additionally, the whole lookup table will be rebuilt taking this new specialisation into account, which means the indirect specialisation `matmul(Dense, CSR) -> CSR` will now make use of this new method, because it has a low conversion weight. #### Adding new types. Now let's say the user wants to add a new `NewDataType` type all across QuTiP. The only action they _must_ take is to tell `data.to` about this new type. Let's say they define it like this:; ```python; >>> class NewDataType:; ... # [...]; >>> def new_from_dense(matrix: data.Dense) -> NewDataType:; ... # [.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1338:9947,efficient,efficiently,9947,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1338,1,['efficient'],['efficiently']

In actuality, through my own reading of the code, **two** random numbers are generated, one for determining if a jump occurs, and another to determine which jump operator was responsible. I suggest the following change (changes highlighted in bold):. > I: Choose a random number **r_1** between zero and one, representing the probability that a quantum jump occurs.; > II: Integrate the Schrödinger equation, using the effective Hamiltonian (1) until a time τ such that the norm of the wave function satisfies ⟨ψ(τ)|ψ(τ)⟩=**r_1**, at which point a jump occurs.; > **III: Choose a random number r_2 between zero and one, used to select which collapse operator was responsible for the jump.**; > IV: The resultant jump projects the system at time τ into one of the renormalized states given by Eq. (3). The corresponding collapse operator Cn is chosen such that n is the smallest integer satisfying:; > (5); > ∑_{i=1}^{n} P_n(τ)≥**r_2**. While this is not an issue in the code, the way the documentation is written at the moment implies that jumps which occur after a short amount of time will primarily be due to collapse operators at the end of the c_ops list, while jumps that happen after a long time will be biased towards collapse operators at the start of the c_ops list. Again, the code is correct, but the documentation does not accurately reflect the algorithm used.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1666:1059,Integrat,Integrate,1059,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1666,1,['Integrat'],['Integrate']

Integrability," A single callback’s expectation value can be any type, but a callback part of a list must return a number as the expectation value. However, I find that passing a callback function in a list e_ops = [my_callback] gives an exception:. > UnboundLocalError: local variable 'rho_t' referenced before assignment. By contrast, I find that passing a callback function directly as e_ops = my_callback does not cause an issue. This is important because I am unable to pass lists of callback functions which, according to the documentation, I should be able to do. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; # Imports ; import qutip as qt; import numpy as np. # System parameters; w = 1; kappa = 0.1; # Size of the Hilbert space; n_max = 10; # Annihilation operator; a = qt.destroy(n_max); # Callback function; my_callback = lambda t, rho_t : rho_t.purity(). # Hamiltonian; H = w * a.dag() * a; # Initial state; psi_0 = ( qt.fock(n_max, 0) + qt.fock(n_max, 1) ) / np.sqrt(2); rho_0 = qt.ket2dm( psi_0); # Integration times; times = np.linspace(0, 2/kappa, 5000); # Collapse operators; c_ops = [np.sqrt(kappa) * a]; # Observables to compute; e_ops = [my_callback]. # Solve the master equation; output = qt.mesolve(H, rho_0, times, c_ops, e_ops); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------; UnboundLocalError Traceback (most recent call last); Cell In[17], line 29; 26 e_ops = [my_callback]; 28 # Solve the master equation; ---> 29 output = qt.mesolve(H, rho_0, times, c_ops, e_ops); 31 plt.plot(output.expect).

Integrability," `adams`, `bdf`, `dop853`, `lsoda`, `vern7`, `vern9`, `diag`. The 4 first are from `scipy.integrate.ode`, the 3 last are ours. `vern7` and `vern9` are runge-kutta methods of 7th and 9th order using [verner's most efficient coefficient](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/) with dense output. `diag` diagonalize a constant system and solve the ODE in that basis.; The minimum that must be given for a new evolver are the `prepare`, `set_state`, `get_state` and `step` methods. `evolver_collection` work as a dispatcher over evolvers. Solvers obtain their evolver instance using `evolver_collection[method, rhs]` with both `method` and `rhs` taken from the options. `evolver_collection` keep a list of description, used options and capacities for each member. It can list the available method matching desired condition. The `rhs` options is not used yet in this PR, it is for future Adaptative Hilbert Space and other modification to the ODE that affect the matrix-state product. #### Other utilities and code added in this PR:. ##### `SolverQEvo`, `Feedback`:; Wrapper around `QobjEvo` that handle feedback arguments and provide `ndarray` interface. ##### qutip/solver/ode/...; Code qutip's evolver, mostly for Verner's method. . ##### progress_bar:; Added a progress bar passed on `tqdm`. `update` no longer need the iteration number. ##### parallel map:; - Added a `loky` based parallel map, hopefully will help windows users.; - Added a `reduce_func` input. Presently the map function is saving all results and the average, std, etc. are only computed at the end. There was no real advantage in saving only average values since all trajectories were in memory at the end of the map. But users expected lower memory usage when asking for only the results average.; - Added `timeout` options to the map, when passed, no error is raised but obtained results are returned. This allow to ask for 30s worth of trajectories instead of fixing a number. **Related issues or PRs**; Build on top of the #1407",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1409:2287,Wrap,Wrapper,2287,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1409,2,"['Wrap', 'interface']","['Wrapper', 'interface']"

When creating a solver options, it read the `method` key and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `bdf`. There is also a generic `Options` class that accept any keys used by integrator or solver and can be converted to any specific solver options:; ```; Options(futur_cupy_ode_specific_options=True) # Will work; Options(not_an_options=True) # Error; # For most solver:; __solve(..., opt=Options()); ```; Once options are associated to a solver, they are frozen:; ```; opt = SeOptions(); solver = SeSolver(..., opt); opt['...'] = ... # Ok, but solver has a copy and is unaffected.; solver.options['...'] = ... # Error; solver.options = opt; ```; This is because changing options without the solver knowing will not take effect. I removed saving / storing options for now. It was mostly used to store openmp threshold, which is not supported.; I also propose to write the stored options as python code when we restore it. (`options = eval(repr(options))`, we may have some issue with circular import if called from `__init__.py`, but we can just write the `repr` of the `dict`.). While it's working fine as is, there are few point to discuss:; - Freezing options associated to solver work fine, but I see 2 alternatives:; - Options know they a",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812:2342,integrat,integrator,2342,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812,1,['integrat'],['integrator']

It also appears to work fine if specifying `c_ops`. **Expected behavior**; My understanding from the documentation regarding time-dependent objects is that the Cubic_Spline representation should work for brmesolve at all argument positions, where appropriate (not just the Hamiltonian and c_ops). For example, at the above URL, we have: <br/>; ""When combining interpolating functions with other Python functions or strings, the interpolating class will automatically pick the appropriate method for calling the class. That is to say that, if for example, you have other time-dependent terms that are given in the string-format, then the cubic spline representation will also be passed in a string-compatible format. In the string-format, the interpolation function is compiled into c-code, and thus is quite fast. This is the default method if no other time-dependent terms are present."" <br/>. If my understanding is incorrect and brmesolve can not accept Cubic_Spline objects, it means it is currently impossible to use this function with non-analytic functions (i.e. only ones we can write out explicitly such as 'exp(-w)'), and seems a major drawback (considering all ot",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1624:1554,depend,dependent,1554,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1624,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Integrability," pull request for a subpackage for non-Markovian solvers, called `nonmarkov`. This idea was mentioned in issue #384. The subpackage now includes two modules, with two quite different non-Markov solvers:. `transfertensormethod`: This module is an implementation of the ""Transfer Tensor Method"" (TTM) introduced by Cerrillo and Cao in [Phys. Rev. Lett 112, 110401 (2014)](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.110401) ([arXiv link](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7743)). TTM is a completely general purpose approach to non-Markovian problems. It takes as input a collection of precomputed dynamical maps for a list of intial ""learning times"", and then tries to extrapolate the non-Markovian dynamics to larger times. `memorycascade`: This module implements the method introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett 115, 060402 (2015)](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.060402) ([arXiv link](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06959)) to integrate the dynamics of open quantum systems coupled to a coherent feedback loop with a time-delay. I decided to refer to this method as the ""memory cascade"" method in qutip. The method essentially maps the non-Markovian problem onto a cascaded chain of identical system, where each system in the chain represents a ""memory"" of a previous version of the system. There is a companion pull request to the qutip-notebooks repo with two new notebooks documenting the usage of these two modules, qutip/qutip-notebooks#21:. examples/example-transfer-tensor-method.ipynb; examples/example-coherent-delayed-feedback.ipynb. Together with code docstrings, these two notebooks should give a good idea of how the modules are to be used. As you will see in the notebooks, the TTM implementation has a user interface that closely mimicks the `mesolve` interface. The solver is called `ttmsolve` and has the following syntax (explained in more detail in the docstring and notebook):. ```; ttmsolve(dynmaps, rho0, times, e_ops=[], learningtimes=None, tensors=",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/405:974,integrat,integrate,974,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/405,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

Integrability," qubits. ; - Next, it computes the longest distance of each node to the start and end nodes. The distance for each dependency arrow is defined by the execution time of the instruction (By default, it is 1 for all gates). This is used as a priority measure in the next step. The gate with a longer distance to the end node and a shorter distance to the start node has higher priority.; - In the last step, it uses a list-schedule algorithm with hardware constraint (e.g. gates using the same qubits) and priority and returns a list of cycles for gates.; - Since it's heuristics, sometimes it does not find the optimal. It offers an option that randomly shuffles the gates (if commuting) and repeats the scheduling a few times to get a better result. For scheduling quantum instructions, of which the runtime of different gates might differ, an additional step is required to compute the scheduled start time of each instruction.; It adds the additional dependency caused by hardware constraint to the graph and recomputes the distance of each node to the start and end node. This distance is then converted to the start time of each instruction. **Example**; ```python; >>> from qutip.qip.circuit import QubitCircuit; >>> from qutip.qip.scheduler import Scheduler; >>> circuit = QubitCircuit(7) ; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SNOT"", 3) # gate0; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 5, 3) # gate1; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 4, 3) # gate2; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 2, 3) # gate3; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 6, 5) # gate4; >>> circuit.add_gate(""CZ"", 2, 6) # gate5; >>> circuit.add_gate(""SWAP"", [0, 2]) # gate6; >>>; >>> scheduler = Scheduler(""ASAP""); >>> scheduler.schedule(circuit, gates_schedule=True) ; [0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4]; ```; The result list is the cycle indices for each gate.

Integrability," the implicit promotion of scalars to operators in addition, taking over 500µs to execute `1 + qutip.qeye(2)`). A lot of this can be completely avoided, however, simply by instantiating the objects using _all_ known information, not relying on inference. In particular, various operations _know_ what the type of their outcome is by a simple lookup table: addition is only defined between operations of the same type and maintains that type, whereas the adjoint has the mapping; ```python; _ADJOINT_TYPE_LOOKUP = {; 'ket': 'bra',; 'bra': 'ket',; 'oper': 'oper',; 'super': 'super',; }; ```; If this information is supplied to `Qobj.__init__` (and the fact that it need not copy data we've created specially for it...), we can hugely slash the overhead of mathematical operations while maintaining their safety. The issues start to come once we look at matrix multiplication and tensor-product spaces. The tensor allows us to construct objects which are a mixture of several different types, and matrix multiplication wants to be able to contract scalar product spaces so that `bra * ket` gives a scalar. ## Problems with dimension handling. The current dimension handling in QuTiP is simple and intuitive until tensor-product structures are considered. At this point, it starts to become more complicated. In particular, the `type` of a `Qobj` is tied to its dimensions, but it becomes difficult to define this once there is tensor product structure. Some of this is because QuTiP allows us to construct objects which do not have a really rigourous mathematical backing to them, such as `I . |g>` - the tensor product of an operator and a ket. QuTiP assigns this a type `'oper'`, though the way it reaches this decision is more like:; 1. is it a ket? [no]; 2. is it a bra? [no]; 3. is it a super-operator? [no]; 4. if here, it must be an operator. Such objects do have a use. Let's say we have a system with two computational qubits and one ancillary qubit, we've performed a calculation on it and ende",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1320:3629,contract,contract,3629,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1320,1,['contract'],['contract']

Following the advice from [this SE post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70240506/why-is-numpy-native-on-m1-max-greatly-slower-than-on-old-intel-i5), I have been trying to install QuTiP in a fresh environment along with the BLAS `accelerate` libraries specific to the Apple M1/M2 chips, in order to get a speedup by using a BLAS library designed for my laptop. In a blank environment, I first ran `conda install numpy ""libblas=*=*accelerate""`, followed by `conda install qutip` and got the following error message: . ```; The following specifications were found to be incompatible with your system:. - feature:/osx-arm64::__osx==13.4=0; - feature:|@/osx-arm64::__osx==13.4=0; - qutip -> numpy[version='>=1.22.4,<2.0a0'] -> __osx[version='>=10.9']. Your installed version is: 13.4; ```; This is odd given that I am using `numpy 1.26.2` and `Mac OS 13.4`, which appear to satisfy the requirements. Instead, I tried using `pip install qutip` which circumvented this error, but results in incorrect behavior as described below. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import numpy as np; import qutip as qt. X = qt.sigmax(); print(np.linalg.eigh(X)[1]); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; `; [[-0.70710678-0.70710678j 0.70710678+1.20710678j]; [ 0.70710678+0.70710678j 0.70710678+0.5j ]]; `; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. `; [[-0.70710678+0.j 0.70710678+0.j]; [ 0.70710678+0.j 0.70710678+0.j]]; `. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.7.3; Numpy Version: 1.26.2; Scipy Version: 1.11.4; Cython Version: None; Matplotlib Version: 3.8.2; Python Version: 3.12.0; Number of CPUs: 10; BLAS Info: Generic; OPENMP Installed: False; INTEL MKL Ext: False; Platform Info: Darwin (arm64); ```. ### Additional Context. I am just comparing the behavior between two environments. The first one correctly diagonalizes the Pauli X operator with a Hadamard, and the second does not.

Integrability,"### Bug Description. Hi,; I've been trying to find the propagator for a time-dependent hamiltonian (with time-dependent collapse operators as well), and have been getting an error saying that the t_list lengths do not match in Qutip 5.0. I also tried to run it without using the collapse operators, but I get the same issue. The same code runs in Qutip 4.7. My goal is to actually find two-time correlation functions of a time-dependent operator (following this paper:https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.023717). What I did do (and what has worked) is decompose the operator into time-independent parts and then use Qutip's correlation_2op_2t. This takes a really long time, since I need to do this for 8 different pairs of operators. I thought of instead finding the propagator and manually finding the correlation using it instead. . From the code below, you can see that mesolve works, but the propagator doesn't. . ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; gamma_1d_1 = Gamma; gamma_1d_2 = Gamma; ## Input pulse; u = input_pulse; mod_u_2 = np.abs(u)**2; integral_u_2 = np.cumsum(mod_u_2) * t[1]; g_u = np.conjugate(u)/np.sqrt(1 - integral_u_2). ## Hamiltonian; emitter_dims = 3; mode_dims = 7; a = 1.1; psi_coherent = coherent(mode_dims, a); ## Mode dims is defined above; w0_1 = 2 * np.pi * 0; alpha_1 = 2 * np.pi * 0.3; w0_2 = 2 * np.pi * 0; alpha_2 = 2 * np.pi * 0.3; gamma_intrinsic = 2 * np.pi * 0.0. sig_1 = tensor(destroy(emitter_dims), qeye(emitter_dims), qeye(mode_dims)); sig_2 = tensor(qeye(emitter_dims), destroy(emitter_dims), qeye(mode_dims)); a_u = tensor(qeye(emitter_dims), qeye(emitter_dims), destroy(mode_dims)).

Integrability,"### Bug Description. I have been running into an issue similar to #806, #1605, and #1623 wherein usage of `mesolve` produces the attached error. It seems as if the majority of the users that reported that error had some suspect input parameters leading to slow convergence in integration; to confirm that this wasn't the case I tried running the [qubit dynamics QuTiP tutorial](https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/examples/qubit-dynamics.ipynb), which _still_ produced the same error.

I also tried `step` for the `MESolver` class and there it works. I think it should also not only output the state but also the measurement output if possible.

In particular when using SciPy 1.8.1 on Linux, fftpack requires `GLIBCXX_3.4.30` but contains a private copy of `GLIBCXX_3.4.29` such that the import fails unless another Python package provides its own implementation of `GLIBCXX_3.4.30` (typically, PyZMQ via `jupyter-client`).

Integrability,"### Bug Description. The `plot_spin_distribution_2d` function allows to project a spin distribution function from the surface of a unit sphere to the unit disk. QuTiP uses `matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor` to perform this task and calculates a meshgrid `X, Y` to plot the function to. Due to some changes in `matplotlib` the current implementation is deprecated and will return errors in a few minor releases. We could quickly fix this by passing `shading='auto'` to the call of `ax.pcolor()` in the [visualization.py](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/82c6704c6fea8a2801492865ad1ef7c1d73c8840/qutip/visualization.py#L1313). However, this raises another UserWarning that the center points are not monotonically sorted. The cleanest way to fix this bug would be to pass the edges of the quadrilaterals to `pcolor()`. But we can not calculate them exactly from the given points in `theta, phi`. Hence, we would need to redesign the interface to this function and to related functions like `plot_spin_distribution_3d` and `spin_q_function`. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import qutip as qt; import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. j = 5; psi = qt.spin_coherent(j, np.random.rand() * np.pi, np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi); rho = qt.ket2dm(psi). theta = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 50); phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 50). Q, THETA, PHI = qt.spin_q_function(psi, theta, phi); fig, ax = qt.plot_spin_distribution_2d(Q, THETA, PHI); plt.show(); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: shading='flat' when X and Y have the same dimensions as C is deprecated since 3.3. Either specify the corners of the quadrilaterals with X and Y, or pass shading='auto', 'nearest' or 'gouraud', or set rcParams['pcolor.shading']. This will become an error two minor releases later.; ax.pcolor(X, Y, P.real, cmap=cmap); ```. ### Expected Behaviour.

Integrability,"### Bug Description. This bug is related to the one explained in #1829. After setting to False the `auto_tidyup` variable in settings, `mesolve` still calls `tidyup` and sets to 0 all values lower than 1e-12. The following code is from a [QuTiP example](https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html#function-based-time-dependence), but removing the collapse operators and multiplying the constant hamiltonian with a very small value (and changing the time vector accordingly). More specifically, I create two different hamiltonians by multiplying `H0` by 1e-12 and 1e-13 respectively. After computing the `mesolve` for both hamiltonians, one can see that in the second case all values have been set to 0. . ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import basis, tensor, qeye, destroy, num, mesolve, settings; import numpy as np. settings.auto_tidyup = False. ustate = basis(3, 0); excited = basis(3, 1); ground = basis(3, 2).

Integrability,"### Bug Description. This issue originates from a [problem in the Help Group](https://groups.google.com/g/qutip/c/F7tOoZzMjto). Calculating the entropy of a density matrix in the Dicke basis leads to -Inf, while the standard calculation with ""entropy_vn"" returns a finite (more logical) result. ; I already tracked down the problem to the calculation of eigenvalues in `dicke_trace_function`. Due to numerical behaviour some eigenvalues have very small negative values, which lead to -Inf entropy. If these values are rounded to zero, the problem disappears. However, I am not sure, which way is the best way to perform this rounding. ; @nathanshammah @quantshah . ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import *; from qutip.piqs import *; import numpy as np; import numpy.random; from scipy.linalg import eig; from scipy.sparse import block_diag.

Integrability,"### Bug Description. When one uses the `floquet_modes` function, the Floquet modes can sometimes come out non-orthogonal. **More info** . I think the problem occurs when some quasienergies are almost degenerate. This could be related to the fact that `floquet_modes` uses `eig` from numpy to diagonalise the propagator U, which in turn does not guarantee orthogonality of the eigenvectors according to the [numpy docs. ](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.eig.html). I tried to come up with a simple example of the problem. I also tested what happens if one changes the precision of the numerical integrator used in the `propagator` function within `floquet modes`, and it does affect the result a lot. The `floquet_modes_mod` function that appears in the code below is exactly `floquet_modes`, only I modified it to also accept Options that are then passed to `propagator` (by the way, is there a smarter way to do this without defining this new function?). . ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import *; import numpy as np; import numpy.linalg as la; from numpy import angle, pi. # create a modified floquet_modes that also accepts Options; def floquet_modes_mod(H, T, args=None, sort=False, U=None, options=None):; """"""; Calculate the initial Floquet modes Phi_alpha(0) for a driven system with; period T.

This _breaks backwards compatibility_ but I imagine it will be ok as I do not expect anyone using these methods.; - [x] Test `_repr_svg_` and `_repr_png_` (there seems to be a bug in `_repr_svg_` #1912).; - [ ] We have `render` and `make_sphere` methods that do _exactly_ the same (`make_sphere` calls `render`) I would vote to deprecate `make_sphere` for QuTiP 5.0.; - [ ] Make the interface consistent among the methods `add_state`, `add_vector`, `add_points`, `add_arc` and `add_line`. (This would address #1105 ); - [ ] Address #1106.; - [ ] Update documentation AND notebooks with changes. These task are planned to be addressed each in a separate PR.

Integrability,"### Describe the Issue!. Calculation of 2-time correlation is understandably slow. There are two things that can improve `_correlation_3op_dm(solver, state0, tlist, taulist, A, B, C)` a bit. 1. In my experience `tlist` is usually chosen so that at `tlist[-1]` all correlations are already gone. Calculate them up to `tlist[-1] + taulist[-1]` is often superfluous. An option can be passed to make last `tau` dependent on `t` to make each subsequent simulation shorter. An example could be something like this (but with more thinking about edge cases):; ```python; _correlation_3op_dm(solver, state0, tlist, taulist, A, B, C, shorten_tau=False):; ...; for t_idx, rho in enumerate(rho_t):; t = tlist[t_idx]; if shorten_tau:; last_tau_index = sum(np.array(taulist) <= t); this_step_taulist = taulist[last_tau_index:]; else:; this_step_taulist = taulist + t; corr_mat[t_idx, :] = solver.run(; C(t) @ rho @ A(t),; this_step_taulist,; e_ops=B; ).expect[0]; progress_bar.update(); progress_bar.finished(); ```; 2.

Integrability,"### Describe the Issue!. Most of the functions in `random_objects.py` take an `N` input and an optional `dims`. Those input are redundant as the size (`N`) can be obtained from the `dims`. However the way they handle this inconsistent:; - Many functions, such as `rand_super`, `rand_dm`, check that the dims matches the size and raise an error if it doesn't.; - `rand_dm_ginibre`, `rand_super_bcsz` just pass the `dims` to `Qobj` without any checks.; - `rand_ket` has a default `N=0` and obtain the size from `dims` when `N` is `0`, but it raise a division per zero error when neither `N` nor `dims` is passed.; - `rand_ket_haar` also tries to obtain the size from `dims` when `N` is `0`, but the default value of `N` is `2`, thus one need to pass `N=0` to use it. `N=0` would fail almost everywhere else. Also some function have a default size, other not: `rand_unitary(N, ...)`, `rand_unitary_haar(N=2, ...)`. The interface of these functions need to be unified. Some options:; - `N` is always needed and `dims` are checked to match.; - A default of `None` is used for `N` and either `N` or `dims` is needed. If both are given, we check that they are compatible. If none are passed, we raise an appropriate error.; - (For `dev.major`) Remove the `dims` parameter and replace `N` with `dimensions`, which act as `N` if an integer is given and `dims` is a list is.

Integrability,"### Describe the Issue!. Not sure if it's a bug, but my qutip result seems unphysical to me: it appears that I got some perpetual oscillation in a dissipative system. What I modeled is a TLS driven by two tones, i.e.:; ```math; H = \frac{\omega_0}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0&1 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1&0 \end{pmatrix} (\Omega_1\cos\omega_1 t + \Omega_2\cos\omega_2 t); ```; In addition, the TLS has a spontaneous emission rate $\Gamma_{21}$. To implement the above system, I used the following code (fully time-dependent, no rotating-wave approximation):; ```python; from numpy import pi, cos, sqrt, linspace; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; from qutip import (; sigmax, sigmaz, fock_dm, mesolve, ; basis, Qobj). omega0 = 100*2*pi # TLS atom level spacing; omega1 = omega0 # 1st tone, resonant with the TLS; omega2 = omega0 -1*2*pi # 2nd tone, detuned from TLS; omegaR1 = 1*2*pi # Rabi freq of 1st tone; omegaR2 = 1*2*pi # Rabi freq of 2nd tone; gamma21 = 1 # spontaneous emission rate. H0 = -sigmaz()/2*omega0; H1, H2 = sigmax()*omegaR1, sigmax()*omegaR2; t = linspace(0,10,501); def H1_coeff(t, args):; return cos(omega1*t); def H2_coeff(t, args):; return cos(omega2*t). H = [H0, [H1, H1_coeff], [H2, H2_coeff]]; c_ops = [Qobj([[0,1],[0,0]])*sqrt(gamma21)]; e_ops = [fock_dm(2,0), fock_dm(2,1)]; psi0 = basis(2,0); result = mesolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, e_ops). plt.plot(t, result.expect[1]); plt.ylim(0,1); ```; One can directly run the above code to produce a perpetual oscillation, which seems unphysical to me. If one suppresses either tone (e.g. by setting `omegaR1` or `omegaR2` to zero), or set the 2nd tone's detuning to zero (i.e. `omega2 = omega0`), one gets the expected damping behavior at large times.; ![Untitled](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/assets/29622362/26578e8e-6665-4852-92a6-d9fe0e888fdb).

Integrability,"### Describe the Issue!. The `filelock` package is required for cython-compiling coefficient functions. However, QuTiP currently does not warn if `filelock` is missing, and the dependency does not seem to be documented anywhere. Instead, QuTiP silently defaults to a `StrFunctionCoefficient`, i.e., to using `eval`. This behavior comes from here:. https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/7892453dd3ae03ce8ac17caffc0457df200a69ec/qutip/core/coefficient.py#L256-L264. The default value of `use_cython` is therefore set to `False` if `filelock` is missing. The result is the following:. ```python; $ git clone git@github.com:qutip/qutip.git .; $ conda create -n qutip-tmp python cython numpy scipy setuptools packaging wheel pytest ipython matplotlib; $ conda activate qutip-tmp; $ python setup.py install; $ cd ~; $ ipython; 	import qutip; 	coeff = qutip.coefficient(""sin(t)""); 	type(coeff); 	> qutip.core.cy.coefficient.StrFunctionCoefficient; 	exit(); ```. Since cython is installed and there was no warning or error, I think it would be reasonable for the user to assume that the coefficient would be compiled, but it is not.

I have a simple hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator with resonant frequency of 5 GHz. If I evolve the initial state (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) under the system hamiltonian (no time dependence) I would expect the expectation values of the |0> and |1> to stay at 0.5. (Amplitudes of eigenstates should not change). . However, when I plot the expectation values, I see a splitting of overtime, where the expectation value of |0> grows linear over time and |1> shrinks linearly with time. Looking through the forums, I figured it was an issue with the ode solver but playing around with the options (max_steps, rtol, atol, etc.) only changes the rate at which the expectation value drops (or grows); it doesn't get rid of the splitting. Any insight into this problem would be of great help :).

Integrability,"### Problem Description. Currently, there is no great support for working with direct product spaces in qutip. For that reason, both the HEOM solver and qutip-qoc contain code manipulating data layer matrices directly. Most commonly, direct product spaces arise because of coupled differential equations. For example, we might have two states $|\psi\rangle$ and $|\psi'\rangle$ satisfying. $$ \partial_t \begin{pmatrix} |\psi\rangle \\\\ |\psi'\rangle \end{pmatrix} = -i \begin{pmatrix} H & 0 \\\\ H' & H \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} |\psi\rangle \\\\ |\psi'\rangle \end{pmatrix} $$. then the object $( |\psi\rangle, |\psi'\rangle )$ is a direct product. Some applications:; * HEOM is a coupled differential equation for the state $\rho$ of an open system, and a number of auxiliary density operators $\rho_{\mathbf n}$.; * The goat algorithm in qutip-qoc works by integrating coupled Schroedinger equations for two ore more unitary operators.; * In full counting statistics, we can find the first n derivatives of a moment-generating function by solving coupled Lindblad equations for n+1 operators.; * A direct product state could potentially be used instead of a tensor product state in cases where we know that two systems are only coupled classically and there will never be any coherences between them. ### Proposed Solution. I think that we would need the following:; * A way to construct objects such as $( |\psi\rangle, |\psi'\rangle )$ and the matrix in the equation above from their constituents.; * A way to describe the dimensions of these objects.; * A way to extract the constituents from these objects at the end of the calculation.; * The differential equations mentioned in the applications above should be solvable with `sesolve` and/or `mesolve`.; * Note that in the first three applications, we actually have direct products of operator spaces (which might make things complicated?). ### Alternate Solutions.

Integrability,"### Problem Description. From version 5.0, the subpackage `qutip.qip` will be removed and replaced by a separate package `qutip-qip`. To make it easier for others to migrate from 4.7 to 5.0, we can set up `qutip-qip` as an optional plug-in for qutip, so that if `qutip-qip` is installed, the `qutip.qip` name space can be used as before. ### Expected behaviour; - If only `qutip` is installed, importing `qutip.qip` will raise an `ImportError` with instruction for installing `qutip_qip`.; - If `qutip-qip` is installed, using `qutip.qip` will automatically use the `qutip_qip` namespace, with no difference in the user interface.; - Update `setup.cfg` so that `pip install qutip[qip]` will automatically install `qutip_qip`. E.g. the following should work if `qutip`-5.0 and `qutip-qip` are both installed; ```python; # The following should be the same; from qutip.qip.circuit import QubitCircuit; from qutip_qip.circuit import QubitCircuit; ```. ### Proposed Solution.

Integrability,"### Problem Description. I'm wondering if it's possible to use `mesolve` to find the evolution of an arbitrary operator in the Heisenberg picture, where the operators carry all of the time dependence, and thus evolve according to the _adjoint_ Lindblad equation. For some operator $O$, the coherent part is $+i [H,O]$ and the dissipator for a collapse operator $L$ is $L^\dagger O L - \frac{1}{2} L^\dagger L O - \frac{1}{2} O L^\dagger L $.; In particular, I was wondering if there is a way to ""hack"" mesolve to do this without any modification, such as using $-O$ instead of $O$ so that it matches the coherent Schrodinger picture evolution $-i [H,O]$ that `mesolve` does, but I'm not sure about the dissipator. Using $L^\dagger$ instead of $L$ would also change the anticommutator term, which actually shouldn't change between the two pictures. Is there a sneaky way of making this work without too much modification? Otherwise, perhaps this would be a good feature to add?. ### Proposed Solution. Instructions on how to use `mesolve` to solve for the time evolution of an operator in the Heisenberg (not Schrodinger) picture, or an extension of `mesolve` to allow for this, possibly through an option in the function call like `picture=True` which defaults to Schrodinger but if False uses the Heisenberg picture. ### Alternate Solutions. _No response_. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2160:189,depend,dependence,189,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2160,1,['depend'],['dependence']

Integrability,"### Problem Description. String based coefficients with time-dependent Hamiltonians in qutip 4.7 causes compiled files (.so, .o, .cpp files) to be stored into a hidden folder `.pyxbld` in the user's home directory. This is a problem because, when using qutip on an HPC cluster (the cluster uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8), I submit multiple qutip simulation jobs to the cluster, each of which generating cached file in my home directory and using up my storage. Qutip is not aware of these files and they are never deleted. The root cause of the problem is in the top level __init__.py, on line 72, `_pyxbuilder.install()`, which calls the install() function in qutip.cy.pyxbuilder, on line 47:. ```; def install():; """"""Install the pyximport interface.""""""; return pyximport.install(setup_args={'include_dirs': [np.get_include()]}); ```; Since the `build_dir` keyword argument is not supplied to `pyximport.install`, the default path is used. ### Proposed Solution. Supply an option in `qutip.settings`, or `qutiprc`, or `qutip.solver.Options` to specify a custom path for the compiled files.

Integrability,"### Problem Description. There are a few issues with graphic capacities in Qutip. 1. Most are not tested. Only Bloch.py has some tests associated. While testing graphs is not evident, matplotlib has testing functions to compare graphs etc. and just running it to ensure that no errors are raised would be a nice start. Here are some files and their coverage:; - tomography.py 50%; - visualization.py 8%; - distribution.py 23%; - bloch.py 55%; - bloch3d.py 8%. 2. The interface is not uniform. Most functions take 'fig' and 'ax', but `hilton` only takes 'ax' but no 'fig'. Maybe one third of the function in visualization accepts 'title' and half a 'figsize'. The order of these options is also inconsistent, 'fig', 'ax' can be the first parameters or the last... As seen in #1573, some want more control so `matrix_histogram` accepts `options`. I am all for more control, but being available for only one function feels wrong. On the bloch side, there is a mismatch between `add_vectors`, `add_points`, which takes `color` and `alpha` as input, and `add_arc`, `add_line` which takes `**kwargs`. 3. The colorblind mode should works everywhere, but presently only `hilton` support it. ### Proposed Solution. So for v5 release, the interface of all these should be clean and uniform, with proper tests. . ### Alternate Solutions. _No response_. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1910:467,interface,interface,467,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1910,2,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"**Checklist**; This rewrite the stochastic solver to use the class interface. - `smesolve`, `ssesolve` have been rewritten to match other solver with matching class interface `SMESolver`, `SSESolver`. The main change is that the options used to be passed as keywords (`**kwargs`) and are now passed as an options dict.; - `m_ops` and `dW_factors` are properties of the classes, but not available to overwrite through the function interface. ; - The multiples end condition (`target_tol`, `timeout`) are added.; - The `solver` keyword is now `method` options, as it is in other solver.; - The method that was referring the homodyne or heterodyne detection is now the `heterodyne` keyword. ie before `method=""heterodyne""` now `heterodyne=True`.; - The default integration method is now `rouchon`, instead of `taylor1.5`. ie the method coming from a physic paper and not a mathematics textbook. . - The stochastic integration methods have been spitted in smaller chunk instead of the huge classes in _stochastic.pyx. I kept most methods, only skipping the taylor order 2.0 method. The python interface is kept very similar to the `Integrator` as `SIntegrator`, the main difference being that `set_state` and `get_state` use an extra random number generator with the time and state. The integration methods are usually 5%~10% slower than they where for medium size problems (shape ~100). Most method are computed the same way as before, but the rouchon method no longer use super operator, but keep the density matrix as a matrix and not an oper-ket. - The derivative computation for used by the integration method has also been split into multiple functions and made only available for `smesolve`. For there methods to be valid, the each diffusion contribution must commute. For `smesolve`, this means that each `sc_ops` must commute, as documented. For `ssesolve`, each `sc_ops` must not only commute, but also commute with other `sc_ops`'s adjoint, this last part being missing from v4's documentation.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2131:67,interface,interface,67,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2131,5,"['integrat', 'interface']","['integration', 'interface']"
Integrability,"**Describe the bug**; As described in the documentation (e.g https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html#time-interp) it is possible to replace string time-dependent functions (e.g. for a Hamiltonian) using Cubic_Spline. This is the case if one has data describing the time-dependent object which is not easy to write analytically. In `brmesolve` the only option is to provide time-dependent functions as strings (or Cubic_Spline). This works fine for the Hamiltonian, but the `a_ops` fail a check in cy/brcodegen.py when using a Cubic_Spline type. **To Reproduce**; ```python; import qutip as qt; import numpy as np. x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1); decay = np.exp(-x); decay_spline = qt.Cubic_Spline(x[0], x[-1], decay). sol1 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-t)""]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-w)""]]) # works fine; sol2 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-w)""]]) # works fine; sol3 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-t)""]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]]) # error; sol4 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]]) # error; ```. On the cases it gives an error (sol3, sol4), it is `Exception: Invalid a_td_term.` from br_codegen.py (`aop_td_funcs()`).; Note that the Cubic_Spline representation works perfectly fine for the Hamiltonian part (e.g. sol2). It also appears to work fine if specifying `c_ops`. **Expected behavior**; My understanding from the documentation regarding time-dependent objects is that the Cubic_Spline representation should work for brmesolve at all argument positions, where appropriate (not just the Hamiltonian and c_ops). For example, at the above URL, we have: <br/>; ""When combining interpolating functions with other Python functions or strings, the interpolating class will automatically pick the appropriate method for calling the class.

Integrability,"**Describe the bug**; I want to compute the 2op_2t correlation function for a problem that I have. The documentation says that the steady state will be computed if I pass `state0=None`. In the source code, whenever this is passed, the time list `tlist` gets overridden to `[0]`. No warnings or messages are shown to the user that whatever previous `tlist` the user passed is being overridden. I think either a warning or the possibility that the list is not overridden should be the default behaviour. **To Reproduce**; Please provide a minimal working example. For instance:. ```python; from qutip import *; from qutip.steadystate import steadystate; from qutip.correlation import correlation_2op_2t; import numpy as np.

Integrability,"**Description**. Add capacity to merge stochastic solver results. While adding it found a few bugs/ issues with the merge and weight that I fixed:. - When one result had trajectories and the other did not, but both stored the states, the merged result had no states.; - When merging 2 results with default ratio, that ratio would depend on whether the `improved_sampling` options was used.; - When the no-jump probability was 1, the total weight as measured by `sum(res.runs_weight)` would not be one.; - A no-jump probability over 1 by numerical error would break the evolution.; - Error in the weight application in the `_target_tolerance_end`. The last 3 are easy fix. For the default weight when merging, using the `num_trajectories` instead of `_num_rel_trajectories` is enough.; But I tried the approach of not counting the no-jumb evolution as a trajectory. This has many small advantages:; - All `result.trajectories` are the same, the first few are not special. ; - All seeds are used.; - No confusing on the merging ratio.; - Keeping the absolute and relative weight apart simply part of the merging.; - The progress bar run up to the expected number. I also tired to simplify the weight management by accumulating per data then split by abs, rel. This makes it easier to add averaged data (nmmc's trace). Seeing the change in lines number in `multitrajresults.py` it seems to be about the same. I am also thinking of removing the weight from trajectories and making it only a multitraj property:; `multitraj.add((seed, traj, rel_weight))`; `multitraj.add_deterministic(traj, abs_weight)`. The marginal / trace would stay in the trajectory, but not merging those with weight feel simpler to me. @pmenczel ; This PR larger than I expected, do you want me to break it into smaller ones for review or are you fine like this.; What do you think about splitting the no-jump / abs traj from the normal ones?; What about having the weights in the `add` instead of the trajectories?",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2455:330,depend,depend,330,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2455,1,['depend'],['depend']

The implementation in Python was slow just because there is a lot of Python looping and arithmetic when the number of operators being combined becomes large. `_from_csr_blocks` is a private constructor for now.

Integrability,"**Description**. Currently QuTiP's build requirements specify `numpy>=1.16.6<1.20` but this was really a guess at the correct numpy to build with and importantly, is the wrong guess for Python 3.10 which is only supported by numpy 1.20 and later. Instead we now depend on the `oldest-supported-numpy` package, which is maintained by the numpy and SciPy folk and should always provide the correct version of numpy to build with on a given platform. A previous version of this PR #1735 attempted to simultaneously add support for Python 3.10, but that turned out to be tricky because conda did not yet provide a pre-compiled SciPy for Python 3.10.

Integrability,"**Description**. Introduces weights for the trajectories of trajectory solvers. These weights enter all trajectory averages. This concept is a generalization of two things that are already in qutip:; * The influence martingale in `nm_mcsolve` is simply a time-dependent weight from this point of view; * The ""improved sampling"" option for `mcsolve` weights the no-jump trajectory with its exact probability, and then only samples from the ensemble of trajectories with at least one jump. Currently, these two things cannot be combined: ""improved sampling"" does not work for `nm_mcsolve`. With these changes, it would work.; In the future, there might be at least one more application for weighted trajectories:; * For mixed initial states in `mcsolve`, it might be useful to allow sampling of initial states with frequencies or probabilities that are different from their true prefactor in the initial state. The ratio between the sampling frequencies and true prefactors would be weights on the trajectories. This also fixes some things in merging `McResult`s and `NmmcResult`s, and perhaps fixes the target tolerance computation for the ""improved sampling"" option. **Implementation**. A difficulty in the implementation is that the weights depend on the total number of trajectories in different ways. For example, the no-jump trajectory has a fixed weight that never changes, but all other trajectories come with prefactors $(1-p_0) / (N-1)$ where $p_0$ is the probability of the no-jump trajectory, and $N$ the total number of trajectories (including the one no-jump trajectory). For this reason, I separate weights into *absolute weights* (like $p_0$) and *relative weights* (like the others). The average is performed as follows:. $$ \bar\rho = \sum_{T: \text{abs}} w_a(T) w_r(T) \rho(T) + \frac{1}{N_{\text{rel}}} \sum _{T: \text{rel}} w_r(T) \rho(T) $$. where the first sum is over all trajectories T that have absolute weights, and the second sum over all other trajectories.

Integrability,"**Description**; A gate (pulse) scheduler for quantum circuits (instructions). It schedules a `QubitCircuit` or a list of instructions to reduce the total execution time by exciting them parallelly. It uses heuristic methods mainly from https://doi.org/10.1117/12.666419. The scheduler aims at pulse schedule and therefore does not consider merging gates to reduce the gates number. It assumes that the input circuit is optimized at the gate level (e.g. has a minimal number of CNOT gates) and matches the hardware topology. The scheduler includes two methods, ""ASAP"", as soon as possible, and ""ALAP"", as late as possible. The later is commonly used in quantum computation because of the finite lifetime of qubits. **Methods**. - The scheduler first generates a quantum gates dependency graph, containing information about which gates have to be executed before some other gates because they do not commute. The graph preserves the mobility of the gates, i.e. commuting gates are not dependent on each other, even if they use the same qubits. ; - Next, it computes the longest distance of each node to the start and end nodes. The distance for each dependency arrow is defined by the execution time of the instruction (By default, it is 1 for all gates). This is used as a priority measure in the next step. The gate with a longer distance to the end node and a shorter distance to the start node has higher priority.; - In the last step, it uses a list-schedule algorithm with hardware constraint (e.g. gates using the same qubits) and priority and returns a list of cycles for gates.; - Since it's heuristics, sometimes it does not find the optimal. It offers an option that randomly shuffles the gates (if commuting) and repeats the scheduling a few times to get a better result. For scheduling quantum instructions, of which the runtime of different gates might differ, an additional step is required to compute the scheduled start time of each instruction.; It adds the additional dependency caus",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1273:776,depend,dependency,776,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1273,2,['depend'],"['dependency', 'dependent']"

Since an integrator can be used without knowing the length of the evolution, some changes where as to when the krylov matrices are recomputed. Instead of choosing the step length so the error of the whole evolution is under `atol`, it is chosen so each steps stays under it and an options is available to compute it only once or at each step. A default `krylov_dim` was needed for the integrator, so I set it the scale as the square root of the size of the system. This is not ideal, but seems to work fine.

Integrability,"**Description**; Add a `Solver` class for better task distribution in `sesolve` and `mesolve`. `sesolve`, `mesolve`, etc. are presently mostly independent: each create their time dependant system, the function to integrator with scipy's ode solver, loop over the `tlist` and store results. With this PR, the `[se/me]solve` functions will reuse most of the code and be more modular.; We already have a `Result` class to manage e_ops and store result, `Integrator` to solve the ode system. `QobjEvo` can support any time-dependant format we support. This PR introduce a new class `Solver` to join all these. Basis usage looks like:; ```; rhs = QobjEvo(...); solver = Solver(rhs, options=opt); result = solver.run(psi, tlist, e_ops=e_ops); result.expect; ```. It can also do step evolution:; ```; rhs = QobjEvo(...); solver = Solver(rhs, options=opt); solver.start(psi, t0); psi_t1 = solver.step(t1); psi_t2 = solver.step(t2, args=new_args) # Can be inefficient depending on integrator.; psi_t3 = solver.step(t3, options=new_opt) # Inefficient but supported.; ```; When stepping, the output is always the state as `Qobj`.

Integrability,"**Description**; Add the capacity of stochastic solver to run from know noise or measurements.; In the lab, the measurement can be obtained, but that measurements is a mix of and expectation values and noise. The stochastic solver can be used to split these components to study the system. The new method for this is `SMESolver.run_from_experiment`. It works similarly to `run` of deterministic solver: it compute a single trajectory. It can take either `dW` or `measurement` as the noise input. (`dW` is the default). `dW` input is available with every integration method, but measurement input is limited to `euler`, `milstein`, `pred_corr`, `platen`. The measurement is `expect(m_ops, state_t) + dW / dt`. For `run_from_experiment` it has no choice but to take `state_t` at the start of the interval, but for the result for `smesovle`, it was taken at the end of the interval. I updated the `store_measurement` options to allow the user the choose where it is taken between `start`, `end` and `middle`. When `start` is used, the `run`'s result's measurement can be feed back to `run_from_experiment` to recompute the same trajectory. (The theory is the integral of the expectation value over the interval.). Another change in this PR is to keep the dW in the wiener and result class.

Integrability,"**Description**; Added one new public function `local_multiply_dense` in a new file qutip/qip/operations/local_operations.py, and tests at tests/test_local_operations.py. This can dramatically improve the speed for performing certain matrix multiplications, taking advantage the new Dense data layer. In particular, for cases where the density matrix/state has few zero's, and we want to multiply a local operator (e.g. one acting on only a small subset of the full system), this routine is expected to be faster. **What is does**; Using some standard tools, such as NumPy's einsum one can compute the local matrix operation directly, i.e. applying a one or two-local gate on a Qobj of many qubits. This is only really useful if one uses the Dense data layer, since otherwise there are conversion overheads which kill any speed-up (at the end of the day, we need NumPy arrays). The code has two 'backends', one using einsum as mentioned, and another using what I call a 'vectorization' approach (where the density matrix or vector is reshaped to a vector over the target qubits). Note: It will work on qudits in general (does not have to be qubits). **Performance**; I find, in systems where the state is dense (few zeros), one can get a speed-up of between 2 and up to around 10x faster (depends on the size and system etc). Of course, sometimes using the standard built in sparse routines are faster, so it really depends what one is doing. Attached is a wall-clock time comparison between the standard sparse way for a 1-local multiplication on a vector (using `gate_expand_1toN`), and the added code (dense local). N being the number of qubits. Here I made things as hard as possible for the sparse routine (all elements non-zero), so this is probably the limit of the speed-up. ![1_local_vector_adaptive_backend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47875526/101932409-91f44900-3b8f-11eb-8b5b-7a00dabec2e4.png). **Other notes**; 1.

Integrability,"**Description**; Make and upgrade a few class commonly used by solvers. All solver's core is a loop that progress between time in `tlist` and take a snapshot of the state at these time. The work of this loop have been moved to 2 classes: `Result` and `Evolver`. . `Result` was previously just a container of the solver output. It now does the snapshot: compute the expectation values, save the state, compute trajectories average, etc. . `Evolver` is qutip's ODE solver interface: the states are `Data` object and the function is `QovjEvo`(or `QobjEvoFunc`). There are multiple type of evolver wrapping different scipy's ode solver and a few of our own. The wrapper around scipy's zvode that was previously used in qutip's is `EvolverScipyZvode`, but we now have our own cython solver based on [Verner's method](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/) that accept any Data type as state. Different evolver based on different ODE method are interchangeable and have their dispatcher `evolver_collection`, allowing to easily add new methods. . With this, time-dependent system are managed by `QobjEvo`, ODE by `Evolver`, therefore the solvers can concentrate more closely on the physic. **Evolver:**; Method supported with this PR: `adams`, `bdf`, `dop853`, `lsoda`, `vern7`, `vern9`, `diag`. The 4 first are from `scipy.integrate.ode`, the 3 last are ours. `vern7` and `vern9` are runge-kutta methods of 7th and 9th order using [verner's most efficient coefficient](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/) with dense output. `diag` diagonalize a constant system and solve the ODE in that basis.; The minimum that must be given for a new evolver are the `prepare`, `set_state`, `get_state` and `step` methods. `evolver_collection` work as a dispatcher over evolvers.

Integrability,"**Description**; Speed up and simplify `state_number_enumerate`, `state_number_index`, `state_index_number`, `state_number_qobj`, and `enr_state_dictionaries`. I've changed quite a few functions in states.py, but all the changes are small. It seemed easier to combine this into a single pull request instead of splitting it up into many smaller ones (but this could be done). The changes in more detail:; - `state_number_enumerate` and `state_index_number` now always return tuples. Before, `state_number_enumerate` returned arrays for `excitations is None` and tuples otherwise, and `state_index_number` returned a list. For `excitations is None`, I realized that a simple call to `itertools.product` is enough, and is about 20x faster for a (relatively big) test case. It would be trivial to keep returning arrays instead of tuples here as before, but this slows the code down (quite significantly, in fact) and, in any case, returning arrays or tuples depending on whether `excitations` is set seems like an inconsistent interface, so I decided to make it consistent (and faster). I checked that the uses in the code base should not be affected. The algorithm used when the number of excitations is restricted is a slightly more elegant version of the one from my previous pull request (#1594), and is faster by another factor of 5 or more for the ""big"" test cases I looked at. ~~It is still recursive, but quite fast, and I did not find an elegant non-recursive algorithm.~~ I came up with an even faster non-recursive algorithm after all. It's arguably a bit less elegant, but I think still readable, and another 50% or so faster than the previous one (see the second commit below).; - `enr_state_dictionaries` now returns a dictionary and a list instead of two dictionaries. Before, `idx2state` was a dictionary with integer keys from 0 to nstates-1, which behaves essentially like a list. However, before Python 3.7, iteration order was not guaranteed to be insertion order (i.e., iterating ove",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1604:955,depend,depending,955,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1604,2,"['depend', 'interface']","['depending', 'interface']"

Integrability,"**Description**; The current steadystate solver requires a time-independent Hamiltonian. This is obvious because a time-dependent Hamiltonian cannot have a steadystate.; However, if the Hamiltonian can be decomposed in a time-independent part H_0 and a periodic time-dependent part cos(w t) * H_i, the system reaches a stroboscopic steadystate. If the perturbation is small, this stroboscopic steadystate fluctuates so slightly that it can be considered as a real steadystate.

Integrability,"**Description**; `Options` and `SolverOptions` are objects that list all available options and pass them a solver. However in v5, with the choice of integrators, the supported options are not fixed. Most integration methods support `""atol""`, but `order` or `beta`, etc. are specific to some methods. SInce new integrators could be added by project such as qutip-cupy, `Options` can no longer be the place to list all supported options. It become little more that a dict. So I propose deprecating it. The documentation of `sesolve`, `mesolve`, etc. now list the options used by the solver and most common ode options and link the the integrator documentation. The class interface has the options property which document the options used by the solver and the integrators have the same.

Integrability,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**. It is very convenient to take measurements in QuTip by passing list of observables in the `e_ops` argument of `mesolve` or `sesolve`, a list of expectation values at each time step of all those operators will be provided in returned `qutip.Result` object. It becomes much less elegant once we implement custom measurements and pass a callback function (for example to work with time-dependent Hamiltonians etc). According to the [documentation](http://qutip.org/docs/4.1/apidoc/functions.html#module-qutip.mesolve). > An instance of the class qutip.Result, which contains either an array result.expect of expectation values for the times specified by tlist, (...), or nothing if a callback function was given in place of operators for which to calculate the expectation values. So to work with callback function, we need to manage the storage by ourselves, for example by defining a global list, as it is done in [this example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-8-Adiabatic-quantum-computing.ipynb#Evolve-the-system-in-time). **Describe the solution you'd like**. Currently when we pass a list of operators such as. ```python; e_ops = [sigmax(), sigmay(), sigmaz()]; result = mesolve(H, rho0, e_ops=e_ops); ```. We will be able to access expectation value of `sigmax()` in `result.expect[0]`, of `sigmay()` in `result.expect[1]` and of course `sigmaz()` in `result.expect[2]`. Why not capture the custom measurement in similar way?. ```; def customMeasurement(tau, psi):; exp_x = expect(sigmax(), psi); exp_y = expect(sigmaz(), psi); exp_z = expect(sigmay(), psi); energy = expect(H, psi); fidelity = np.abs(psi_ref.overlap(psi))**2.; return [exp_x, exp_y, exp_z, energy, fidelity]; ```.

Integrability,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**; In the device simulator of QuTiP (`qutip.qip.device`), a quantum computing device is characterized by the class `Processor` and its subclasses. It contains information about the available control pulses. In addition, a compiler is used to compile a set of universal quantum gates (e.g. RX, RY and ISWAP) into the corresponding control pulses. Together, they can automatically compiler an arbitrary quantum circuit into control pulses, create the time-dependent Hamiltonian representation and run the simulation using QuTiP solvers. However, in the current version, this compilation is done for each gate sequentially. At each time step, there is only one control pulse active. In practice, it is inefficient because usually several gates can be performed parallelly (e.g. X gate on qubit 0 and qubit 1). To make the compilation more practical, it is necessary to introduce a scheduler that schedules the control pulses. A similar example is https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/pulse.html#schedules. **Describe the solution you'd like**; There is existing research (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00023.pdf) on gate-level scheduling. It studies which gates can be performed at the same time. In the most general case, however, gate-level scheduling is not enough, since different gates often have different runtime (.e.g. CNOT usually takes longer time than X gate). Despite the difference, pulse-level scheduling can be done in a similar way as gate-level scheduling by generating a graph (see the reference above). The difference is that each pulse will have its own duration. The possible implementation in `qutip.qip` could be in two steps:; - Modernize the current compiler and create an `Instruction` class representing each compiled control instruction (pulse, qubit index, amplitude, duration).; - Implement the scheduling algorithm similar as in the above reference.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1243:519,depend,dependent,519,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1243,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Integrability,"**Summary**; This change adds `mpi_pmap` to qutip.parallel. It is an analogue of `parallel_map` that can run parallel computations on multiple CPUs (e.g., multiple supercomputer nodes) at the same time by using the MPI (message passing interface) API. We make use of the mpi4py module and its MPIPoolExecutor class. That is, parallel_map and mpi_pmap are basically the same, except that the `multiprocessing.ProcessPoolExecutor` gets replaced by the `mpi4py.MPIPoolExecutor`, and we allow users to provide arbitrary keyword arguments to be passed on to the MPIPoolExecutor. **Detailed list of changes**; * Added `mpi_pmap`. Extracted the common functionality of parallel_map, loky_pmap and mpi_pmap into a `_generic_pmap` function. The behavior of parallel_map and loky_pmap should be unchanged (except for a tiny change in loky_pmap regarding the order in which reduce_func is called).; * Added a section showcasing QuTiP's MPI capabilities in the tutorial notebook ""Non-Markovian Monte Carlo Solver"", see [PR 78](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-tutorials/pull/78) in qutip-tutorials.; * Added `mpi_options` to the options of MultiTrajSolver and all its subclasses. This option only takes effect if the 'map' option is set to 'mpi', in which case the mpi_options are added to the map_kwargs.; * For MultiTrajSolver, all its subclasses and corresponding XXsolve functions, I double-checked that the descriptions of the options in the docstrings correspond to the `solver_options`. That is, I did not touch the solver options except for adding 'mpi_options', but I edited the docstrings in some places in order to reflect the actually available solver options.; * While creating the new section in the tutorial notebook, I noticed some bugs in `MultiTrajResult#__add__` and fixed them.; * Added tests. Tests are skipped if the mpi4py module is not available (like with loky_pmap and the loky module). **Todo**; - [X] Include the changelog in a file named: `doc/changes/<PR number>.<type>` 'type' can be ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296:220,message,message,220,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296,2,"['interface', 'message']","['interface', 'message']"

Integrability,", which is a very sizable chunk of the entire test suite. We can concentrate on rewriting the longest tests to make sure we're still testing all the behaviour, without excessively long runtimes. I've been fairly conservative with the number of tests I set in motion. On the free GitHub plan we can have 20 concurrent VMs running across the whole QuTiP organisation, which I think spreads across all repositories and all test runs. With no Windows tests currently active this is 6 test runs plus the documentation build. If we want more, we could consider spending some money ($4/user/month) to convert into a Teams account which gets us 60 concurrent VMs, but I don't see any need to do this right now. All the test runners now start up almost instantly, which really solves a lot of the slowdown we were getting on Travis. The actual speeds of the Linux VMs seem to be similar to what we had on Travis - the walltimes are slightly longer because I now install _all_ optional dependencies in most runners, so slightly more gets tested than before. Currently there's also a slowdown on several machines because `cvxpy` doesn't build many wheels, and none at all for Linux, on `pip`. I install all our dependencies except BLAS/LAPACK stuff that way, since it's easiest to read out the dependencies like that. We can potentially save some build time (maybe ~3 minutes?) if we install that from conda-forge instead. I also fixed a minor point of how environment variables are read within `setup.py` (in the end I didn't actually use the new behaviour in the action, but I did during testing), and added a warning filter on dnorm tests to account for a deprecated Numpy alias being used within `cvxpy` code.

More specifically, I create two different hamiltonians by multiplying `H0` by 1e-12 and 1e-13 respectively. After computing the `mesolve` for both hamiltonians, one can see that in the second case all values have been set to 0. . ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import basis, tensor, qeye, destroy, num, mesolve, settings; import numpy as np. settings.auto_tidyup = False. ustate = basis(3, 0); excited = basis(3, 1); ground = basis(3, 2).

Integrability,". There were several issues with this function, which I have attempted to rectify as described below. Also its my first pull request (instead of asking anubhav or alex to help), so if I messed it up let me know. 1) The default method, a direct solution using sparse matrices, would fail with an ""exactly singular"" error on small examples (like the well studied single-resonant level or double quantum dot examples). The other sparse methods also suffered from the same issue, as did the 'direct' method for dense solutions. The latter, the dense matrices solver, I have fixed by capturing the error using lstsq() if np.linalg.solve() fails. For the sparse cases there seems to no equivalent fix. One can solve the issue by adding a small finite frequency to the definition of the shot noise. However, this seems like a bit of a bodge, and could cause issues if this small frequency is of the order of some system frequencies. So I have changed the default behavior to use the dense solvers, and added a description of the sparse matrix issues in the function description and in an example notebook I will upload to the example notebooks github. . Maybe someone can suggest a better fix?. 2) There was, in addition, an error in the definition of the shot noise formula in the default sparse matrix direct solution. In addition, the dense methods which used pinv() were also incorrectly defined (they were missing pre and post- multiplication by the 'Q' operator), and would thus give different results from the direct solutions. These issues have been fixed, and everything now fits expected analytical results (see example notebook). 3) I have added a frequency dependence via a list of possible frequencies at which to evaluate the shot noise. 4) I removed the option of passing a pseudo-inverse to the function directly, and changed various other interface things. I am not sure if everything conforms to PEP8 etc. Edit: the example notebook is here https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks/pull/35",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/528:1796,depend,dependence,1796,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/528,2,"['depend', 'interface']","['dependence', 'interface']"

Integrability,".4,<2.0a0'] -> __osx[version='>=10.9']. Your installed version is: 13.4; ```; This is odd given that I am using `numpy 1.26.2` and `Mac OS 13.4`, which appear to satisfy the requirements. Instead, I tried using `pip install qutip` which circumvented this error, but results in incorrect behavior as described below. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import numpy as np; import qutip as qt. X = qt.sigmax(); print(np.linalg.eigh(X)[1]); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; `; [[-0.70710678-0.70710678j 0.70710678+1.20710678j]; [ 0.70710678+0.70710678j 0.70710678+0.5j ]]; `; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. `; [[-0.70710678+0.j 0.70710678+0.j]; [ 0.70710678+0.j 0.70710678+0.j]]; `. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.7.3; Numpy Version: 1.26.2; Scipy Version: 1.11.4; Cython Version: None; Matplotlib Version: 3.8.2; Python Version: 3.12.0; Number of CPUs: 10; BLAS Info: Generic; OPENMP Installed: False; INTEL MKL Ext: False; Platform Info: Darwin (arm64); ```. ### Additional Context. I am just comparing the behavior between two environments. The first one correctly diagonalizes the Pauli X operator with a Hadamard, and the second does not. The ""correct"" environment uses a standard numpy 1.26.2 install, with qutip installed with conda. The ""incorrect"" environment uses the `accelerate` numpy install, and qutip installed with pip. Each environment has the same `qutip.about()` return string. In reality, my use case is more complex than this, but I managed to boil down the error to faulty matrix diagonlization. I also want to add that I do indeed get a factor of ~4 speedup in pure numpy examples (like those linked in the SE post), so it's only when integrating with QuTiP that something goes awry.

On the cases it gives an error (sol3, sol4), it is `Exception: Invalid a_td_term.` from br_codegen.py (`aop_td_funcs()`).; Note that the Cubic_Spline representation works perfectly fine for the Hamiltonian part (e.g. sol2). It also appears to work fine if specifying `c_ops`. **Expected behavior**; My understanding from the documentation regarding time-dependent objects is that the Cubic_Spline representation should work for brmesolve at all argument positions, where appropriate (not just the Hamiltonian and c_ops). For example, at the above URL, we have: <br/>; ""When combining interpolating functions with other Python functions or strings, the interpolating class will automatically pick the appropriate method for calling the class. That is to say that, if for example, you have other time-dependent terms that are given in the string-format, then the cubic spline representation will also be passed in a string-compatible format. In the string-format, the interpolation function is compiled into c-code, and thus is quite fast. This is the default method if no other time-dependent terms are present."" <br/>. If my understanding is incorrect and brmesolve can not accept Cubic_Spline objects, it means it is currently impossible to use this function with non-analytic functions (i.e. only ones we can write out explicitly such as 'exp(-w)'), and seems a major drawback (considering all other solvers in QuTiP are more flexible in what can be accepted to specify time-dependence). **Your Environment**; QuTiP Version: 4.6.2; Numpy Version: 1.18.1; Scipy Version: 1.4.1; Cython Version: 0.29.24; Matplotlib Version: 3.1.3; Python Version: 3.7.6; Number of CPUs: 4; BLAS Info: INTEL MKL; OPENMP Installed: False; INTEL MKL Ext: True; Platform Info: Darwin (x86_64)",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1624:1999,depend,dependent,1999,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1624,3,['depend'],"['dependence', 'dependent']"

I don't really know anything about the theory here, and just went with what the `matlab` documentation said: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/symrcm.html. In commit 0ce36d00 it is clear that the functions in `qutip.graph` were meant to be distinct from `Qobj`, so ideally they would be beyond our purview in this package. This actually has already lead to problems with the documentation, since the docstrings in; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/graph.py#L50-L53; and; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/graph.py#L71-L74; are out-of-date. I find that the only uses of `qutip.graph` are in `qutip.steadystate`, which uses `reverse_cuthill_mckee` and `weighted_bipartite_matching`. The former can be replaced directly with the `scipy` version, at the cost of ~10% speed. The latter is not yet in `scipy`, so we ought to perhaps keep it, since it is used and documented for `qutip.steadystate.steadystate`. All other functions in `qutip.graph` are not used, and not documented (and in `scipy` anyway). While obviously I don't want to trample on anybody's code, I think it might be worth considering how we can reduce the package complexity of `qutip`, especially while significant new complexity is frequently being added in the interests of speed. We only have a finite amount of resources to maintain the codebase, and it's already quite difficult to get a handle on bug reports, documentation, testing (what I'm working on in #1181), and keeping old features up-to-date with the new. In the tracking down of these points, I can also strongly advocate for a stricter policy on `git` commit messages and keeping the commit history tidy and descriptive, but I'll live to fight another day on that one!",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203:4196,message,messages,4196,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203,1,['message'],['messages']

New design elements under consideration:; - [improved `'type'` and `'dims'` handling for tensor-product spaces](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1320). Major breaking changes to QuTiP:; - `Qobj.data` is no longer an instance of `scipy.sparse.spmatrix`, but the new abstract ""data-layer type"" `core.data.Data`; - `bra * ket` now returns a scalar, not a `Qobj` (no need to do `(bra * ket).data[0, 0]` or `(bra * ket).tr()`) any more; - 1D subspaces in `Qobj.dims` are now never contracted silently (they were, but inconsistently before), but the new function `Qobj.contract()` can be called to do this explicitly; - `Qobj` no longer defines `__array__`, and so cannot be treated as if it is a numpy array. Having this led to inconsistent behaviour when `Qobj` was used in arithmetic with numpy arrays from the left and right, and allowed simple code to become `Qobj.dims`-unsafe _implicitly_. To get the full array view now, you must be explicit and call `Qobj.full()` - it is not enough to do `np.array(qobj)`, and this behaviour is consistent with `scipy.sparse` matrices.; - `eseries` and `essolve` are removed; - OpenMP is temporarily removed (but should be added back in before the release); - most functions marked deprecated as of version 4.5.2 are removed (e.g. in `qutip.correlation`); - `vec2mat` and `mat2vec` are renamed away from the terse MATLAB-compatible syntax to the more QuTiP-consistent `vector_to_operator` and `operator_to_vector`. Non-breaking changes:; - the internal file layout of the code is more organised, with physical ""packages"" `qutip.core` and `qutip.solve` containing the core code and the solvers res",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1278:2262,contract,contract,2262,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1278,1,['contract'],['contract']

The changes are (a) to increase consistency between the monte carlo solvers and the stochastic solvers, (b) to reduce repeating code from MultiTrajSolver in the subclasses, (c) to fix some documentation. * Renamed `_MTSystem` and `_MCSystem` into `_MultiTrajRHS` and `_MCRHS` to make them analogous to `_StochasticRHS`. Removed distinction between `.system` and `.rhs` which seemed unnecessary and confusing to me (please tell me if I'm wrong).; * Made `_integrate_one_traj` use the integrator's run method (which doesn't do anything special currently, but I imagine that it could potentially be implemented more efficiently than repeated calls to integrate). Made subclasses use `_run_one_traj`, `_integrate_one_traj` etc of the parent class where possible, instead of duplicating logic.; * The docstring of MCSolver.run was not documenting its parameters, instead referring to the docstring of MultiTrajSolver.run, but MultiTrajSolver is not included in the docs.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2359:562,integrat,integrator,562,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2359,2,['integrat'],"['integrate', 'integrator']"

Integrability,"A lot of the cost of the Husimi Q function does not depend on the state. If it is called many times (e.g. for a density matrix or when doing multiple states), this can be used for a speedup. I wrote a function to precompute everything that does not depend on the state and store it as a 3d array. The Q function itself is then a dot product between the last axis of the precomputed array and a pure state. Performance: Everything tested by computing Q of a coherent state with N dimensions, evaluated at 401 points in x and y, respectively.; Speedup is 3x for N=10, 4x for N=20, 7x for N=50. ; For density matrices, precomputing is already paid for by the first call. . Possible further changes:; Because precomputing is always worth it if the state is a density matrix, one could do that automatically. Because the memory cost can be large (len(xvec) * len(yvec) * N * 128 bit) , I still leave the decision to the user. The third if statement in _qfunc_pure can be avoided at a small performance cost in either the polyval or np.dot variant.

Integrability,"As before, options can be set as keywork at initialization or when setting items. The default can be changed using context (mainly for tests) or setting items at the class:. ```; SolverOptions['method`] = 'bdf' # Set default method ; with SolverOptions(atol=1e-5):; opt = SolverOptions(store_state=True); opt['progress_bar'] = False; print(opt). progress_bar : False; store_state : True; method : 'bdf'; atol : 1e-5; ...; ```; The option can also be initialized from a dict or another options instance, it will make a copy. I added the capacity to add a safety check when setting an options. It is only used for `use_cython` which will error when trying to set it to `True` without cython installed. Otherwise, it will fail when trying to use the options. *Solver's options*; Each solver has it's option class (SeOptions, MeOptions, etc.) with only needed keys.This somewhat feel overkill since they are all the some for now, until mcsolve is merged. Each integrator also has an associated options and the solver options contain an integrator options. Conversion between options type will raise an error. When creating a solver options, it read the `method` key and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `bdf`. There is also a generic `Options` class that accept any keys used by integrator or solver and can be converted to any specific solver options:; ```; Options(futur_cupy_ode_specific_options=True) # Will work; Options(not_an_options=True) # Error; # For most solver:; __solve(..., opt=Options()); ```; Once options are associated to a solver, they are f",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812:1579,integrat,integrator,1579,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812,2,['integrat'],['integrator']
Integrability,As discussed in #664 this PR is regarding citation reminders for QuTiP as it seems that many times users are unaware of the papers to cite when they use QuTiP. I have added a bibtex file in the source now and into the MANIFEST file. We should discuss how to get this to the users attention. Creation of a cite() function which generates a bibtex entry in the working directory whenever qutip is imported could be one option. The other option is to put it in /home/qutip or print it out whenever a result class is called. We can also add a welcome message at setup which reminds users regarding the papers and points them to the bibtex file. I am in favour of having a bibtex generator in __init__.py such that qutip.bib appears in the code folder whenever QuTiP is used.,MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/752:547,message,message,547,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/752,1,['message'],['message']
Integrability,"At present the only known working option that works with the runtime compile features (e.g. string type time-dependence) requires Visual Studio 2015 with C++ options.

Integrability,"Change `bloch_redfield_tensor` to be an equivalent to the `liouvillian` function.; As the former, it is now placed in core and support the both constant and time-dependant systems. (Removing the need for `br_codegen.py`). Previously, `bloch_redfield_tensor` returned the tensor in the frame where the Hamiltonian was diagonalized, now it offer the option between returning the tensor in that frame of the the lab frame. The function `brterm` as been added as the equivalent to `lindblad_dissipator`, it compute the contribution of one `a_op` of a bloch Redfielf tensor. The last user facing addition is `SpectraCoefficient`, it transform a coefficient of `t` to one of `w`. The coupling with the environment include a frequency response function which, in `brmesolve`, could be a function, string or `Cubic_Spline`, thus a `Coefficient`, but with a `w` input. `SpectraCoefficient` is to have interpolation based coefficient take the `w` input. . `QobjEvo` created by `brterm` use a custom element: `_BlochRedfieldElement` to allow faster matmul with a state. Since the operator in computed in a basis and the state is in another, having `matmul` change the state basis is usually faster than changing the operator basis. Each `_BlochRedfieldElement` of a `QobjEvo` share a `_EigenBasisTransform`, the object that does the Hamiltonian diagonalization at each call.

When run in a Jupyter notebook, as per the tutorial on http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-bloch.html, the Bloch sphere is immediately displayed in the cell output. However, nothing is displayed (no matplotlib window opens) when this code is run as a standalone script from the terminal, or even in IPython. For this, an additional call to `plt.show()` is required. I understand how this behaviour could be useful when moving code that has been developed in a notebook into a standalone script, as `plt.show()` is a blocking command. However, I still see this as inconsistent as we get distinctly different results depending on where the code is being run. If this is indeed intentional behaviour, might I suggest a note in the tutorial/API documentation? At present, there is no way to tell that this is what happens and if this is consistent.

I would argue that the product `L * rho` should do this kind of conversion internally instead of throwing an exception. It seems to me the intention of `L * rho` is completely unambiguous, but maybe I'm missing something?. Having the product work out of the box means that I can write a simple propagation routine as `(A * dt).expm() * state` and it would work independent of whether (A, state) are a (Hamiltonian, vector) or a (Liouvillian, density matrix).

There are several additional comments and explanations in the expanded commit messages, where I've tried to explain a little bit about bugs I found and reasons for swapping over to certain libraries (e.g. for temporary file handling). I'm in part opening a new PR now so that I can see if the CodeClimate tests are passing. I shouldn't have many pep8 issues because I have a tool to check, but I don't have CodeClimate working locally for things like the complexity (if it even checks them for tests...). I've been really rather aggressively using the parametrisation that `pytest` offers for fixtures, which is cutting out an awful lot of code duplication, and hopefully making it a bit clearer when things are exactly the same. One common theme I'm finding when I'm running these tests is that there's an awful lot of warnings caused by `pyximport`, a part of `Cython`, which is using the Python 2 era `imp` instead of the newer `importlib`.

Integrability,"Currently QuTiP solvers are pure batch jobs. One calls a function, e.g. `mesolve`, which then runs until the state has been propagated to all requested time steps and then the function returns the result. There are a variety of use cases where having access to results as they are calculated can be useful:. * Implementing a progress bar; * Limiting how long a solver runs for; * Stopping a solver early if a steady state or other desired or undesired state is detected.; * Implementing adaptive solvers where parameters are changed depending on the current state. We're currently refactoring the QuTiP solvers for QuTiP v5, so perhaps now is a good time to consider whether this feature will see enough use to be worth the effort. Implementation options:. * The solver could call a `callback function` each time a new result becomes available.; * The solver could `yield` each time a new result becomes available.; * The solver could do something asynchronous (I think this is not worth supporting natively in QuTiP -- either of the others would allow something asynchronous to be implemented by a QuTiP users themselves if they wanted). Probably these are not mutually exclusive. To make porting easier, it should still be possible to call some solve function without a callback or yielding as one can do now.

Integrability,"Currently, trying to convert a Qobj to a numpy array with `np.array(qobj)` does not work the way I would expect:. ~~~; >>> import numpy as np; >>> import qutip; >>> a = np.random.random((10, 10)); >>> A = qutip.Qobj(a); >>> b = np.array(A); >>> b.shape; (); ~~~. What it does is it handles `A` like it would a scalar.; ~~~; >>> np.array(1).shape; (); ~~~.

The reason why I'd want `np.array(A)` to work is that it makes it much easier to write code that works for any array-like types (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40378427/numpy-formal-definition-of-array-like-objects).

If I'm not mistaken, the only thing required is to define an `__array__` method on `Qobj` that returns `self.full()`.

Integrability,"Dear qutip developers,. In the documentation of version 4.5 the c_ops argument is said to support callback functions, however they are not implemented in that version and as far as I can tell neither in the current branch. It would be nice to have this feature added to allow for arbitrary time-dependent Lindbladians to be implemented. There are cases where Lindbladians cannot simply be described as the product of a time-dependent scalar and a time-independent Lindbladian, this is where the callback becomes useful. I envisage a single callback passed to c_ops as being useful, where the user has to manually add multiple decoherence channels. This way, arbitrary data can be passed through the args parameter of the callback to build the operators at a given time step. I believe this would also allow channel cross-correlations to be implemented too. I have hacked my local copy of qutip 4.5 to check this can in principle be done with mesolve, and it has worked.

Integrability,"Different platforms have some subtle differences in how multiprocessing works: On linux, processes ""fork"". My basic understanding is that sub-processes are created as copies of the parent process, thus inheriting their entire state (global variables/functions). Windows, and [macOS with Python >= 3.8](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1180209729609420800) uses ""spawn"". There, I believe subprocesses start from blank slate, and relevant global state is injected via IPC. Sadly, limitations of the pickle protocol can cause ""spawn""-based multiprocessing to have problems. Jupyter notebooks are affected by this: you cannot use multiprocessing-map using functions defined within the notebook. . Within qutip, this definitely affects the `parallel_map` function: It currently will cause freezes on Windows (See https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.0.0/notebooks/08_example_ensemble.html). With Python 3.8, macOS is also affected by this. See https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks/issues/100. One possible workaround is to use a third-party replacement for multiprocessing. An work-in-progress implementation of this is in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1092, using [loky](https://loky.readthedocs.io). In #1197, we also identified a freeze in `mcsolve` when running tests on macOS/Python 3.8. This is suspected to be an issue with spawn-based multiprocessing, although we haven't been able to determine this with complete confidence. If the freeze is indeed caused by spawn-multiprocessing, the problem *should* also show up on Windows. Is anyone running Windows able to reproduce this?",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1202:456,inject,injected,456,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1202,2,"['inject', 'protocol']","['injected', 'protocol']"

Integrability,"Hello,. I'm using qutip alongside another library, which does something like this:; ```py; import logging; logger = logging.getLogger(); logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG); ```; Im not entirely sure why it does so, but nevertheless debug messages don't show up anywhere, since the root logger doesn't print anything without it being configured. If you run the above code in Ipython but add `import qutip` before it, `logging.debug(""foo"")` prints to the stderr (without qutip it doesn't). So when I started using the library with qutip, suddenly all debug messages started getting printed to stderr. Apparently, this is somewhat on purpose, by looking at the code [here](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/eff1c3a606cad64b8d16f3232181b0463d65d746/qutip/logging_utils.py#L99).

Nevertheless, I thought I could work around this by setting `log_handler = ""null""` in my settings file, but that in turn causes qutip to crash, because the rc loader [expects](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/eff1c3a606cad64b8d16f3232181b0463d65d746/qutip/configrc.py#L97) `log_handler` to be a boolean for some reason.

Integrability,"Hello,; I'm the Lead developer of [netket](https://github.com/netket/netket), a jax-based framework for using Machine-Learning techiques to study quantum systems (open and closed). We are finalising the next release and as I am a big fan of extensibility, I would like our two frameworks to coexist and provide a sensible, easy api to work together.; Mainly, what I would like to do is provide an easy-to-use no-documentation-needed to convert NetKet's types to Qutip, so that it becomes easy to use it to check our variational calculations. TLDR: I propose creating and documenting a `__qobj__` interface so that arbitrary objects having this method will support conversion to a QuTiP Qobj. --. NetKet has mainly three types that are concerned: hilbert spaces, operators and variational states. ; Hilbert spaces describe the space every object is defined upon, and can be easily converted to your `dims` format. Operators are used to represent operators and super-operators acting on hilbert spaces. We use a very custom format roughly corresponding to a lazy kronecker product. Those object satisfy the numpy `__array__` interface and can be converted by calling `np.array(netket_operator)` or `np.asarray(netket_operator)`. We can also obtain sparse representations (but there is no nice api to do that, so we simply provide a method `netket_operator.to_sparse()`. Variational states can also be converted to vectors or matrices (kets and density operators) as they also support the `__array__` interface. I would like our users to be able to call `Qobj(netket_operator)` or `Qobj(netket_state)` and obtain the corresponding qutip object. We could, in principle support a `netket_operator.to_qobj()` conversion method, but I am strongly opposed to that as this is an ugly design pattern: a way to construct a `Qobj` already exists, it's `Qobj(...)`, and the simplest-to-use api is, in my opinion, to overload this constructor to perform the conversion.; This is a standard design pattern in Julia, ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508:596,interface,interface,596,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"Hello. I am currently running a simulation with `mesolve` (yet the same error occurs with `sesolve`) with a slow perturbation, such that close to zero the Hamiltonian is very close to zero (the perturbation is a thin Gaussian distribution). When I run `mesolve`, instead of running my time-dependent coefficients for the values in `tlist` (where in this case I had 250 times in `tlist`), **QuTiP** uses about 20 seemingly random time values, some of which are not even in `tlist`. . I believe this error is stemming from the Hamiltonian changing extremely slowly and being close to zero for a long period of time. This is because **QuTiP** began working normally when I added the constant 0.00001 to my time-dependent coefficient.

Integrability,"Hi QuTiP users,. I am not quite sure how I should introduce the issue that I have, but basically it comes down to the fact that my Hamiltonian and a particular function seems to require >500 GB of RAM for some parameters used. For the desired parameters, this can even become Terabytes which is hard to implement. . The main parameters by the way is N, which is the dimension of the Hilbert Space. The maximum is N=111 when running the program on the 500 GB node. The memory usage fits very good to a RAM (MB) = 0.0008804*N^4 dependence. A strange thing is that Slurm's MaxRSS command says that only 133,690 MB was needed to run the program, which is not close to the 500 GB. The memory profiler said that one function required 145,766.2 MiB (152,846.9 MB) at some point, and 327,769.4 MiB (343,691.1 MB) was freed. Together this comes close to the 500 GB, although I don't understand the numbers. I have no profound knowledge of the memory allocation in Python and QuTiP, but I would like to check if this can be improved. I went to two IT consultants who are in charge of the National Supercomputer in the Netherlands, and they also found no errors in my code. One of their suggestions was to ask you for advice on this topic. Of course, I can provide you with more details (the whole code, the outcome of the memory profiler, the meaning of the parameters and the infrastructure), but I don't want to overwhelm you. I look forward to hearing from you. Best regards,.

I've got a fairly primitive version of the code working now, so I'd like to see what you think. I tried to mimic the appearance of partial_transpose as much as possible, for familiarity to QuTiP users. Things yet to be done include:; - Rewriting the 'kernel' of the efficient application code in Fortran 90, f2py-ing and wrapping for increased speed; - Ensuring that no un-needed copies of the various arrays involved are being made; - (Perhaps, if you're so inclined) adding more structure to superoperators objects, so that they can be more easily handled.

Integrability,"Hi,. It seems there are some errors in the Floquet `mesolve`-equivalent function, which are not seen when considering a simple qubit.

Integrability,"Hi,. Thanks a lot for this great package. Here are two patches I would like to suggest:; - support for numpy arrays as cython args to allow time dependence using arrays. I use this in the following way: H.append([op/1e9, '(0 if (t<0 or t>100) else ch0[round(t)])']), where ch0 is a numpy array containing the actual waveform. It will be in the args dictionary given to mesolve/sesolve.

Integrability,"Hi,. There is a [manual integration](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/floquet.py#L602-L624) using rectangles method in `qutip.floquet` file which sometimes fail. Problem is that the number of timesteps, `nT`, is hardcoded and not accessible to the user. In my case, `nT = 100` does not seem to be enough and the integral is wrong. A quick and dirty fix is to have an extra `nT=100` keyword argument to `floquet_master_equation_rates`, so that user can overload it. Still, it does not seem to be the most efficient way of doing it. I have a quick fix I can contribute which is using `scipy.integrate.simps` instead. This requires keeping an array of values to integrate in memory (which is less memory-efficient) but I could keep `nT=100` and get the correct integral by using this method. I guess the best option would be to use [`scipy.integrate.quad`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.quad.html#scipy.integrate.quad), as it uses an adaptive algorithm. I can contribute a fix for this, just looking for feedback on the best available option :).

Integrability,"Hi,; I want to discuss 2 points about how we manage time dependent Hamiltonian, relating to the discussion started on qucontrol/krotov#56. First, presently function coefficients are defined as:; ```; def f(t, args):; return ...; ```; With `args` is a dictionary containing extra variables to pass to the function. For backward compatibility; ```; def f(t, state, args):; return ...; ```; is also accepted if the option `rhs_with_state` is set to `True`. . But there have been demand to accept more signatures: `f(t)` and `f(t, **args)`. PR #1123, when ready, should allow both signature using options. . The best signature I believe is `f(t, **args)` since it allows to use more natural function call using kwargs (`f(t, w=0, a=1)`). However, it is the slowest in the #1123 implementation (up to 10x): some items are added to `args` for internal use and they need to be filtered at each call. It could be brought to 2.5x with some work, but no better. `f(t)` is about 2x slower than `f(t, args)`. But it's less agile: if the Hamiltonian use `f(t, w1=0)`, we cannot add a c_ops using `f(t, w2=0)`, both function must accept `w1` and `w2`. `args` could just hide unused items. Which ever we choose as the main one will be 2~3x faster than the other. We can have automatic detection of the signature if we want to be fancy. Which signature do you think is better?. Second, these function can depend on the state with the option `rhs_with_state`. Thus the coefficients are `f(t, state, args)` with `state` a 1D numpy array.; When making QobjEvo, I added special `args`' keys that indicate that the value should be updated with the state: setting `args = {""val=Qobj"":psi0, ""val"":psi0}` would tell `args[""val""]` to be updated with the state at each use in the solver. The state can be obtained as Qobj, np.array or the args could be updated to be the expectation value of another Qobj.; There are some bug for it in master presently but it will work with PR #1127.

Such an object would get passed down into the C layer, which does no shape checking, without having its shape explicitly tested, and eventually could cause a segfault in the matrix multiplication routine. The correct check in this setup is to test the shapes when passed into `mesolve`, if this is possible.

It seems to be faster if `ODE.integrate(tlist, step=n)` can store the state. In this way I ignore `tlist[k]` totally.; 2. After `if norm2_psi <= rand_vals[0]:`, you find the collapse time to within specified tolerance. Can I just take the collapse time as the time immediately after `ODE.integrate(tlist[k], step=1)`? Since the step in the `ODE` should be small enough, would it make a lot difference by ignoring the steps of finding the collapse time to within specified tolerance?.

I kept most methods, only skipping the taylor order 2.0 method. The python interface is kept very similar to the `Integrator` as `SIntegrator`, the main difference being that `set_state` and `get_state` use an extra random number generator with the time and state. The integration methods are usually 5%~10% slower than they where for medium size problems (shape ~100). Most method are computed the same way as before, but the rouchon method no longer use super operator, but keep the density matrix as a matrix and not an oper-ket. - The derivative computation for used by the integration method has also been split into multiple functions and made only available for `smesolve`. For there methods to be valid, the each diffusion contribution must commute. For `smesolve`, this means that each `sc_ops` must commute, as documented. For `ssesolve`, each `sc_ops` must not only commute, but also commute with other `sc_ops`'s adjoint, this last part being missing from v4's documentation.

See [1][Nineteen Dubious Ways to Compute the Exponential of a Matrix, Twenty-Five Years Later∗](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/cv/ResearchPDF/19ways%2B.pdf). In a quantum optics, the displacement operator is one of the most basic. It is used to create coherent states from vacuum and forms one of the two gates for universal control of a cavity (Displacement + SNAP gates) [2] [Efficient cavity control with SNAP gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14256). When we want to write an optimisation routine that finds best displacement parameters in a routine similar to the paper above [2], it would be nice if we can compute the operator faster without doing matrix exponentiation as qutip does now:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/operators.py#L732. I have some notes from a colleague who calculated an analytical formula to compute the matrix elements of the displacement operator without having to do matrix exponentiation [3]: ; [Displacement_operator.pdf](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/4791455/Displacement_operator.pdf). A PR to implement this in QuTiP would be great. We could first write a `_displace_analytical` function that calculates the displacement matrix using the [Scipy Laguerre polynomial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.genlaguerre.html) and have it as an option as `displace(N, alpha, offset, method=`analytical` )`. Could it also come in handy for optimal control? @ajgpitch .

Integrability,"Measuring the statistics of electron transport though nanostructures has been found to be a powerful experimental tool to gather information about such structures. The functions in countstat.py return the first two cumulants of a transport process, which are associated with measuring the current and shot noise, respectively. However at the moment they are a little buggy, and the current noise function fails sometimes, depending on the dimensionality of the system. As well as fixing this issue, there a couple of enhancements that can be done:. 1) Making the current noise function frequency dependant. This just requires adding a list of frequencies to return, and calculating the noise power for each given frequency ( at the moment it returns the zero frequency current noise). 2) Adding higher-order current cumulants. This is a straightforward generalization of the current noise function, though for very high orders the expansion of a given cumulant in terms of pseudo-inverse and current operators can be a little complicated. An iterative method for generating these can be found in C. Flindt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 150601 (2008). and C. Flindt, T. Novotny, A. Braggio, and A.-P. Jauho, Phys. Rev.

I suggest the following change (changes highlighted in bold):. > I: Choose a random number **r_1** between zero and one, representing the probability that a quantum jump occurs.; > II: Integrate the Schrödinger equation, using the effective Hamiltonian (1) until a time τ such that the norm of the wave function satisfies ⟨ψ(τ)|ψ(τ)⟩=**r_1**, at which point a jump occurs.; > **III: Choose a random number r_2 between zero and one, used to select which collapse operator was responsible for the jump.**; > IV: The resultant jump projects the system at time τ into one of the renormalized states given by Eq. (3). The corresponding collapse operator Cn is chosen such that n is the smallest integer satisfying:; > (5); > ∑_{i=1}^{n} P_n(τ)≥**r_2**. While this is not an issue in the code, the way the documentation is written at the moment implies that jumps which occur after a short amount of time will primarily be due to collapse operators at the end of the c_ops list, while jumps that happen after a long time will be biased towards collapse operators at the start of the c_ops list.

Integrability,"QuTiP is currently incompatible with numpy 1.20. Tests will fail to even collect with an error such as; ```; AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'dag'; ```; and a lot of functionality will break - anything that requires `Qobj.eigenstates()` for example. This is because `Qobj` defines `__array__`, one of numpy's ""array interface"" functions, intended for classes that can be safely converted _implicitly_ into an `ndarray`. This isn't really the case for `Qobj` - it loses all sorts of information when you do that, which is why we've maintained the separate `Qobj.full()` for explicitly getting the dense matrix representation of a `Qobj`. This is not to mention that numpy ufuncs probably should not be able to implicitly convert `Qobj` - I'd strongly argue that `np.sin(qutip.basis(2, 1))` should be `TypeError`, _not_ `array([[0. +0.j], [0.84147098+0.j]])` (like it is right now). We actually already removed this ""functionality"" in `dev.major`. The most pressing incompatibility is that a few points in QuTiP put a few `Qobj` into a `np.array(dtype=object)`. In numpy 1.20, this no longer produces a 1D array of `Qobj`, but a 3D array of complex. This breaks `Qobj.eigenstates`, and prevents test collection due to it being present in `states.py::qutrit_basis()`, which is called during parametrisation. There are a two possible ways to solve this, and we ought to release a fix with one of them in a patch ASAP:; 1. remove `Qobj.__array__`; 2. remove all use of `Qobj` in `np.array`. I'm personally in favour of ""explicit is better than implicit"" in this case, i.e. removing `Qobj.__array__` and relying on `Qobj.full()`. As another example along this vein, note `scipy.sparse` matrices don't implement this either, and they're arguably closer to being safely coerced to `ndarray` than we are. ### Related issues. #938: feature request for implementing `__array__`.

While this is very useful for distinguishing quantum maps from other quantum objects, additional metadata to tell apart Liouville (supermatrix) and Choi representations would be very useful in writing functions that act on quantum maps. For instance, the average gate fidelity of a map is easily calculated in terms of its Kraus decomposition, such that to find the fidelity of the map represented by a `Qobj`, one would either call `super_to_choi` and then `choi_to_kraus`, or would skip directly to `choi_to_kraus`, depending on how the map was represented.

Also, in #1480 we issued deprecation warnings for user-facing uses of `eseries`, `essolve` and `ode2es`, however we are not deprecating the correlation and spectrum methods (in QuTiP 5.0 the necessary components are just absorbed into private functions inside `correlation.py`), so these should not generate warnings. Simon (@hodgestar) and I briefly discussed whether we needed a special warnings filter inside those functions, but we thought we didn't need it because default Python filters would prevent `DeprecationWarning` from being shown, since it is triggered by library code and not code in `__main__`. The problem is that not everything uses the default filters; both `pytest` and the documentation build do not suppress all `DeprecationWarning` messages. This was a particular problem in `pytest`, where approximately 68,000 warnings (!) were generated. Since this is _not_ deprecated functionality, nor is it using deprecated functionality, so there shouldn't be any warnings. This PR removes those as well. The end result is that a completely clean documentation build now should generate 0 warnings. My eventual intent is to create an automatic documentation build process, which treats warnings as errors to prevent us from breaking it in PRs. This cannot happen until the merger of the documentation into this repository, however, because otherwise new features/feature removals could get into an impossible situation where the two PRs to `qutip` and `qutip-doc` would not be aware of each other, so would return failed CI.

Integrability,"This PR fixes every warning reported in `pytest`, and then makes `pytest` treat warnings as errors to hopefully make sure we stick to this state of affairs. (Or at least it fixes all the ones that appear on my particular machine...). The reason this is desirable is that it means we cannot ignore deprecation warnings in dependencies or even in our own code. It also helps us not let certain parts of the codebase get lost in the sands of time, or at least compels us to do something about potential problems before they actually become catastrophic. This is _somewhat_ of a trial, though I hope we can stick to it; warnings usually indicate that something's wrong. Tests can still test run code that generates warnings, but you now have to mark it explicitly in `pytest`. This doesn't mean you should just ""blank out"" warnings by filtering them away. You should first consider if what you're doing is the right way to do it (fix the warning), and then only if it absolutely is and you're testing something that is _supposed_ to warn, then you can use `pytest.warns` to _assert_ that it warns. Of note: a `warnings.catch_warnings` block _inside_ a test (i.e. in test code, not module code) does not work when `pytest` is treating warnings as errors. There are a few classes of fixes in this PR:. - filtering ""expected"" warnings from `pyximport` (hoping to remove QuTiP's dependence on this in 5.0 anyway); - removal of the old `np.matrix` type in favour of `ndarray`, with some changes to accommodate the different arithmetic semantics; - convert an `__init__` method in a test into just class attributes to allow `pytest` to collect it; - bug fixes for behaviour that was raising warnings we hadn't been paying attention to.

Integrability,"This fixes the calls to the `qutip.configrc` module in `qutip/__init__.py` when setting up OpenMP. Also, this tidies up a lot of very old code out of `__init__.py` that was testing for ancient versions of SciPy and Numpy. Since we have hard requirements at installation time for those, it's fine for us not to test their versions at initialisation. We still should check the version of Cython because it's an optional dependency, so isn't always constrained by the package manager. Some of the changes deliberately make `qutip/__init__.py` less forgiving of exceptions, especially when it comes to loading up `pyximport`. This is deliberate, even though it may make a couple more errors surface that have previously gone undetected. As it stands right now, the file will causes several errors to be silently ignored, even if they weren't the error we were testing for. That masks problems for a short while, but they usually resurface during use when they're much harder to debug. We should be solving the underlying problems, not sweeping them under the rug. In particular, we've frequently had complaints about `pyximport` failing, or trying to import OpenMP modules that have previously been compiled but aren't currently active, and things like that.

Integrability,"This is a tidied up and completed version of #934. The first commit is credited to the original author (although I fixed up some little concerns in the PR and rebased it), because it's logically built off that PR, although in the end it's a complete reimplementation. This is a complete rewrite of the Husimi Q calculations, to make a more formal split between the iterative (low-memory) and precomputed (faster) algorithms, giving full access to both of them. It's a bit easier to use from a user's perspective, and it's faster than #934 as well. The concept of the precomputed matrix is encapsulated into a class with a cached tensor, so that the same precomputed system can be used for many states of different sizes, and autoexpands (up to the memory limit) to accommodate larger states. This is called `QFunc` as opposed to the standard function interface `qfunc`. It also adds rather more error checking on its inputs, and adds a complete testing suite for the new implementation. Closes #934. ## Examples. Let's say we have some states, and the phase-space coordinates we want to calculate the Husimi Q function at.; ```python; >>> import qutip; >>> states = [qutip.rand_dm(32, density=0.2) for _ in [None]*100]; >>> xs = np.linspace(-2, 2, 401); ```. Now the normal way of calculating the Q distribution for a single state is; ```python; >>> qutip.qfunc(states[0], xs, xs); array( ... ); ```. This already has some speed advantages over the pre-PR version of `qfunc`, because it caches a lot of its intermediary results, to avoid recomputing them. This results in calculating more matrix-vector products than before, but far fewr FLOPS overall. By default, `qfunc` issues a warning if it exceeds a certain amount of memory, and falls back to the low-memory version. You can control this limit with the `precompute_memory` option:; ```python; >>> qutip.qfunc(states[0], xs, xs, precompute_memory=0); qutip/qutip/wigner.py:822: UserWarning: Falling back to iterative algorithm due to lack of mem",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583:851,interface,interface,851,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"This is causing test failures in all CI builds against scipy 1.5 currently. The other failing tests on scipy 1.5 are due to changes to the handling of `csr` matmul operations, which is fixed in patch #1298. As far as I can see, there is no way to recover the exact same behaviour as existed in scipy < 1.5 (there's optimisations of the `lwork` input to the LAPACK routine), and consequently we are not getting the exact same set of eigenvectors for problem dimensions > 32. This does not mean that `brtools` is suddenly doing something wrong. It just means that the test assumed we would have the exact same output as `scipy`, and we don't any more. . This is an annoying problem to fix, I think. Two possible methods:. 1. attempt to ""trick"" scipy into doing the same pre-1.5 behaviour. Possibly this would involve monkey-patching out the ability of `eigh` to optimise the `lwork` parameters (i.e. stubbing out `scipy.linalg.lapack._compute_lwork` to always return `lwork=18*nrows`, `lrwork=24*nrows` and `liwork=10*nrows` to match `qutip.cy.brtools.ZHEEVR`).; 2. do some linear algebra work to determine that the eigenvectors we have returned are equivalent to the ones scipy has returned. 2 is a better solution, but harder to implement, especially in the presence of degenerate or near-degenerate eigenvalues (of which there are likely a lot around 0). 1 is very unsatisfying, but might be enough. In general, this problem will hopefully be solved a bit more thoroughly when `brmesolve` is updated to use the new data layer types, and we standardise the calculation of eigenvalues and -vectors across QuTiP.

Integrability,"This issue is on behalf of [a post in the forums by Louis Fry](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qutip/93uSuJGK_Jk) who is trying to implement Lindblad operators which cannot be written in the form of a known `f(t) * A`, because the operators are related to the instantaneous eigenstates of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The documentation in the docstring of `mesolve` says that `c_ops` may be a callback function of the signature `f(t, args) -> Qobj`, similarly to the Hamiltonian. This is not the case, and as best as I can tell, has never been the case. Basic reproduction (though the functionality is just completely missing, so this won't ever succeed).; ```python; import qutip; def c_ops(t, args):; return qutip.create(3); qutip.mesolve(qutip.num(3), qutip.basis(3, 1).proj(), [0, 1], c_ops); ```. ## History. - @jrjohansson originally wrote the docstring saying that `c_ops` could be a callback function in 2012 (pre-QuTiP 1.1.4) in commit 1bf006d4, although the code did not support it at this time; - in issue #40 (2013), he commented that this functionality should be implemented, and this issue was closed without further action in 2018.; - in issue #223 (2014) there is some further discussion, but nothing is done until @Ericgig closes it in 2019, saying it is addressed by QuTiP 4.4.0 (the big swap to QobjEvo), but this doesn't appear to be the case.

The blocking issue is currently a failure of the multiprocessing capabilities, which also affects mcsolve. We can now reasonably run coverage reporting on every test run, and upload all of them to Coveralls at the end, so we get accurate stats on what lines were actually tested. I've also turned pytest's timer, so it reports all tests that took longer than a second to run. This should really help identify where the real problems in our testing are - right now you should see that there's a `correlation` test that takes around 2 minutes to run, which is a very sizable chunk of the entire test suite. We can concentrate on rewriting the longest tests to make sure we're still testing all the behaviour, without excessively long runtimes. I've been fairly conservative with the number of tests I set in motion. On the free GitHub plan we can have 20 concurrent VMs running across the whole QuTiP organisation, which I think spreads across all repositories and all test runs. With no Windows tests currently active this is 6 test runs plus the documentation build. If we want more, we could consider spending some money ($4/user/month) to convert into a Teams account which gets us 60 concurrent VMs, but I don't see any need to do this right now.

Integrability,"This patch obsoletes #1429, by applying the packaging changes to the current version of `master` rather than needing the new structure on `dev.major`. This patch should (mostly) apply cleanly to `dev.major` as well, so merging this up will be easy - the new automated systems in `setup.py` also mean that the distribution can handle both the current `master` and the `dev.major` package layouts with no changes. The rest of this text is very similar to the original message in #1429. ---. This patch overhauls how QuTiP is packaged and distributed. Once this patch is merged, there will be an option on QuTiP's GitHub Actions tab for people who have write permission on qutip/qutip to build all wheels and optionally release the build to PyPI, making it available on `pip` as a binary release. The major changes are in the files `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg` and `.github/workflows/build.yml`, while `MANIFEST.in` and a new file `VERSION` were also touched. ### Distribution changes:; - there is a GitHub Action which will build all the wheels for CPython 3.6+ on Linux (`manylinux1` x86 and x86_64), macOS and Windows (32- and 64-bit). This action is triggered manually, and the wheels will be available for download afterwards. Optionally, the action will push to PyPI, making the version immediately available on `pip` by binary release.; - `.cpp` files are now distributed with the wheels but not added to source control. This is a step towards a full Cython-free delivery of the QuTiP source (binary releases never require Cython), but right now I think our `setuptools` machinery doesn't quite handle that. ### Changes to `setup.py`; - all package metadata is moved out into `setup.cfg`, which is easier to read and change, and modern `setuptools`' preferred way of doing things; - all directory-tree access is done in a completely platform-agnostic manner, rather than just hoping that Unix-style paths will work on Windows; - the file is tidied and structured into a small script, ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1465:466,message,message,466,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1465,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"Using integer-like floats in `math.factorial` is deprecated as of Python 3.9. Glancing over the rest of the code, I'm fairly sure `math.factorial` is only called on floats formed by (e.g.) `N / 2 + 0.5`, which is guaranteed be an integer for all odd `N` integers, but to be safe I inserted the same test that `math.factorial` will do as well. By the way: depending on how accurate you actually want/need to be with your degeneracy calculations, a common way to deal with these binomial quantities is to work in the logarithmic space --; ```python; def factln(x):; return scipy.special.gammaln(x + 1). def energy_degeneracy(N, m):; return int(np.exp(Decimal(factln(N) - factln(N/2 + m) - factln(N/2 - m)))); ```; This is pretty much guaranteed to be faster, but a little less precise; double-precision floats have ~15 decimal digits of precision compared to the `Decimal` default of 28. You have to be careful that the `np.exp` call doesn't overflow (unless you can use the number in logarithmic space as well), but you can just use a single `Decimal` instance like I did if it really matters to you to have huuuuge numbers output. I suspect it doesn't, since you multiply it by a float right after, which will overflow to `inf`.

Upon further investigation I found out that the output is not a truncated version of the single-mode squeezing unitary, but rather the matrix exponential of the truncated generator. These are _very_ different things!. Am I right in assuming that the most useful matrix would be the truncated unitary? If that's the case, the current method to compute it is wrong. To compute the right matrix one can use the disentangling formula for SU(1,1) (formula (31) [here](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.3413923)):. ```python; def squeeze(n,z):; s0 = np.exp(1j*np.angle(z))*np.tanh(abs(z)); s1 = -2*np.log(np.cosh(abs(z))); s2 = -np.exp(-1j*np.angle(z))*np.tanh(abs(z)); ; L = s0*0.5*(qt.create(n)*qt.create(n)); K = s1*(0.5*qt.num(n)+0.25*qt.identity(n)); R = s2*0.5*(qt.destroy(n)*qt.destroy(n)); ; return (L.expm())*(K.expm())*(R.expm()); ```. As you can see, this definition does *not* depend on the truncation parameter.

Integrability,"_Last updated: 2020-08-12_. This is an issue for tracking and publicising the development status of a separated data layer. This is a major breaking change to be introduced in QuTiP 5, and will change how library functions and users access the underlying data structures of `Qobj`. This document and issue will change over time. Development is taking place on the [`dev.major` branch](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/tree/dev.major) in `qutip/qutip`. Pull requests implementing new features:; - #1282 separating out the core QuTiP operations into a (logical but user-transparent) package `qutip.core`.; - #1296 implementing the first parts of the data multiple dispatch and new data types.; - #1332 replacing the `fast_csr_matrix` with the new Cython type `CSR` all across QuTiP; - #1338 implementing the data-layer creation, conversion and dispatcher routines. We are writing a new ""developers' guide"" to explain the logic behind the design decisions, and help new QuTiP developers work on the code. You can follow initial development hosted as [a repo in my user account](https://github.com/jakelishman/qutip-devguide) until we decide how this will be added to the main documentation. You can view a rendered version of the documentation at https://jakelishman.github.io/qutip-devguide. Some design documents:; - [data layer](https://github.com/jakelishman/qutip-doc/blob/design-data-layer/design/01-data-time-layer-separation.md); - [data structure implementation choices](https://github.com/jakelishman/qutip-doc/blob/design-data-layer/design/02-data-structures.md); - [original GSoC proposal (PDF)](https://www.binhbar.com/posts/2020/05/welcome-to-google-summer-of-code-2020/proposal.pdf). New design elements under consideration:; - [improved `'type'` and `'dims'` handling for tensor-product spaces](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1320).

Integrability,"aces. I'm proposing one possible way to speed this up, while also gaining some additional safety and knowledge about mathematical operations on tensor-product spaces. The steps:; 1. rigourously define the ""grammar"" of `dims`, and allow all of `dimensions.py` to assume that this grammar is followed to speed up parsing; 2. maintain a private data structure type `dimensions._Parsed` inside `Qobj` which is constructed once, and keeps all details of the parsing so they need not be repeated. Determine `Qobj.type` from this data structure; 3. maintain knowledge of the individual `type` of every subspace in the full Hilbert space (e.g. with a list). There is still a ""global"" `Qobj.type`, but this can now be one in the set `{'bra', 'ket', 'oper', 'scalar', 'super', 'other'}`. `'other'` is for when the individual elements do not all match each other. Individual elements cannot be `'other'`. `'scalar'` is added to operations can keep track of tensor elements which have been contracted, say by a `bra-ket` product - operations will then broadcast scalar up to the correct dimensions on certain operations.; 4. dimension parsing is now sped up by using the operation-specific type knowledge. For example, `bra + bra -> bra`, and `ket.dag() -> bra`. Step 3 is necessary to allow matrix multiplication to work. These lookups could be done with enum values instead of string hashing. # Technical details. As of QuTiP 4.5 (and all previous versions), `Qobj` instantiation is slow and this permeates through to all operations on `Qobj`. Matrix multiplication, scalar multiplication, addition and so forth all need to instantiate new `Qobj` instances, and the time penalty for this is on the order of ~50µs per object. This results in more and more code than needs to bypass `Qobj` for speed, and in some cases (e.g. `qutip.control`) makes the use of `Qobj` prohibitively expensive. This obviously is not ideal, since `Qobj` is our primary data type. The majority of this time loss is due to inferring the",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1320:1135,contract,contracted,1135,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1320,1,['contract'],['contracted']

Integrability,"algorithms and better cache usage in places, but its principle advantage was the massive reduction in overhead for function calls between Python and C space, which largely affected small objects. The full aim, however, is to have QuTiP 5 support many different data representations as the backing of `Qobj`, and use the most suitable representation for the given data. This will not require every single QuTiP function to have an exponential number of versions for every possible combination of inputs, but only to have specialisations for the most common data combinations. This concept is the ""data layer"". All code examples in this PR are prefixed with. ```python; >>> from qutip.core import data; ```. ## Specification. The core to achieving this is fast, fully specified inter-conversion between all known data types, and efficient multiple-dispatch for mathematical operations. There are then four principle components of the data-layer:. 1. a creation routine which returns an appropriate data-layer type given some arbitrary Python object (`data.create`); 2. a routine which can perform the conversion from any data-layer type to any other data-layer type (`data.to`); 3. completely specialised mathematical operations (e.g. `data.add_csr_dense_dense(CSR, Dense) -> Dense`); 4. an object which provides multiple dispatch operations on its input arguments to use an exact specialisation (defined in item 3) if known, or uses the conversion routine (item 2) to convert the inputs into ones matching a specialisation if not: `data.Dispatcher`. The exported mathematical functions will all be instances of this type. The minimum work needed to define a new data-layer type is to provide `data.to` with two conversion functions; one into the new type from a current data-layer type, and one which converts the new type _into_ a current data-layer type. Once this is done, every single QuTiP component will be able to use the new data-layer type, although until specialisations are given which use i",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1338:1308,rout,routine,1308,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1338,1,['rout'],['routine']
Integrability,"allelly. It uses heuristic methods mainly from https://doi.org/10.1117/12.666419. The scheduler aims at pulse schedule and therefore does not consider merging gates to reduce the gates number. It assumes that the input circuit is optimized at the gate level (e.g. has a minimal number of CNOT gates) and matches the hardware topology. The scheduler includes two methods, ""ASAP"", as soon as possible, and ""ALAP"", as late as possible. The later is commonly used in quantum computation because of the finite lifetime of qubits. **Methods**. - The scheduler first generates a quantum gates dependency graph, containing information about which gates have to be executed before some other gates because they do not commute. The graph preserves the mobility of the gates, i.e. commuting gates are not dependent on each other, even if they use the same qubits. ; - Next, it computes the longest distance of each node to the start and end nodes. The distance for each dependency arrow is defined by the execution time of the instruction (By default, it is 1 for all gates). This is used as a priority measure in the next step. The gate with a longer distance to the end node and a shorter distance to the start node has higher priority.; - In the last step, it uses a list-schedule algorithm with hardware constraint (e.g. gates using the same qubits) and priority and returns a list of cycles for gates.; - Since it's heuristics, sometimes it does not find the optimal. It offers an option that randomly shuffles the gates (if commuting) and repeats the scheduling a few times to get a better result. For scheduling quantum instructions, of which the runtime of different gates might differ, an additional step is required to compute the scheduled start time of each instruction.; It adds the additional dependency caused by hardware constraint to the graph and recomputes the distance of each node to the start and end node. This distance is then converted to the start time of each instruction. **Example**",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1273:1149,depend,dependency,1149,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1273,1,['depend'],['dependency']

Integrability,"and `dW_factors` are properties of the classes, but not available to overwrite through the function interface. ; - The multiples end condition (`target_tol`, `timeout`) are added.; - The `solver` keyword is now `method` options, as it is in other solver.; - The method that was referring the homodyne or heterodyne detection is now the `heterodyne` keyword. ie before `method=""heterodyne""` now `heterodyne=True`.; - The default integration method is now `rouchon`, instead of `taylor1.5`. ie the method coming from a physic paper and not a mathematics textbook. . - The stochastic integration methods have been spitted in smaller chunk instead of the huge classes in _stochastic.pyx. I kept most methods, only skipping the taylor order 2.0 method. The python interface is kept very similar to the `Integrator` as `SIntegrator`, the main difference being that `set_state` and `get_state` use an extra random number generator with the time and state. The integration methods are usually 5%~10% slower than they where for medium size problems (shape ~100). Most method are computed the same way as before, but the rouchon method no longer use super operator, but keep the density matrix as a matrix and not an oper-ket. - The derivative computation for used by the integration method has also been split into multiple functions and made only available for `smesolve`. For there methods to be valid, the each diffusion contribution must commute. For `smesolve`, this means that each `sc_ops` must commute, as documented. For `ssesolve`, each `sc_ops` must not only commute, but also commute with other `sc_ops`'s adjoint, this last part being missing from v4's documentation. It also meant that the sc_ops needed to commute with it's own adjoint when using heterodyne detection... - `ssepdpsolve`, `smepdpsolve`, `photocurrent_mesolve`, `photocurrent_sesolve` removed.

Integrability,"bj` now supply `dims` and `type` information to the constructor so that instantiation time is down from ~50-100µs to about ~5µs. Notable removals:; - `eseries` and `essolve` are completely gone; - OpenMP is temporarily removed (though this will be added back in to the data layer later); - all functions in `correlation` and `qobj` which were marked ""deprecated"" are now actually removed; - `vec2mat` and `mat2vec` have been renamed to `vector_to_operator` and `operator_to_vector`; - all ""legacy"" files have been completely removed; - all previous scipy-CSR-like Cython code is completely gone (replaced by the data layer); - `Qobj` no longer defines `__array__`, and so will not automatically turn itself into one. Having this produced very inconsistent behaviour when multiplying by numpy arrays, or otherwise dealing with numpy functions. If you _need_ `Qobj` to be array, be explicit and call `Qobj.full()`. Notable changes in `Qobj`:; - matrix multiplication now contracts to a scalar if doing `bra @ ket`; - matrix multiplication no longer contracts 1D subspaces, but the new `Qobj.contract()` will do this; - arithmetic operations are much more strict about enforcing `Qobj.type`-safety; - `Qobj` understands the `@` operator to mean matrix multiplication, but also maintains the same behaviour of treating `Qobj * Qobj` as matrix multiplication. Package organisation:; - the solvers are now physically contained in `qutip.solve`, but are still logically available in the `qutip` namespace. This means that direct imports (like `from qutip.mesolve import mesolve`) will fail (it becomes `from qutip.solve.mesolve import mesolve`), but the ""proper"" unqualified access `from qutip import mesolve` remains unchanged. This is for internal code organisation purposes. The integral type used as the indices in the `CSR` type is now done by simple typedef in the files `qutip/core/data/base.{pyx,pxd}`, so changes it in those two files at compile-time will allow you to switch between 32-bit and 64-b",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1332:1329,contract,contracts,1329,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1332,2,['contract'],['contracts']

Integrability,"cade`: This module implements the method introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett 115, 060402 (2015)](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.060402) ([arXiv link](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06959)) to integrate the dynamics of open quantum systems coupled to a coherent feedback loop with a time-delay. I decided to refer to this method as the ""memory cascade"" method in qutip. The method essentially maps the non-Markovian problem onto a cascaded chain of identical system, where each system in the chain represents a ""memory"" of a previous version of the system. There is a companion pull request to the qutip-notebooks repo with two new notebooks documenting the usage of these two modules, qutip/qutip-notebooks#21:. examples/example-transfer-tensor-method.ipynb; examples/example-coherent-delayed-feedback.ipynb. Together with code docstrings, these two notebooks should give a good idea of how the modules are to be used. As you will see in the notebooks, the TTM implementation has a user interface that closely mimicks the `mesolve` interface. The solver is called `ttmsolve` and has the following syntax (explained in more detail in the docstring and notebook):. ```; ttmsolve(dynmaps, rho0, times, e_ops=[], learningtimes=None, tensors=None, **kwargs); ```. where `dynamps` is a list of pre-computed dynamical maps to learn from, `rho0` is the initial state, `times` are the times at which to find the solution etc. The ""memory cascade"" implementation however, diverges a bit from this standard. In general I think it will be hard to have a kind of unified interface for different types of non-Markovian solvers, because unlike the Markovian case, there is no unified theoretical approach, and different solvers work in quite different ways. For the ""memory cascade"" implementation I chose a more object oriented style for the interface. The user first creates a `MemoryCascade` object, storing all the relevant parameters, and subsequently calls class methods to runs simulation",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/405:1769,interface,interface,1769,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/405,2,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"ction calls between Python and C space, which largely affected small objects. The full aim, however, is to have QuTiP 5 support many different data representations as the backing of `Qobj`, and use the most suitable representation for the given data. This will not require every single QuTiP function to have an exponential number of versions for every possible combination of inputs, but only to have specialisations for the most common data combinations. This concept is the ""data layer"". All code examples in this PR are prefixed with. ```python; >>> from qutip.core import data; ```. ## Specification. The core to achieving this is fast, fully specified inter-conversion between all known data types, and efficient multiple-dispatch for mathematical operations. There are then four principle components of the data-layer:. 1. a creation routine which returns an appropriate data-layer type given some arbitrary Python object (`data.create`); 2. a routine which can perform the conversion from any data-layer type to any other data-layer type (`data.to`); 3. completely specialised mathematical operations (e.g. `data.add_csr_dense_dense(CSR, Dense) -> Dense`); 4. an object which provides multiple dispatch operations on its input arguments to use an exact specialisation (defined in item 3) if known, or uses the conversion routine (item 2) to convert the inputs into ones matching a specialisation if not: `data.Dispatcher`. The exported mathematical functions will all be instances of this type. The minimum work needed to define a new data-layer type is to provide `data.to` with two conversion functions; one into the new type from a current data-layer type, and one which converts the new type _into_ a current data-layer type. Once this is done, every single QuTiP component will be able to use the new data-layer type, although until specialisations are given which use it, it will always be achieved by conversion to another type, and conversion back.

New design elements under consideration:; - [improved `'type'` and `'dims'` handling for tensor-product spaces](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1320). Major breaking changes to QuTiP:; - `Qobj.data` is no longer an instance of `scipy.sparse.spmatrix`, but the new abstract ""data-layer type"" `core.data.Data`; - `bra * ket` now returns a scalar, not a `Qobj` (no need to do `(bra * ket).data[0, 0]` or `(bra * ket).tr()`) any more; - 1D subspaces in `Qobj.dims` are now never contracted silently (they were, but inconsistently before), but the new function `Qobj.contract()` can be called to do this explicitly; - `Qobj` no longer defines `__array__`, and so cannot be treated as if it is a numpy array. Having this led to inconsistent behaviour when `Qobj` was used in arithmetic with numpy arrays from the left and right, and allowed simple code to become `Qobj.dims`-unsafe _implicitly_. To get the full array view now, you must be explicit and call `Qobj.full()` - it is not enough to do `np.array(qobj)`, and this behaviour is consistent with `scipy.sparse` matrices.; - `eseries` and `essolve` are removed; - OpenMP is temporarily removed (but should be added back in before the release); - most functions marked deprecated as of version 4.5.2 are removed (e.g. in `qutip.correlation`); - `vec2mat` and `mat2vec` are renamed away from the terse MATLAB-compatible syntax to the more QuTiP-consistent `vector_to_operator` and `operator_to_vector`. Non-breaking changes:; - the internal file layout of the c",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1278:2175,contract,contracted,2175,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1278,1,['contract'],['contracted']

Integrability,"dnorm tests have historically been very flaky, and for as long as we're using random tests (which we possibly shouldn't be), we always run the risk of temperamental failures. In particular, the semidefinite solvers used in dnorm fail every now and again on random states; we historically haven't treated this as a bug, since it's pretty similar to an integration failing to converge because the system was too stiff. It means that the user has to adjust some settings and try again. To prevent this sort of error from failing our test suite, however, we can mark the tests as being allowed to rerun twice on a failure. We had a relatively small sample to judge the test failure rate by, but my very very approximate guess is that we'd have a failure about 1 in 10 runs on Travis. We counter this with two strategies:. 1. parametrise the tests in pytest style, so each random repetition is a separate instance, and known to pytest (some of this was done in earlier commits); 2. allow 2 reruns of every dnorm test. The two of these together should remove all random failures; since all random loops have been moved into pytest-handled repeats, there are far fewer calls to dnorm handled within each test. This means less chance that an individual test run will fail, but a slightly higher chance the entire suite will. Now with the test re-running a single failure point is tried again up to twice more, to determine if it was just a one-off, or if the test is truly broken. The reruns are handled by a pytest plugin pytest-rerunfailures. It's quite nontrivial behaviour to hook this in to the pytest mechanism, so better to use an external dependency to do it than to vendor in a custom version. The dnorm problems have resurfaced a little after lying dormant for a long time, because #1463 reactivated them. Before that, they'd not actually been running because none of the test runners had cvxpy installed.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490:351,integrat,integration,351,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490,2,"['depend', 'integrat']","['dependency', 'integration']"

Integrability,"e gradient I find using Numpy's gradient function. I also specify the step size that the gradient function should use. However, when passing the function and its gradient to Qutips mesolve function, i get the error:. ValueError: Shape of array too small to calculate a numerical gradient, at least (edge_order + 1) elements are required. I think this is because usually you would pass the whole array of time which Numpy would calculate the gradient of, but in the case of mesolve in qutip, we are passing a float instead of an array, i.e. calculating 1 time point which numpy cannot use.; I need the gradient function and its step size, rather than using the analytical gradient as a simply function due to the simulations I am trying to make. I would appreciate any and all insight into this problem, thank you. ```python; import scipy as sp; import numpy; from qutip import *; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. # pre define transport functions (time dependent functions for use in hamiltonian); def q_c(t,t_f,d): #position of ion; return d*(10*(t/t_f)**3 - 15*(t/t_f)**4 + 6*(t/t_f)**5). def grad_q_c(t,t_f,step,d): #velocity; return np.gradient(q_c(t,t_f,d),step). def grad2_q_c(t,t_f,step,d): #acceleration; return np.gradient(grad_q_c(t,t_f,step,d),step). def q_0(t,args): #position of trap (harmonic well); '''; t: time step; t_f: final time (total time); step: step size for gradient function; d: total distance of transport'''; t_f,step,d = args['t_f'],args['step'],args['d']; return grad2_q_c(t,t_f,step,d)/(w_z**2) + q_c(t,t_f,d). def q_02(t,args): #position of trap; t_f,step,d = args['t_f'],args['step'],args['d']; return (grad2_q_c(t,t_f,step,d)/(w_z**2) + q_c(t,t_f,d))**2. # set up initial conditions and parameters for ion; N = 200 # hilbert space dimension ; w = 2 * pi * 200e3 # angulr frequency of oscillator (Hz); m = 171 * 1.66e-27 # mass of ion (kg); hbar = 1 # reduced plancks constant (eVs) . # set up operators; a = destroy(N); n = a.dag()*a; x = np.sqrt(hbar/(2*m*w))*(a + a.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1834:1036,depend,dependent,1036,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1834,1,['depend'],['dependent']
Integrability,"e object satisfy the numpy `__array__` interface and can be converted by calling `np.array(netket_operator)` or `np.asarray(netket_operator)`. We can also obtain sparse representations (but there is no nice api to do that, so we simply provide a method `netket_operator.to_sparse()`. Variational states can also be converted to vectors or matrices (kets and density operators) as they also support the `__array__` interface. I would like our users to be able to call `Qobj(netket_operator)` or `Qobj(netket_state)` and obtain the corresponding qutip object. We could, in principle support a `netket_operator.to_qobj()` conversion method, but I am strongly opposed to that as this is an ugly design pattern: a way to construct a `Qobj` already exists, it's `Qobj(...)`, and the simplest-to-use api is, in my opinion, to overload this constructor to perform the conversion.; This is a standard design pattern in Julia, which I believe has the best ecosystem inter-compatibility thanks to a standardisation of this pattern through (multiple)dispatch. Numpy too, does the same, through the `__array__` interface: any object that defines a `__array__(self, dtype=None)->np.ndarray` method will be supported by `np.asarray` and `np.array`. Proposal: I would like QuTiP to support a `__qobj__` interface, meaning that your `Qobj` constructor should check if an object has this method, and if it has, then use it to convert it to a Qobj.; It should be relatively simple and involve adding another else-if in [your constructor](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/624405e7c49f7c25d0623451cff5a5a5d0544559/qutip/qobj.py#L333). ```; if isinstance(inpt, Qobj):; ...; elif inpt is None:; ...; ...; elif hasattr(inpt, ""__qobj__""):; data = input.__qobj(options); self.shape = data.shape; ...; ```; The only thing to do would be discussing the interface itself and document what it should return. This will allow other software in the future to integrate with qutip, too, and I believe will help shape the ecosystem.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508:2182,interface,interface,2182,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508,4,"['integrat', 'interface']","['integrate', 'interface']"

This new class can be used to predict measurement outcomes and post-measurement states for a variety of different quantum systems:. ```python; >>> import qutip; >>> H = qutip.operations.hadamard_transform(); >>> ket_plus = H * qutip.basis(2, 0); >>> z_instrument = qutip.QInstrument.basis_measurement(2); >>> (H * z_instrument)(ket_plus); {Seq(0,): Outcome(probability=0.5000000000000002, output_state=Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = (2, 2), type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[0.5 0.5]; [0.5 0.5]]), Seq(1,): Outcome(probability=0.5000000000000002, output_state=Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = (2, 2), type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 0.5 -0.5]; [-0.5 0.5]])}; >>> z_instrument.sample(ket_plus); (Seq(1,), Outcome(probability=0.5000000000000001, output_state=Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = (2, 2), type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[0. 0.]; [0.

Integrability,"e removals:; - `eseries` and `essolve` are completely gone; - OpenMP is temporarily removed (though this will be added back in to the data layer later); - all functions in `correlation` and `qobj` which were marked ""deprecated"" are now actually removed; - `vec2mat` and `mat2vec` have been renamed to `vector_to_operator` and `operator_to_vector`; - all ""legacy"" files have been completely removed; - all previous scipy-CSR-like Cython code is completely gone (replaced by the data layer); - `Qobj` no longer defines `__array__`, and so will not automatically turn itself into one. Having this produced very inconsistent behaviour when multiplying by numpy arrays, or otherwise dealing with numpy functions. If you _need_ `Qobj` to be array, be explicit and call `Qobj.full()`. Notable changes in `Qobj`:; - matrix multiplication now contracts to a scalar if doing `bra @ ket`; - matrix multiplication no longer contracts 1D subspaces, but the new `Qobj.contract()` will do this; - arithmetic operations are much more strict about enforcing `Qobj.type`-safety; - `Qobj` understands the `@` operator to mean matrix multiplication, but also maintains the same behaviour of treating `Qobj * Qobj` as matrix multiplication. Package organisation:; - the solvers are now physically contained in `qutip.solve`, but are still logically available in the `qutip` namespace. This means that direct imports (like `from qutip.mesolve import mesolve`) will fail (it becomes `from qutip.solve.mesolve import mesolve`), but the ""proper"" unqualified access `from qutip import mesolve` remains unchanged. This is for internal code organisation purposes. The integral type used as the indices in the `CSR` type is now done by simple typedef in the files `qutip/core/data/base.{pyx,pxd}`, so changes it in those two files at compile-time will allow you to switch between 32-bit and 64-bit.

Here I made things as hard as possible for the sparse routine (all elements non-zero), so this is probably the limit of the speed-up. ![1_local_vector_adaptive_backend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47875526/101932409-91f44900-3b8f-11eb-8b5b-7a00dabec2e4.png). **Other notes**; 1. I am a contractor for NASA, and they required a slight change to the license for the code I added. This is why I made two new files for this work specifically (instead of putting it in e.g. gates.py), which now includes a Copyright NASA sentence. I will talk privately with someone about this. 2. ~~I actually think that we could make a wrapper function `local_multiply` which can additionally take a backend 'sparse', so that it is easier to compare the above code, to one using the default sparse way (e.g. using the `expand_operator` type functions). I didn't do this yet as thought i'd see what thoughts are on this -- I can easily add this.~~ **Update (20/12/20)**: I just added some basic functionality for this. Will need to add more tests and maybe re-work it a bit still. 3. Currently the input local operator is expected to be square, and we do not take output dimension arguments. This means it keeps the system dimensions the same. This can be relaxed easily, but we probably need an additional output dimension list, which needs to be consistent with the input operator. Again, this is easy to do, but was not sure if it is needed. If I get time I might add this anyway. 4. There are some examples of the code in the docstring to see how to run it (and also in the tests of course). I also have offline a script to perform certain speed comparisons (vs the sparse routine), I can share some more results of that. I figured this type of script shouldn't go into the project, but I can also add this. **Changelog**; Added a local multiplication routine, to speed up certain dense matrix operations.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405:3319,rout,routine,3319,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405,2,['rout'],['routine']
Integrability,"ed-feedback.ipynb. Together with code docstrings, these two notebooks should give a good idea of how the modules are to be used. As you will see in the notebooks, the TTM implementation has a user interface that closely mimicks the `mesolve` interface. The solver is called `ttmsolve` and has the following syntax (explained in more detail in the docstring and notebook):. ```; ttmsolve(dynmaps, rho0, times, e_ops=[], learningtimes=None, tensors=None, **kwargs); ```. where `dynamps` is a list of pre-computed dynamical maps to learn from, `rho0` is the initial state, `times` are the times at which to find the solution etc. The ""memory cascade"" implementation however, diverges a bit from this standard. In general I think it will be hard to have a kind of unified interface for different types of non-Markovian solvers, because unlike the Markovian case, there is no unified theoretical approach, and different solvers work in quite different ways. For the ""memory cascade"" implementation I chose a more object oriented style for the interface. The user first creates a `MemoryCascade` object, storing all the relevant parameters, and subsequently calls class methods to runs simulations. I personally like this style, and I think it is a general style that could be used across a great variety of solvers. I could however in addition write a function with a more `mesolve`-like interface. It can't, however, be identical, as there are several special arguments that has to be given. There is also a separate class method that computes output field correlation functions, and I kind of like that the various methods are collected together in a class, instead of having multiple different functions that all have to be called with a long list of arguments. I therefore suggest the style used in the `memorycascade` module as a style that can be used for new solvers going forward. In general there will be a class with a name reflecting the solver, and this class has methods for doing various typ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/405:2610,interface,interface,2610,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/405,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"en setting an options. It is only used for `use_cython` which will error when trying to set it to `True` without cython installed. Otherwise, it will fail when trying to use the options. *Solver's options*; Each solver has it's option class (SeOptions, MeOptions, etc.) with only needed keys.This somewhat feel overkill since they are all the some for now, until mcsolve is merged. Each integrator also has an associated options and the solver options contain an integrator options. Conversion between options type will raise an error. When creating a solver options, it read the `method` key and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `bdf`. There is also a generic `Options` class that accept any keys used by integrator or solver and can be converted to any specific solver options:; ```; Options(futur_cupy_ode_specific_options=True) # Will work; Options(not_an_options=True) # Error; # For most solver:; __solve(..., opt=Options()); ```; Once options are associated to a solver, they are frozen:; ```; opt = SeOptions(); solver = SeSolver(..., opt); opt['...'] = ... # Ok, but solver has a copy and is unaffected.; solver.options['...'] = ... # Error; solver.options = opt; ```; This is because changing options without the solver knowing will not take effect. I removed saving / storing options for now. It was mostly used to store openmp threshold, which is not supported.; I also propose to write the stored options as python code when we restore it.

Integrability,"ent. Unfortunately, no alternative method has been discovered for calculating the diamond norm in the general case of CPTP channels. However, in the special case where we are trying to calculate the difference between two unitary channels, a very efficient implementation exists. This makes use of an unproved theorem on page 29 of [1]. I have proved this theorem and elaborated an efficient algorithm to calculate the diamond distance between two unitaries as part of my masters thesis. . The current qutip implementation makes use of the semi-definite program formulation in [3] and only uses a simplified calculation on 2 qubit unitary differences. The implementation of this novel approach is very simple - the hardest step involves diagonalising a unitary. Although time complexity is still exponential in the number of qubits, this implementation is far more efficient than the more general implementation. The Choi representation of the quantum channel isn't used and there is no need to solve a complicated semi-definite program (meaning I can do away with the `cvxpy` dependency). ## Empirical testing; Results of empirical testing on my machine are reported below. | | 3 qubit | 4 qubit |; |---------|---------|----------|; | current implementation | 5.22 s | 3min 21s |; | hyper-efficient implementation | 924 µs | 1.11 ms |. ## Proposition; Given the popularity of the circuit model and unitary-based quantum computation, I believe a very efficient implementation of the diamond distance for unitaries would be incredibly valuable for the research community. Given how simple the change is (current tests already cover the test case), I think it would be a simple and worthwhile addition to qutip. ## Citations. [1] D. Aharonov, A. Kitaev, and N.

The reason the tests are a little bit slow compared to, e.g., the tests in `TestMESolveTDDecay` is the computation of the fidelity of the states at all the different times. If you think the tests are too slow, i can change them, and for example only check the fidelity of the final state. As a side note: As I wrote this new functionality, I also ran some simple tests comparing a pure python implementation of the right hand side for `_mesolve_const` to the cython implementation (I did this because I was considering how much cython code I had to write, or if a pure python implementation of the new functionality would suffice). I actually found that a pure python implementation was as fast (or maybe slightly _faster_) than the cython implementation. The pure python implementation of the right hand side is simply (see lines 767-769 of mesolve.py). ``` python; def _ode_rho_test(t, rho, data):; # for performance comparison of cython code; return data*(np.transpose(rho)); ```. Here is a plot of the performance compare to the standard cython implementation for a very simple test. The benchmark was a damped-cavity JC-model with Hilbert space dimension 4 for the cavity, integrated up to ""integration time"". ""run time"" is the real run time on my laptop. ![benchmark](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2354542/11615553/48fe8604-9c32-11e5-83b9-2de366bd3cef.png). Since there is no big difference between the cython implementation and the pure python implementation (if anything, the pure python implementation is slightly faster), maybe it makes sense to replace the call to `cy_ode_rhs` with a call to `_ode_rhs_test` (see lines 744 to 747 in mesolve.py)? This makes the code a tiny bit easier to read. Of course, this was a single, very simplistic test. Sorry about all the merge commits. I'm still learning good workflow for this type of feature branch. Will use rebasing more in the future.

Integrability,"function to have an exponential number of versions for every possible combination of inputs, but only to have specialisations for the most common data combinations. This concept is the ""data layer"". All code examples in this PR are prefixed with. ```python; >>> from qutip.core import data; ```. ## Specification. The core to achieving this is fast, fully specified inter-conversion between all known data types, and efficient multiple-dispatch for mathematical operations. There are then four principle components of the data-layer:. 1. a creation routine which returns an appropriate data-layer type given some arbitrary Python object (`data.create`); 2. a routine which can perform the conversion from any data-layer type to any other data-layer type (`data.to`); 3. completely specialised mathematical operations (e.g. `data.add_csr_dense_dense(CSR, Dense) -> Dense`); 4. an object which provides multiple dispatch operations on its input arguments to use an exact specialisation (defined in item 3) if known, or uses the conversion routine (item 2) to convert the inputs into ones matching a specialisation if not: `data.Dispatcher`. The exported mathematical functions will all be instances of this type. The minimum work needed to define a new data-layer type is to provide `data.to` with two conversion functions; one into the new type from a current data-layer type, and one which converts the new type _into_ a current data-layer type. Once this is done, every single QuTiP component will be able to use the new data-layer type, although until specialisations are given which use it, it will always be achieved by conversion to another type, and conversion back. In this way, a new type can be added incrementally, with only the most common operations needing to be defined to get good efficiency. **Important caveat:** the data layer operates only on _exact_ types; subclasses of defined types will be treated as completely different types.

(`options = eval(repr(options))`, we may have some issue with circular import if called from `__init__.py`, but we can just write the `repr` of the `dict`.). While it's working fine as is, there are few point to discuss:; - Freezing options associated to solver work fine, but I see 2 alternatives:; - Options know they are used by a solver and inform it when modified. More complex but give the image that it just work. ; - All options instance are read-only. To change a key, you create a new options. Simple for us. To modify an existing options we could make it callable: `updated_options = old_options(atol=1e-5)`.; - Passing bad options keys or wrong options types (`mesolve(..., SeOptions)`) raise error, should we be less strict?; - Should we flatten SolverOptions.ode: ; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; And associated to it, where do we store default for integrators, per solver or per integrator.; - Do we add more sanity check to options values, or do we move `use_cython` to setting and remove the feature?. **Related PR**; It will cause conflict with #1710 and #1644. **Changelog**; Options classes using inheritance.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812:4023,integrat,integrators,4023,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812,2,['integrat'],"['integrator', 'integrators']"

For both states, `isherm` should be `False`. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 5.0.0.dev0+5fabdd3; Numpy Version: 1.26.3; Scipy Version: 1.12.0; Cython Version: 3.0.8; Matplotlib Version: 3.8.2; Python Version: 3.12.1; Number of CPUs: 20; BLAS Info: Generic; INTEL MKL Ext: False; Platform Info: Linux (x86_64); ```. ### Additional Context. The source of the issue is that `_prepare_state` ([link](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/solver/solver_base.py#L86)) and `_restore_state` ([link](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/solver/solver_base.py#L99)) of the `solver_base` module assume that the dynamics preserves the Hermiticity of the state. The `isherm` attribute of the initial state is saved and copied into the output state. We could try to detect whether the Hamiltonian is Hermitian / whether the Liouvillian is Hermiticity-preserving, but @Ericgig mentioned in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2408 that this solution could be difficult with time-dependent problems. As an aside, I just noticed another potential small issue. This code; ```; res3 = qt.mesolve(H, initial, [0, 1]); print(qt.ket2dm(res3.final_state)); ```; has a different output compared with the `res1` above (because `sesolve` is used, which can of course never produce non-Hermitian states).",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2410:2030,depend,dependent,2030,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2410,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Integrability,"he initial floquet modes, computing the propagator over one period, then using these to compute at other time, recomputing the propagator up to that time. When the modes at multiple times were needed, we could compute a list of them over one period using `floquet_modes_table`, but at least 2 computations over a period were needed. With the and the `Propagator` memoize capacities added in v5, only one computation of the propagator is required. Also with the table computation of v4, if a mode was not included in the table, the closest one was used. `fmesolve ` and `fsesolve` computed 100 slices over the period. It did not used the values in `tlist` and caused artifacts in the result. With `FloquetBasis`, the mode are always computed at the exact time. . I left the v4's functions with warnings. The construction of the floquet tensor was done using 2 functions: `floquet_master_equation_rates` which returned 4 tensors and `floquet_master_equation_tensor`. I added `floquet_tensor` which computed the tensor in one call and split `floquet_master_equation_rates` in 4 functions, one for each of the outputs. Floquet, like `brmesolve`, need a function for the noise power spectrum. Unlike `brmesolve`, string are not supported, only functions. We should have them match, but supporting string is quite heavy since coefficient are not a great fit. `fsesolve` have been rewritten without the class interface. As an integrator, the floquet method has no advantage since the propagator much be computed using another method. `fmesolve` work similarly to other solver. The `e_ops` are always in the laboratory basis. The result states are also in the laboratory basis. The option `""store_floquet_states""` is used to store the states in the floquet basis in `result.floquet_states`. In v4, there it an option for the environment temperature, but no tests for it. I kept the feature, but it's still untested.; Also all tests for `fmesolve` are either for constant systems or without collapse operator.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2034:1717,interface,interface,1717,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2034,2,"['integrat', 'interface']","['integrator', 'interface']"
Integrability,"heir projects, beginning in priority from the lead developers. . ## Other Funding Schemes; Similarly, I have been writing NumFOCUS [small development grants](https://numfocus.org/blog/fall-2018-open-source-development-grants), which have a different goal but can be set up similarly. Also, in the future we may apply again to [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). . ## Future Opportunities; Several senior researchers and team leaders have aired the desire to contribute to the project more actively. Setting up a space where they can propose projects, even on their own funding resources (most probably together with the development of research projects), in coordination with the lead development team, could help foster development in a more sustainable way. . ## Proposal; I propose to help sustain available projects in a more structural way than what is done now. This is an example of a what we could call a **QEP, or ""QuTiP Enhancement Proposal"".**. - One thing that could be done is to simply expand the existing Wiki. The downside of taking only this action is that only organization members can modify the wiki. So this could work, but mainly as a more static and cleaner staple. . - I propose to integrate the Wiki with Issues that contain the projects, adding a `projects` (or similar) label. This is in the spirit also of other large quantum open source projects such as Qiskit, which has even an ad-hoc `qiskit-community` repository, https://github.com/qiskit-community/. In QuTiP case, we could create a new repository similar to the notebooks one, e.g., https://github.com/qutip/qutip-community/. The downside is that in general the division is subfolders is not advised for easiness of maintainability. So one could just open issues with open projects. Of course, for physics questions, sometimes spilling in to PRs and Issues, qutip already has a Google Group forum, where I advise that this new capabilities may be advertised with a proper thread.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1132:2660,integrat,integrate,2660,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1132,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

I added the capacity to add a safety check when setting an options. It is only used for `use_cython` which will error when trying to set it to `True` without cython installed. Otherwise, it will fail when trying to use the options. *Solver's options*; Each solver has it's option class (SeOptions, MeOptions, etc.) with only needed keys.This somewhat feel overkill since they are all the some for now, until mcsolve is merged. Each integrator also has an associated options and the solver options contain an integrator options. Conversion between options type will raise an error. When creating a solver options, it read the `method` key and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `bdf`. There is also a generic `Options` class that accept any keys used by integrator or solver and can be converted to any specific solver options:; ```; Options(futur_cupy_ode_specific_options=True) # Will work; Options(not_an_options=True) # Error; # For most solver:; __solve(..., opt=Options()); ```; Once options are associated to a solver, they are frozen:; ```; opt = SeOptions(); solver = SeSolver(..., opt); opt['...'] = ... # Ok, but solver has a copy and is unaffected.; solver.options['...'] = ..",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812:1806,integrat,integrator,1806,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812,1,['integrat'],['integrator']
Integrability,"ith two new notebooks documenting the usage of these two modules, qutip/qutip-notebooks#21:. examples/example-transfer-tensor-method.ipynb; examples/example-coherent-delayed-feedback.ipynb. Together with code docstrings, these two notebooks should give a good idea of how the modules are to be used. As you will see in the notebooks, the TTM implementation has a user interface that closely mimicks the `mesolve` interface. The solver is called `ttmsolve` and has the following syntax (explained in more detail in the docstring and notebook):. ```; ttmsolve(dynmaps, rho0, times, e_ops=[], learningtimes=None, tensors=None, **kwargs); ```. where `dynamps` is a list of pre-computed dynamical maps to learn from, `rho0` is the initial state, `times` are the times at which to find the solution etc. The ""memory cascade"" implementation however, diverges a bit from this standard. In general I think it will be hard to have a kind of unified interface for different types of non-Markovian solvers, because unlike the Markovian case, there is no unified theoretical approach, and different solvers work in quite different ways. For the ""memory cascade"" implementation I chose a more object oriented style for the interface. The user first creates a `MemoryCascade` object, storing all the relevant parameters, and subsequently calls class methods to runs simulations. I personally like this style, and I think it is a general style that could be used across a great variety of solvers. I could however in addition write a function with a more `mesolve`-like interface. It can't, however, be identical, as there are several special arguments that has to be given. There is also a separate class method that computes output field correlation functions, and I kind of like that the various methods are collected together in a class, instead of having multiple different functions that all have to be called with a long list of arguments. I therefore suggest the style used in the `memorycascade` module as a",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/405:2340,interface,interface,2340,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/405,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"lid to add a vector in the Pauli-Z basis to one in the Pauli-X basis by element-wise addition, but QuTiP has no way of knowing if this is what the user is doing, and will simply allow it because the dimensions will match. This is still the case if the user used `Qobj.transform` to get from one to the other; it is one case where we have to trust that the user is doing the right thing, rather than enforcing correctness. In the future, the system proposed here could be extended to enforce this; the `dims` parameter would be renamed `basis`, and some unique identifier would be attached to each `Space` object. This would allow us to safely define basis-transformation ""operators""; they would have the dimensions object `Map(State(2, 'paulix'), State(2, 'pauliz'))`, or something to that effect. In #1320, I mentioned the possibility of a new `'scalar'` type object. Here, this is effectively the `Field` subtype. There is a choice to be made whether `Compound(Field, Field)` should be `Field` (implicit contraction of 1D spaces), or whether we should keep track of ""missing"" spaces. The missing spaces are useful in principle in QIP settings for defining local operations on subsets of the whole system, but right now we do not have the mathematics backend to implement this completely. For now, I propose we keep track of all the missing spaces; it allows this extension in the future, with no cost right now. ### Implementation details. All objects will be completely immutable, and all their construction arguments will be as well (e.g. `State` will take only `int`, which is immutable). This means that singleton instances can be found by looking them up in a global store, similar to Python's `builtin` package or its `import` system. The singleton nature of the dimension classes is achieved by defining `__new__` for the instances, and _not_ `__init__`. The former is effectively a class method, while the latter is an instance method; since we want instances representing the same object t",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1421:6493,contract,contraction,6493,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1421,1,['contract'],['contraction']

Integrability,"lly useful if one uses the Dense data layer, since otherwise there are conversion overheads which kill any speed-up (at the end of the day, we need NumPy arrays). The code has two 'backends', one using einsum as mentioned, and another using what I call a 'vectorization' approach (where the density matrix or vector is reshaped to a vector over the target qubits). Note: It will work on qudits in general (does not have to be qubits). **Performance**; I find, in systems where the state is dense (few zeros), one can get a speed-up of between 2 and up to around 10x faster (depends on the size and system etc). Of course, sometimes using the standard built in sparse routines are faster, so it really depends what one is doing. Attached is a wall-clock time comparison between the standard sparse way for a 1-local multiplication on a vector (using `gate_expand_1toN`), and the added code (dense local). N being the number of qubits. Here I made things as hard as possible for the sparse routine (all elements non-zero), so this is probably the limit of the speed-up. ![1_local_vector_adaptive_backend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47875526/101932409-91f44900-3b8f-11eb-8b5b-7a00dabec2e4.png). **Other notes**; 1. I am a contractor for NASA, and they required a slight change to the license for the code I added. This is why I made two new files for this work specifically (instead of putting it in e.g. gates.py), which now includes a Copyright NASA sentence. I will talk privately with someone about this. 2. ~~I actually think that we could make a wrapper function `local_multiply` which can additionally take a backend 'sparse', so that it is easier to compare the above code, to one using the default sparse way (e.g. using the `expand_operator` type functions).

Integrability,"me detail information for the GSoC 2020 project ""Error mitigation in QuTiP"". Unfortunately, I don't have writing access to the QuTiP GitHub Wiki page. I post it here so if anyone finding it nice could copy it to the Wiki page. I add some details based on the original description:. -----------------------------------; ## 1. Error mitigation in QuTiP; From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. . This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate. This part is gonna involve some physics and study of commonly used hardware platforms. The related code can be found in `",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1184:1027,integrat,integration,1027,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1184,1,['integrat'],['integration']
Integrability,"mes using the standard built in sparse routines are faster, so it really depends what one is doing. Attached is a wall-clock time comparison between the standard sparse way for a 1-local multiplication on a vector (using `gate_expand_1toN`), and the added code (dense local). N being the number of qubits. Here I made things as hard as possible for the sparse routine (all elements non-zero), so this is probably the limit of the speed-up. ![1_local_vector_adaptive_backend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47875526/101932409-91f44900-3b8f-11eb-8b5b-7a00dabec2e4.png). **Other notes**; 1. I am a contractor for NASA, and they required a slight change to the license for the code I added. This is why I made two new files for this work specifically (instead of putting it in e.g. gates.py), which now includes a Copyright NASA sentence. I will talk privately with someone about this. 2. ~~I actually think that we could make a wrapper function `local_multiply` which can additionally take a backend 'sparse', so that it is easier to compare the above code, to one using the default sparse way (e.g. using the `expand_operator` type functions). I didn't do this yet as thought i'd see what thoughts are on this -- I can easily add this.~~ **Update (20/12/20)**: I just added some basic functionality for this. Will need to add more tests and maybe re-work it a bit still. 3. Currently the input local operator is expected to be square, and we do not take output dimension arguments. This means it keeps the system dimensions the same. This can be relaxed easily, but we probably need an additional output dimension list, which needs to be consistent with the input operator. Again, this is easy to do, but was not sure if it is needed. If I get time I might add this anyway. 4. There are some examples of the code in the docstring to see how to run it (and also in the tests of course). I also have offline a script to perform certain speed comparisons (vs the sparse routine), I can share so",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405:2279,wrap,wrapper,2279,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

Integrability,"method` options, as it is in other solver.; - The method that was referring the homodyne or heterodyne detection is now the `heterodyne` keyword. ie before `method=""heterodyne""` now `heterodyne=True`.; - The default integration method is now `rouchon`, instead of `taylor1.5`. ie the method coming from a physic paper and not a mathematics textbook. . - The stochastic integration methods have been spitted in smaller chunk instead of the huge classes in _stochastic.pyx. I kept most methods, only skipping the taylor order 2.0 method. The python interface is kept very similar to the `Integrator` as `SIntegrator`, the main difference being that `set_state` and `get_state` use an extra random number generator with the time and state. The integration methods are usually 5%~10% slower than they where for medium size problems (shape ~100). Most method are computed the same way as before, but the rouchon method no longer use super operator, but keep the density matrix as a matrix and not an oper-ket. - The derivative computation for used by the integration method has also been split into multiple functions and made only available for `smesolve`. For there methods to be valid, the each diffusion contribution must commute. For `smesolve`, this means that each `sc_ops` must commute, as documented. For `ssesolve`, each `sc_ops` must not only commute, but also commute with other `sc_ops`'s adjoint, this last part being missing from v4's documentation. It also meant that the sc_ops needed to commute with it's own adjoint when using heterodyne detection... - `ssepdpsolve`, `smepdpsolve`, `photocurrent_mesolve`, `photocurrent_sesolve` removed. They are all less efficient variants of `mcsolve`. `mcsolve` already include the photocurrent in the output. - `general_stochastic`, removed. It is a mostly generic stochastic equation solver.

Integrability,"ng techiques to study quantum systems (open and closed). We are finalising the next release and as I am a big fan of extensibility, I would like our two frameworks to coexist and provide a sensible, easy api to work together.; Mainly, what I would like to do is provide an easy-to-use no-documentation-needed to convert NetKet's types to Qutip, so that it becomes easy to use it to check our variational calculations. TLDR: I propose creating and documenting a `__qobj__` interface so that arbitrary objects having this method will support conversion to a QuTiP Qobj. --. NetKet has mainly three types that are concerned: hilbert spaces, operators and variational states. ; Hilbert spaces describe the space every object is defined upon, and can be easily converted to your `dims` format. Operators are used to represent operators and super-operators acting on hilbert spaces. We use a very custom format roughly corresponding to a lazy kronecker product. Those object satisfy the numpy `__array__` interface and can be converted by calling `np.array(netket_operator)` or `np.asarray(netket_operator)`. We can also obtain sparse representations (but there is no nice api to do that, so we simply provide a method `netket_operator.to_sparse()`. Variational states can also be converted to vectors or matrices (kets and density operators) as they also support the `__array__` interface. I would like our users to be able to call `Qobj(netket_operator)` or `Qobj(netket_state)` and obtain the corresponding qutip object. We could, in principle support a `netket_operator.to_qobj()` conversion method, but I am strongly opposed to that as this is an ugly design pattern: a way to construct a `Qobj` already exists, it's `Qobj(...)`, and the simplest-to-use api is, in my opinion, to overload this constructor to perform the conversion.; This is a standard design pattern in Julia, which I believe has the best ecosystem inter-compatibility thanks to a standardisation of this pattern through (multiple)di",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508:1123,interface,interface,1123,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"np.inf; c_ops = (1/T_dephasing) * sigmaz(). ### Run simulation. tlist = np.linspace(0, 2, 10000); e_ops = [sigmaz()]; output = mesolve(H, psi0, tlist, c_ops = c_ops, e_ops = e_ops); Z_expectation = output.expect[0]; ```. ### Notes on system:. - The Hamiltonian is periodic and formed of two-pulses.; - H2 applies a full spin flip when applied for time 0.5, so if we start in a Z basis state then Z_expectation should change from +1 to -1 or vice versa. ### Problem:. - When I set c_ops = [], I get the expected behaviour of Z_expectation.; - When I set c_ops to be the zero matrix as in the code above, Z_expectation remains constant, even though this should give exactly the same result as setting c_ops = [].; - This effect seems to depend on the choice of initial state. For a random pure state, setting c_ops to be the zero matrix seems to give the correct result, but for a Z basis state I get the inconsistency.; - This effect is not reproduced by the Monte Carlo based solver, mcsolve. However, I would like to use mesolve if possible because it is much faster for the systems I am considering. ### Some further notes:. - I think this is something to do with the fact that the Hamiltonian is time-dependent. ; - If I just simulate H2, then Z_expectation oscillates as expected. ; - Additionally, if I swap the order of H1 and H2 in the Hamiltonian, then I get the correct result.; - Setting c_ops as the zero matrix results in a much quicker simulation time than setting c_ops = []. This seems somewhat counter-intuitive, since I thought setting c_ops as the zero matrix would force the program to simulate the evolution of the density matrix rather than the state vector.; - Given this, I wonder if mesolve is making an approximation to speed up the calculation which is not valid here. I would very much appreciate any insights into where this inconsistency comes from, and how to fix it. Since mcsolve does not reproduce it, I think this might be an issue with mesolve. Many thanks,.

Note: It will work on qudits in general (does not have to be qubits). **Performance**; I find, in systems where the state is dense (few zeros), one can get a speed-up of between 2 and up to around 10x faster (depends on the size and system etc). Of course, sometimes using the standard built in sparse routines are faster, so it really depends what one is doing. Attached is a wall-clock time comparison between the standard sparse way for a 1-local multiplication on a vector (using `gate_expand_1toN`), and the added code (dense local). N being the number of qubits. Here I made things as hard as possible for the sparse routine (all elements non-zero), so this is probably the limit of the speed-up. ![1_local_vector_adaptive_backend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47875526/101932409-91f44900-3b8f-11eb-8b5b-7a00dabec2e4.png). **Other notes**; 1. I am a contractor for NASA, and they required a slight change to the license for the code I added. This is why I made two new files for this work specifically (instead of putting it in e.g. gates.py), which now includes a Copyright NASA sentence. I will talk privately with someone about this. 2. ~~I actually think that we could make a wrapper function `local_multiply` which can additionally take a backend 'sparse', so that it is easier to compare the above code, to one using the default sparse way (e.g. using the `expand_operator` type functions). I didn't do this yet as thought i'd see what thoughts are on this -- I can easily add this.~~ **Update (20/12/20)**: I just added some basic functionality for this. Will need to add more tests and maybe re-work it a bit still. 3. Currently the input local operator is expected to be square, and we do not take output dimension arguments. This means it keeps the system dimensions the same. This can be relaxed easily, but we probably need an additional output dimension list, which needs to be c",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405:1949,contract,contractor,1949,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405,1,['contract'],['contractor']

Integrability,"om a superoperator, see, e.g., https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.quantum_info.average_gate_fidelity.html relating the average gate fidelity to the process fidelity, and https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.quantum_info.process_fidelity.html#qiskit.quantum_info.process_fidelity to compute that from a superoperator. I think it would be better to use that direct formula if the input is not already in Kraus form!. There is also a function `process_fidelity` in Qutip, but I'm having a hard time understanding what it's intended for. It doesn't seem to be the process fidelity explained in the Qiskit docs above. The arguments of Qutip's `process_fidelity` are called `U1` and `U2` suggesting they are expected to be unitary, but this is not checked. It is computed as `(U1 * U2).tr()`, which is not between 0 and 1, and doesn't give 1 as I'd expect if `U1==U2`. Does someone know the intended use of that function? If not, I'd implement the process fidelity as described in the Qiskit docs here, with several version depending on whether the input is Kraus, a superoperator, and maybe a chi matrix. Lastly, there is an issue with the tests - the lines; ```; class Test_dnorm:; # Skip dnorm tests if we don't have cvxpy or cvxopt available, since it; # depends on them.; cvxpy = pytest.importorskip(""cvxpy""); cvxopt = pytest.importorskip(""cvxopt""); ```; actually skip all the tests in the file if cvxpy is not available, not just the ones in the `Test_dnorm` class. The test output, if `cvxpy` is not installed, is; ```; $ pytest qutip/tests/test_metrics.py ; ============================= test session starts ==============================; platform linux -- Python 3.9.7, pytest-6.2.4, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1; rootdir: /home/florian/code/qutip/qutip/qutip/tests, configfile: pytest.ini; plugins: rerunfailures-10.1; collected 0 items / 1 skipped ; ```; That issue seems to be addressed on the dev.major branch.

Integrability,"onvert NetKet's types to Qutip, so that it becomes easy to use it to check our variational calculations. TLDR: I propose creating and documenting a `__qobj__` interface so that arbitrary objects having this method will support conversion to a QuTiP Qobj. --. NetKet has mainly three types that are concerned: hilbert spaces, operators and variational states. ; Hilbert spaces describe the space every object is defined upon, and can be easily converted to your `dims` format. Operators are used to represent operators and super-operators acting on hilbert spaces. We use a very custom format roughly corresponding to a lazy kronecker product. Those object satisfy the numpy `__array__` interface and can be converted by calling `np.array(netket_operator)` or `np.asarray(netket_operator)`. We can also obtain sparse representations (but there is no nice api to do that, so we simply provide a method `netket_operator.to_sparse()`. Variational states can also be converted to vectors or matrices (kets and density operators) as they also support the `__array__` interface. I would like our users to be able to call `Qobj(netket_operator)` or `Qobj(netket_state)` and obtain the corresponding qutip object. We could, in principle support a `netket_operator.to_qobj()` conversion method, but I am strongly opposed to that as this is an ugly design pattern: a way to construct a `Qobj` already exists, it's `Qobj(...)`, and the simplest-to-use api is, in my opinion, to overload this constructor to perform the conversion.; This is a standard design pattern in Julia, which I believe has the best ecosystem inter-compatibility thanks to a standardisation of this pattern through (multiple)dispatch. Numpy too, does the same, through the `__array__` interface: any object that defines a `__array__(self, dtype=None)->np.ndarray` method will be supported by `np.asarray` and `np.array`. Proposal: I would like QuTiP to support a `__qobj__` interface, meaning that your `Qobj` constructor should check if an ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508:1498,interface,interface,1498,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508,1,['interface'],['interface']

For a random pure state, setting c_ops to be the zero matrix seems to give the correct result, but for a Z basis state I get the inconsistency.; - This effect is not reproduced by the Monte Carlo based solver, mcsolve. However, I would like to use mesolve if possible because it is much faster for the systems I am considering. ### Some further notes:. - I think this is something to do with the fact that the Hamiltonian is time-dependent. ; - If I just simulate H2, then Z_expectation oscillates as expected. ; - Additionally, if I swap the order of H1 and H2 in the Hamiltonian, then I get the correct result.; - Setting c_ops as the zero matrix results in a much quicker simulation time than setting c_ops = []. This seems somewhat counter-intuitive, since I thought setting c_ops as the zero matrix would force the program to simulate the evolution of the density matrix rather than the state vector.; - Given this, I wonder if mesolve is making an approximation ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/898:2234,depend,depend,2234,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/898,1,['depend'],['depend']

Integrability,"ported options are not fixed. Most integration methods support `""atol""`, but `order` or `beta`, etc. are specific to some methods. SInce new integrators could be added by project such as qutip-cupy, `Options` can no longer be the place to list all supported options. It become little more that a dict. So I propose deprecating it. The documentation of `sesolve`, `mesolve`, etc. now list the options used by the solver and most common ode options and link the the integrator documentation. The class interface has the options property which document the options used by the solver and the integrators have the same. In the online documentation, the integrator api entries only contain the description of the method and the supported options. Since users don't need to call them directly, other methods are hidden and will be included in the dev documentation only. Usage will look like this, for functions:; ```; sesolve(H, psi, tlist, options={""store_states"": True, ""method"": ""lsoda"", ""atol"": 1e-5}); ```; and for the class interface:; ```; solver = SeSolver(H, options={""store_states"": True, ""method"": ""lsoda"", ""atol"": 1e-5}); solver.run(...); solver.options[""atol""] = 1e-9; solver.run(...) # run with the new tol.; solver.options = {""atol"": 1e-2} # only change the affected items. ; solver.run(...) # Also run with the new tol.; solver.options[""method""] = ""adams"" # reset all ode options, including ""atol"" supported by both.; solver.options = {""method"": ""bdf"", ""atol"": 1e-2} # reset all ode options then apply the new atol ; ```. Inside solvers, options are stored in a `_SolverOptions` which is a dict with frozen keys and feedback (chaging atol will reset the integrator).; ; Some `Intergrator` are slip so one method correspond to one integrator. Otherwise, `method` was an options used by both the solver to know which integrator to use and by some integrators. `Options` and `SolverOptions` still both exist for backward compatibility: they raise a warning but return the dict of the same opt",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1955:1194,interface,interface,1194,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1955,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"ps://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.quantum_info.average_gate_fidelity.html relating the average gate fidelity to the process fidelity, and https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.quantum_info.process_fidelity.html#qiskit.quantum_info.process_fidelity to compute that from a superoperator. I think it would be better to use that direct formula if the input is not already in Kraus form!. There is also a function `process_fidelity` in Qutip, but I'm having a hard time understanding what it's intended for. It doesn't seem to be the process fidelity explained in the Qiskit docs above. The arguments of Qutip's `process_fidelity` are called `U1` and `U2` suggesting they are expected to be unitary, but this is not checked. It is computed as `(U1 * U2).tr()`, which is not between 0 and 1, and doesn't give 1 as I'd expect if `U1==U2`. Does someone know the intended use of that function? If not, I'd implement the process fidelity as described in the Qiskit docs here, with several version depending on whether the input is Kraus, a superoperator, and maybe a chi matrix. Lastly, there is an issue with the tests - the lines; ```; class Test_dnorm:; # Skip dnorm tests if we don't have cvxpy or cvxopt available, since it; # depends on them.; cvxpy = pytest.importorskip(""cvxpy""); cvxopt = pytest.importorskip(""cvxopt""); ```; actually skip all the tests in the file if cvxpy is not available, not just the ones in the `Test_dnorm` class. The test output, if `cvxpy` is not installed, is; ```; $ pytest qutip/tests/test_metrics.py ; ============================= test session starts ==============================; platform linux -- Python 3.9.7, pytest-6.2.4, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1; rootdir: /home/florian/code/qutip/qutip/qutip/tests, configfile: pytest.ini; plugins: rerunfailures-10.1; collected 0 items / 1 skipped ; ```; That issue seems to be addressed on the dev.major branch. Would it make sense to take the test file from there and use it in the master branch also?.

Integrability,"ptions that `Qobj` with a shape of `(1,1)` with be a `Dimensions(Field, Field)` and not a `Field`. . Some previously valid and used list format are no longer accepted. Playing with of tensor of super operators, `permute` and `reshuffle`, you could make object with dims as `[[[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]], [[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]]` which can be interpreted as the tensor of 3 super operators. But then `[[[2, 2], [3, 3]], [[2, 2],[3, 3]]]` can both be interpreted as tensor of super operator or super operator of tensor spaces, so : ; - `[[[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]], [[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]]`: Error; - `[[[2, 2], [4, 4]], [[2, 2], [4, 4]]]`: list representation of dimensions of `to_super(tensor(oper, oper))`; - `[[[2], [2], [3], [3]], [[2], [2], [3], [3]]]`: list representation of dimensions of `tensor(to_super(oper), to_super(oper))`. Dimensions object have a `type` and `shape` set a initialization. There is a check when creating/ modifying a `Qobj` with between the data's shape and dims's shape and an error is raise when they are not matching. . Since operator-ket have a `superrep`, I added the `superrep` parameter to the Superspace instead of the dimensions, for now. But a better look at super operator representation is needed. At the present state, `Qobj.dims` take and return a list, keeping the dimension object internally. From there, minimal adjustment were made so test pass. The eigenstate fix in #1820 is already merged since it would create `Qobj` which dims and shape did not match. ToDo:. - [x] Tensor using dimension directly instead of list.; - [x] QobjEvo.dims use dimension object.; - [x] state and operator accept dimension.; - [ ] Super operator representation.; - [ ] Ptrace, partial_transpose and permute use dimension object (supported with enr states).; - [ ] Flags / new types for rectangular operator?; - [ ] List dimension manipulation function in dimension.py should support the class/ be integrated in it / removed. **Related issues or PRs**; #1476. **Changelog**",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1826:2799,integrat,integrated,2799,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1826,1,['integrat'],['integrated']
