Deployability,"> Here are more details from my local builds:. They feel like the opaque typedef (`Double32_t`) are (at the very least partially) no longer opaque (See in particular the ""new"" duplicate definitions complaint from the linker). In https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/45c0f48f3c3c631d291e0a7a32fd1ba292e79160, I see:; ```; TemplateDecl *TD = T->getTemplateName().getAsTemplateDecl();; ...; printTemplateArgumentList(OS, T->template_arguments(), Policy,; TD->getTemplateParameters());; ```; From the text in the long discussion, I am guessing that `TD` is now used to inform the printer on how to spell the template argument. I would bet that `TD` has neither the opaque typedef kept nor the default argument being made explicit (all done by `Utils/AST.cpp` and part of T (if I read correctly)). This would explain both the sudden need to request the default template argument and the error related to `Double32_t`. One solution might be to remove those 2 patches and instead to deal with the suffixes in `Utils/AST.cpp`. [Reminder the spelling of the normalized name is essential for backward compatibility; if the name must change to be more accurate, we might need to extend TClass/TStreamerInfo to smooth out the conversion.

If that wasn't the case, I'd have no concerns about continuing to carry the functionality in the compiler.; > ; > I understand that perception, but given this, do you prefer to improve the AST printing, remove it, or keep it ""rotten"" as you put it? We have significant coverage of it, and we can witness that it's doing a good job. I have two answers (sorry!). My preference is for someone to step up and maintain it because, as you point out, it can perform useful work that people are already using today and so it should be actively maintained. However, I don't have the time to commit to it myself, and code reviewers have never traditionally required patch authors to spend much effort on -ast-print support, so this maintenance isn't likely to happen without someone dedicating effort to it. If nobody steps up to maintain it, my personal preference would be to remove the feature, but it'd definitely require a community RFC to do so -- that gives everyone an opportunity to speak up about why it's critical to keep it (and hopefully drums up a volunteer to maintain it with more regularity). It's not at all clear to me how the community would react to such an RFC, and it's also not clear to me whether we'd need to do OTHER work to prep for removing the functionality (e.g., if ObjC modernization rewriting relies on -ast-print being ""good enough"", we might want to also rip out ObjC moderanization rewriting at the same time, which is another RFC, and so on). FWIW, I'd be happy to be a reviewer for any reviews maintaining or improving `-ast-print` behavior in community (not trying to apply pressure!). > We'd be happy to keep this change minimal, e.g. escape only what needs to be escaped rather than going all in on showing the original spelling of the source code.

Do you see a way forward to make this patch upstreamable?. I'm not certain I understand the goal of the patch (or the changes its applied over the top of). `writeValue()` and `writeDump()` are used for AST printing and AST dumping, so it doesn't seem correct to me to convert what the user wrote to be a raw string literal. Not only will that not round trip to what the user wrote in code (that's fine, it happens), but it can cause behavioral differences that might be relevant to consumers of the attribute information: https://godbolt.org/z/sb3o1oTYo. The AST printing behavior is wonderfully broken, but the AST dump behavior is somewhat more worrying; there's a difference between \n and an actual newline (for example, on Windows, the actual newline would be `\r\n` and not `\n`). That said, the test failures you're seeing are ones I would expect. For example, the failure in `AST/ast-print-attr.c` is specifically because we were checking that we round-tripped the user-provided argument, and now we're round-tripping it differently.

This is a good question. If you omit the type name for structs or collections, they become untyped structs or untyped collections. RDF can deal with this fully, the `RNTupleReader` currently only with untyped collections (transparently cast to an `std::vector`). In general, C++/framework code is likely to have problems with untyped structs because there is no class to read data into... Still, untyped structs and untyped collections are valid RNTuple data. For basic types, we cannot omit the type because the column only specify the on-disk type while the field type information gives the in-memory type. The two don't have to be identical (e.g. `double` in memory and `Real32` on disk). I thought we already documented the allowed combinations of POD type and column types but I now realized we didn't.

Deployability,"> I am not in favour of this solution.; I don't think is bringing any advantages, we were using a plugin manager that was based on the interpreter and there were no direct dependency on fftw3.; Now you require people to directly install fftw3 and they would need to set also the include path. It is an over complication for the users. You are right, when building ROOT with `fftw3=ON`, it brings zero advantages but only makes if more fragile because `fftw3.h` needs to be in the path. *Edit*: it just came to my mind that this might actually be a rare case. Right now, `builtin_fftw3*` is always `OFF` by default, also on cfmfs. So the `fftw3.h` header was already found in the include path at build time, which means it's probably found when running ROOT too. However, in case where ROOT is built with `fftw3=OFF`, this makes the difference between the `RooFFTConvPdf` even working or not. And this case is relevant because we release the ROOT binaries like this. Since we need to make sure that FFTs work in RooFit when people install ROOT on their laptops with the binaries, I think a fix like this is necessary. Maybe as a compromise, I could apply the these changes only in case where `fftw3=OFF` by using preprocessor macros?

[Here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/config/rootrc.in#L376-L391) we have a set of customization rules for ACLiC. We may want to extend this and if that configuration is set then we can call rootcling differently. On your side, you will 'just' need to alter the `.rootrc` configuration after building ROOT.

Deployability,"> I see, we can add that, thank you for the explanation. Why can't one add this environment variable to the invocation in the ROOT build in ROOT's cmake?. The build failure is a just a symptom of the issue. In fact, ROOT was already built and in its final step it runs a sanity check something like `root.exe -l -b -q tutorials/hsimple.C` to catch such basic issues early. I'd be happy if we could solve this in a nicer way, however I do not think ROOT has enough information about its build process (and I think it should not). For example, even if we detect where Vc (or other relevant information) was at build time, this does not mean a lot. We cannot be sure that it stays at the same place on the deployment node. For instance, CMSSW-like setups then, at install time, reshuffle things around quite a bit. That environment variable is there because of that - essentially provides a way for ""devops"" (to use a modern word here) to express extra knowledge which is (nearly) impossible to deduce at build time.

Deployability,"> My question was: is it possible to modify the ROOT-cmake-find script, so that it only forces the nlohmann-json-dependency if you are going to use ROOT7 classes? So to say, that depending on the `REQUIRED COMPONENTS` that you use in the `find_package` statement in your user code, it is more or less 'requiring'. That's an interesting question. 🤔 CMake project's can't easily do this. I mean, nothing is impossible, but it's not simple to do. As long as externals are handled through imported library targets (which I'm not sure the nlohmann_json dependency is used with 😕), one would need to tweak the behaviour of CMake in a pretty fundamental way for this. 🤔 You see, when you tell in (in this case) ROOT's build that library `Foo` needs to publicly link against library `Bar::bar`, CMake exports this information in the `ROOTConfig-targets.cmake` file. (That is a file generated fully by CMake itself.) It will say that `Foo` depends on `Bar::bar`. So at that point `ROOTConfig.cmake` has to produce `Bar::bar` in some way. Even if the user's code itself never wants to use the `Foo` library. Because CMake will not like it that it has the `Foo` library defined (even if unused by others), without all of its requirements met. So even if `ROOTConfig.cmake` itself doesn't look for nlohmann_json, if any of the CMake code depends on the `nlhmann::json` target (yes, there is such a target in CMake 😄), the CMake configuration would still fail. With a complaint about `nlohmann::json` not being known. 😦. So generally, projects that publicly depend on something else, always look for all of those dependencies with [find_dependency(...)](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.html).

In practice, this means that the same 'happenstance' you describe might not be true on other platforms. Furthermore the compiler is also allowed to re-order code in 'surprising ways' that would thwart/foil the assumption on the happenstance you describe. Thus our policy, consistent with the standard is that if a value can be updated while being read, it either must be an atomic or both the read and write must be protected by a lock.

Deployability,"> So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?. Sorry, but no, this is not acceptable if you ask me. In fact, the need for a patched zeromq raises a big red flag as that may make it not possible to ever use a system version of zeromq if your pull request gets stuck. I agree with Axel that the right course of action is to add the needed functionality to zeromq directly first, then add this work to ROOT. I don't think that time constraints should be used as a way to get hackish code into ROOT. Alternatively, if your addition is really independent to zeromq, you could just add it to the RooFitZMQ library instead, so that you can use the system version of zeromq as is. If in a later version they add your new functionality, you can then adapt RooFitZMQ to that in a new pull request.; ; > Then about the RooFitZMQ option: agreed, I should add an option for that. The only catch is that this PR is part of a bigger series and the ""real"" end-product that should be optional in my opinion is RooFit::MultiProcess, so I wanted to wait with such an option until that PR (hopefully I'll be able to submit that one today). In this PR, RooFitZMQ is not used for anything and later on it will just be a library for RooFit::MultiProcess as well, so there would typically not really be a point for a user to want to build RooFitZMQ but not RooFit::MultiProcess. Do you think in this situation it makes sense to add the option for RooFitZMQ already or should I just do it for RooFit::MultiProcess? So, this option (say `-Droofit_multiprocess=ON`) would activate both RooFit::MultiProcess and RooFitZMQ, and also builtin_zeromq.

As far as I can see there is no way to check this other than checking that the symbol is in the library.

The check was also never triggered, because it only happens if (ZeroMQ_FOUND), but ZeroMQ_FOUND hasn't been defined yet when the variable is checked.

However, this also skips a number of other actions. As a result, I end up with an assertion for a cast of `FunctionDecl` - probably because some internal state is not correctly updated.

Deployability,"> The function here seems to well behave for the analytical integral only when `z=0,beta=0, lambda <-1 strictly` In the current master implementation some of the logics on the parameter and sigma,lambda interplay seems to be not implemented. Hi, I'm also trying to use the analytical integral and I think the problem is that currently the RMS is used as the sigma parameter, but for `z=0, beta=0, 0>lambda >-1` the RMS is infinity. In `Ipatia2`, the definition of `sigma` changes when `lambda` moves from (-oo,-1] to (-1,0). This actually could cause problems in the fit as the shape does not change smoothly. Similar behavior happens in the current version due to the definition change of `sigma` for `zeta->0` and `zeta=0`. The definition of `sigma` in the current version is inconsistent in the `evaluate()` function and `analyticalIntegral` function (though commented out). When `beta=0, zeta=0`, the analytical integral could work for `-1<lambda<0`, but the `sigma` is not the RMS. This need to be fixed either in the code, or in the documentation. I suggest to update the `analyticalIntegral` code to be consistent with `evaluate()`. So the RMS will be:; 1. `beta=0, zeta=0, lambda<-1`: non-standard student t pdf, RMS = sigma/sqrt(-2(lambda+1)); 2. `beta=0, zeta=0, 0>lambda>-1`: non-standard student t pdf, RMS is infinity; 3. `beta=0, zeta>0`: RMS = sigma; 4. other: RMS is complicated, as given in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_hyperbolic_distribution. The user should use the pdf in two modes as the definition of `sigma` is different: 1) `zeta=0, lambda<0`; and 2) `zeta>0`. The analytical integral is provided for mode 1) when `beta=0`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7254#issuecomment-1169929120:1067,update,update,1067,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7254#issuecomment-1169929120,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"> The intent is the opposite. The RDirectory's internal representation and what it returns is a kind of shared_ptr. The user register the same name twice then if they hold a 'reference' to it, they keep and if they don't it is deleted. I do appreciate that as written it works and prevents a leak. New and delete have also worked for 20 years of root, and when written correctly do prevent leaks and get the job done, so there's no crisis of course. This offers a little more protection in some usages, but maybe new things to understand in others. I think stack-based lifetime management is simple, intuitive, encourages top-down code design and configuration, and avoids side effects. The smart pointer is interesting. It wasn't obvious to me that create would behave like shared_ptr::reset(), in the sense of allowing copies to persist (rather than redirecting some pointers they contain to the the new thing). . I kind of see a way now that it's possible to get the scalability (produce variable N plots at a time) without editing the PR routine. From my caller I'd need to call the subroutine, then do an RDirectory::Find() to get a shared pointer which will preserve the created thing, then call the routine again to get a new one. And if I still want to keep the first one for the interactive prompt, I have to make it global again with a new RDirectory::Add() of the contained thing, with a new name.

Deployability,"> The motivation for this patch is that cling should not adjust itself to the PCHs of the client, pretty much the same way as clang. That seems to contradict the goal that a ROOT build should be relocatable. Let me retry to explain better:. ROOT is built on machine 1 with some flags, e.g. `-DMACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.1` (just making this up). Now we try to run this package on a different machine, where clang would (e.g. because of the Xcode version) set `-DMACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.2`. Before this used to work because the compiler config is taken from the PCH. This PR will break this case. Typical cases might be:; - not all compile time flags made it from the build of ROOT to ; - not all flags passed to rootcling when building the PCH are replicated by the Driver. You should be able to try by building ROOT with `CXXFLAGS=-Dfoo` and then running the resulting ROOT binary without. This works in master and should fail in your PR. This has been a real issue, seen with macOS and experiments, which triggered me to take the PCH compiler config as the source of truth, and not an unrelated config determined at runtime and potentially clashing with what we had when building the PCH. I believe several experiments currently still use ROOT build with a PCH due to issues with modules. As a way forward I propose:; - try the `CXXFLAGS` test I mention above; - check with your preferred experiment currently using PCH in production, to assert relocatability e.g. onto grid nodes.

The `9*nbuffers` is meant to be for the keys and is now inaccurate (most algorithms have a 9 bytes header but for lz4 we have seemingly 73. This part is missing from the `RNTuple` usage. The consequences is that on data set that is not compressible `TTree` might use a bit more space (header + barely compressed size) vs `RNTuple` (uncompressed size which might be less than header + barely compressed size). This of course assume that the compression algorithm strictly respect the limit given (it would be a serious security risk if not).

That said, we are in a confusing situation, as I'm not able to reproduce the problem as soon as I recompile ROOT.

Unless I'm missing something, this means only RNTuple was affected by this and TTree was fine because of the slightly larger buffers? For now, I've opened backports for 6.30 (https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14624), 6.28 (https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14625), and 6.26 (https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14626). If we find that TTree is also affected, we can (and have to) open more backports. > A a side note, the extra size given by TKey and TBaskets probably should be removed (delta understanding why there was a +8 ""in case object is placed in a deleted gap"". Ok, we can try (in `master`).

Deployability,"> `explicit` will give a compile error. And really, if you're faced with a compile error, you'd better do the right thing: Use the normal default ctor. No it won't the cases where the TObject is explicitly passed to the constructor would still correctly compile (like in [gui/gui/src/TGTable.cxx](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/15451/files#diff-b4d685b49ccf5a970cd4c04abfd67249ec82a844dbabc8ba5dfeefdcbf2b496a) touched in this PR). It's only the case in the PR description with the wrong left-hand side type that would not compile anymore with explicit. So by using `explicit` we would keep more compatibility with existing code. However, there are also other reasons why this constructor is dangerous, even if it's `explicit`. Take this code for example:; ```c++; auto n = new TNamed;; auto l1 = new TList;; auto l2 = new TList{l1}; // let's say the user intended a copy here, but forgot to dereference l1; // it will still compile and call this ""dangerous ctor""!; ```; The signature is extremely easy to confuse with a copy constructor too. So maybe removing it is indeed better. You can use the ROOT deprecation macro for this (at the end of the declaration before the semicolon) like in this PR for example:; https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14954. And please add a bullet point here:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md#deprecation-and-removal.

Deployability,"@Axel-Naumann @pcanal I believe that there are too many places that need to be changed when changing the default compression. We should have a single source of truth for the default, and use its value everywhere else. So, instead of using `1` and `4` directly, it would be much better to use `ROOT::DefaultCompressionAlgorithm` or something similar to that. One good reason for this is that it's really hard to find which `4`s mean `LZ4` and which are just a regular `4`. It also seems that `R__HAS_DEFAULT_LZMA` isn't used anywhere, so it would be quite hard to set the default to that at the moment. Finally, when a user sets the default on his/her config file to something else, it will not affect any of these places where `1` and `4` are used directly in ROOT. That's made even worse by the fact that setting `-Dcompression_default=lzma` at CMake configuration time will not change any of these as well, which will definitely make users very confused.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2492#issuecomment-414648413:852,configurat,configuration,852,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2492#issuecomment-414648413,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"@Axel-Naumann I've updated the patch to use `TUrl` and always redirect. I updated the code comment and release notes to match. The way to disable the redirection then will be to set `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` to `0` in `rootrc`. Now the behavior should be consistent between plain `TFile::Open` calls and `TChain`. @pcanal I tried moving the code after line 4057 and using `expandedUrl` but it started showing errors like this when using `TChain`:; ```; Error in <TNetXNGFile::Open>: [ERROR] Server responded with an error: [3001] Required argument not present; ```. So I moved it back where it was before and use only the input `url` to `TFile::Open` as is. I tested that this now works both for plain `TFile::Open` calls as well as with `TChain` and the redirection always happens as long as the file being opened is on EOS.

Deployability,"@Axel-Naumann Thank you for looking at this! I thought of your approach also; using move semantics to transfer ownership means TGraph does not need to make a copy either. The idea on this branch is to demonstrate the potential for a significant performance speed-up in the constructor by not making a copy of the data. Additionally, sharing ownership with TGraph means a user can use the data for things apart from in a TGraph and/or update a TGraph after modifying the data. . In either approach, a user would still be able to use the existing TGraph constructors, however the ROOT file writing classes need an update to write `shared_ptr` or `vector` objects to a ROOT file. Thinking about this, another solution would be to use move semantics and to add a non-const accessor to the TGraph interface, which may work better when writing to a ROOT file.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9610#issuecomment-1056881682:434,update,update,434,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9610#issuecomment-1056881682,2,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"@Axel-Naumann yes, testing is one of the motivations, in particular continuous testing to prevent future regressions (now we can check against an external implementation, instead of just copying the current values and declaring them ""known-good""). The other reason, and why I think this might provide benefit for users, is performance: The original RANLUX implementation by James (at least its implementation in GSL) needs 40 seconds to sum 1 million numbers at luxury level 3, `gsl_rng_ranlux389` (luxury level 4) takes a bit more than 1 minute. The same sequence takes less than 8 seconds with `RanluxppCompatEngineJamesP[34]`, respectively (due to the LCG, you don't even pay for higher decorrelation!).; The difference is even larger for `std::ranlux48` (used directly, not through `std::uniform_real_distribution` which eats up more than one number per iteration): 2m55s compared to 12 seconds with `RanluxppCompatEngineStdRanlux48`. And because we can generate the same sequence, switching the generator won't change the output of a simulation / analysis / ... (only the interface is slightly different). Plus the users get the possibility to skip in the very same sequence without generating the intermediate numbers. Now we could argue that all users should switch to `RanluxppEngine2048`, which on top of that provides better seeding and even higher decorrelation. On the other hand, the implementations above have been around for some time now and are so widely available (`std::ranlux{24,48}` comes with any C++ compiler) that they will remain used...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8383#issuecomment-857732772:68,continuous,continuous,68,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8383#issuecomment-857732772,1,['continuous'],['continuous']

Deployability,"@MrCarroll we decided to clarify the meaning of this build option further by calling it `test_distrdf_pyspark`. Indeed, checking that pyspark is installed on the system and its dependencies are met at configuration time is needed only if it is foreseen that this feature will be actually used, e.g. when running the respective tests. In general, not all users will be interested in running distributed RDataFrame computations through pyspark, and for those who will the pyspark dependencies will be optional and only needed at runtime, not configuration time (i.e. what happens for a user of pyspark normally).

Keep `../../io/io` for instance ; - `make -j8` // this will creat `~/rootdoc`.

Deployability,"@amadio Thanks!.

So probably, the main question is: Which notation is correct / should be used, and in case it's the double-dot notation, should `root-config` stay backwards-compatible? . In case the actual change linked above was not intended, but was just about dropping the `sed` (which is a good thing to do! :+1: ), maybe defining a CMake variable using the dot-slash notation in https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/18b789c7ca051f09d84471fc948b410b61670f6e/cmake/modules/SetROOTVersion.cmake; and using it in `root-config` would be best.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14068#issuecomment-1815217164:279,release,release,279,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14068#issuecomment-1815217164,1,['release'],['release']

I believe this story has not ended. I suspect that the package maintainers will start complaining about that switch (has not yet happened) and we will have to revert again to no-rtti environment... . Perhaps the utopic model would be to use the `llvm-c` interfaces when communicating with llvm (or at least crossing the rtti/no-rtti worlds). The separation between `TCling` and `TClingCallbacks` and Cling standalone in software engineering terms does not really exist.

The whole idea behind the parallel unzip is to do as much work in separate tasks as possible so we can pipeline with the main user thread.; - Utilize the parent/child between relationship to know when all the TBB tasks have completed. This can be later used to know when it is safe to fill buffers from the next cluster. Allows us to avoid a read lock.; - @zzxuanyuan - hmm, I don't see this code in the current PR though?

I did not doxygen document everything, because most functionality was copy-pasted from the old RooMinimizerFcn. The new things are now documented though.; - Renamed snake_case to dromedary.; - Use unique_ptr for parameter lists, as suggested by Stephan.; - Remove a few obsolete __ROOFIT_NOROOMINIMIZER flags (I guess these are part of the merge conflicts).; - I realized that part of what I changed in PR #8596 could (and imho should) have been introduced here already. I moved functionality to RooAbsMinimizerFcn, namely storage of the to-be-minimized function and constant term optimization information, but did not yet remove it (in this PR) from RooMinimizer. Now it has been removed.; - While going over the above, I realized I had actually *completely* forgot to add back in a backwards compatible way of enabling offsetting for numerical precision! This has now been correctly added back in. Then, about what I did not change:. - I did not have time for doing the include reordering/optimization that @hageboeck suggested. I tried to quickly figure it out, but I couldn't change things fast enough and still be able to guarantee that everything will still work in the later PRs that build on this one. I agree it would be nice, but I hope we can postpone this to some future PR, perhaps after the other additions have been merged.; - As mentioned earlier, RooAbsMinimizerFcn is basically a way to reduce code duplication. This should be seen in light of RooGradMinimizerFcn as well (see again PR #8596) and will also be used for a later addition. I think removing all data members and also the protected vs private suggestion would complicate this goal.

All logging is now done through `MnPrint`, which gained a static method `Log` with a severity level, a prefix for the actual message (usually set to the class name to indicate the origin of the message), and the actual message, which can consist of strings and streamable objects. For convenience, there are methods `Error`, `Warn`, `Info`, `Debug`, which use a globally set prefix for convenience and to make the code more readable and less redundant. The global prefix is set with a scope guard. Thanks to RAII, this works also for nested scopes. .

Deployability,"@pcanal @bbockelm . The updates address some issues for random read case and the code should be good now. Some updates after last Friday meeting:. As we discussed last Friday, random read performance is very slow. It technically cannot be improved if we decide to use cache. I also tried random read workload with pthread. The performance was the same with tbb. I think the reason is obvious that reading next random event will invalidate current cache and all baskets need to be reset and cache buffer has to be filled by next cluster of events. Based on current cache replacement policy, the slow performance is reasonable. Philippe pointed out the common use case for ROOT should be mostly sequential reads plus little random reads. I was thinking it would be not helpful if we store decompressed baskets by main thread (when cache miss happens) back to cache. Because for sequential read, they will not be accessed again, neither random reads since the cache will be invalidate and all decompressed baskets in cache should be marked as invalid.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1010#issuecomment-335354319:24,update,updates,24,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1010#issuecomment-335354319,2,['update'],['updates']

Deployability,"@pcanal, my performance quest did not bring a lot of fruit unfortunately. The good news is that this PR does not introduce significant performance regression. There is 2-5% slowdown on some tests but I think the improvement of type consistency is worth it.

Deployability,"@sawenzel I get your point about thread safety, and agree that even the previous version was thread-unsafe, so I will deal with this later. The current version introduces a rather large critical section in `TGeoParallelWorld::InitSafetyVoxel` that blocks all concurrent threads even if they want to update the cache of different voxels, I would have pushed that lock a bit below where the update of the cache actually happens. But since this does not run in MT mode this is not critical now. Could you also do clang-formatting using ROOT style for the `bvh` part only (The entirety of TGeo is not yet formatted, but we will do it at some point), however the new files should be formatted. I looked and the internal thread pool is actually used for building the BVH in parallel, which is cool, but there may still be some unused headers, such as `sphere.h` - could you cross-check that and remove whatever is not needed?. The compilation errors on Mac are unrelated to your PR. Still, the compilation on alma8 with gcc8.5 fails, although it should not because the standard is set correctly to C++17 and the header <numeric> is included. ; ```; Error: /github/home/ROOT-CI/src/geom/geom/inc/bvh/v2/vec.h:99:17: error: ‘transform_reduce’ is not a member of ‘std’; ```; So @dpiparo what do we do about this since the `gcc` compliance with C++17 is known to be stable only starting with the gcc9 series? Why do we still test gcc8.5 with C++17?.

Deployability,"@sazio, as I said on the other PR, you originally based your local work on the `latest-stable` branch, which is only used by users to get the latest release, but not to check in new content into ROOT's repository. As you see in the change diff, there are lots of changes that are not meant to be there (that you should also have seen before creating the pull request, in the ""Review changes"" section). Also there are a number of merge conflicts. You must solve this locally before creating the PR. You must rebase your commits on top of `master`, otherwise this is not going to work. Here's what I would recommend, provided that your actual commits are on a local branch called `latest-stable`:; ```bash; $ git branch -m latest-stable tmva-variable-plotter # Renames your local branch; $ git fetch origin master:master; $ git checkout tmva-variable-plotter. # Rebase your 'tmva-variable-plotter' branch onto 'master', provided that the fork point of your branch was 'origin/latest-stable'.; # The default editor will open showing a number of 'pick' lines; just verify that those commits are part of your work. You may; # need to fix any merge conflict that might happen here.; $ git rebase --interactive --onto master origin/latest-stable. # If you mess up at some point while rebasing, you can revert to the previous state issueing `$ git rebase --abort`. # Then push your changes to GitHub and open a new pull-request; $ git push ...; ```. Afterward, you can open a new pull request with origin on `sazio:tmva-variable-plotter` targetting `root-project:master`. Other than that, I will close this pull-request, as it cannot be merged in its current state.

Deployability,"@sazio, please, don't try to open a pull-request targeted at `root-project/stable-branch`. This branch is only used for release purposes. Pull requests usually targe the `master` branch, which is then used to tag new releases. It seems (by the branch name), that your work is also based on some revision of the `latest-stable` branch: GitHub will tell you if there is any merge conflict when you create a PR targeting `master` (quite possible, as `latest-stable` is always behind master).

Deployability,"@vgvassilev I have updated the PR to include a similar patch for the SourceManager and at least the trivial test seems to work fine, including a nice 9MB reduction in memory allocations. I am now testing with the ALICE analysis framework. I have also done a few of the cleanups, and it now only exposes an ""expand"" interface (basically resize without shrinking). AFAICT, it's not worth to implement the full ""resize"" functionality, given it's complicated and at least the places I fixed never shrink. I think also the calloc approach might not be a good idea given realloc does not guarantee that the memory is zeroed and besides that page ranges might be a tad too big for vector of pointers and so on. I would put aside that idea, at least for now. My current plan:. * Verify with larger tests using ALICE analysis and asynchronous reconstruction.; * Unify the two PagedVector implementations I currently have (one for ASTReader and one for SourceManager).; * Use fixed size ranges, so that I can get rid of the ranges in my internal index and just keep where each page was allocated.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13000#issuecomment-1717257305:19,update,updated,19,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13000#issuecomment-1717257305,2,"['patch', 'update']","['patch', 'updated']"

Deployability,"@vgvassilev It seems that the changes in this PR provide the same performance as the current master (after the two hotfixes), while supporting leaving the `k*` constants in `TError.h` as `constexpr` so without producing a symbol in `libCore.so`. For `TString::kNPOS` I guess we want to leave the commit there since it was anyway a real fix to a bug. Another problem which is still present in both the current master and even after this PR is that the number of file operations is still quite high, i.e.; ```; 532 newfstatat(3, ; 29 newfstatat(4, ; 10141 newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, ; 546 openat(AT_FDCWD, ; 843 readlink(; ```. which are exactly the same whether current master or this patch. Consider that many of those `newfstatat` calls are spurious and I'm trying to understand where they come from. Take the following as an example; ```; newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, ""/home/vpadulan/programs/rootproject/rootbuild/reduce-symbol-search-release/gui/sessionviewer/input_line_11"", 0x7ffde442f050, 0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory); ```. Note the presence of the `rootbuild` directory, which is the path where I store the ROOT build artifacts, even though I am using ROOT from the install directory. I thought it was something in the machinery of `(T)cling` but so far my tests haven't brought me to any conclusion. Another suspicion is that the path to the build directory is hardcoded somehow in the `.pcm` or in the AST and doesn't get converted to the install directory.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14287#issuecomment-1867410890:115,hotfix,hotfixes,115,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14287#issuecomment-1867410890,5,"['hotfix', 'install', 'patch', 'release']","['hotfixes', 'install', 'patch', 'release']"

In some cases the script isn't sure if the typo correction works correctly and didn't do any changes. It also ignored a few system headers. See the report for a list of those cases. In the report every handled header guard is listed in the form; FILE; FOUND HEADER GUARD SYMBOL; HEADER GUARD USED IN THE IFNDEF. The script is available here: https://gist.github.com/Teemperor/767cbd5ec74a3c6444d9548414150c0a,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/341#issuecomment-278974049:47,patch,patch,47,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/341#issuecomment-278974049,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"After upgrading ROOT to 6.30, one of our applications also started giving us the error mentioned in this thread; ```; Fatal in <operator new>: with std::align_val_t is not implemented yet; ```; A little research led me to this: https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/aborting-with-std-align-val-t-is-not-implemented-yet-rhel-9-2/55989. If I understand correctly, this is the situation:. - `TMapFile` requires linking with libNew; - libNew is broken with -std=c++17 or higher (missing `operator new` overload); - ROOT 6.30 requires C++17; - Hence `TMapFile` (and actually all of `libNew`) is currently unusable in ROOT 6.30. There are no workarounds. Please elaborate if I am missing something. This is a bit of an issue. You do realize that EPEL 9 provides just such a broken version (ROOT 6.30.02 with -std=c++17). Hence, on RHEL 9/Alma 9 etc. (i.e. the current go-to version of Linux at many labs), anyone who needs to use `TMapFile` (or `libNew`) must downgrade to ROOT 6.28 and, possibly, compile by hand with -std=c++14. Additionally, on the latest version of macOS, Sonoma, only ROOT 6.30+ is supported. Hence, any code that uses `TMapFile` is inevitably broken at this time on the current version of macOS. The only ""workaround"" would be to downgrade (i.e. reinstall) the OS.; ; If I might make a suggestion: I would mention, or better: highlight, such regressions in the [release notes](https://root.cern/doc/v630/release-notes.html#release-6.3004) of a new version. Or better yet, not consider a new release ready until such significant regressions are resolved.

You can therefore make the writing work if you first evaluate your function with a normalization set, and make sure that the normalization set is still alive during `writeToFile()` such that the pointer is not invalid:. ```C++; RooArgSet nset{*myy};; morph_ND->getVal(&nset);; ; morph_ND->Print();; w->import(*morph_ND);; w->Print();; w->writeToFile(""test_workspace.root"");; ```.

Deployability,"As a heads-up: I tried this PR to integrate RNTuple merging into `TBufferMerger`. It needs some change (for example `RPageSourceFile` needs to work with a `TMemFile`, ie we need a `RRawFileTFile` that wraps a `TFile` pointer), but then it mostly runs through. The only problem is that this code doesn't consider merging into a ntuple that already exists in the output file. As a result, all pages will be there but the meta data will only have the cluster(s) from the last merge. What we probably need is the `RPageSinkFile` for the destination to load an existing `RNTuple` anchor and append to it...

Deployability,"At a fundamental level the problem is that `RDataFrame` has some homegrown logic to figure out the type of a branch/leaf that is sensible to changes in behavior of `TTree::GetBranch` or `TTree::GetLeaf`. The problem RDataFrame has with this patch is that in the following repro, in which a `TClonesArray` branch is added to a `TTree`, behavior of `tree.GetLeaf(""clonesarray"")` has changed: before this patch, it would return a nullptr (while `tree.GetBranch(""clonesarray"")` would return the branch; after this patch `tree.GetLeaf(""clonesarray"")` returns a valid `TLeaf`, so RDataFrame thinks the type of the branch is `leaf->GetTypeName()`, which is `Int_t` for this branch containing `TClonesArray`. I don't think this change in behavior is intentional given that the PR is supposed to fix retrieval of leaves by their full name, not change the behavior of retrieval of leaves with no dot in their names?. ```cpp; #include <ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx>; #include <TTree.h>; #include <TClonesArray.h>; #include <TH1D.h>. int main(); {; TClonesArray arr(""TH1D"", 3);; for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {; auto *h = static_cast<TH1D *>(arr.ConstructedAt(i));; h->SetBins(25, 0, 10);; h->Fill(i);; }; TTree t(""t"", ""t"");; t.Branch(""arr"", &arr);; t.Fill();. auto l = t.GetLeaf(""arr"");; if (l == nullptr) {; std::cout << ""leaf is null"" << std::endl; // this is what happens before this PR; return 0;; }. // this prints ""Int_t"", and it is what happens with this PR; std::cout << ""leaf has type name "" << l->GetTypeName() << std::endl;; return 0;; }; ```. P.S.; note that both before and after this patch, `TTree::GetListOfLeaves` does not report `""arr""` as a leaf:. ```; root [4] for (auto e : *t->GetListOfLeaves()) std::cout << e->GetName() << std::endl;; arr_; arr.TH1; arr.TArrayD; ```. P.P.S. it seems the problem is that with this patch `tree->GetLeaf(""arr"")` returns leaf called `""arr_""`:. ```cpp; ~/S/d/getleaf_problem root -l df_readwritetclonesarray.root ; root [0] ; Attaching file df_readwritetclonesarray.root ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6258#issuecomment-682390615:241,patch,patch,241,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6258#issuecomment-682390615,3,['patch'],['patch']

That alone would be a win before going on the fully reimplement that call. Yes, friends are still an issue, but they're not supported today either yet. Yes, people need to know a name, that is true today, and always will be: nature of dynamic languages like Python. Those operators are a total non-issue, as I'm doing expression-based invocation already in my version of TClingCallFunc (precisely b/c templates and function-style do not mix), so yes, if you still have the same old code there in ROOT then it's totally a problem for PyROOT, but it's already fine for cppyy.
