Modifiability,"Hi @guitargeek ,. Thanks a lot for checking this. I wonder what is the implication of this inconsistency in NLL values though. Does it mean a multi-range fit using RooFit is fundamentally flawed and should not be used?. In our use case, we are trying to obtain the values of the parameters in our background models by fitting to the data sideband. So we are more concerned about the best fit values of the variables in the workspace than the value of the NLL itself. Though from our validation plots, our background model shape obtained from the multi-range fit seems to agree well with the data. My question is then what is the right thing to do if we want to perform a multi-range fit using RooFit?

Modifiability,"Hi @hageboeck and @manolismih, thanks for you comments! Sorry for the late answer, it took me some time to come up with a better solution. Making the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` aware of the batchmode is the biggest challenge in this PR, as you have noticed.; Like Stephan suggested, I have tried no to pass as much information as possible in the constructors to hopefully avoid some of the new member variables I introduced here. In part I have succeeded, because now the cache optimization will now always be skipped in the construction in batch mode is enabled. So I don't need a `_originallyCacheOptimized` flag to remember if the optimization has to be reverted after the construction which was not the nicest hack anyway. Still, I could not do without a new `_batchMode` flag in `RooAbsTestStatistic` because the cache optimization can also happen after the construction via `RooAbsTestStatistic::constOptimizeTestStatistic`. Adding a batch mode flag to the constructor also required me to change all the constructor signatures of `RooAbsTestStatistic` and derived classes. I took that opportunity to revisit how the configuration parameters are passed such that if the future it will be much easier to add a new parameter. This has been a significant refactor, so I made a new PR with these changes excluding the `RunContextTracker` which we could introduce in a second step:. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7616",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7344#issuecomment-802953807:399,variab,variables,399,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7344#issuecomment-802953807,3,"['config', 'refactor', 'variab']","['configuration', 'refactor', 'variables']"

My hesitation concerns the new member variables in `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` that relate to the batched mode: I don't know if they should take part in the IO or not. On one hand, I don't know why flags about how the test statistic is evaluated need to be stored. On the other hand, the `_batchEvaluations` flag that is currently in `RooNLLVar` and that this PR moves to `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` [is not excluded from the IO](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooNLLVar.h#L82). I guess you had a good reason for this choice, so I kept the new flags in `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` also for the IO. You think this is the right choice?.

Modifiability,"Hi @henryiii, thanks for the contributions. I think that the tcmalloc space after the -L is something we need to fix. However, I'm not quite so sure about adding `ROOT::Flags` and `ROOT::Libraries`. These will be moving targets that may cause more trouble than they fix. We need to fix ROOT to only really pass required flags, not recommended flags. GeantV, for example, cannot compile against ROOT sometimes, because they inherit bad flags (think C++ standard). Also, `ROOT::Libraries` is quite generic and may or may not contain what the user needs, so if dependent projects use that rather than individual targets, they will certainly run into problems. However, for things like using `ROOT::RooFit` as convenience target already including `RooFitCore`, I think we should add the targets. With proper target dependencies, users will probably not need to list all targets, but only the ones used directly. So, if `ROOT::Math` requires `ROOT::Core`, that will be added automatically if you link against `ROOT::Math`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1959#issuecomment-387355022:423,inherit,inherit,423,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1959#issuecomment-387355022,1,['inherit'],['inherit']

Modifiability,"Hi @kratsg, thanks a lot for the detailed issue report!. I see the problem, but I don't understand exactly from your post and the linked pyhf discussion what the expected behavior is. Do you expect the XML schema to be updated to allow for this initial `ShapeFactor` nuisance parameter values, or do you want to prohibit that such a `Measurement` object can even be instantiated?. Both solutions have problems in my opinion. Restricting the measurement class would break usecases, and expanding the XML schema is promoting the use of a software component (HistFactory XML) that we consider as legacy. Both changes affect code used in production and are not bugfixes (but extending the HistFactory schema), so they can't be done for ROOT patch releases. So if I fix this one way or the other, the patch would only reach users by ROOT 6.30 which is who knows how many months away. We are currently working on a new IO format to replace the HistFactory XML, which is based on JSON (in the context of the HEP statistics serialization standard), and we plan for it to be ready for general use in ROOT 6.30 too. In that case, we can make sure that the models of the user in the pyhf issue thread are supported, such that he can share his model with his ROOT-using colleague via JSON. Therefore, what I suggest is to not start working on this issue now, and *only* if it turns out late in the 6.30 development cycle that we probably will not support this usecase in the HS3 JSON for some unforeseen reason, we can extend the XML schema. This way, we're sure that this problem is solved in ROOT 6.30. Does this sound okay to you, or do you have other suggestions?

Modifiability,"Hi @mkrzewic, indeed ROOT currently does not compile on FreeBSD.

Modifiability,"Hi @ynikitenko, thanks for the request! There are several reasons for not supporting PyPy. PyROOT, which is building on top of cppyy, is very deeply connected to the CPython implementation of CPyCppyy. Just like the CPython version of cppyy, PyROOT consists of a Python module and a compiled CPython extension (`libROOTPythonization`). And you can't use CPython extensions in PyPy. So to support PyPy, we would have to rewrite [all this code](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/pyroot/pythonizations/src), and work closely with the cppyy team to make sure it's PyPy implementation also provides the interfaces that PyROOT expects. That would be a *huge* amount of work with no usecase to justify it. And there are so many alternative of fast analysis frameworks that people are trying out right now: RDataFrame, NumPy, numba, awkward arrays, etc. And let's not forget that pypy has it's limitations! It only supports a restricted subset of Python, and it would require large efforts to port PyROOT to this. One final point: the future of PyPy development is not very clear. Right now, they don't support Python 3.11 yet, for example. Builds are only available for [Python 3.9 and Python 3.10](https://www.pypy.org/download_advanced.html). So investing in PyPy compatibility is also risky because of that. Imagine we would spend half a year trying to support it, and then PyPy would not be maintained anymore :(. I'll therefore close this issue as ""not planned"". tldr; the HEP community is gravitation towards other C++ native of jit-based Python packages to speed up analysis, and at this point investing in pypy is not worth it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8110#issuecomment-2148504771:419,rewrite,rewrite,419,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8110#issuecomment-2148504771,1,['rewrite'],['rewrite']

This description does not need to be a long text but a short synopsis of the utility. Adding example invocations would greatly increase its usefulness.; 4) You do not need to parse the header. I saw you now have a dictionary for the class. The autoloating and autoparsing will kick in and provide the ROOT typesystem with the necessary info. The direct usage of RunSumpleAnalysis should be discarded in favour of an explicit instantiation of a TSimpleAnalysis object (ROOT cannot autoload based on free function names); 5) ""Invalid argument set"" shall be printed on stderr; 6) The script must be compatible python2 and python3, e.g. for what concerns the print function; 7) The deciding factor for invoking the constructor with only the configuration file or the separate arguments is the presence of the ""inputfile"". The rest of the checks are not useful.

Second PR with the new `roofit` packages `multiprocess` and `roofitZMQ`, again with separate commits for the individual packages. I guess you'd have to exclude the multiprocessing test that depends on roofit at that point, though. In this PR, we can also discuss in more detail how to manage the zero MQ dependency.; 3.

Modifiability,"Hi Vassil,. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can; use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is; necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time,; so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator),; so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator; to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested; symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you; should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each; library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using; JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll; walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should; prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in; precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider; a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor; that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a; circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock; (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like; this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so""; provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and; resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""...; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in; the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1. The lookup for ""f"" finds and runs",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1274280300:477,refactor,refactor,477,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1274280300,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

Modifiability,"Hi, . Thank you Hans for your example, it was very useful for this case. . I have investigate this and I think the assert should be removed and there is no need of a warning or an error. The first time one iterates the first states comes from MnSeed and I think in that case the state is always valid (but not 100% sure); Eventually we could add the assert or (better) an Error but not at line 232, but at line 75, when we enter in the top function VariableMetricBuilder::Minimum. What we should maybe change is the logic around line 150. A covariance matrix is computed via MnHesse. This is done to check the edm.

Source integration (`add_subdirectory`) - oneTBB is just built from sources together with user project.; 2. Binary integration (`find_package`) - user project relies on pre-built oneTBB, it is supported through TBBConfig files inside oneTBB packages, for some distributions/versions it will work out-of-the-box, but for others it may require additional CMake variable to be set. [Here ](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/blob/master/cmake/README.md#tbbconfig---integration-of-binary-packages)is a short description of binary integration.

Or which system and which version have you used? . Concerning the ROOT versions (6.24.08, 6.26.10 and 6.28.04) on the Ubuntu 20.04.4 (gcc 9.4), those 3 ROOT versions all have been tested with gcc9.4, however, except for 6.28.04, the 6.24.08 and 6.26.10 both don't work with TApplication when the macro was compiled with the ROOT-CONFIG option of ""-Wl,--no-as-needed -lNew"". . Without the option ""-Wl,--no-as-needed -lNew"", the TApplication works properly as expected. Could you have a closer look at this issue?

Modifiability,"Hi, thanks for the question!. The standard way of do this in ROOT is to use [TParameter](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v612/classTParameter.html) or an `std::` container, as also discussed here:; https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/writing-simple-variable-in-root-files/11094/5.

Modifiability,"Hi, thanks for your comments! I tested the code now with a modified `rooArgusModel` example from https://root.cern/manual/roofit/. What I changed:; * Number of generated toy events increased from 2000 to 200000; * Changed fitting command to `model.fitTo(*data, RooFit::Offset(true), RooFit::Extended(false));`. The offset has to be enabled to cover the changes suggested in this PR. The extended term has to be disabled for the same reason that the offset subtraction has been changed in this PR: the extra term is of the similar order of magnitude as the Kahan sum over events but is summed with the Kahan algorithm. Therefore, the carry is lost and becomes zero. But if the carry is zero, we can't see what's different in the offset subtraction with this PR.

Modifiability,"Hi,. Thanks for trying to recreate it! I tried on my end as well, trying to recreate the code snippet the best I can in a standalone .cxx file. Unfortunately, I also couldn't obtain this ""Invalid write of size 1"" either. I have tried with the exact same pathways, same ROOT version, and same compiler. I copied quite a bit of code over to this standalone file from the project. My best guess is that it's a transient problem, and could be a side-effect of memory issues elsewhere in the code. My setup on lxplus while attempting to reproduce the problem; ```; > lsetup ""root 6.28.08-x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt""; > source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/contrib/gcc/13.1.0/x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt/setup.sh; > gcc --version; gcc (GCC) 13.1.0; > root -b -q; Welcome to ROOT 6.28/08; > g++ -o <output> <standalone_file>.cxx `root-config --cflags --glibs`; ```. My setup using setupATLAS when compiling the project ; (And tested with the standalone file as well); ```; setupATLAS; asetup AnalysisBase,24.2.27; ```. **Regarding the debug build**; I used the latest corresponding to `x86_64-el9-gcc13-dbg`; ```; source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/dev3/latest/x86_64-el9-gcc13-dbg/setup.sh; ```. However, this gives a ROOT version of ROOT 6.31/01, which is higher than what I compiled for (6.28/08). With this upgraded ROOT version, my project no longer compiles. (And since we don't plan on updating past the AnalysisBase release, I don't plan to fix the compilation error 🙂); If there's a way of obtaining a debug build of ROOT 6.28/08, I can try it. This coredump only started appearing when our compiler version changed from x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt to x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt, and we moved to AnalysisBase,24.2.27 from AnalysisBase,22.2.113.

If `!fDisplacement` missing, then some classes will fail. And second, probably some readers relies that `TBasket::GetEntryOffset()` returns array - even when fNevBufSize set.

Modifiability,"Hi,. This has been bugging me for a while now. 😛. ROOT has been exporting a CMake configuration for downstream projects (using ROOT) for a while now. But the exported/imported library targets at the moment can't be used with code like:. ```cmake; find_package( ROOT 6.10 REQUIRED ); add_executable( MyExecutable test.cxx ); target_link_libraries( MyExecutable ROOT::Core ); ```. In this case the build would complain that it can't find the ROOT headers that `test.cxx` may want to use. Even though the expectation against imported targets **is** that they would carry all information with them to compile any client code correctly. While the latter sentiment can take us quite far, as one could even argue that imported libraries should carry whatever compiler definitions/options the client may need with themselves, unfortunately this is not super easy to do with CMake at the moment. (For instance I don't know of a good way in which the imported library could impose the same C++ standard on the client project that ROOT was built with. While allowing the client project to use an even newer standard if needed.). So for now I'll just be satisfied making sure that at least the include directory needed by the ROOT libraries would be automatically propagated to clients wanting to link against them. This update takes care of that.

Modifiability,"Hi,; I think I have found a solution that fulfilles all requirements.; First of all the good news: I got rid of all double pointers and two dimensional arrays. I overhauled all the constructors and since I was already at it, I also added constructors which take a name and a title, as it is implemented for histograms. The notations without name and title still persist so the class stays compatible with all other TGraph objects. For the constructors which take y errors, I implemented one which takes std::vector<std::vector<Double_t>> as prefered by you and one which takes std::vector\<TArrayD\> which ist the implementation I prefer, since I still think one should use STL containers only when there is no way to achieve the same result with ROOT objects. Another change I implemented is changing the arrays that store the summed y-errors to mutable because that allows me to implement the functions GetEYlow() and GetEYhigh() inherited from TGraph with the exact same signature which eliminated possible problems with graph objects declared as constant. I hope I could fulfill all your expectations with these changes.; All the best,; Simon",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3452#issuecomment-564027666:932,inherit,inherited,932,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3452#issuecomment-564027666,1,['inherit'],['inherited']

Modifiability,"Hi; few comments after digging a bit in the code... . - it looks the problem is not in the RooDataHist itself but it's in the plotOn function. If you check the RooDataHist content, bin content is equal to the original histogram. The problem looks coming from this line [0]: if you comment it then the plot looks good.; - the plotting problem occurs also when you get a PDF from the RooDataHist using RooHistPdf. If you compare the PDF with the original histogram (scaled to have integral equal to one), the fixed size bin histogram looks good while the variable size bin histogram doesn't. In this case I didn't find how to fix the problem (the RooHistPdf code is a lot more complicated than the RooDataHist routine) but checking the behaviour of the PDF (i.e fitting the PDF to the RooDataHist), everything looks ok both for the fixed and variable size histogram.

I.e. CMake (3.20, on RHEL9) is very happy to find the built-in VDT for me. Even without having done any environment setup at all. I'm just pointing CMake at ROOT's installation location using `ROOT_ROOT`. Are you not pointing at ROOT's installed location in any shape or form? :confused: I didn't know that CMake would be looking for packages under `/opt` automatically. :confused: So, how is this happening in your environment? How does CMake find ROOT, but not VDT in the same location? Since now that I read a little about it, when CMake is executing code ""as part of a `find_package` call"", it does consider paths that were used to find the package in question.

Modifiability,"I agree that there is a problem, and it comes from the fact that you cannot easily depend on Vdt via targets when Vdt is builtin. CMake complains about headers in the interface which are in the build directory in that case, so a lot of workarounds are needed and no workaround works reliably across CMake versions. When I last touched this, we decided to use variables and rely on the fact that vdt headers were installed into the same place as ROOT headers when Vdt was builtin. However, when Vdt and ROOT are installed separately and into different locations, this doesn't work so well indeed. Fixing this is overdue, but we unfortunately have to keep it working for both builtin/external Vdt.

Modifiability,"I already told Axel I was ""playing"" with clang-tidy. Here are some first results, basically low-hanging fruits only. I also included some of my own TMVA patches (more progress bars / unordered_map) and code modernization for TMVA. Biggest improvement is probably the missing TString move assignment operator, that makes sorting a vector<TString> much much faster if the strings are too long for short string optimization. Most of these patches can be applied in any order, they do not depend on each other. We can discuss the large modernize-loops commit. I didn't have enough time to go through the loop variable names.

Modifiability,"I don't know if this is desirable or not, but I figured I would raise the issue. `TStreamerElement::ESTLtype` duplicates `ROOT::ESTLType` exactly, but with a lower-case `t` in `type`. It confused me when I found this out (and it turns out that I forgot to update `TStreamerElement::ESTLtype` when I updated `ROOT::ESTLType`). I could not find any usage of `TStreamerElement::ESTLType` in ROOT, and ROOT compiles just fine without the enum, but just in case someone out there is using it, I'm proposing to deprecate it in 6.24 and remove it in 6.26. Feel free to close this PR if you don't think this makes sense. UPDATE:. after discussion with @pcanal we decided that deprecation/removal is the right thing to do, and I extended the patch to `TDictionary` and `TClassEdit`. `TBufferJSON` had some usage of `TClassEdit::ESTLType` which has now been substituted with `ROOT::ESTLType`. UPDATE 2:. Since gcc 5 (the system compiler on Ubuntu 16) [does not support deprecation of enumerators](https://godbolt.org/z/1TEo5M), I'm proposing to disable `R__DEPRECATED` for that gcc version (it was already disabled for gcc 5.1 and 5.2 due to a different issue).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7234:720,extend,extended,720,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7234,1,['extend'],['extended']
Modifiability,"I don't really understand your question. 😕. [tutorials/eve7/boxset.C](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tutorials/eve7/boxset.C) doesn't seem to need `nlohmann/json.hpp`, does it?. The nlohmann_json ""library"" is a pure header ""library"". It does not need to be distributed with the ROOT binaries for those binaries to be functional. All the symbols from `nlohmann/json.hpp` are compiled into the ROOT binaries themselves. 🤔. You ""only"" need `nlohmann/json.hpp` when using a ROOT header in your own build that itself publicly uses `nlohmann/json.hpp`. For that you do need that actual header. So I'm still pretty convinced that this is a relatively simple mistake. The machine on which 6.30 was built, probably had nlohmann_json installed on it recently. And people doing the ROOT binary builds didn't notice that their build now picked up nlohmann_json from the system. This does shine light on a deeper issue though. 😦 The ROOT CMake configuration is a bit too autonomous for my liking. 😦 It will too easily turn features on/off based on what it finds. Instead of asking the user explicitly to specify what they want to have on or off. If it was up to me, I'd remove most of the automation in how the build figures out what it should do, and rather introduce a bunch of [CMake presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) to ease the life of the users a little. For the latter, we're using those pretty happily in this project for instance:; - https://github.com/acts-project/algebra-plugins/; - https://github.com/acts-project/algebra-plugins/blob/main/CMakePresets.json.

Modifiability,"I recommend not sourcing `thisroot.sh` multiple times in the same shell. That will mess up your environment. This is not related to install/uninstall. If you install ROOT somewhere with `make install`, just add `<prefix>/bin` to your `$PATH` and `<prefix>/lib` to your `$PYTHONPATH` and you should never need to `source thisroot.sh`. Also, if you install your own multiple versions of ROOT with `make install`, I recommend installing into an empty directory, not `/usr/local` where Homebrew may have installed it. Then you can just `rm -rf` if needed to uninstall. If you install into `/usr/local` with a package manager, just use the package manager to uninstall. Installing with `make install` a custom ROOT that overwrites another installation with a package manager is going to get you into trouble and `make uninstall` will not help much. With the uninstall target, if you change configuration before uninstalling, you may have half-uninstalled ROOT left over (e.g by enabling/disabling `pyroot_experimental` between make install/make uninstall), or may remove important files from other packages depending on what builtins you had enabled when you built ROOT.

Modifiability,"I replied via email, but GitHub does not seem to have picked it up, so posting here for good measure:. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time, so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator), so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ ( ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so"" provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""... ; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382:564,refactor,refactor,564,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

ROOT library targets propagate C++ standard, include directories, and link dependencies now, so I think that it's best to use those when linking instead of a generic target that may or may not contain the libraries you need.

Modifiability,"I see your issue with thread safety. However, your proposed solutions will not work for the following reasons. The assignment of the static variable in GetRootSys depends on the environment variable ROOTSYS (as does the others since they depend on GetRootSys). If the static variables are assigned at initialization time, these assignments will be done when the program is loaded before the program starts. But at this point the value of the ROOTSYS environment variable is not always set to the correct value. If the program is started without ROOTSYS set, TUnixSystem::Init will initialize it. The assignment of the static variable in GetRootSys must therefore be done after this. I have added calls to all the functions in the TROOT constructor, after the call to InitSystem. This way all the static variables get assigned by the TROOT constructor (which I believe is run single threaded). All subsequent calls to the functions will then not change the value of the static variables and are therefore thread safe.

If we want something more detailed, like ""this dataframe will run its computations on a dataset named XXX, stored in a container of type YYY placed at ZZZ"", then we're looking for more. For a ttree without friends, this would translate to. * XXX = name of the tree; * YYY = ROOT file / TFile; * ZZZ = path to the ROOT file. And for a csv table it would be; * XXX = None; * YYY = CSV file; * ZZZ = path to the csv file. If the dataset is horizontally extended through e.g. friends, then the information above is not sufficient to identify the full dataset RDataFrame will run its computations on. For a ttree, we would also need to print out XXX,YYY,ZZZ for any friend of the tree.

Modifiability,"I will probably state a few obvious things:; - Maintaining a single documentation (like the web pages and doxygen) is better than having several (partially overlapping, partially complementing) documentations around. For maintenance and for users to know where to look.; - If there is a man page it should be up to date (outdated information can be worse than missing man page, if there is no man page you look for other resources instead of wasting time with wrong information). Part of my motivation to make the update PR was that doing and merging the update is relatively straight forward and I can do part of the work for you. The possible deprecation and removal of the page is your business.; - What I like about man pages wrt the full online documentation is: works w/o internet (imagine bad hotel wifi or overloaded conference wifi) and changing from the shell to a browser and clicking through 4 links, just to look up if it was `root -e 'std::cout << ""hello world"";'` or `-c`, is a mildly annoying hazzle. Having a short cli doc at hand at the cli is convenient. (This also means that the man page doesn't need to go beyond documenting the cli behaviour).; - trying both `<command> --help` and `man <command>` to figure out which is available, is mildly frustrating. (That inconsistency is more a problem of all the software out there, and root can just catch that by having docs on both calls). So, my opinion: I'm fine if the man pages get removed for maintenance reasons (or possibly better get cut down to links to the forum and online doc). I would prefer if they stay (though tbh, I myself only use those for `root`, `root-config`, and `hadd`. And the one for `root-config` could even get shortened. e.g.: The ""how to use root in a cmake project"" is already findable on the web page, I haven't seen the same for bare make or autoconf as it's now in the man page).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1487#issuecomment-356994647:1640,config,config,1640,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1487#issuecomment-356994647,2,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"In 6.26, just don't use the RooSimultaneous and build your NLL as a sum of per-channel NLLs instead, using RooAddition. This is what I also do in the updated cross-check for the simultaneous fit in this PR #11455 ( see the `testRooSimultaneous` file). In 6.24 or older, you would have to further all all these multi-range normalization correction integrals to the RooAddition, like I introduced it under the hood in #7719. But I would not advice doing this unless you carefully validate that you implemented the math correctly. Then, I also have a little hack for you that would work in all ROOT versions: the whole problem **does not affect extended fits**, as explained in this tutorial from ROOT 6.24: https://root.cern.ch/doc/v624/rf204b__extendedLikelihood__rangedFit_8C.html.

Modifiability,"In RooFit, there are many functions that return pointers that are owned; by the caller. We can't change this interface anymore, but we can wrap; the return values transparently in a raw pointer wrapper that is called; a `RooFit::Owner`. On the C++ side, this helps to analyze your code and detect potential; memory leaks. On the Python side, we can tell cppyy to take ownership; of the object if the pointer is wrapped in a owning pointer such as the; `RooFit::Owner`. This is more flexible and convenient than the existing; cppyy way of flagging the CPPOverloads on the Python side with the; `__creates__ = True` attribute for at least two reasons:. 1. This flag can't be applied at the granularity of indivirual C++; overloads; 2. It's only on the Python side, so if you want to flag these functions; in C++ as well as in Python you have to do some bookkeeping. A unit test was implemented to check that the `RooFit::Owner` behaves in; Python as expected, and that there is no memory leaking when using; functions that return them. As a first example, the `RooFit::Owner` is used in the highly used; function `RooAbsPdf::generate`, so we also get quite some test coverage; from the tutorials.

Modifiability,"In SPlots, `RooAbsArg::attachDataSet()` is called on the input pdf,; redirecting the parameters of the pdf to the RooRealVars in the dataset.; This is not reversed, leaving the pdf in a corrupt state when the; dataset gets deleted.

This commit suggests to not attach the pdf to the dataset, as it is not; necessary. When looping over the dataset and evaluating the pdf later,; the pdf variables get synced with the dataset variables anyway. This was; done via `RooStats::SetParameters`, which is just a wrapper around; `RooAbsCollection::assign()`. I suggest to use `assign()` directly to make; more explicit to the reader what happens.

Modifiability,"In clang a transient file is a header file which is stored in the pch/pcm file. If this file does not exist, clang creates a virtual file of the unzipped stored file. However, if the file exists it compares the size of the file on disk and the size of the transent file. If the two sizes are different it does not complain (as validation is off) but it triggers an assert in when constructing and outdated clang::InputFile. The implementation disallows a overridden or transient file to be out of date. This patch extends the DisableValidation abilities to span not only for timestamps but we avoid checking the file sizes if the file is on the disk. And, instead we just create a virtual file of the file that we already have.

The `COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` are stored in the `module_defs` variable with; a generator expression:. ```; set(module_defs $<TARGET_PROPERTY:${ARG_MODULE},COMPILE_DEFINITIONS>); ```. Then, the definitions are added to the rootcint command with this; expression:. ```; ""$<$<BOOL:${module_defs}>:-D$<JOIN:${module_defs},;-D>>""; ```. This code was almost copied exactly from the CMake documentation; example:. https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html. In particular, the `BOOL` check makes sure that the if the target; property is empty, we will not get a bare `-D` with nothing after it,; corrupting the rootcint command. However, there is no protextion against the case where the; `COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` target property is not empty, but its elements are; empty strings! This happened to me in my recent build. Instead of trying to figure out where the empty strings are added to the; `COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`, it is better to also protect against empty target; property elements in the CMake generator expressions, which is; implemented in this commit.

Modifiability,"In the current C++ working paper:; [expr.prim.lambda]/10: ""A lambda-expression whose smallest enclosing scope is a block scope (3.3.3) is a local lambda expression; any other lambda-expression shall not have a capture-default or simple-capture in its lambda-introducer."". As we decl-extract lambdas we should forbid capture-defaults. But we decl-extract after Sema. So indeed - a post-processing step makes sense, but it should complain about *any* capture default. [expr.prim.lambda]/11: ""An entity that is designated by a simple-capture...and shall be *this ... or a variable with automatic storage duration"": this should be noticeable by Sema, except for transactions that declare both the variable and the capture in the same input. So here, too, we'll need a postprocessing step - but it's not as urgent. @marsupial - do you think you could widen the first check (i.e. forbid *any* capture default)?.

Modifiability,"In the current implementation of `RooDataSet::reduceEng`, the dataset; itself was queried to get the weight variable used in the reduced; dataset. This didn't work with the `RooCompositeDataStore`, because a; dataset with this data store doesn't have a weight variable, as these; are encapsulated in the components of the composite store. Hence,; reducing a weighted dataset with a RooCompositeDataStore yields an; unweighted dataset, which is a bug. To fix this problem, this commit implements a separate reduction logic; for the RooCompositeDataStore: the components are now reduced; individually, instead of naively creating a RooCompositeDataStore from a; RooVectorDataStore/RooTreeDataStore. To avoid further code branches in; RooDataSet, a new virtual function `RooAbsDataStore::reduce` is; introduced.

Modifiability,"In the previous PR https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7344, the biggest challenge has been to make `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` aware if batch mode is enabled to skip the cache optimization. The cleanest way of disabling the cache optimization is to do so directly in the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` constructor so it is skipped. Unfortunately, the constructor of `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` and its base class `RooAbsTestStatistic` has already a very long signature, and it is already challenging to correctly align all parameters correctly with the position they should have. That's why I propose in this PR to use a struct to group all `RooAbsTestStatistic` parameters. This has several advantages:; * the struct can be initialized with tagged initialization, so alignment errors can be easily avoided; * if a new parameter is added (such as the `batchMode` flag in this PR), only the configuration struct declaration struct needs to be changed; * the default values are defined in a central place and not redundantly in all the relevant constructor declarations/`RooAbsTestStatistic::create` overrides. To make the review easier, this PR only includes the configuration refactor and disabling the cache optimization is batch mode is used. The `RunContextTracker`-related commits would follow in a separate PR, but I already tested that everything together does work and the unit test I created for the `RunContextTracker` succeeds. Two open questions are still:; * the `RooNLLVar::_batchEvaluations` flag is now redundant, but I still kept it to not have to change class versions too often. Is this acceptable?; * the new `RooAbsTestStatistic::_batchMode` takes part in the IO, entailing an increment of the class version. I that acceptable?

Modifiability,"In the still relevant Jira issue [ROOT-10388](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-10388), it was requested to extend the RooFit crystal ball shape with the possibility to set different standard deviations for the left side and and the right side of the Gaussian core. An example implementation that didn't implement the analytical integral was linked:; * [RooDoubleCB.h](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Erasmus/blob/b58c1441bb4233b11b0b5bb5816fa268add7c97c/Bu2D0H/Bu2D0H_FIT/src/RooDoubleCB.h); * [RooDoubleCB.C](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Erasmus/blob/b58c1441bb4233b11b0b5bb5816fa268add7c97c/Bu2D0H/Bu2D0H_FIT/src/RooDoubleCB.C). This suggestion can be taken as an opportunity to improve the crystal ball shapes in RooFit in general. Right now there is the [RooCBShape](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofit/src/RooCBShape.cxx) that only has a left non-Gaussian tail and [RooDSCBShape](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofit/src/RooDSCBShape.cxx) that has two separately parametrized tails. The implementation of the RooDSCBShape is not super elegant because it has a lot of code duplication that would only get worse with the further parametrzation. To clear this up, we could implement one modern and fully parametrized crystal ball shape with a clear name like **RooCrystalBall** that can serve as a drop-in replacement for both RooCBShape and RooDSCBShape as well as cover the usecase of the asymmetric Gaussian core. Such a class and a rigurous test is implemented in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7257, which can serve as a starting point for this development. In addition to the commit suggested in the PR, there are a few more things that could be done to make RooCrystalBall the new standard:. * Write documentation.; * Implement batch computation interface.; * Maybe even deprecate the old shapes somehow.

Modifiability,"It turned out that my proposal to fix issue [ROOT-8510](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8510) had the side-effect of requiring the environment variable FC to be set to find the correct Fortran compiler under some circumstances. This should now be fixed. Finding out whether a compiler is found in Cmake seems to be really; hard. In particular a non-found Fortran compiler caused issues on MacOS; (ROOT-8510). The inital check for the compiler was. enable_language(Fortran OPTIONAL). This does not set the the CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER variable (or sets it to; NOTFOUND) if a Fortran compiler is not found, but still marks the; Fortran language as being enabled for the current project. This broke; the settings for BLAS/LAPACK. The second attempt (bb40ede3941d0b4f2db4e23d5f9c32b221eb5fac) was to use. check_language(Fortran); if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER); enable_language(Fortran); endif(). This does not find the Fortran compiler corresponding to the used C++; compiler. Cmake has some mechanism that if the C++ compiler is a GNU; compiler, it would also prefer GNU Fortran compilers. However, as the; check_language test is running in a separate process it would not know; about the C++ compiler. This is a problem in a set-up with executables; like:. /opt/newgcc/g++; /opt/newgcc/gfortran; /usr/bin/f95 (link to gfortran); /usr/bin/g++; /usr/bin/gfortran. Two versions of GCC are installed, one by the system, and one more; recent version in a separate directory. The directory to the newer; version is in the environment variable PATH before /usr/bin. In this; case the test from above (second attempt) would use /usr/bin/f95 as the; Fortran compiler, because Cmake usually prefers the executable f95 over; gfortran. This causes problems in case the two Fortran compilers are not; ABI compatible, i.e., gfortran 4.4 installed by the system vs. 4.9 as a; slightly more recent version. A simple enable_language (as in the; initial version) would correctly use /opt/newgcc/gfortran in this case.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/891:152,variab,variable,152,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/891,2,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"It turns out that this is already possible, although not enabled by default. The trick is that you need to give `TFile::Open` a properly crafted URL for the local file, and you need to enable processing of local metalink files by setting an environment variable first.

I have defined a range that contains the states I want to consider in the fit. I am trying to do the fit with pdf->fitTo(data,Range(""myrange"")).

Modifiability,"Just opening the PR to discuss the problem:; Jitting many `Define` (or `Filter`) calls currently incurs in major runtime and memory consumption penalties. This is because repeated calls to `Calc` or `ProcessLine` have a significant overhead w.r.t. a single call that jits the same code in a single go. Jitting all `Define` calls together (and together with all jitted actions) greatly reduces runtime and memory consumption. **Current issue:**; in code such as. ```c++; d.Define(""x"", ""42"").Min(""x""); ```. the `Min` action has no way to know the type of `x` because the lambda that produces `x` has not been jitted yet. Maybe we could defer even the creation of the strings to jit for the actions to _after_ we have jitted all the `Define`s, but this will require more thinking and more refactoring.; EDIT: the same goes for jitted `Snapshot`s, the formation of the string to jit must be deferred to after we have jitted and executed all `Define`s.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1313:786,refactor,refactoring,786,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1313,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

If anything else is still claiming the variables, they will not be deleted by the RooAbsData destructor. That's quite messy. For example, if the RooAbsData is destructed before the external ""claimers"" releases the variables, the claimers suddenly has the responsability to delete the variables themselves. And who of them should do it then? The ownership model is completely unclear.

Modifiability,"Many analyses and frameworks offer the possibility of using a semi-structured format to represent both the full dataset (in terms of the files that need to be processed) and some metadata attached to it. Most often, the files are split into multiple groupings, which are usually called ""samples"" or ""datasets"". A few examples of this pattern are:. * [AGC](https://github.com/iris-hep/analysis-grand-challenge/blob/main/analyses/cms-open-data-ttbar/ntuples.json); * [PocketCoffea](https://github.com/PocketCoffea/PocketCoffea/blob/main/datasets/DATA_DoubleMuon_local.json); * [WRemnants](https://github.com/WMass/WRemnants/blob/4068b8622fd54867ae779ee3d79a4d4aa270a4a5/wremnants/datasets/datasetDict_v9.py); * [Bamboo](https://gitlab.cern.ch/swertz/bambooexamples/-/blob/master/samples.yml). This helps a lot in keeping the configuration of the analysis dataset tidy and short, so that it can also be more easily shared to others and compared between different executions. But this also calls for a discussion on providing a standard schema that all frameworks could accept and digest into their own execution workflows. For example, it is quite natural to always include a list of files in each ""sample"". This new standard schema should support a few key features of the definition of a dataset:. * Specify groups of several input files, each with associated metadata; * Decide what term to use instead of ""groups""; * Cover TTree but plan for RNTuple support; * Should support friend trees per group; * Should support entry ranges per group; * No indexed friend trees (at least for now). One possible starting point would be (using ""samples""=""groups""=""datasets""):; ```python; {; ""samples"":{; ""sample_a"":{; ""treenames"": [""Events""],; ""files"": [""fa*.root""],; ""friends"":{; ""treenames"": [""Friend""],; ""files"": [""fr*.root""],; },; ""entry_range"": [0, 1000],; ""metadata"": {...}; },; ""sample_b"":{; ""treenames"": [""treeb_1"", ""treeb_2""],; ""files"": [""fileb_1.root"", ""fileb_2.root""],; ""friends"":{; ""treenames"": [""Frie",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11624:823,config,configuration,823,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11624,1,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"Minuit migrad minimization: 1. the setup phase where the initial gradient is calculated and 2. the line search phases. To make the above possible, a few bugs had to be fixed:; - `RooAbsL` classes have `evaluatePartition` which allows you to specify the range of events and components over which to evaluate the likelihood. This had some bugs: the extended term and possible subsidiary components were added for each partition, leading to N duplicates (for N partitions). Commits 3db2e0dd36478813cfb534451f459348e8d90da9 and c2a8bc9df029f65ee575e140825af6c509860538.; - As a result of this fix, which reorders some terms in the sum, the LikelihoodGradientJob test was failing for a specific case due to increased floating point differences. We would like to add back in an option for retaining bit-wise exact same results in the future, but since the minimization still converges to the same value within the desired precision, for now we leave it like this, since the user can still pick the old ways if they prefer their exact old results. Commit b7f7fa7b705e2dfb767187dce3f6a32275f30d9e.; - `LikelihoodJob` had a bug where it didn't reset its `result` sum variable to zero before doing a new sum. Commits 042e1577d8c303d532016537e7467d6e2fbfcd9c and 44197a2a64f77b47587e5ee200d360c4514b8098. Finally, I made a mini optimization in `LikelihoodJob` by using `publish_from_master_to_workers` more efficiently, which reduces communication overhead slightly (and makes the code a bit cleaner).

Modifiability,"Most ROOT developers and users seem to agree that autonomously toggling features at configuration time based on the environment is not good. The feature set that ROOT is built with is then not deterministic. In past cases, this already resulted in accidentally missing test coverage because features were switched off after environment changes. That's why for the CI, we are always building with the `fail-on-missing-option`. However, this is not only a problem in testing, but everytime ROOT is built. That's why this commit suggests to make `fail-on-missing` the default, and warn the users of potential future deprecation of this flag in the release notes. An interesting point is also that the `fail-on-missing` code path in `SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake` is much simpler, which also helps to reduce the margin for error.

Modifiability,"Motivation: we need to make sure that, if PyROOT is used from another process that will keep on living after the Python interpreter dies, PyROOT does not shut down the ROOT interpreter via `TROOT::EndOfProcessCleanups` when running its atexit handler. In that sense, this PR adds a configuration option to tell PyROOT if the teardown needs to be soft, i.e. we do not want to shut down the ROOT interpreter. Instead, in the soft mode, we only want (and need) to clean the objects that are controlled by PyROOT via its `TMemoryRegulator`. @Axel-Naumann @pcanal just one new thing with respect to what we discussed: in the function that does the cleanup of the objects in `TMemoryRegulator`, called `RecursiveRemoveAll` in my commit, we can only delete a C++ object found in the map if the corresponding Python proxy **owns** the C++ object.

Modifiability,"Moves from fixed page sizes on write to adaptive page sizes, following the original idea of @hahnjo . The new mechanism is explained in the tuning.md document in the PR. The PR also bumps the target compressed cluster size to 150MB. We may want to reduce that still. Evaluation of the new method is currently ongoing and the PR description will be amended with the results. EDIT: [Comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1maJhgvgVU8RkX7QXd7B3QiTBfKuYbTbvgkoHzBUOurY/edit?usp=sharing) of current write performance vs adaptive page sizes with 50MB, 100MB, 150MB target cluster size. To me it seems that there is not a good argument to go to 150 MB clusters. There may be an argument for 100 MB clusters. For the moment, I'll remove the commit that changes the default settings from the PR. An additional flavor, `adaptive / exp`, is included in the table to test the effect of flushing _foreign columns_. In the experimental mode, columns only flush themselves, which simplifies the `RWritePageMemoryManager` and avoids the upcall from the sink to the column. There is a small positive effect of foreign flushes on the file size in the nanoAOD sample. The effect is more visible for the number of pages. The memory consumption is slightly smaller without foreign column flushes. I'll see if I can construct an example that shows better the advantage of foreign column flushes (or not). As expected, the memory savings become visible for large EDMs (e.g., nanoAOD in this set of samples).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16311:40,adapt,adaptive,40,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16311,3,['adapt'],['adaptive']

Modifiability,"My 2 cents:. 1. It is extremly weird/ a bug that the webgui needs to depend on `TObject`.; 2. `RBrowserDataCleanup` derives from `TObject`, so it *must* have a `ClassDef` as per https://root.cern/manual/io_custom_classes/#the-classdef-macro . I am not sure about what using `ClassDefInline` as suggested by @pcanal would change; 2a. Can `RBrowserDataCleanup` just avoid inheriting from `TObject` completely? ; 3. `RBrowserData` has a dictionary and allows I/O, as it is defined in `LinkDef.h`, so it is only natural that its data members need a dictionary as well. As @hahnjo commented, the particular error coming from a `std::tuple` is due to the fact that the class uses ` std::unique_ptr<RBrowserDataCleanup>`.

Modifiability,"No, not really, this happens for TROOT::fFiles so this mechanism is already ""in action"". The problem is this is called via at_exit_of_TROOT() which is called by libc **after** libXrdCl.so has already been unloaded. That's why I proposed to strip off the cleanups of object lists held by TROOT and call this just before calling exit in TApplication::Terminate() --- at this point we are guaranteed that all the loaded libraries are still present. As a fallback when TApplication is not used and the user does not call TROOT::Terminate() manually (current behavior) one call the same method from ~TROOT, assuming it is not virtual (do people inherit from TROOT? :) ). @michalsimon is this correct?

Modifiability,"Note from the JIRA tickets:. Summary of discussion related to this ticket and https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9543. In the issue #9543, the unusual situation is the combination of:. * there is (intentionally) no dictionary for `std::map<int,std::vector<int>>`; * consequently we use an ""emulated collection proxy"" for that collection; * there is (unintentional due to external config) interpreter information/ClassInfo for `std::map<int,std::vector<int>>`. The crux of the issue #9543 is:. * TClass::fSizeof info prefers the information from the CollectionProxy; * TStreamerInfo::fSize is set to the value of TClass::fSizeOf; * TClass:New prefers the constructor from the interpreter; * TStreamerInfo::New was using TClass::New for that case; * On the failing platform, the `sizeof(std::map<int,std::vector<int>>)` is larger than the size of the emulated collection. Since the I/O and TStreamerInfo uses the TCollection proxy and all of TStreamerInfo needs to prefer the information from the collection proxy (including the 'sizeof'). To fix #9543 the solution is for; * TStremearInfo::New to prefer/use TCollectionProxy::New over TClass::New (i.e. the interpreted constructor in this particular case). Since we can access the emulated collection through the CollectionProxy, it makes sense to have `TClass` to be a way to access/use the interpreted instance. In order to be consistent (`TClass:New` already prefers the interpreted information), TClass::fSizeOf should be set the sizeof the interpreted instance. In addition to the patch mentioned at https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8273?focusedCommentId=76181&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-76181,; we also need the following changes:. * TClass::SetClassInfo needs to update `TClass::fSizeof` when a (new) ClassInfo is set.; * TStreamerInfo::fSize needs to prefer the value of `TCollectionProxy::SizeOf()` over the value of `TClass::fSizeof`",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9543#issuecomment-1013280108:389,config,config,389,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9543#issuecomment-1013280108,2,"['config', 'plugin']","['config', 'plugin']"

Modifiability,"Now I'm doing another thing, and return again to this issue. I want to make a 3-dimensional fit, but some pdfs depend only on z, so I multiply them by uniform pdfs on x and y.

So I have 5 pdfs for which I need to create a separate uniform distribution on (x, y), which in turn requires creation of new pdfs on x (and on y), which are all uniform and absolutely the same. This leads to 15 new lines of code, which is not that much, but seems redundant (as names and titles of the uniform distribution on all x) and even more error-prone (because of very similar code).

Modifiability,"Ok, I had another look -- also at the cmake documentation --, and I'm wondering now:; Why are we setting the optimisation flags at all?.

They didn't have an effect in the past, and nobody complained other than not being able to override them.; - If we think that `-O2` is better than `-O3`, it's fine to do it [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/f040e05154c9f4c9899cd6e2262c68a0af944ea5/CMakeLists.txt#L14) by setting one of the `*_INIT` variables.; - We seem to be able to use the same for linux as for Mac, so less configs, and for Windows we just don't do anything. CMake will figure it out.; - If you want asserts, there's two easy ways to get them:; 1. Configure with `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE=""-O2 -g"" ...`; 2. We create a custom build type assert using `set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_ASSERT_INIT ""-O2 -g"")`.

Modifiability,"Ok, we reached the first milestone: the upgrade builds on all platforms :tada: . The next step is to investigate the failures in ROOT's tests (but please don't look at the last test report from the new CI, it's incomplete because I messed up the paths when uploading the results; it was done properly in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13310). We have a couple of failures across all platforms, and the easiest to understand is that LLVM 16 prepends `class` or `struct` less often for C++ class types. Eventually this comes down to (on `master`):; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] A a; (A &) @0x7f8a3ca38000; root [2] struct A b; (struct A &) @0x7f8a33db2000; ```; whereas LLVM 16 now prints; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] A a; (A &) @0x7f025c5a6000; root [2] struct A b; (A &) @0x7f025c5a0000; ```. Similarly the following used to output (on `master`):; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] .Class A; ===========================================================================; struct A; SIZE: 1 FILE: ROOT_prompt_0 LINE: 1; List of member variables: -------------------------------------------------; List of member functions: -------------------------------------------------; filename line:size busy function type and name; (compiled) (NA):(NA) 0 public: struct A f();; ```; while with LLVM 16 we get; ```; (compiled) (NA):(NA) 0 public: A f();; ```; (funnily enough, `struct A { struct A f(); };` still outputs `public: struct A f();` for LLVM 16). This affects a couple of Cling tests and 3 ROOT tests: `roottest-cling-operator-runEqualTest`, `roottest-cling-template-separateDict-make`, and `roottest-cling-template-separateDictNamespace-make`. I propose we just update the expected reference output and be done with it.

A general note is that `rootcling` is a superset of `genreflex`. The argument parsing of rootcling is more helpful and we run extra checks in the context of `-cxxmodule`.

Modifiability,"Oops, the above wasn't enough for the ""revert"", I also had to replace the calling site (in `flexibleInterp`) with. ```; // return total * std::exp(interpolate6thDegree(x, std::log(low), std::log(high), std::log(nominal), boundary));; return total * interpolate6thDegree(x, low, high, nominal, boundary);; ```. This (together with using the old code as commented out above) indeed gets rid of the `nan`!. **I think the crucial part is that the old code checks for `high <= 0` and also `low <= 0`.**. Indeed, I traced the `nan` there: the sequence of events in this failing example is that `high` is zero, so that `std::log(high)` is `-inf`. Then `eps_plus` is also `-inf` and so `S` and `A` too, so you `-inf` times something negative (`t` happens to be negative in this example) so the term becomes `+inf` and eventually you get a `-inf + inf` and that equals `nan`. So, there's at least two options to fix this, both will need some conditionals added in again. 1. Going back to the original algorithm. If I understand the commit message of that change correctly, it was mostly removed because it required cached variables. As I rewrote the algorithm above, no more cached variables are necessary. Of course, it does involve more temporary values than the new algorithm, so perhaps this is another reason to pick the new algorithm.; 2. Adding similar `<= 0` checks to the new algorithm. I think this should take place at the call site, because it doesn't make sense for the other `interpolate6thDegree` usecase where no weird values are expected from logarithms. By the way, why is the interpolation taking place in logarithmic space instead of regular linear space and then transformed back into linear space after interpolation? Doesn't this also mean that the two interpolation schemes (FlexibleInterpVar and PiecewiseInterpolation) are again inconsistent? If the logarithm can be eliminated, I think we can do without introducing conditionals, no? That is, assuming the high and low vectors are fi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427:92,flexible,flexibleInterp,92,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427,1,['flexible'],['flexibleInterp']

With this extended struct, suppose we have a TChain at poistion `i` of the list of friends of the main tree/chain. Then we can have `fFriendNames[i] = std::make_pair(chain.GetName(), alias)` and `fFriendChainSubNames[i] = GetTreeFullPaths(chain)` . This way the chain can still have no name but we retrieve the full list of sub-tree names that is returned by `GetTreeFullPaths`. It would also help in recreating the friend chain afterwards because we would have all the information about every subtree whereas previously we only retrieved info about the first subtree in the chain. Of course `fFriendChainSubNames[i]` would just be a repetition of `fFriendNames[i].first` if at position `i` we have a TTree, but I think that's not an issue.

Modifiability,"Partial fix of #8708.; In a setup where ROOT was installed in a system directory, ROOT was picking up headers from that directory instead of its own. . ## How to reproduce:; 1. `echo '#error This is the wrong header' > /my/include/directory/RooSpan.h` (or a few other headers).; 2. Install some builtins into that directory, e.g. VDT; 3. `cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/my/include/directory/ <root>` to create a dependency to that include directory.; 4. Build. The problem only becomes visible when `A` depends on `B and C`, and `B` depends on something in `/system/include/`, and `C` is installed in those system includes as well. This generates a compile command such as:; ```; -I.../core/x -I.../core/y -I.../core/... -I.../A/include -I.../B/include -I/system/include/ -I.../C/include ...; ```. ## In this PR:; - Includes for VDT and XROOTD are fixed by making them `IMPORTED` targets, so their includes have lowest precedence.; - Some cheating where include directories are copied around between targets is removed. CMake should handle this.; - Some dependency and target management is simplified (or rather modernised with target-based cmake); - A broken dependency in RooFit is fixed, which was previously hidden by the cheating with include directories. ## What remains to be done:; It is likely that more builtins (or rather `FindXXX` have to be converted to `IMPORTED` targets, so they don't provoke this error again. A broken configuration can be detected by; 1. Having CMake pick up a dependency in some common directory; 2. Either; - Placing a lot of `#error`-ROOT headers in there or; - Searching `compile_commands.json` for `-I/my/include/directory/`; 3.

Modifiability,"Probably due to historical reasons, the Minuit2 code uses several systems to report errors, warnings, and debug info. Some of these only work when certain compile flags are set (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). I would like to unify these systems and use the MnPrint facilities consistently everywhere. This would have the advantage that debug info can be turned on at any time without recompiling and it has additional advantages for frontends to Minuit2, like [iminuit](https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit). I would like to work on this, but need some feedback before I invest time. ### Proposed changes. Currently, there are three systems to report info, errors, warnings, and debug messages. The latter two need to be enabled with compile flags (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). Examples from VariableMetricBuilder.cxx:. Direct use of the MnPrint facilities (this is the ""proper"" way); ```c++; if (PrintLevel() > 1) {; MnPrint::PrintState(std::cout, result.back(), ""VariableMetric: Iteration # "",result.size()-1);; }; ```; Use of MnPrint macros for info messages that are only enabled when WARNINGMSG is set; ```c++; #ifdef WARNINGMSG; MN_INFO_MSG(""VariableMetricBuilder: initial matrix not pos.def."");; #endif; ```; Use of DEBUG and std::cout; ```c++; #ifdef DEBUG; std::cout<<""VariableMetricBuilder convergence when edm < ""<<edmval<<std::endl;; #endif; ```; The latter two need to be enabled at compile-time. If they are enabled, there is no fine-grained run-time control, because the MnPrint system only distinguishes two verbosity levels 0 and 1. On level 0, only errors are reported. On level 1, errors and ""info"" are reported. I propose to enhance this by two more levels. - level 0: report errors; - level 1: all of level 0 + warnings; - level 2: all of level 1 + info; - level 3: all of level 2 + debug. and add the corresponding macros; ```c++; MN_WARN_MSG; MN_WARN_MSG2; MN_WARN_VAL; MN_WARN_VAL2; MN_DEBUG_MSG; MN_DEBUG_MSG2; MN_DEBUG_VAL; MN_DEBUG_VAL2; ```; in addition to the existing MN_INFO_* and MN",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421:779,Variab,VariableMetricBuilder,779,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421,2,['Variab'],"['VariableMetric', 'VariableMetricBuilder']"
Modifiability,"Probably to summarize: Following cmake best practise, all `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS*` should be set **before** calling `project(ROOT)` because the `project` calls finalises these variables.

Drawbacks at this point: . - Can't choose the size of the threadpool. HPX always proceeds with as many as physical cores.; - Breaks all RDataFrame tests that run with a specified number of cores/slots.; - Requires `#include <hpx/hpx_main.hpp>` in the script with the main.; - Compilation becomes more cumbersome, ending up with something like: ``g++ myProgram.cpp `root-config --cflags --libs` `pkg-config --cflags --libs hpx_application` - DHPX_APPLICATION_NAME=myProgram -o myProgram.out``; - Performance (benchmarking at the moment).

Modifiability,"RDataFrame currently has internal mechanisms to merge the partial results coming from different thread executions when running with IMT.; There is no possibility though to merge such results in a distributed environment, where the various chunks of the dataset are processed separately on different machines.; In this PR I propose a possible implementation of such feature, given the following requirements:; * The standard RDataFrame API should not be altered, i.e. first and foremost there should be no changes in the types pointed to by RResultPtr.; * To be truly portable, the result of the RDataFrame execution should know how to merge itself with another result of the same type and the result of the merge operation should still know how to merge again. To this end, a new function called `GetMergeableValue` takes as input an RResultPtr<T> , e.g. the last action node of the graph, and returns an `RMergeableValue<T>*`, a new class that satisfies the previous requirements. The choice of creating a new class instead of, for example, returning the standard return value plus a function to merge two values of that type, has to do with the second requirement above.; In fact, while this could be feasible with the return value of a `Count` operation (the merge function would just be the sum of the two count values), it would not be enough for all operations.; Notably, to merge results of two `Mean` operations we would need also the counts of each mean to merge them as a weighted mean, so the function would take 4 parameters of which at most 2 are known beforehand (the mean and the counts of the action that is currently being examined by the GetMergeableValue function), while the other 2 parameters wouldn't be known until the user tries to perform the Merge on the two values. RMergeableValue is created after the execution of the computation graph from the information contained in the various action helpers in ""tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/ActionHelpers.hxx"".; RMergeableValue itself",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5552:567,portab,portable,567,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5552,1,['portab'],['portable']

Modifiability,"Re-joining the discussion a bit late... Installing debug symbols for our analysis releases on CVMFS would be pretty difficult. Our builds do produce a separate RPM for the debug symbols of our own code. (Though we didn't even use that machinery for the analysis releases yet.) But when we build XRootD for our standalone analysis release, we don't bother with the ""RelWithDebInfo"" CMake build mode. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0/External/XRootD/CMakeLists.txt#L55-60. This is because every ""external project"" has a different implementation for this. And coding up how we would produce just one ""ATLAS RPM"" that contains just the debug symbol files for all the externals seemed way too much trouble. For such debugging we would use a full-on Debug build instead. But the more relevant thing: Does XRootD, or any of the I/O libraries that it uses, make use of OpenMP? Putting aside all the weird linking issue possibilities, the one unusual thing that RD's MCFM build does is that it sets the following environment variable for the jobs:. ```sh; export OMP_STACKSIZE=16000; ```. Since apparently MCFM does use OpenMP. (This I checked.) Though I don't know why this variable would need to be set manually. With a quick Google search I saw that for instance gfal, at least at one point, used OpenMP. So I wonder if maybe OpenMP is responsible for something here. It shouldn't interfere with ROOT's usage of TBB (at least I don't think so), but maybe with some I/O library?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6948#issuecomment-760888600:1038,variab,variable,1038,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6948#issuecomment-760888600,2,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"Remaining points and questions arising from @hageboeck's review:. 1. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672508683 Should RooRealL have I/O? It is currently disabled by setting ClassDef version to 0.; 2. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672509759 RooFit naming convention puts underscores in front of member names. This is discouraged, since underscore prefix is reserved for C++ implementations. I introduced some new members with underscore suffix instead, which is also common practice e.g. in the Google C++ guidelines. I think this is not something we should spend too much time on now, but maybe good to keep in mind for the future.; 3. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672519457 The configuration parameters (GlobalObservables etc.): should we unify them or keep like this?; 4. https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#discussion_r672538377 This should be checked by Wouter. In addition, some other remaining questions:; 1. `testRooRealL.getValRooAddition` fails because it doesn't know `RooFormulaVar`... I'm not sure what this means, but I vaguely remember that (I think) @hageboeck and @cburgard were talking about this, so I was hoping you may be able to help me out with fixing that test.; 2. In an ideal world I would have liked to add a serial implementation of the `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` class. Probably, we can reuse a lot of `RooGradMinimizerFcn` for this and it should be rather straightforward. However, this will take time. The advantage would be that we could add a test to this PR that covers all that is added, basically by just running a minimization. Note that I do have such a full-coverage test, but only for the MultiProcess minimization, where I implemented `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` in the parallel `LikelihoodGradientJob` class. So this test will come in ""PR 7"" (see overview). So, up for discussion, two choices: A: add (probably mostly useless except for testing this PR) ""Likelih",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#issuecomment-915217168:765,config,configuration,765,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#issuecomment-915217168,1,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"Removed the false comment and moved the `unique_ptr` declaration above `TextInputHolder`, in case `TextInputHolder::~TextInputHolder()` still access it (in the future). However, I am thinking about enhancing CLI completion support of cling. Such as tab completion. Currently cling only prints completion suggestion but does not complete the input buffer for the user when only single unambiguous completion exists. Also the completion does not recognize meta command like `.x`, `.L` so it does not try to complete its arguments (paths). And the path does not expand `~` to home dir.; @Axel-Naumann , do you think it is a good idea for cling to adopt `llvm::LineEditor` ? (https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1LineEditor.html) ; Or building cling's own readline/libedit wrapper? ; `core/textinput/src/textinput/doc/textinput.txt` states that `textinput` is created to avoid depending on readline/libedit in year 2011.; Is it still true today 2022? cling highly depends on llvm now so it should be fine to adopt `llvm::LineEditor` (created in 2013. `textinput` predates it).; I have a prototype cling with the above enhanced completion support based on libedit but I will only create PR if cling (and all root components currently using `textinput` ) are open to such changes and dependency. I can refactor to use `llvm::LineEditor` instead.

Modifiability,"Results of today's investigations: The reason is that `LinkageComputer::getLVForNamespaceScopeDecl` assigns internal linkage to `const` qualified variables without external storage class, which then our `KeepLocalGVPass` changes to a weak symbol. If that happens in multiple transactions, the JIT infrastructure (?) merges the symbols into one memory location but constructors and destructors run multiple times on the same object (see above). We cannot disable `KeepLocalGVPass` because it also takes care of `static` variables in functions that are lazily initialized. Additionally, not merging the constant variables would mean that they have different addresses which could also cause problems (FWIW this is what you get upstream in `clang-repl`). Fun fact: it works by accident in the upgrade to LLVM 16 because I backported https://reviews.llvm.org/D156537, but not https://reviews.llvm.org/D156897 so if a variable `MustBeEmitted` it is actually not re-emitted and `KeepLocalGVPass` works correctly. Conclusion: What I think we should really do here is patch `LinkageComputer::getLVForNamespaceScopeDecl` to not assign internal linkage to `const` qualified variables under `IncrementalExtensions`.

Modifiability,"RooFit currently includes the `RooCBShape` and `RooDSCBShape` to; represent the family of crystal ball distributions. The `RooCBShape`; only has a left tail, and `RooDSCBShape` has two independently; parametrized tails.

To make the RooFit code more maintainable and also cover the use case; of an asymmetric Gaussian core, this commit implements a new; `RooCrystalBall` class that should cover all classes of crystal ball; shapes, such that `RooCBShape` and `RooDSCBShape` are in principle not; necessary anymore. The new features of the `RooCrystalBall` class that make it different; from `RooDSCBShape` are:. - possibility to set sigma of left side and right side of Gaussian; core separately. - code modernization and using `std::` math functions. - three constructors: fully parametrized, symmetric Gaussian core; (to replace `RooDSCBShape`), only left tail (to replace; `RooCBShape`). - useage of inlined helper functions to avoid code duplication. It is also carefully tested in `testRooCrystalBal`:. - test the fully parameterized case. - test the constructor for left-tail only case and compare values; with `RooCBShape`. - test the constructor with symmetric Gaussian core and compare; values with `RooDSCBShape`. - test the constructor for right-tail only and symmetric tails. - test integration with many possible combinations integration; ranges to cover all branches of integration code",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7257:453,maintainab,maintainable,453,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7257,2,"['maintainab', 'parameteriz']","['maintainable', 'parameterized']"

Modifiability,"Root has two different ways to configure the build - the traditional configure script and cmake. The builds generated by the two systems are similar, but far from equivalent. Historically the configure script has been more feature complete and some things that the configure script is able to do are either missing or broken in the cmake build. However, new features are often only added to the cmake build. This has resulted in that today neither of the two is able to build root with a complete set of features. The cmake build is more standard and behaves in a more predictive way, e.g. it understands CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and friends which the configure script never did. It also integrates the test suite in the build and allows for running ""make test"", a feature that the configure script is missing. So the cmake build is in many ways better, if it wasn't for those missing and broken things mentioned earlier.

On macOS, this type has a size of 16 (and not 12 as one would expect, with 8 bytes for the int + bool struct of the optional plus 4 bytes for the index member). Moreover, the additional 4 bytes come from padding at the beginning of the variant type. Clang's `dump-record-layouts` gives the following, where I cannot explain why the `__impl` member starts at an offset of 4.

That way, we can have `builtin_openui5=ON` and `fetch_openui5=ON` for automatic fetching, and `builtin_openui5=ON` and `fetch_openui5=OFF` when we provide openui5 ourselves.

Modifiability,"Some libraries are layered can depend on other libraries on a private paths. That is, libA can depend on libB which is neither on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH nor on a known system path. The posix linker injects ""variables"" such as @rpath which is expanded at link time to resolve the libraries on a relative path. Prior to this patch, cling's Dyld-based symbol resolution could not trace down such cases causing failures in symbol resolution when a symbol is only defined in libB (a private library). This patch implements the basic posix linker substitutions allowing cling's Dyld-based symbol resolution implementation to follow more closely the linker rules. ## Performance. |platform|test|master|PRv1|PRv2| mem master|mem PRv2|; |:--------|:---|:---------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|; |ubu20|roottest-python-pythonizations|6.5|6.55|6.65|342076|347168|; |ubu20|roottest-cling|112.8|114.53|181.26|411048|416036|; |ubu20|roottest-python|148.5|136.26|144.72|394292|397120|; |ubu20|roottest-root-hist|16.78|17.35|15.45|465156|235084|; |ubu20|roottest-root-math|28.28|27.89|27.40|424072|371256|; |ubu20|roottest-root-tree|462.84|510.59|465.79|796512|797992|; |ubu20|roottest-root-treeformula|117.53|129.16|114.44|261184|260168|; |ubu20|root-io-stdarray|66.90|67.89|65.71|263424|255120|; |ubu20|roottest-root-treeformula|117.55|129.10|; |osx 10.15|roottest-python-pythonizations|17.25|16.06|; |osx 10.15|roottest-cling|346.06|343.46|; |osx 10.15|roottest-root-hist|36.06|36.22|; |osx 10.15|roottest-root-math|49.78|52.42|; |osx 10.15|root-io-stdarray|119.32|118.73|.

This can be a problem, especially when these paths may be evaluated from a different system folder assumed by CMake (e.g. when `CMAKE_INTSTALL_CMAKEDIR` is not the same for ROOT and CMake) as well as in other cases, when relative paths are not appropriate. Thus, it is safer in the general case to have these relative paths resolved to absolute system paths immediately before being passed to a caller.

Modifiability,"TBranchElement: do not set fOnfileObject for collection parent (type 3 or 4). This assignment is both unnecessary and harmfull. It is unnecessary because the pushd and popd of the onfile object address; for those cases is already handle by the usage of PushDataCache and PopDataCache; action for the branches of type 3 and 4 (via their configuration). It is harmfull because the type of the used/seen in the sub-branches might; be completely different from the type of the collection content.

Thus the hessian generation is done by clad and TFormula wraps it in a trampoline function.,MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8371:71,extend,extends,71,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8371,1,['extend'],['extends']
Modifiability,"TFormula generates a function on the fly along with a trampoline function; which ensures uniform calling of it. Once compiled, the function can be; called on different data and multiple times. We extend this concept by computing the gradient of the nominated function.; The gradient generation is done by clad and TFormula wraps it in a similar; easy-to-call trampoline function.

Modifiability,"TGraph and TGraphPainter work similarly, where the PaintScatter method is handled by TGraphPainter. TScatter extends functionality by adding marker size and color, but the actual drawing is still done in TGraphPainter. Instead of inheriting from TGraph, TScatter contains a TGraph as a data member. The same structure should be applied for 2D:. TScatter2D should have a TGraph2D as a member.; The painting should be done in TGraph2DPainter::PaintScatter2D.; There's no need for a TGraph3DPainter.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16376#issuecomment-2368055574:109,extend,extends,109,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16376#issuecomment-2368055574,2,"['extend', 'inherit']","['extends', 'inheriting']"
Modifiability,"TGraph3D .... Well why not. But then that will imply we can draw x y and Z in 3D then we get two more variables mapped on color and size and we can end up with a TGraph4D . The inheritance from TGraph makes it very easy to implement as we have all the painter machinery available. The idea was to introduce a better implementation of what is called in the literature a ""scatter plot"". We do not have this concept in root.

Modifiability,"TLDR: `TTree* TMVA::DataSet::GetTree` is missing a call to `tree->ResetBranchAddresses()` at the end. The interesting bit is that `TBufferFile::ReadInt` is being used even-though all the variables in the example (and indeed all their corresponding branches) are floats. So the issue is that the address of the Int branch:; ```; *Br 0 :classID : classID/I *; ```; is still set to an address that uses to be on the stack (according to valgrind). How can it be possible, you may ask. Well ... looking at the result of `fOutputFile->ls("""")` we notice:; ```; ....; OBJ: TTree TestTree TestTree : 0 at: 0x5555555eae70; ```; **even before** the call to `fOutputFile.Get(""dataset/TestTree"");`. This means that at point the `TTree` is already in memory (and already setup) and this prior loading is the likely place of the setting of the address to a local variable. It turns out that the `TTree` is created in `TTree* TMVA::DataSet::GetTree` at `DataSet.cxx:628` and later we have:; ```; UInt_t cls;; ...; tree->Branch( ""classID"", &cls, ""classID/I"" );; ...; return tree;; }; ```; At which point the `tree` is returns pointing to a bunch of now invalid memory location.; Using:; ```; tree->ResetBranchAddresses();; return tree;; }; ```; solves the problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10010#issuecomment-2080153300:187,variab,variables,187,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10010#issuecomment-2080153300,2,['variab'],"['variable', 'variables']"

Modifiability,"Thanks @amadio for the extensive input! Let me address it point by point:. First: the current choice for ""built-in only"". The built-in is there for two reasons: 1) as a dependency, obviously, but 2) also because the full source is needed to build `zmq::ppoll`. `ppoll` was written as an extension to libzmq itself. In the ideal world, I would have committed this back to libzmq (which they are open to, and which I'll do later, see https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/4220), but haven't had time yet. The interim solution is to just ship it with ROOT, but this requires (part of) the libzmq source to build against. We can do this in two ways: a) just include the necessary libzmq files or b) get them externally on the fly. I actually went with option a) first. However, when people started trying out this branch on their machines, it turned out that the `conda` libzmq build (which I was using in my dev setup) had a more favorable configuration than for instance most Linux native builds, especially because those native builds lack CMake configuration files. That latter fact made me decide to just make the built-in dependency the default; this way I wouldn't have to figure out how to best detect libzmq on each platform (or find / cobble together a good and freely licensed FindZeroMQ.cmake, but the general feeling around the ZeroMQ community is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?.

Modifiability,"Thanks Philippe. After further consideration, i think you're right. I had indeed been concerned about a possible deadlock, but i had thought; that it was probably ok because a similar change was working fine; in production. But (a), i had forgotten about the dlopen lock and (b),; they weren't exactly the same change. As i alluded to above, we didn't; want to have a custom patch to ROOT, so for production we address this; race by wrapping dlopen. But in that case, the core lock is acquired; _before_ the call to dlopen, not after. So, what is to be done?. There is probably only one code path in ATLAS that was giving us problems.; The Gaudi plugin manager was being used to load one of the POOL libraries; that happened to include ROOT dictionary information. I could; acquire the ROOT core lock around this (and one or two other places; where i known that Gaudi components may be loaded after event processing; starts). However, there are many other places where shared libraries; could potentially be loaded. While those probably don't matter...; the original bug here was quite opaque, taking several months; to completely track down. So i'm loathe to leave open any possibility; that it could bite us again. We could add locking within TClassTable. This is perhaps an attractive; way forward, as it should make it much easier to ensure that usages; of TClassTable are correct. A drawback is that is hard to then ensure; that we don't have something else that is also supposed to be protected; by the core mutex. Nevertheless, i could try to prepare a change; to do this if it sounds good. However, that's not the end of the problems. If this analysis is correct, then we _already_ have potential deadlock; problems, as there is nothing to prevent the initialization code of a; shared library (which can be arbitrary used code) from calling into ROOT; in a way that would acquire the core mutex. So code which would look; innocent to the user would have a chance of deadlocking.; I'm not sure ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071:646,plugin,plugin,646,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071,1,['plugin'],['plugin']

That is not done in the current status (there is the `eval` but I don't think it calls directly into cling every time). That's true, but probably `eval` is even worse.

Modifiability,Thanks for the PR. `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` seems to be a function and it has lexical scoping rules so I do not understand why resetting the `definitions` variable make things work. Why do we need another switch for `REFLEX_GENERATE_DICTIONARY`? We should be able to deduce the include paths from the target configurations. Passing different include paths using `USES` would mean that your dictionary has a different set of header files (compiled in a different way) than the library the dictionary is compiled in. That's quite dangerous as it can bring hard to diagnose inconsistencies. The direction ROOT has taken in the past is that it encourages single cmake call to produce library and its dictionaries. This is what `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` is. Maybe we should have something similar for reflex or even better (add a flag for ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` which calls `genreflex` instead of `rootcling`.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5019#issuecomment-587478295:157,variab,variable,157,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5019#issuecomment-587478295,2,"['config', 'variab']","['configurations', 'variable']"

I agree that it's not clear how meaningful `weightError` is for RooDataSet, but still the only two classes that derive from RooAbsData are RooDataHist and RooDataSet. Both of them reimplement `weightError` in a non-trivial way. Or are you thinking about some user classes that might inherit from `RooAbsData`? In that case they would not compile because not all purely virtual functions are implemented. But I'd argue that this a good thing, because then the user is made aware that `weightError` should be implemented with a dummy value. Actually, it can even be dangerous that we choose this dummy value ourselves (why zero and not `nan` for example?).

Modifiability,"Thanks for the great comments @guitargeek! All the ones I didn't comment on I agree with, so will implement those soon. I agree that it has become quite a complex class. It would be nice if things could be refactored at some time. However, part of it is also inevitable, I fear, because `RooMinimizer` has to bridge between two rather different frameworks, that of Minuit2 and RooFit, and now due to all the parallel processing work will have to deal with even more stuff than before. By the way, just as a historical aside: at some point I had turned `RooMinimizer` into a fully templated class, which made it even more horrible to maintain and time consuming to develop (since the header had to be recompiled on every change). I managed to trim the template horror down to just the constructor by introducing `RooAbsMinimizerFcn`. That introduced its own complexity here and there, as we discussed above :) But it was better in the end, I think. Note that the sole reason the template parameter is still necessary in the constructor is that the `MinimizerFcn` needs the proper constructor inside the `RooMinimizer` constructor. I like your suggestion of also using the template class argument instead of the `dynamic_cast` using `std::is_same`, but this is not strictly necessary like using the proper constructor is. By the way, note also that in the upcoming TestStatistics PR, there will be yet another `RooMinimizer` constructor, also with template arguments, but different ones, namely the concrete calculator classes for the likelihood and gradient.

Modifiability,"Thanks for the reference, @vepadulano ! . If `TRint` is indeed purely for use in `root.exe`, this is news to me (and some other colleagues), since the documentation of the class does not seem to state it's internal — it's used in our analysis software, the analysis software we inherited from (a decade ago, from a different collaboration), various student analyses etc. . As described above, the main use case is something for which no alternate class seems to exist:; * Start an application, and prepare an environment (e.g. an analysis framework). ; * Drop to the interpreter at some point later, e.g. during the first event. ; * Allow to interactively study the in-memory objects via the interpreter shell. . Note that I fully agree with the notion that `root.exe` should exit when encountering unrecognized options. However, the class is actively and successfully used in many projects I know (due to it's usefulness), and there is no easy replacement. So if it's internal, I'd probably vote for something like `TApplicationInterpreter` which would be similar to `TRInt`, but without the newly added `root.exe` specifics, and could be used by external projects (to prevent the need for external projects to replicate `TRint`). .

Modifiability,"The ROOT binaries don't come with `fft3` enabled because of licensing incompatibilities (GPL). However, it is not necessary to recompile all of ROOT to get the `fftw3` functionality. That's because the `math/fftw` library is not used directly, but nicely abstacted away with ROOTs plugin system via `TVirtualFFT`. Therefore, it would be very convenient for users if `math/fftw` could be built standalone, such that an existing ROOT installation can pick up these plugins. This was tested by building ROOT without `fftw3`, then also building and installing `math/fftw` standalone. I was running the RooFit convolution unit tests before and after installing `math/fftw` standalone. Indeed, the unit tests fail before installing it and pass after, showing that the standaline installation of the plugin works.

The script can be generically called as; ```sh; ctest -VV -S test.cmake; ```; from the top directory of the repository. There are several options to customize the build, the main ones are:. | Option | Description |; |----------------------|-------------|; | -DCOVERAGE=1 | Enables test coverage analysis with gcov; | -DMEMCHECK=1 | Enables memory checking with valgrind; | -DSTATIC_ANALYSIS=1 | Enables static analysis with clang-tidy; | -DINSTALL=1 | Enables an extra step to call make install; | -DCDASH=1 | Enables submission to CDash (needs CTestConfig.cmake). When enabling coverage, a report is generated by default in the `coverage/` directory inside the build directory. The results can be viewed by opening the file `html/coverage_details.html`. This step can be disabled by passing `-DGCOVR=0` to `ctest`. It is recommended to use a debug build to generate the coverage analysis. The configuration can be specified directly on the command line via the `-C` option. For example, to run a coverage build in debug mode, with less verbose output, and showing test output when a test failure happens, one can run:; ```sh; ctest -V --output-on-failure -C Debug -DCOVERAGE=1 -S test.cmake; ```; Some environment variables can also influence the behavior of the script, like `CC`, `CXX`, `CMAKE_GENERATOR`, `CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE`, `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL`, `CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL`, `CMAKE_ARGS`, `CDASH`, `DESTDIR`, `BASE_REF`, `HEAD_REF`, and GitHub Actions environment variables.
