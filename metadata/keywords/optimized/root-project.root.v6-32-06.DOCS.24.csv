The contexts are listed in order from leaf-most call (the; allocation itself) to the outermost callsite context required for uniquely; identifying the described profile behavior (note this may not be the top of; the profiled call stack). .. _md_callsite:. '``callsite``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``callsite`` metadata is used to identify callsites involved in memory; profile contexts described in :ref:`memprof metadata<md_memprof>`. It is attached both to the profile allocation calls (see the example in; :ref:`memprof metadata<md_memprof>`), as well as to other callsites; in profiled contexts described in heap allocation ``memprof`` metadata. Example:. .. code-block:: text. %call = call ptr @_Z1Bb(void), !callsite !0; !0 = !{i64 -6528110295079665978, i64 5462047985461644151}. Each operand in the ``callsite`` metadata attachment is a unique id; corresponding to a callsite (possibly inlined). In practice these ids are; formed via a hash of the callsite's debug info. If the call was not inlined; into any callers it will contain a single operand (id). If it was inlined; it will contain a list of ids, including the ids of the callsites in the; full inline sequence, in order from the leaf-most call's id to the outermost; inlined call. Module Flags Metadata; =====================. Information about the module as a whole is difficult to convey to LLVM's; subsystems. The LLVM IR isn't sufficient to transmit this information.; The ``llvm.module.flags`` named metadata exists in order to facilitate; this. These flags are in the form of key / value pairs --- much like a; dictionary --- making it easy for any subsystem who cares about a flag to; look it up. The ``llvm.module.flags`` metadata contains a list of metadata triplets.; Each triplet has the following form:. - The first element is a *behavior* flag, which specifies the behavior; when two (or more) modules are merged together, and it encounters two; (or more) meta",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:326418,hash,hash,326418,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['hash'],['hash']

It; does not guarantee continuity of elements within memory. In exchange for this extra flexibility, ``std::deque`` has significantly higher; constant factor costs than ``std::vector``. If possible, use ``std::vector`` or; something cheaper. .. _dss_list:. <list>; ^^^^^^. ``std::list`` is an extremely inefficient class that is rarely useful. It; performs a heap allocation for every element inserted into it, thus having an; extremely high constant factor, particularly for small data types.; ``std::list`` also only supports bidirectional iteration, not random access; iteration. In exchange for this high cost, std::list supports efficient access to both ends; of the list (like ``std::deque``, but unlike ``std::vector`` or; ``SmallVector``). In addition, the iterator invalidation characteristics of; std::list are stronger than that of a vector class: inserting or removing an; element into the list does not invalidate iterator or pointers to other elements; in the list. .. _dss_ilist:. llvm/ADT/ilist.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``ilist<T>`` implements an 'intrusive' doubly-linked list. It is intrusive,; because it requires the element to store and provide access to the prev/next; pointers for the list. ``ilist`` has the same drawbacks as ``std::list``, and additionally requires an; ``ilist_traits`` implementation for the element type, but it provides some novel; characteristics. In particular, it can efficiently store polymorphic objects,; the traits class is informed when an element is inserted or removed from the; list, and ``ilist``\ s are guaranteed to support a constant-time splice; operation.

Note that the task of identifying all live pointers to garbage; collected values, transforming the IR to expose a pointer giving the; base object for every such live pointer, and inserting all the; intrinsics correctly is explicitly out of scope for this document.; The recommended approach is to use the :ref:`utility passes; <statepoint-utilities>` described below. This abstract function call is concretely represented by a sequence of; intrinsic calls known collectively as a ""statepoint relocation sequence"". Let's consider a simple call in LLVM IR:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 addrspace(1)* @test1(i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); gc ""statepoint-example"" {; call void ()* @foo(); ret i8 addrspace(1)* %obj; }. Depending on our language we may need to allow a safepoint during the execution; of ``foo``. If so, we need to let the collector update local values in the; current frame. If we don't, we'll be accessing a potential invalid reference; once we eventually return from the call. In this example, we need to relocate the SSA value ``%obj``. Since we can't; actually change the value in the SSA value ``%obj``, we need to introduce a new; SSA value ``%obj.relocated`` which represents the potentially changed value of; ``%obj`` after the safepoint and update any following uses appropriately. The; resulting relocation sequence is:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 addrspace(1)* @test1(i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); gc ""statepoint-example"" {; %0 = call token (i64, i32, void ()*, i32, i32, ...)* @llvm.experimental.gc.statepoint.p0f_isVoidf(i64 0, i32 0, void ()* @foo, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); %obj.relocated = call coldcc i8 addrspace(1)* @llvm.experimental.gc.relocate.p1i8(token %0, i32 7, i32 7); ret i8 addrspace(1)* %obj.relocated; }.

As we already described, saving and restoring modeller states can be; quite useful during tracking and is a feature extensively used by; external tracking engines.

For quite big geometries, state indexing is not; possible anymore and will be automatically disabled by the modeller.; Fortunately there is a backup solution working in any condition: the; modeller maintains a stack of states that is internally used by its own; navigation algorithms, but user code is also allowed to access it.

Security,"ations without a constraint term attached (for shapes determined from control samples); XML steering for interpolation types. RooStats; General Improvements. This release brings several speed improvements to the RooStats tools and improved stability and performance with PROOF. This comes mainly through changes to the ToyMCSampler. In addition the HypoTestInverter tool has been rewritten, leading to some changes in the HypoTestResult. Finally, a new hypothesis test new called FrequentistCalculator was written, which plays the same role as the HybridCalculator but eliminates nuisance parameters in a frequentist way. ToyMCSampler. The primary interface for this class is to return a SamplingDistribution of a given TestStatistic.; The ToyMCSampler had a number of internal changes for improved performance with PROOF. These should be transparent. In addition, a new method was added RooAbsData* GenerateToyData(RooArgSet& paramPoint) that gives public access to the generation of toy data with all the same options for the treatment of nuisance parameters, binned or unbinned data, treatment of the global observables, importance sampling, etc. This is new method particularly useful for producing the expected limit bands where one needs to generate background-only pseudo-experiments in the same way that was used for the primary limit calculation. HypoTestResult. In the process of writing the new HypoTestInverter the conventions for p-values, CLb, CLs+b, and CLs were revisited. The situation is complicated by the fact that when performing a hypothesis test for discovery the null is background-only, but when performing an inverted hypothesis test the null is a signal+background model. The new convention is that the p-value for both the null and the alternate are taken from the same tail (as specified by the test statistic). Both CLs+b and CLb are equivalent to these p-values, and the HypoTestResult has a simple switch SetBackgroundIsAlt() to specify the pairing between (null p-val",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v530/index.html:2189,access,access,2189,roofit/doc/v530/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v530/index.html,1,['access'],['access']

Overview; ________. Taint analysis works by checking for the occurrence of special operations during the symbolic execution of the program.; Taint analysis defines sources, sinks, and propagation rules. It identifies errors by detecting a flow of information that originates from a taint source, reaches a taint sink, and propagates through the program paths via propagation rules.; A source, sink, or an operation that propagates taint is mainly domain-specific knowledge, but there are some built-in defaults provided by :ref:`alpha-security-taint-TaintPropagation`.; It is possible to express that a statement sanitizes tainted values by providing a ``Filters`` section in the external configuration (see :ref:`clangsa-taint-configuration-example` and :ref:`clangsa-taint-filter-details`).; There are no default filters defined in the built-in settings.; The checker's documentation also specifies how to provide a custom taint configuration with command-line options. .. _clangsa-taint-configuration-example:.

All wavefronts belonging to the same work-group will access the; same memory for any given local address. However, the same local address; accessed by wavefronts belonging to different work-groups will access; different memory. It is higher performance than global memory. The data store; (DS) instructions can be used to access it. **Private**; The private address space uses the hardware scratch memory support which; automatically allocates memory when it creates a wavefront and frees it when; a wavefronts terminates. The memory accessed by a lane of a wavefront for any; given private address will be different to the memory accessed by another lane; of the same or different wavefront for the same private address. If a kernel dispatch uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory from a; pool of backing memory allocated by the runtime for each wavefront. The lanes; of the wavefront access this using dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping; used from private address to backing memory address is:. ``wavefront-scratch-base +; ((private-address / 4) * wavefront-size * 4) +; (wavefront-lane-id * 4) + (private-address % 4)``. If each lane of a wavefront accesses the same private address, the; interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed and hence requires; fewer cache lines to be fetched. There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is; determined by a wavefront (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). Scratch memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer; instructions with the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch; offset, by the scratch instructions, or by flat instructions.

On the other hand, any volume is a small world by itself - what we need; to do is to take it out and to ignore all the rest since it is a; self-contained object. In fact, the modeller can act like this,; considering a given volume as temporary MARS, but we will describe this; feature later on. Let us focus on the biggest pack - it is mandatory to; define one. Consider the simplest geometry that is made of a single box.; Here is an example on how to build it:. ### Example 1: Creating the World. We first need to load the geometry library. This is not needed if one; does `make map` in root folder. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gSystem->Load(""libGeom"");; ```. Second, we have to create an instance of the geometry manager class.; This takes care of all the modeller components, performing several tasks; to insure geometry validity and containing the user interface for; building and interacting with the geometry. After its creation, the; geometry manager class can be accessed with the global; ***`gGeoManager`***:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] new TGeoManager(""world"", ""the simplest geometry"");; ```. We want to create a single volume in our geometry, but since any volume; needs to have an associated medium, we will create a dummy one. You can; safely ignore the following lines for the time being, since materials; and media will be explained in detail later on. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TGeoMaterial *mat = new TGeoMaterial(""Vacuum"",0,0,0);; root[] TGeoMedium *med = new TGeoMedium(""Vacuum"",1,mat);; ```. We can finally make our volume having a box shape. Note that the world; volume does not need to be a box - it can be any other shape. Generally,; boxes and tubes are the most recommendable shapes for this purpose due; to their fast navigation algorithms. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TGeoVolume *top=gGeoManager->MakeBox(""Top"",med,10.,10.,10.);; ```. The default units are in centimeters. Now we want to make this volume; our world.

Security,"bFile. Compared to the current support of S3 in ROOT (basically the class; TAS3File), the modifications include the improvements below:. - add support for using HTTPS : you can use different schemas for; specifying the underlying transport protocol to use ""s3:"",; ""s3http:"", ""s3https:"" [""s3"" uses HTTPS]. The current schema, namely; ""as3:"", is supported for backwards compatibility.; - extend support for other S3 service providers that do not offer the; virtual hosting functionality (currently only Amazon offers this).; - support the possibility of specifying user credentials on a per-file; basis or for all S3 files via environment variables.; - honor the ""NOPROXY"" option when specified in the constructor.; - exploit the capability of the S3 file server to provide partial; content responses to multi-range HTTP requests. Here are some examples of usages from the end user perspective:. ``` {.cpp}; TFile* f = TFile::Open(""s3://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/path/to/my/file"", ""AUTH=<accessKey>:<secretKey> NOPROXY""); TFile* f = TFile::Open(""s3://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/path/to/my/file"") // Uses environmental variables for retrieving credentials; ```. Limitations:. - we cannot efficiently detect that a S3 server is able to respond to; multi-range HTTP GET requests. Some servers, such as Amazon's,; respond to such kind of requests with the whole file contents. Other; servers, such as Huawei's, respond with the exact partial content; requested. Therefore, I added the possibility of configuring the; behavior via the ROOT configuration file: the identity of the; servers known to correctly support multi-range requests is; configurable. If the server is known to support this feature, ROOT; will send multi-range requests, otherwise it will issue multiple; single-range GET requests, which is also the default behavior.; - currently the virtual host syntax:; ""s3://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/my/file"" is not supported; but can be added if this is considered useful.

Because the kernel and user processes use; disjoint address regions in most operating systems, a single user process; address space plus the kernel address space can be treated as a single address; space for symbolization purposes if desired. Dependence on Build IDs; =======================. The symbolizer markup scheme relies on contextual information about runtime; memory address layout to make it possible to convert markup elements into useful; symbolic form. This relies on having an unmistakable identification of which; binary was loaded at each address. An ELF Build ID is the payload of an ELF note with name ``""GNU""`` and type; ``NT_GNU_BUILD_ID``, a unique byte sequence that identifies a particular binary; (executable, shared library, loadable module, or driver module). The linker; generates this automatically based on a hash that includes the complete symbol; table and debugging information, even if this is later stripped from the binary. This specification uses the ELF Build ID as the sole means of identifying; binaries. Each binary relevant to the log must have been linked with a unique; Build ID. The symbolizing filter must have some means of mapping a Build ID back; to the original ELF binary (either the whole unstripped binary, or a stripped; binary paired with a separate debug file). Colorization; ============. The markup format supports a restricted subset of ANSI X3.64 SGR (Select Graphic; Rendition) control sequences. These are unlike other markup elements:. * They specify presentation details (bold or colors) rather than semantic; information. The association of semantic meaning with color (e.g. red for; errors) is chosen by the code doing the logging, rather than by the UI; presentation of the symbolizing filter.

Security,"ble which should foster its actual use and adoption. No Duplicate Implementations; ----------------------------. The implementation of a function for a given platform must be written exactly; once. This implies that it must be possible to apply a function's; implementation to multiple operating systems if those operating systems can; share the same implementation. This rule applies to the set of operating; systems supported for a given class of operating system (e.g. Unix, Win32). No Virtual Methods; ------------------. The Support Library interfaces can be called quite frequently by LLVM. In order; to make those calls as efficient as possible, we discourage the use of virtual; methods. There is no need to use inheritance for implementation differences, it; just adds complexity. The ``#include`` mechanism works just fine. No Exposed Functions; --------------------. Any functions defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``); must not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header; file for that function is not exposed. This prevents inadvertent use of system; specific functionality. For example, the ``stat`` system call is notorious for having variations in the; data it provides. ``lib/Support`` must not declare ``stat`` nor allow it to be; declared. Instead it should provide its own interface to discovering; information about files and directories. Those interfaces may be implemented in; terms of ``stat`` but that is strictly an implementation detail. The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms.

Jump tables may call external functions, so their definitions need not; be available at LTO time. Note that if an externally defined function is; associated with a type identifier, there is no guarantee that its identity; within the module will be the same as its identity outside of the module,; as the former will be the jump table entry if a jump table is necessary.

Pointer types in ``typedef``\s do not have implicit default bounds annotations.; Instead, the bounds annotation is determined when the ``typedef`` is used.

This was fixed. * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/llvm/issues/detail?id=23 reports a new Spectre; gadget variant that Speculative Load Hardening (SLH) does not mitigate. No; extension to SLH was implemented to also mitigate against this variant. * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/llvm/issues/detail?id=30 reports missing memory; safety protection on the (C++) exception handling path. A number of fixes; were implemented. * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/llvm/issues/detail?id=33 reports the RETBLEED; vulnerability. The outcome was clang growing a new security hardening feature; `-mfunction-return=thunk-extern`, see https://reviews.llvm.org/D129572. No dedicated LLVM releases were made for any of the above issues.

Security,"bute specifies the possible memory effects of the call-site or; function. It allows specifying the possible access kinds (``none``,; ``read``, ``write``, or ``readwrite``) for the possible memory location; kinds (``argmem``, ``inaccessiblemem``, as well as a default). It is best; understood by example:. - ``memory(none)``: Does not access any memory.; - ``memory(read)``: May read (but not write) any memory.; - ``memory(write)``: May write (but not read) any memory.; - ``memory(readwrite)``: May read or write any memory.; - ``memory(argmem: read)``: May only read argument memory.; - ``memory(argmem: read, inaccessiblemem: write)``: May only read argument; memory and only write inaccessible memory.; - ``memory(read, argmem: readwrite)``: May read any memory (default mode); and additionally write argument memory.; - ``memory(readwrite, argmem: none)``: May access any memory apart from; argument memory. The supported memory location kinds are:. - ``argmem``: This refers to accesses that are based on pointer arguments; to the function.; - ``inaccessiblemem``: This refers to accesses to memory which is not; accessible by the current module (before return from the function -- an; allocator function may return newly accessible memory while only; accessing inaccessible memory itself). Inaccessible memory is often used; to model control dependencies of intrinsics.; - The default access kind (specified without a location prefix) applies to; all locations that haven't been specified explicitly, including those that; don't currently have a dedicated location kind (e.g. accesses to globals; or captured pointers). If the ``memory`` attribute is not specified, then ``memory(readwrite)``; is implied (all memory effects are possible). The memory effects of a call can be computed as; ``CallSiteEffects & (FunctionEffects | OperandBundleEffects)``. Thus, the; call-site annotation takes precedence over the potential effects described; by either the function annotation or the operand bund",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:85678,access,accesses,85678,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['access'],['accesses']

For example, given two declarations of a function ""``g``"" that are; overloaded, e.g.,. .. code-block:: c++. void g();; void g(int);. the ``DeclContext::lookup`` operation will return a; ``DeclContext::lookup_result`` that contains a range of iterators over; declarations of ""``g``"". Clients that perform semantic analysis on a program; that is not concerned with the actual source code will primarily use this; semantics-centric view. .. _LexicalAndSemanticContexts:. Lexical and Semantic Contexts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Each declaration has two potentially different declaration contexts: a; *lexical* context, which corresponds to the source-centric view of the; declaration context, and a *semantic* context, which corresponds to the; semantics-centric view. The lexical context is accessible via; ``Decl::getLexicalDeclContext`` while the semantic context is accessible via; ``Decl::getDeclContext``, both of which return ``DeclContext`` pointers. For; most declarations, the two contexts are identical. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. class X {; public:; void f(int x);; };. Here, the semantic and lexical contexts of ``X::f`` are the ``DeclContext``; associated with the class ``X`` (itself stored as a ``RecordDecl`` AST node).; However, we can now define ``X::f`` out-of-line:. .. code-block:: c++. void X::f(int x = 17) { /* ... */ }. This definition of ""``f``"" has different lexical and semantic contexts. The; lexical context corresponds to the declaration context in which the actual; declaration occurred in the source code, e.g., the translation unit containing; ``X``. Thus, this declaration of ``X::f`` can be found by traversing the; declarations provided by [``decls_begin()``, ``decls_end()``) in the; translation unit. The semantic context of ``X::f`` corresponds to the class ``X``, since this; member function is (semantically) a m",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:77650,access,accessible,77650,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,2,['access'],['accessible']
Security,"by setting the `useAverage` parameter of `RooPlot::residHist` or `RooPlot::pullHist` to `false`. ### Improved recovery from invalid parameters. When a function in RooFit is undefined (Poisson with negative mean, PDF with negative values, etc), RooFit can now pass information about the; ""badness"" of the violation to the minimiser. The minimiser can use this to compute a gradient to find its way out of the undefined region.; This can drastically improve its ability to recover when unstable fit models are used, for example RooPolynomial. For details, see the RooFit tutorial [rf612_recoverFromInvalidParameters.C](https://root.cern/doc/v624/rf612__recoverFromInvalidParameters_8C.html); and [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### Modernised RooDataHist. RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated. This holds especially for direct accesses to `_curWeight`,; `_curWeightErrLo`, etc, which have been removed. (It doesn't make sense to write to these members from const functions when the same information; can be retrieved using an index access operator of an array.) All similar accesses in derived classes should be replaced by the getters `get_curWeight()`; or better `get_wgt(i)`, which were also supported in ROOT \<v6.24. More details on what happened:. - Reduced side effects. This code produces undefined behaviour because the side effect of `get(i)`, i.e., loading the new weight into `_curWeight`; is not guaranteed to happen before `weight()` is called:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight()); // Dangerous! Order of evaluation is not guaranteed.; ```; With the modernised interface, one would use:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight(i));; ```; To modernise old code, one should replace patterns like `h.get(i); h.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md:20834,access,access,20834,README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md,1,['access'],['access']

A value over the amount of available space on the disk; will be reduced to the amount of available space. A value of 0 disables; the byte size-based pruning. The default is no byte size-based pruning. Note that ThinLTO will apply both size-based pruning policies simultaneously,; and changing one does not affect the other. For example, a policy of; ``cache_size_bytes=1g`` on its own will cause both the 1GB and default 75%; policies to be applied unless the default ``cache_size`` is overridden. - ``cache_size_files=X``:; Set the maximum number of files in the cache directory. Set to 0 to indicate; no limit. The default is 1000000 files. - ``prune_after=Xs``, ``prune_after=Xm``, ``prune_after=Xh``: Sets the; expiration time for cache files to ``X`` seconds (or minutes, hours; respectively).

Security,"c size limit. ``align`` must be; explicitly specified on atomic loads. Note: if the alignment is not greater or; equal to the size of the `<value>` type, the atomic operation is likely to; require a lock and have poor performance. ``!nontemporal`` does not have any; defined semantics for atomic loads. The optional constant ``align`` argument specifies the alignment of the; operation (that is, the alignment of the memory address). It is the; responsibility of the code emitter to ensure that the alignment information is; correct. Overestimating the alignment results in undefined behavior.; Underestimating the alignment may produce less efficient code. An alignment of; 1 is always safe. The maximum possible alignment is ``1 << 32``. An alignment; value higher than the size of the loaded type implies memory up to the; alignment value bytes can be safely loaded without trapping in the default; address space. Access of the high bytes can interfere with debugging tools, so; should not be accessed if the function has the ``sanitize_thread`` or; ``sanitize_address`` attributes. The alignment is only optional when parsing textual IR; for in-memory IR, it is; always present. An omitted ``align`` argument means that the operation has the; ABI alignment for the target. The optional ``!nontemporal`` metadata must reference a single; metadata name ``<nontemp_node>`` corresponding to a metadata node with one; ``i32`` entry of value 1. The existence of the ``!nontemporal``; metadata on the instruction tells the optimizer and code generator; that this load is not expected to be reused in the cache. The code; generator may select special instructions to save cache bandwidth, such; as the ``MOVNT`` instruction on x86.

Security,"c that forces all objects to be TG-aligned.; `free` tags the memory with a different tag. Stack; -----. Stack frames are instrumented by aligning all non-promotable allocas; by `TG` and tagging stack memory in function prologue and epilogue. Tags for different allocas in one function are **not** generated; independently; doing that in a function with `M` allocas would require; maintaining `M` live stack pointers, significantly increasing register; pressure. Instead we generate a single base tag value in the prologue,; and build the tag for alloca number `M` as `ReTag(BaseTag, M)`, where; ReTag can be as simple as exclusive-or with constant `M`. Stack instrumentation is expected to be a major source of overhead,; but could be optional. Globals; -------. Most globals in HWASAN instrumented code are tagged. This is accomplished; using the following mechanisms:. * The address of each global has a static tag associated with it. The first; defined global in a translation unit has a pseudorandom tag associated; with it, based on the hash of the file path. Subsequent global tags are; incremental from the previously-assigned tag. * The global's tag is added to its symbol address in the object file's symbol; table. This causes the global's address to be tagged when its address is; taken. * When the address of a global is taken directly (i.e. not via the GOT), a special; instruction sequence needs to be used to add the tag to the address,; because the tag would otherwise take the address outside of the small code; model (4GB on AArch64). No changes are required when the address is taken; via the GOT because the address stored in the GOT will contain the tag. * An associated ``hwasan_globals`` section is emitted for each tagged global,; which indicates the address of the global, its size and its tag. These; sections are concatenated by the linker into a single ``hwasan_globals``; section that is enumerated by the runtime (via an ELF note) when a binary; is loaded and the memory",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst:6491,hash,hash,6491,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst,1,['hash'],['hash']

Then, all the supporting allocator needs to do is compile with; ``-DINSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS`` and link against the GWP-ASan library! For; performance reasons, we strongly recommend static linkage of the GWP-ASan; library. Guarded Allocation Pool; -----------------------. The core of GWP-ASan is the guarded allocation pool. Each sampled allocation is; backed using its own *guarded* slot, which may consist of one or more accessible; pages. Each guarded slot is surrounded by two *guard* pages, which are mapped as; inaccessible. The collection of all guarded slots makes up the *guarded; allocation pool*. Buffer Underflow/Overflow Detection; -----------------------------------. We gain buffer-overflow and buffer-underflow detection through these guard; pages. When a memory access overruns the allocated buffer, it will touch the; inaccessible guard page, causing memory exception. This exception is caught and; handled by the internal crash handler. Because each allocation is recorded with; metadata about where (and by what thread) it was allocated and deallocated, we; can provide information that will help identify the root cause of the bug. Allocations are randomly selected to be either left- or right-aligned to provide; equal detection of both underflows and overflows. Use after Free Detection; ------------------------. The guarded allocation pool also provides use-after-free detection. Whenever a; sampled allocation is deallocated, we map its guarded slot as inaccessible. Any; memory accesses after deallocation will thus trigger the crash handler, and we; can provide useful information about the source of the error. Please note that the use-after-free detection for a sampled allocation is; transient.

We have included two; more examples to show the impact of compression on Trees in the next; chapter. ### Using the General Open Function of TFile. To make life simple we provide a general function to open any type of; file (except shared memory files of class **`TMapFile`**). This; functionality is provided by the static `TFile::Open()` function:. ``` {.cpp}; TFile *TFile::Open(const Text_t *name,Option_t *option="""",; const Text_t *title="""",Int_t compress,Int_t netopt); ```. Depending on the `name` argument, the function returns a **`TFile`** or one; of its derivations, for example a; **`TNetXNGFile`** or a **`TDavixFile`** object. In case a URL; specifies a local file, a **`TFile`** object will be returned (and of; course no login information is needed). The arguments of the `Open()`; function are the same as the ones for the **`TFile`** constructor. Using `ReOpen()` method it is possible to reopen a file with a; different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE,; RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either ""READ"" or; ""UPDATE"". The method returns:. - 0 in case the mode was successfully modified;. - 1 in case the mode did not change (it was already as requested or; there were wrong input arguments);. - -1 in case of failure. In the last case the file cannot be used; anymore. ## Remotely Access to ROOT Files. ROOT files can be accessed remotely in many ways, on the base of the protocol; URL. Among the most popular are XRootD (protocols 'root://' and 'xrd://') and; a Web server (protocl 'http://' or 'https://'). The rootd daemon is deprecated and has been removed in version 6.16/00. Please refer to the XRootD documentation for starting and ensuring that such a; daemon is running.

It is highly recommended to follow the dependency chain when manually; upgrading packages individually (i.e. ``cppyy-cling``, ``cppyy-backend``,; ``CPyCppyy`` if on CPython, and then finally ``cppyy``), because upstream; packages expose headers that are used by the ones downstream.; Of course, if only building for a patch/point release, there is no need to; re-install the full chain (or follow the order).; Always run the local updates from the package directories (i.e. where the; ``setup.py`` file is located), as some tools rely on the package structure.

It is illegal for the list node to be empty since it might be confused; with an access group. The access group metadata node must be 'distinct' to avoid collapsing; multiple access groups by content. An access group metadata node must; always be empty which can be used to distinguish an access group; metadata node from a list of access groups. Being empty avoids the; situation that the content must be updated which, because metadata is; immutable by design, would required finding and updating all references; to the access group node. The access group can be used to refer to a memory access instruction; without pointing to it directly (which is not possible in global; metadata). Currently, the only metadata making use of it is; ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses``. '``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Security,"ccesses; ------------------------. Certain memory accesses, such as :ref:`load <i_load>`'s,; :ref:`store <i_store>`'s, and :ref:`llvm.memcpy <int_memcpy>`'s may be; marked ``volatile``. The optimizers must not change the number of; volatile operations or change their order of execution relative to other; volatile operations. The optimizers *may* change the order of volatile; operations relative to non-volatile operations. This is not Java's; ""volatile"" and has no cross-thread synchronization behavior. A volatile load or store may have additional target-specific semantics.; Any volatile operation can have side effects, and any volatile operation; can read and/or modify state which is not accessible via a regular load; or store in this module. Volatile operations may use addresses which do; not point to memory (like MMIO registers). This means the compiler may; not use a volatile operation to prove a non-volatile access to that; address has defined behavior. The allowed side-effects for volatile accesses are limited. If a; non-volatile store to a given address would be legal, a volatile; operation may modify the memory at that address. A volatile operation; may not modify any other memory accessible by the module being compiled.; A volatile operation may not call any code in the current module. In general (without target specific context), the address space of a; volatile operation may not be changed. Different address spaces may; have different trapping behavior when dereferencing an invalid; pointer. The compiler may assume execution will continue after a volatile operation,; so operations which modify memory or may have undefined behavior can be; hoisted past a volatile operation. As an exception to the preceding rule, the compiler may not assume execution; will continue after a volatile store operation. This restriction is necessary; to support the somewhat common pattern in C of intentionally storing to an; invalid pointer to crash the program.

JITLink passes are ``std::function<Error(LinkGraph&)>`` instances. They are free; to inspect and modify the given ``LinkGraph`` subject to the constraints of; whatever phase they are running in (see :ref:`generic_link_algorithm`). If a; pass returns ``Error::success()`` then linking continues. If a pass returns; a failure value then linking is stopped and the ``JITLinkContext`` is notified; that the link failed. Passes may be used by both JITLink backends (e.g. MachO/x86-64 implements GOT; and PLT construction as a pass), and external clients like; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``. In combination with the open ``LinkGraph`` API, JITLink passes enable the; implementation of powerful new features.

A thread is the schedulable entity. It has only those properties that; are required to ensure its independent flow of control. These include; the following properties:. - Stack. - Scheduling properties (such as policy or priority). - Set of pending and blocked signals. - Some thread-specific data (TSD). An example of thread-specific data is the error indicator, `errno`. In; multi-threaded systems, `errno` is no longer a global variable, but; usually a subroutine returning a thread-specific `errno` value. Some; other systems may provide other implementations of `errno`. With respect; to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the ***`gPad`*** pointer,; which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any; thread or the main thread. Threads within a process must not be considered as a group of processes; (even though in Linux each thread receives an own process id, so that it; can be scheduled by the kernel scheduler). All threads share the same; address space. This means that two pointers having the same value in two; threads refer to the same data. Also, if any thread changes one of the; shared system resources, all threads within the process are affected.; For example, if a thread closes a file, the file is closed for all; threads. ### The Initial Thread.

Security,"ck. Linking a DSO with SafeStack is not currently supported. Known compatibility limitations; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Certain code that relies on low-level stack manipulations requires adaption to; work with SafeStack. One example is mark-and-sweep garbage collection; implementations for C/C++ (e.g., Oilpan in chromium/blink), which must be; changed to look for the live pointers on both safe and unsafe stacks. SafeStack supports linking statically modules that are compiled with and; without SafeStack. An executable compiled with SafeStack can load dynamic; libraries that are not compiled with SafeStack. At the moment, compiling; dynamic libraries with SafeStack is not supported. Signal handlers that use ``sigaltstack()`` must not use the unsafe stack (see; ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""safe-stack"")))`` below). Programs that use APIs from ``ucontext.h`` are not supported yet. Security; --------. SafeStack protects return addresses, spilled registers and local variables that; are always accessed in a safe way by separating them in a dedicated safe stack; region. The safe stack is automatically protected against stack-based buffer; overflows, since it is disjoint from the unsafe stack in memory, and it itself; is always accessed in a safe way. In the current implementation, the safe stack; is protected against arbitrary memory write vulnerabilities though; randomization and information hiding: the safe stack is allocated at a random; address and the instrumentation ensures that no pointers to the safe stack are; ever stored outside of the safe stack itself (see limitations below). Known security limitations; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. A complete protection against control-flow hijack attacks requires combining; SafeStack with another mechanism that enforces the integrity of code pointers; that are stored on the heap or the unsafe stack, such as `CPI; <https://dslab.epfl.ch/research/cpi/>`_, or a forward-edge control flow integrity; mechanism that enforces corr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/SafeStack.rst:2966,access,accessed,2966,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/SafeStack.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/SafeStack.rst,1,['access'],['accessed']

As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures).

Whenever the current; compiler and standard library provide an implmentation, it is used. The type string_view describes an object that can refer to a constant contiguous sequence of char-like objects with the first element of the sequence at position zero. This type is used throughout the ROOT code to avoid copying strings when a; sub-string is needed and to extent interfaces that uses to take a const char*; to take a std::string_view as thus be able to be directly directly passed a; TString, a std::string or a std::string_view. Usage example:. ``` {.cpp}; // With SetName(std::string_view); std::string str; …; obj.SetName( str );; obj.SetName( {str.data()+pos, len} );; ```. ### Meta library. #### Backward Incompatibilities. TIsAProxy's constructor no longer take the optional and unused 2nd argument which was reserved for a 'context'. This context was unused in TIsAProxy itself and was not accessible from derived classes. #### Interpreter. The new interface `TInterpreter::Declare(const char* code)` will declare the; code to the interpreter with all interpreter extensions disabled, i.e. as; ""proper"" C++ code. No autoloading or synamic lookup will be performed. A new R__LOAD_LIBRARY(libWhatever) will load libWhatever at parse time. This allows ROOT to resolve symbols from this library very early on. It is a work-around for the following code from ROOT 5:. ``` {.cpp}; // ROOT 5:; void func() {; gSystem->Load(""libEvent"");; Event* e = new Event;; }; ```. Instead, write:. ``` {.cpp}; // ROOT 6:; R__LOAD_LIBRARY(libEvent); #include ""Event.h"". void func() {; Event* e = new Event;; }; ```. #### TClass. Introduced new overload for calculating the TClass CheckSum:. ``` {.cpp}; UInt_t TClass::GetCheckSum(ECheckSum code, Bool_t &isvalid) const;; ```. which indicates via the 'isvalid' boolean whether the checksum could be; calculated correctly or not. ### TROOT.

The schema evolution C++ API consists of two classes: `ROOT::TSchemaRuleSet` and; `ROOT::TSchemaRule`. Objects of the TSchemaRule class represent the rules and their fields have exactly the same; meaning as the ones of rules specified in the dictionaries. `TSchemaRuleSet` objects; manage the sets of rules and ensure their consistency. There can be no conflicting; rules in the rule sets. The rule sets are owned by the `TClass` objects corresponding to the; target classes defined in the rules and can be accessed using `TClass::{Get|Adopt}SchemaRules`. ### Manual Schema Evolution. If you have written your own `Streamer` as described in the section; ""Streamers with Special Additions"", you will have to manually add code; for each version and manage the evolution of your class. When you add or; remove data members, you must modify the `Streamer` by hand. ROOT; assumes that you have increased the class version number in the; `ClassDef` statement and introduced the relevant test in the read part; of the Streamer. For example, if a new version of the `Event` class; above includes a new member: `Int_t fNew` the `ClassDef` statement; should be changed to `ClassDef(Event,2)` and the following lines should; be added to the read part of the `Streamer`:. ``` {.cpp}; if (R__v > 1) R__b >> fNew;; else fNew = 0; // set to some default value; ```.

This works for all objects deriving from **`TObject`**. However, a; question remains. An object has a name if it derives from **`TNamed`**,; not from **`TObject`**. For example, an arrow (**`TArrow`**) doesn't; have a name. In that case, the ""name"" is the name of the class. To know; the name of an object, just click with the right button on it. The name; appears at the top of the context menu. In case of multiple unnamed; objects, a call to `GetPrimitive(""className"")` returns the instance of; the class that was first created. To retrieve a later instance you can; use `GetListOfPrimitives()`, which returns a list of all the objects on; the pad. From the list you can select the object you need. #### Hiding an Object. Hiding an object in a pad can be made by removing it from the list of; objects owned by that pad. This list is accessible by the; `GetListOfPrimitives()` method of **`TPad`**. This method returns a; pointer to a **`TList`**. Suppose we get the pointer to the object, we; want to hide, call it `obj` (see paragraph above). We get the pointer to; the list:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] li = gPad->GetListOfPrimitives(); ```. Then remove the object from this list:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] li->Remove(obj); ```. The object will disappear from the pad as soon as the pad is updated; (try to resize it for example). If one wants to make the object; reappear:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] obj->Draw(); ```. Caution, this will not work with composed objects, for example many; histograms drawn on the same plot (with the option ""`same`""). There are; other ways! Try to use the method described here for simple objects. ### The Coordinate Systems of a Pad.

This criterion does not apply to all; extensions, since some extensions fall outside of the realm of the standards; bodies.; A long-term support plan: increasingly large or complex extensions to; Clang need matching commitments to supporting them over time, including; improving their implementation and specification as Clang evolves.

Security,"cture for this (aside from function analyses in loop passes; as described below). Self-updating analyses that gracefully degrade also handle; this problem (e.g. GlobalsAA), but they run into the issue of having to be; manually recomputed somewhere in the optimization pipeline if we want precision,; and they block potential future concurrency. The second reason is to keep in mind potential future pass concurrency, for; example parallelizing function passes over different functions in a CGSCC or; module. Since passes can ask for a cached analysis result, allowing passes to; trigger outer level analysis computation could result in non-determinism if; concurrency was supported. A related limitation is that outer level IR analyses; that are used must be immutable, or else they could be invalidated by changes to; inner level IR. Outer analyses unused by inner passes can and often will be; invalidated by changes to inner level IR. These invalidations happen after the; inner pass manager finishes, so accessing mutable analyses would give invalid; results. The exception to not being able to access outer level analyses is accessing; function analyses in loop passes. Loop passes often use function analyses such; as the dominator tree. Loop passes inherently require modifying the function the; loop is in, and that includes some function analyses the loop analyses depend; on. This discounts future concurrency over separate loops in a function, but; that's a tradeoff due to how tightly a loop and its function are coupled. To; make sure the function analyses that loop passes use are valid, they are; manually updated in the loop passes to ensure that invalidation is not; necessary. There is a set of common function analyses that loop passes and; analyses have access to which is passed into loop passes as a; ``LoopStandardAnalysisResults`` parameter. Other mutable function analyses are; not accessible from loop passes.

Pointer types may have an optional address space attribute defining; the numbered address space where the pointed-to object resides. For; example, ``ptr addrspace(5)`` is a pointer to address space 5.; In addition to integer constants, ``addrspace`` can also reference one of the; address spaces defined in the :ref:`datalayout string<langref_datalayout>`.; ``addrspace(""A"")`` will use the alloca address space, ``addrspace(""G"")``; the default globals address space and ``addrspace(""P"")`` the program address; space. The default address space is number zero. The semantics of non-zero address spaces are target-specific. Memory; access through a non-dereferenceable pointer is undefined behavior in; any address space. Pointers with the bit-value 0 are only assumed to; be non-dereferenceable in address space 0, unless the function is; marked with the ``null_pointer_is_valid`` attribute. If an object can be proven accessible through a pointer with a; different address space, the access may be modified to use that; address space. Exceptions apply if the operation is ``volatile``.

RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated.

This code produces undefined behaviour because the side effect of `get(i)`, i.e., loading the new weight into `_curWeight`; is not guaranteed to happen before `weight()` is called:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight()); // Dangerous! Order of evaluation is not guaranteed.; ```; With the modernised interface, one would use:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight(i));; ```; To modernise old code, one should replace patterns like `h.get(i); h.func()` by `h.func(i);`. One may `#define R__SUGGEST_NEW_INTERFACE` to switch on; deprecation warnings for the functions in question.; Similarly, the bin content can now be set using an index, making prior loading of a certain coordinate unnecessary:; ```; for (int i=0 ; i<hist->numEntries() ; i++) {; - hist->get(i) ;; - hist->set(hist->weight() / sum);; + hist->set(i, hist->weight(i)",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md:21165,access,accesses,21165,README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v624/index.md,1,['access'],['accesses']

This; approach only requires the underlying hardware have a way to implement a; branchless and unpredicted conditional update of a register's value. All modern; architectures have support for this, and in fact such support is necessary to; correctly implement constant time cryptographic primitives.

Security,"d typedef types bring up some complexities that must be; carefully managed. Specifically, the ``isa``/``cast``/``dyn_cast`` operators; generally shouldn't be used in code that is inspecting the AST. For example,; when type checking the indirection operator (unary ""``*``"" on a pointer), the; type checker must verify that the operand has a pointer type. It would not be; correct to check that with ""``isa<PointerType>(SubExpr->getType())``"", because; this predicate would fail if the subexpression had a typedef type. The solution to this problem are a set of helper methods on ``Type``, used to; check their properties. In this case, it would be correct to use; ""``SubExpr->getType()->isPointerType()``"" to do the check. This predicate will; return true if the *canonical type is a pointer*, which is true any time the; type is structurally a pointer type. The only hard part here is remembering; not to use the ``isa``/``cast``/``dyn_cast`` operations. The second problem we face is how to get access to the pointer type once we; know it exists. To continue the example, the result type of the indirection; operator is the pointee type of the subexpression. In order to determine the; type, we need to get the instance of ``PointerType`` that best captures the; typedef information in the program. If the type of the expression is literally; a ``PointerType``, we can return that, otherwise we have to dig through the; typedefs to find the pointer type. For example, if the subexpression had type; ""``foo*``"", we could return that type as the result. If the subexpression had; type ""``bar``"", we want to return ""``foo*``"" (note that we do *not* want; ""``int*``""). In order to provide all of this, ``Type`` has a; ``getAsPointerType()`` method that checks whether the type is structurally a; ``PointerType`` and, if so, returns the best one. If not, it returns a null; pointer. This structure is somewhat mystical, but after meditating on it, it will make; sense to you :). .. _QualType:.

The reader can create `RNTupleView` objects for the independent reading of individual fields.; The reader can create `RBulk` objects for bulk reading of individual fields. Additionally, the reader provides access to a cached copy of the descriptor.; It can display individual entries (`RNTupleReader::Show()`) and summary information (`RNTupleReader::PrintInfo()`). ### RNTupleView<T>; RNTuple views provide read access to individual fields.; Views are created from an RNTupleReader.; Views are templated; for simple types (e.g., `float`, `int`), views provide read-only access directly to an RNTuple page in memory.; Complex types and void views require additional memory copies to populate an object in memory from the column data. A view can iterate over the entry range, over the field range, and over the range of a collection within an entry.; For instance, for a field `std::vector<float> pt`, a view can iterate over all `pt` values of all entries, or over the `pt` values of a particular entry. A view can safely outlive its originating reader.; Once the reader is deconstructed, any attempt to read data will throw an exception, but the view is still properly destructed.

Walkers were built to be flexible, though, so it's entirely reasonable; (and expected) to create more specialized walkers (e.g. one that specifically; queries ``GlobalsAA``, one that always stops at ``MemoryPhi`` nodes, etc). Default walker APIs; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are two main APIs used to retrieve the clobbering access using the walker:. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA);`` return the; clobbering memory access for ``MA``, caching all intermediate results; computed along the way as part of each access queried. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA, const MemoryLocation &Loc);``; returns the access clobbering memory location ``Loc``, starting at ``MA``.; Because this API does not request the clobbering access of a specific memory; access, there are no results that can be cached. Locating clobbers yourself; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you choose to make your own walker, you can find the clobber for a; ``MemoryAccess`` by walking every ``MemoryDef`` that dominates said; ``MemoryAccess``. The structure of ``MemoryDef``\ s makes this relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize. In other words, the; ``definingAccess`` of a ``MemoryDef`` is always the nearest dominating; ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` of said ``MemoryDef``. Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``.

The ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata refers to one or more; access group metadata nodes (see ``llvm.access.group``). It denotes that; no loop-carried memory dependence exist between it and other instructions; in the loop with this metadata. Let ``m1`` and ``m2`` be two instructions that both have the; ``llvm.access.group`` metadata to the access group ``g1``, respectively; ``g2`` (which might be identical). If a loop contains both access groups; in its ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata, then the compiler can; assume that there is no dependency between ``m1`` and ``m2`` carried by; this loop. Instructions that belong to multiple access groups are; considered having this property if at least one of the access groups; matches the ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` list. If all memory-accessing instructions in a loop have; ``llvm.access.group`` metadata that each refer to one of the access; groups of a loop's ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata, then the; loop has no loop carried memory dependences and is considered to be a; parallel loop. Note that if not all memory access instructions belong to an access; group referred to by ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses``, then the loop must; not be considered trivially parallel. Additional; memory dependence analysis is required to make that determination. As a fail; safe mechanism, this causes loops that were originally parallel to be considered; sequential (if optimization passes that are unaware of the parallel semantics; insert new memory instructions into the loop body). Example of a loop that is considered parallel due to its correct use of; both ``llvm.access.group`` and ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses``; metadata types. .. code-block:: llvm. for.body:; ...; %val0 = load i32, ptr %arrayidx, !llvm.access.group !1; ...; store i32 %val0, ptr %arrayidx1, !llvm.access.gro",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:312292,access,access,312292,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['access'],['access']

We are currently using the `chromium issue tracker`_ (as the `llvm` project) to have security discussions:. * File security issues.; * Discuss security improvements to LLVM. When a new issue is filed, a template is provided to help issue reporters provide all relevant information. *FUTURE*: The `Github security`_ workflow allows publicly disclosing resolved security issues on the github project page, and we would be interested in adopting it for that purpose. However, it does not easily allow confidential reporting of security issues, as creating Github Security Advisories is currently restricted to Github project admins.

The aarch64 implementation is considered production ready, and; an `implementation of the runtime`_ has been added to Android's libc; (bionic). An x86_64 implementation was evaluated using Chromium and was found; to have critical performance and security deficiencies--it was removed in; LLVM 9.0. Details on the x86_64 implementation can be found in the; `Clang 7.0.1 documentation`_. .. _`implementation of the runtime`: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/808d176e7e0dd727c7f929622ec017f6e065c582/libc/bionic/pthread_create.cpp#128; .. _`Clang 7.0.1 documentation`: https://releases.llvm.org/7.0.1/tools/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.html. Comparison; ----------. To optimize for memory consumption and cache locality, the shadow call; stack stores only an array of return addresses. This is in contrast to other; schemes, like :doc:`SafeStack`, that mirror the entire stack and trade-off; consuming more memory for shorter function prologs and epilogs with fewer; memory accesses. `Return Flow Guard`_ is a pure software implementation of shadow call stacks; on x86_64. Like the previous implementation of ShadowCallStack on x86_64, it is; inherently racy due to the architecture's use of the stack for calls and; returns. Intel `Control-flow Enforcement Technology`_ (CET) is a proposed hardware; extension that would add native support to use a shadow stack to store/check; return addresses at call/return time. Being a hardware implementation, it; would not suffer from race conditions and would not incur the overhead of; function instrumentation, but it does require operating system support. .. _`Return Flow Guard`: https://xlab.tencent.com/en/2016/11/02/return-flow-guard/; .. _`Control-flow Enforcement Technology`: https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf.

Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it. However, the loader and base libraries can also; simply refuse to map the heap, data segments, or stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again make everything hard. Unfortunately, the technique of using `orq`-instructions has a serious flaw on; x86. The very thing that makes it easy to accumulate state, the flag registers; containing predicates, causes serious problems here because they may be alive; and used by the loading instruction or subsequent instructions. On x86, the; `orq` instruction **sets** the flags and will override anything already there.; This makes inserting them into the instruction stream very hazardous.; Unfortunately, unlike when hardening the loaded value, we have no fallback here; and so we must have a fully general approach available.

Security,"de_semantics:. Semantics; """""""""""""""""". The TBAA metadata system, referred to as ""struct path TBAA"" (not to be; confused with ``tbaa.struct``), consists of the following high level; concepts: *Type Descriptors*, further subdivided into scalar type; descriptors and struct type descriptors; and *Access Tags*. **Type descriptors** describe the type system of the higher level language; being compiled. **Scalar type descriptors** describe types that do not; contain other types. Each scalar type has a parent type, which must also; be a scalar type or the TBAA root. Via this parent relation, scalar types; within a TBAA root form a tree. **Struct type descriptors** denote types; that contain a sequence of other type descriptors, at known offsets. These; contained type descriptors can either be struct type descriptors themselves; or scalar type descriptors. **Access tags** are metadata nodes attached to load and store instructions.; Access tags use type descriptors to describe the *location* being accessed; in terms of the type system of the higher level language. Access tags are; tuples consisting of a base type, an access type and an offset. The base; type is a scalar type descriptor or a struct type descriptor, the access; type is a scalar type descriptor, and the offset is a constant integer. The access tag ``(BaseTy, AccessTy, Offset)`` can describe one of two; things:. * If ``BaseTy`` is a struct type, the tag describes a memory access (load; or store) of a value of type ``AccessTy`` contained in the struct type; ``BaseTy`` at offset ``Offset``. * If ``BaseTy`` is a scalar type, ``Offset`` must be 0 and ``BaseTy`` and; ``AccessTy`` must be the same; and the access tag describes a scalar; access with scalar type ``AccessTy``. We first define an ``ImmediateParent`` relation on ``(BaseTy, Offset)``; tuples this way:. * If ``BaseTy`` is a scalar type then ``ImmediateParent(BaseTy, 0)`` is; ``(ParentTy, 0)`` where ``ParentTy`` is the parent of the scalar type as; described in t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:274650,access,accessed,274650,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['access'],['accessed']

Security,"defined or; defined before the function begins. An example of all of this overlaid on LLVM IR (obtained by running ``opt; -passes='print<memoryssa>' -disable-output`` on an ``.ll`` file) is below. When; viewing this example, it may be helpful to view it in terms of clobbers.; The operands of a given ``MemoryAccess`` are all (potential) clobbers of said; ``MemoryAccess``, and the value produced by a ``MemoryAccess`` can act as a clobber; for other ``MemoryAccess``\ es. If a ``MemoryAccess`` is a *clobber* of another, it means that these two; ``MemoryAccess``\ es may access the same memory. For example, ``x = MemoryDef(y)``; means that ``x`` potentially modifies memory that ``y`` modifies/constrains; (or has modified / constrained).; In the same manner, ``a = MemoryPhi({BB1,b},{BB2,c})`` means that; anyone that uses ``a`` is accessing memory potentially modified / constrained; by either ``b`` or ``c`` (or both). And finally, ``MemoryUse(x)`` means; that this use accesses memory that ``x`` has modified / constrained; (as an example, think that if ``x = MemoryDef(...)``; and ``MemoryUse(x)`` are in the same loop, the use can't; be hoisted outside alone). Another useful way of looking at it is in terms of memory versions.; In that view, operands of a given ``MemoryAccess`` are the version; of the entire memory before the operation, and if the access produces; a value (i.e. ``MemoryDef/MemoryPhi``),; the value is the new version of the memory after the operation. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() {; entry:; %p1 = alloca i8; %p2 = alloca i8; %p3 = alloca i8; ; 1 = MemoryDef(liveOnEntry); store i8 0, ptr %p3; br label %while.cond. while.cond:; ; 6 = MemoryPhi({entry,1},{if.end,4}); br i1 undef, label %if.then, label %if.else. if.then:; ; 2 = MemoryDef(6); store i8 0, ptr %p1; br label %if.end. if.else:; ; 3 = MemoryDef(6); store i8 1, ptr %p2; br label %if.end. if.end:; ; 5 = MemoryPhi({if.then,2},{if.else,3}); ; MemoryUse(5); %1 = load i8, ptr %p1; ; 4 = MemoryDef(5",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst:5098,access,accesses,5098,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,1,['access'],['accesses']

This; is usually done by emitting either a full fence before the loads or a full; fence after the stores; which is preferred varies by architecture. Atomics and IR optimization; ===========================. Predicates for optimizer writers to query:. * ``isSimple()``: A load or store which is not volatile or atomic. This is; what, for example, memcpyopt would check for operations it might transform. * ``isUnordered()``: A load or store which is not volatile and at most; Unordered. This would be checked, for example, by LICM before hoisting an; operation. * ``mayReadFromMemory()``/``mayWriteToMemory()``: Existing predicate, but note; that they return true for any operation which is volatile or at least; Monotonic. * ``isStrongerThan`` / ``isAtLeastOrStrongerThan``: These are predicates on; orderings. They can be useful for passes that are aware of atomics, for; example to do DSE across a single atomic access, but not across a; release-acquire pair (see MemoryDependencyAnalysis for an example of this). * Alias analysis: Note that AA will return ModRef for anything Acquire or; Release, and for the address accessed by any Monotonic operation. To support optimizing around atomic operations, make sure you are using the; right predicates; everything should work if that is done. If your pass should; optimize some atomic operations (Unordered operations in particular), make sure; it doesn't replace an atomic load or store with a non-atomic operation. Some examples of how optimizations interact with various kinds of atomic; operations:. * ``memcpyopt``: An atomic operation cannot be optimized into part of a; memcpy/memset, including unordered loads/stores. It can pull operations; across some atomic operations. * LICM: Unordered loads/stores can be moved out of a loop. It just treats; monotonic operations like a read+write to a memory location, and anything; stricter than that like a nothrow",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst:16535,access,access,16535,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,1,['access'],['access']

You see that the character public or; private does not depend of the type of argument. It can be a data; member, a member function, or even a class. For example, in the case; of **`TArrow`**, the base class **`TLine`** is declared as public:. ``` {.cpp}; class TArrow : public TLine { ...; ```. This means that all methods of **`TArrow`** will be able to access all; methods of **`TLine`**, but this will be also true for anybody in the; outside world. Of course, this is true if **`TLine`** accepts the; outside world to see its methods/data members. If something is; declared private in **`TLine`**, nobody will see it, not even; **`TArrow`** members, even if **`TLine`** is declared as a public; base class. What if **`TLine`** is declared ""`private`"" instead of ""`public`"" ?; Well, it will behave as any other name declared private in; **`TArrow`**: only the data members and methods of **`TArrow`** will; be able to access **`TLine`**, its methods and data members, nobody; else. This may seem a little bit confusing and readers should read a; good C++ book if they want more details. Especially since, besides; public and private, a member can be protected. Usually, one puts; private the methods that the class uses internally, like some; utilities classes, and that the programmer does not want to be seen; in the outside world. With ""good"" C++ practice (which we have tried to use in ROOT), all; data members of a class are private. This is called data encapsulation; and is one of the strongest advantages of Object Oriented Programming; (OOP). Private data members of a class are not visible, except to the; class itself.

The specific interpretation of these fields varies by the; target architecture and is detailed in the ISA descriptions. **Buffer Strided Pointer**; The buffer index pointer is an experimental address space. It represents; a 128-bit buffer descriptor and a 32-bit offset, like the **Buffer Fat; Pointer**. Additionally, it contains an index into the buffer, which; allows the direct addressing of structured elements. These components appear; in that order, i.e., the descriptor comes first, then the 32-bit offset; followed by the 32-bit index. The bits in the buffer descriptor must meet the following requirements:; the stride is the size of a structured element, the ""add tid"" flag must be 0,; and the swizzle enable bits must be off. **Streamout Registers**; Dedicated registers used by the GS NGG Streamout Instructions. The register; file is modelled as a memory in a distinct address space because it is indexed; by an address-like offset in place of named registers, and because register; accesses affect LGKMcnt.

Security,"dules:. * **Rewrite the world's code**: It is not realistic to require applications or software libraries to make drastic or non-backward-compatible changes, nor is it feasible to completely eliminate headers. Modules must interoperate with existing software libraries and allow a gradual transition. * **Versioning**: Modules have no notion of version information. Programmers must still rely on the existing versioning mechanisms of the underlying language (if any exist) to version software libraries. * **Namespaces**: Unlike in some languages, modules do not imply any notion of namespaces. Thus, a struct declared in one module will still conflict with a struct of the same name declared in a different module, just as they would if declared in two different headers. This aspect is important for backward compatibility, because (for example) the mangled names of entities in software libraries must not change when introducing modules. * **Binary distribution of modules**: Headers (particularly C++ headers) expose the full complexity of the language. Maintaining a stable binary module format across architectures, compiler versions, and compiler vendors is technically infeasible.

The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU over XGMI or PCIe the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host; memory accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2; cache. This also causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not; invalidated by ``*_vol``.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and; so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents.

Ref-countable types aren't supposed to be allocated on stack so we check arguments for parameters of raw pointers and references to uncounted types. Here are some examples of situations that we warn about as they *might* be potentially unsafe. The logic is that either we're able to guarantee that an argument is safe or it's considered if not a bug then bug-prone. .. code-block:: cpp. RefCountable* provide_uncounted();; void consume(RefCountable*);. // In these cases we can't make sure callee won't directly or indirectly call `deref()` on the argument which could make it unsafe from such point until the end of the call. void foo1() {; consume(provide_uncounted()); // warn; }. void foo2() {; RefCountable* uncounted = provide_uncounted();; consume(uncounted); // warn; }. Although we are enforcing member variables to be ref-counted by `webkit.NoUncountedMemberChecker` any method of the same class still has unrestricted access to these. Since from a caller's perspective we can't guarantee a particular member won't get modified by callee (directly or indirectly) we don't consider values obtained from members safe. Note: It's likely this heuristic could be made more precise with fewer false positives - for example calls to free functions that don't have any parameter other than the pointer should be safe as the callee won't be able to tamper with the member unless it's a global variable. .. code-block:: cpp. struct Foo {; RefPtr<RefCountable> member;; void consume(RefCountable*) { /* ... */ }; void bugprone() {; consume(member.get()); // warn; }; };. The implementation of this rule is a heuristic - we define a whitelist of kinds of values that are considered safe to be passed as arguments.

Origin tracking trace representation; ------------------------------------. An origin tracking trace is a list of chains. Each chain has a stack trace; where the DFSan runtime records a label propagation, and a pointer to its; previous chain. The very first chain does not point to any chain. Every four 4-bytes aligned application bytes share a 4-byte origin trace ID. A; 4-byte origin trace ID contains a 4-bit depth and a 28-bit hash ID of a chain. A chain ID is calculated as a hash from a chain structure. A chain structure; contains a stack ID and the previous chain ID. The chain head has a zero; previous chain ID. A stack ID is a hash from a stack trace. The 4-bit depth; limits the maximal length of a path. The environment variable ``origin_history_size``; can set the depth limit. Non-positive values mean unlimited. Its default value; is 16. When reaching the limit, origin tracking ignores following propagation; chains. The first chain of a trace starts by `dfsan_set_label` with non-zero labels. A; new chain is appended at the end of a trace at stores or memory transfers when; ``-dfsan-track-origins`` is 1. Memory transfers include LLVM memory transfer; instructions, glibc memcpy and memmove. When ``-dfsan-track-origins`` is 2, a; new chain is also appended at loads. Other instructions do not create new chains, but simply propagate origin trace; IDs.

This is particularly true because LLVM is used in; a wide variety of circumstances: there are different threat models, untrusted; inputs differ, and the environment LLVM runs in is varied. Therefore, what the; LLVM Project considers a security issue is what its members have signed up to; maintain securely. As this security process matures, members of the LLVM community can propose that; a part of the codebase be designated as security-sensitive (or no longer; security-sensitive). This requires a rationale, and buy-in from the LLVM; community as for any RFC.

Instruction naming; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An instruction name consists of the base name, a default operand size, and a; character per operand with an optional special size. For example:. ::. ADD8rr -> add, 8-bit register, 8-bit register; IMUL16rmi -> imul, 16-bit register, 16-bit memory, 16-bit immediate; IMUL16rmi8 -> imul, 16-bit register, 16-bit memory, 8-bit immediate; MOVSX32rm16 -> movsx, 32-bit register, 16-bit memory.

The code; generation is retargetable to several variations or *subtargets* of the PowerPC; ISA; including ppc32, ppc64 and altivec. LLVM PowerPC ABI; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. LLVM follows the AIX PowerPC ABI, with two deviations. LLVM uses a PC relative; (PIC) or static addressing for accessing global values, so no TOC (r2) is; used. Second, r31 is used as a frame pointer to allow dynamic growth of a stack; frame. LLVM takes advantage of having no TOC to provide space to save the frame; pointer in the PowerPC linkage area of the caller frame. Other details of; PowerPC ABI can be found at `PowerPC ABI; <http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/LowLevelABI/Articles/32bitPowerPC.html>`_\; . Note: This link describes the 32 bit ABI. The 64 bit ABI is similar except; space for GPRs are 8 bytes wide (not 4) and r13 is reserved for system use. Frame Layout; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The size of a PowerPC frame is usually fixed for the duration of a function's; invocation. Since the frame is fixed size, all references into the frame can be; accessed via fixed offsets from the stack pointer.

Security,"e pointer is either pointing to a single; object or null. Hence, pointers with ``__single`` do not permit pointer; arithmetic nor being subscripted with a non-zero index. Dereferencing a; ``__single`` pointer is allowed but it requires a null check. Upper and lower; bounds checks are not required because the ``__single`` pointer should point; to a valid object unless it's null. ``__single`` is the default annotation for ABI-visible pointers. This; gives strong security guarantees in that these pointers cannot be incremented or; decremented unless they have an explicit, overriding bounds annotation that can; be used to verify the safety of the operation. The compiler issues an error when; a ``__single`` pointer is utilized for pointer arithmetic or array access, as; these operations would immediately cause the pointer to exceed its bounds.; Consequently, this prompts programmers to provide sufficient bounds information; to pointers.

As a result, the compiler; generates an error suggesting to add ``__counted_by`` to the pointer. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *p, unsigned count) {; for (unsigned i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; p[i] = i; // error; }; }.

Moreover, this means that invalidating a single; instance variable should *not* invalidate the rest of the object, since unlike; struct fields or array elements there is no way to perform pointer arithmetic; to access another instance variable. Consequently, although the base region of an ObjCIvarRegion is the entire; object, RegionStore offsets are computed from the start of the instance; variable. Thus it is not valid to assume that all bindings with non-symbolic; offsets start from the base region!. Region Invalidation; -------------------. Unlike binding invalidation, region invalidation occurs when the entire; contents of a region may have changed---say, because it has been passed to a; function the analyzer can model, like memcpy, or because its address has; escaped, usually as an argument to an opaque function call. In these cases we; need to throw away not just all bindings within the region itself, but within; its entire cluster, since neighboring regions may be accessed via pointer; arithmetic. Region invalidation typically does even more than this, however. Because it; usually represents the complete escape of a region from the analyzer's model,; its *contents* must also be transitively invalidated. (For example, if a region; ``p`` of type ``int **`` is invalidated, the contents of ``*p`` and ``**p`` may; have changed as well.) The algorithm that traverses this transitive closure of; accessible regions is known as ClusterAnalysis, and is also used for finding; all live bindings in the store (in order to throw away the dead ones). The name; ""ClusterAnalysis"" predates the cluster-based organization of bindings, but; refers to the same concept: during invalidation and liveness analysis, all; bindings within a cluster must be treated in the same way for a conservative; model of program behavior.

All agents (GPU and CPU) access GPU memory through the MALL cache. Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not; change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes constant; address space and global address space for program scope ``const`` variables.; Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to; ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L0 and L1 caches at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid; needing to invalidate the L2 cache.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and; so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents.

The design; of the method pool is similar to that of the :ref:`identifier table; <pchinternals-ident-table>`: the first time a particular selector is formed; during the compilation of the program, Clang will search in the on-disk hash; table of selectors; if found, Clang will read the Objective-C methods; associated with that selector into the appropriate front-end data structure; (``Sema::InstanceMethodPool`` and ``Sema::FactoryMethodPool`` for instance and; class methods, respectively).

This is true information encapsulation, and ensures that the object can be used as a true software component. Signals and slots can take any number of arguments of any type. It is possible to connect as many signals as you want to a single slot, and a signal can be connected to as many slots as you desire. It is possible to make a single connection from all objects of the same class. ## A Small Example. A minimal C++ class declaration might read:. ``` {.cpp}; class A {; private:; Int_t fValue;; public:; A() { fValue = 0; }; Int_t GetValue() const { return fValue; }; void SetValue(Int_t);; };; ```. A small ROOT **interpreted** class might read:. ``` {.cpp}; class A {; RQ_OBJECT(""A""); private:; Int_t fValue;; public:; A() { fValue = 0; }; Int_t GetValue() const { return fValue; }; void SetValue(Int_t); //*SIGNAL*; };; ```. This class has the same internal state, and public methods to access the state, but in addition it has support for component programming using signals. This class can tell the outside world that its state has changed by emitting a signal, `SetValue(Int_t)`. Here is a possible implementation of `A::SetValue()`:. ``` {.cpp}; void A::SetValue(Int_t v); {; if (v != fValue) {; fValue = v;; Emit(""SetValue(Int_t)"", v);; }; }; ```. The line `Emit(""SetValue(Int_t)"", v)` emits the signal `SetValue(Int_t)` with argument `v` from the object. As you can see, you emit a signal by using `Emit(""full_method_name"",arguments)`. Here is one of the ways to connect two of these objects together:. ``` {.cpp}; A *a = new A();; A *b = new A();; a->Connect(""SetValue(Int_t)"", ""A"", b, ""SetValue(Int_t)"");; b->SetValue(11);; a->SetValue(79);; b->GetValue(); // this would now be 79, why?; ```. The statement `a->Connect(""SetValue(Int_t)"", ""A"", b, ""SetValue(Int_t)"")` denotes that object `a` connects its `""SetValue(Int_t)""` signal to `""A::SetValue(Int_t)""` method of object `b`.

First, start by; defining an enum of the optimizations that you would like to perform:. .. code-block:: c++. enum Opts {; // 'inline' is a C++ keyword, so name it 'inlining'; dce, instsimplify, inlining, strip; };. Then define your ""``cl::list``"" variable:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::list<Opts> OptimizationList(cl::desc(""Available Optimizations:""),; cl::values(; clEnumVal(dce , ""Dead Code Elimination""),; clEnumVal(instsimplify , ""Instruction Simplification""),; clEnumValN(inlining, ""inline"", ""Procedure Integration""),; clEnumVal(strip , ""Strip Symbols"")));. This defines a variable that is conceptually of the type; ""``std::vector<enum Opts>``"". Thus, you can access it with standard vector; methods:. .. code-block:: c++. for (unsigned i = 0; i != OptimizationList.size(); ++i); switch (OptimizationList[i]); ... ... to iterate through the list of options specified. Note that the ""``cl::list``"" template is completely general and may be used with; any data types or other arguments that you can use with the ""``cl::opt``""; template. One especially useful way to use a list is to capture all of the; positional arguments together if there may be more than one specified.

By default, objects involved in RNTuple I/O (objects read from disk or written to disk) are passed to RNTuple as shared pointers.; Both RNTuple or the application may create the object.; Raw pointers to objects can be passed to RNTuple -- such objects are considered as owned by the application.; The caller has to ensure that the lifetime of the object lasts during the I/O operations. An RNTuple writer that is constructed without a `TFile` object (`RNTupleWriter::Recreate()`) assumes exclusive access to the underlying file.; An RNTuple writer that uses a `TFile` for writing (`RNTupleWriter::Append()`) assumes that the `TFile` object outlives the writer's lifetime.; The serial writer assumes exclusive access to the underlying file during construction, destruction and `Fill()` as well as `CommitCluster()` and `FlushCluster()`.; For `FlushColumns()` and `FillNoFlush()`, the sequential writer assumes exclusive access only if buffered writing is turned off.; The parallel writer assumes exclusive access to the underlying file during all operations on the writer (e.g. construction and destruction) and all operations on any created fill context (e.g. `Fill()` and `FlushCluster()`).; Notable exceptions are `FlushColumns()` and `FillNoFlush()` which are guaranteed to never access the underlying `TFile` during parallel writing (which is always buffered). A `TFile` does not take ownership of any `RNTuple` objects. When reading data, RNTuple uses the `RMiniFile` and `RRawFile` classes to open a given storage path and find the `RNTuple` anchor.; When creating a `RNTupleReader` from an existing anchor object, RNTuple uses `RRawFile` only for files of dynamic type `TFile`, `TDavixFile`, and `TNetXNGFile`.; In either case, the `RRawFile` owns its own file descriptor and does not interfere with `TFile` objects concurrently reading the file.; For anchors from files of other dynamic type,",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md:18031,access,access,18031,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md,1,['access'],['access']

It takes a series of arguments, of three possible kinds:. #. Raw text, to be copied directly to the output.; #. Selector: specified with a ``RangeSelector``, indicates a range of source text; to copy to the output.; #. Builder: an operation that constructs a code snippet from its arguments. For; example, the ``access`` function we saw above. Data of these different types are all represented (generically) by a ``Stencil``.; ``cat`` takes text and ``RangeSelector``\ s directly as arguments, rather than; requiring that they be constructed with a builder; other builders are; constructed explicitly. In general, ``Stencil``\ s produce text from a match result. So, they are not; limited to generating source code, but can also be used to generate diagnostic; messages that reference (named) elements of the matched code, like we saw in the; example of rewriting method calls.

One can defend against this type of vulnerability by always checking and; sanitizing the potentially malicious, untrusted user input.

Many of the potential; improvements end up being discussed on the `monthly public call on LLVM's; security group <https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#online-sync-ups>`_. 2022; ----. In this section we report on the issues the group received in 2022, or on issues; that were received earlier, but were disclosed in 2022. In 2022, the llvm security group received 15 issues that have been disclosed at; the time of writing this transparency report. 5 of these were judged to be security issues:. * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/llvm/issues/detail?id=17 reports a miscompile in; LLVM that can result in the frame pointer and return address being; overwritten.

TMathText's purpose is to write mathematical equations, exactly as TeX; would do it. The syntax is the same as the TeX's one. The script `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/graphics/tmathtex.C`:. gives the following output:. ![A TMathText example](pictures/mathtext.png). `TMathText` uses plain TeX syntax and uses ""\\"" as control instead of; ""\#"". If a piece of text containing ""\\"" is given to `TLatex` then; `TMathText` is automatically invoked. Therefore, as histograms' titles,; axis titles, labels etc ... are drawn using `TLatex`, the `TMathText`; syntax can be used for them also. ## Axis. The axis objects are automatically built by various high level objects; such as histograms or graphs. Once build, one may access them and change; their characteristics. It is also possible, for some particular purposes; to build axis on their own. This may be useful for example in the case; one wants to draw two axis for the same plot, one on the left and one on; the right. For historical reasons, there are two classes representing axis.; **`TAxis`** \* `axis` is the axis object, which will be returned when; calling the `TH1::GetAxis()` method. ``` {.cpp}; TAxis *axis = histo->GetXaxis(); ```. Of course, you may do the same for `Y` and `Z`-axis. The graphical; representation of an axis is done with the **`TGaxis`** class. The; histogram classes and **`TGraph`** generate instances of this class.; This is internal and the user should not have to see it. ### Axis Title. The axis title is set, as with all named objects, by. ``` {.cpp}; axis->SetTitle(""Whatever title you want"");; ```. When the axis is embedded into a histogram or a graph, one has to first; extract the axis object:. ``` {.cpp}; h->GetXaxis()->SetTitle(""What",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:49469,access,access,49469,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['access'],['access']

If you want to use CUDA libraries and have access to a GPU on your machine,; you should choose nvidia-cuda-based image and use `nvidia-docker; <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_ to run your docker containers. Note; that you don't need nvidia-docker to build the images, but you need it in order; to have an access to GPU from a docker container that is running the built; image. If you have a different use-case, you could create your own image based on; ``example/`` folder. Any docker image can be built and run using only the docker binary, i.e. you can; run debian10 build on Fedora or any other Linux distribution.

Security,"e; user-specified type is always immediately available. There are two problems; with this: first, various semantic checks need to make judgements about the; *actual structure* of a type, ignoring typedefs. Second, we need an efficient; way to query whether two types are structurally identical to each other,; ignoring typedefs. The solution to both of these problems is the idea of; canonical types. .. _CanonicalType:. Canonical Types; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every instance of the ``Type`` class contains a canonical type pointer. For; simple types with no typedefs involved (e.g., ""``int``"", ""``int*``"",; ""``int**``""), the type just points to itself. For types that have a typedef; somewhere in their structure (e.g., ""``foo``"", ""``foo*``"", ""``foo**``"",; ""``bar``""), the canonical type pointer points to their structurally equivalent; type without any typedefs (e.g., ""``int``"", ""``int*``"", ""``int**``"", and; ""``int*``"" respectively). This design provides a constant time operation (dereferencing the canonical type; pointer) that gives us access to the structure of types. For example, we can; trivially tell that ""``bar``"" and ""``foo*``"" are the same type by dereferencing; their canonical type pointers and doing a pointer comparison (they both point; to the single ""``int*``"" type). Canonical types and typedef types bring up some complexities that must be; carefully managed. Specifically, the ``isa``/``cast``/``dyn_cast`` operators; generally shouldn't be used in code that is inspecting the AST. For example,; when type checking the indirection operator (unary ""``*``"" on a pointer), the; type checker must verify that the operand has a pointer type. It would not be; correct to check that with ""``isa<PointerType>(SubExpr->getType())``"", because; this predicate would fail if the subexpression had a typedef type. The solution to this problem are a set of helper methods on ``Type``, used to; check their properties. In this case, it would be correct to use; ""``SubExpr->getType()->isPointerType",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:64208,access,access,64208,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['access'],['access']

The Virtual Analysis Facility client is a wrapper around commands sent; to the remote host by means of PROOF on Demand's `pod-remote`.

In our example we will assume that the remote server's name is; `cloud-gw-213.to.infn.it`: substitute it with your remote endpoint. First, check that you have your Grid certificate and private key; installed both in your browser and in the home directory of your; client. Point your browser to `https://cloud-gw-213.to.infn.it/auth/`: you'll; probably be asked for a certificate to choose for authentication. Pick; one and you'll be presented with the following web page:. ![Web authentication with sshcertauth](img/sshcertauth-web.png). The webpage clearly explains you what to do next. ### Customizing user's configuration. Before entering the VAF environment, you should customize the user's; configuration. How to do so depends on your experiment, but usually you; should essentially specify the version of the experiment's software you; need. For instance, in the CMS use case, only one file is needed:; `~/.vaf/common.before`, which contains something like:. ``` {.bash}; # Version of CMSSW (as reported by ""scram list""); export VafCmsswVersion='CMSSW_5_3_9_sherpa2beta2'; ```. ### Entering the VAF environment.

'``noalias``' and '``alias.scope``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``noalias`` and ``alias.scope`` metadata provide the ability to specify generic; noalias memory-access sets. This means that some collection of memory access; instructions (loads, stores, memory-accessing calls, etc.) that carry; ``noalias`` metadata can specifically be specified not to alias with some other; collection of memory access instructions that carry ``alias.scope`` metadata.; Each type of metadata specifies a list of scopes where each scope has an id and; a domain. When evaluating an aliasing query, if for some domain, the set; of scopes with that domain in one instruction's ``alias.scope`` list is a; subset of (or equal to) the set of scopes for that domain in another; instruction's ``noalias`` list, then the two memory accesses are assumed not to; alias. Because scopes in one domain don't affect scopes in other domains, separate; domains can be used to compose multiple independent noalias sets. This is; used for example during inlining.

The ordering of; statements within a block indicates unconditional flow of control from one; statement to the next. :ref:`Conditional control-flow; <ConditionalControlFlow>` is represented using edges between basic blocks. The; statements within a given ``CFGBlock`` can be traversed using the; ``CFGBlock::*iterator`` interface. A ``CFG`` object owns the instances of ``CFGBlock`` within the control-flow; graph it represents. Each ``CFGBlock`` within a CFG is also uniquely numbered; (accessible via ``CFGBlock::getBlockID()``). Currently the number is based on; the ordering the blocks were created, but no assumptions should be made on how; ``CFGBlocks`` are numbered other than their numbers are unique and that they; are numbered from 0..N-1 (where N is the number of basic blocks in the CFG). Entry and Exit Blocks; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Each instance of ``CFG`` contains two special blocks: an *entry* block; (accessible via ``CFG::getEntry()``), which has no incoming edges, and an; *exit* block (accessible via ``CFG::getExit()``), which has no outgoing edges.; Neither block contains any statements, and they serve the role of providing a; clear entrance and exit for a body of code such as a function body. The; presence of these empty blocks greatly simplifies the implementation of many; analyses built on top of CFGs. .. _ConditionalControlFlow:. Conditional Control-Flow; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Conditional control-flow (such as those induced by if-statements and loops) is; represented as edges between ``CFGBlocks``. Because different C language; constructs can induce control-flow, each ``CFGBlock`` also records an extra; ``Stmt*`` that represents the *terminator* of the block. A terminator is; simply the statement that caused the control-flow, and is used to identify the; nature of the conditional control-flow between blocks.

This section describes the :program:`lit` testing architecture for users interested in; creating a new :program:`lit` testing implementation, or extending an existing one. :program:`lit` proper is primarily an infrastructure for discovering and running; arbitrary tests, and to expose a single convenient interface to these; tests. :program:`lit` itself doesn't know how to run tests, rather this logic is; defined by *test suites*. TEST SUITES; ~~~~~~~~~~~. As described in :ref:`test-discovery`, tests are always located inside a *test; suite*. Test suites serve to define the format of the tests they contain, the; logic for finding those tests, and any additional information to run the tests. :program:`lit` identifies test suites as directories containing ``lit.cfg`` or; ``lit.site.cfg`` files (see also :option:`--config-prefix`). Test suites are; initially discovered by recursively searching up the directory hierarchy for; all the input files passed on the command line.

A; UUID is 128 bits long, and if generated according to this algorithm, is; either guaranteed to be different from all other UUID generated until; 3400 A.D. or extremely likely to be different. The **`TROOT`** constructor automatically creates a **`TProcessID`**.; When a **`TFile`** contains referenced objects, the **`TProcessID`**; object is written to the file. If a file has been written in multiple; sessions (same machine or not), a **`TProcessID`** is written for each; session. The **`TProcessID`** objects are used by **`TRef`** to uniquely; identify the referenced **`TObject`**. When a referenced object is read from a file (its bit `kIsReferenced` is; set), this object is entered into the objects table of the corresponding; **`TProcessID`**. Each **`TFile`** has a list of **`TProcessIDs`** (see; `TFile::fProcessIDs`) also accessible from `TProcessID::fgPIDs`; (for all files). When this object is deleted, it is removed from the; table via the cleanup mechanism invoked by the **`TObject`** destructor.; Each **`TProcessID`** has a table (`TObjArray *fObjects`) that keeps; track of all referenced objects.

We could define a new ABI and/or calling convention to explicitly pass the; predicate state in and out of functions. This may be interesting if none of the; alternatives have adequate performance, but it makes deployment and adoption; dramatically more complex, and potentially infeasible. ## High-Level Alternative Mitigation Strategies. There are completely different alternative approaches to mitigating variant 1; attacks. [Most](https://lwn.net/Articles/743265/); [discussion](https://lwn.net/Articles/744287/) so far focuses on mitigating; specific known attackable components in the Linux kernel (or other kernels) by; manually rewriting the code to contain an instruction sequence that is not; vulnerable. For x86 systems this is done by either injecting an `lfence`; instruction along the code path which would leak data if executed speculatively; or by rewriting memory accesses to have branch-less masking to a known safe; region. On Intel systems, `lfence` [will prevent the speculative load of secret; data](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/Intel-Analysis-of-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channels.pdf).; On AMD systems `lfence` is currently a no-op, but can be made; dispatch-serializing by setting an MSR, and thus preclude misspeculation of the; code path ([mitigation G-2 +; V1-1](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Managing-Speculation-on-AMD-Processors.pdf)). However, this relies on finding and enumerating all possible points in code; which could be attacked to leak information.

This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process. JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process. JITLinkMemoryManager and Security; ---------------------------------. JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead for the dual mapping).

JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:31067,secur,security,31067,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,1,['secur'],['security']

While in some cases static; analysis is effective at doing this at scale, in many cases it still relies on; human judgement to evaluate whether code might be vulnerable. Especially for; software systems which receive less detailed scrutiny but remain sensitive to; these attacks, this seems like an impractical security model. We need an; automatic and systematic mitigation strategy. ### Automatic `lfence` on Conditional Edges. A natural way to scale up the existing hand-coded mitigations is simply to; inject an `lfence` instruction into both the target and fallthrough; destinations of every conditional branch. This ensures that no predicate or; bounds check can be bypassed speculatively. However, the performance overhead; of this approach is, simply put, catastrophic. Yet it remains the only truly; ""secure by default"" approach known prior to this effort and serves as the; baseline for performance. One attempt to address the performance overhead of this and make it more; realistic to deploy is [MSVC's /Qspectre; switch](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/01/15/spectre-mitigations-in-msvc/).; Their technique is to use static analysis within the compiler to only insert; `lfence` instructions into conditional edges at risk of attack. However,; [initial](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/microsofts-compiler-level-spectre-fix-shows-how-hard-this-problem-will-be-to-solve/); [analysis](https://www.paulkocher.com/doc/MicrosoftCompilerSpectreMitigation.html); has shown that this approach is incomplete and only catches a small and limited; subset of attackable patterns which happen to resemble very closely the initial; proofs of concept. As such, while its performance is acceptable, it does not; appear to be an adequate systematic mitigation. ## Performance Overhead.

Each linkage unit has only a single LTO unit. The LTO visibility of a class is used by the compiler to determine which; classes the whole-program devirtualization (``-fwhole-program-vtables``) and; control flow integrity (``-fsanitize=cfi-vcall`` and ``-fsanitize=cfi-mfcall``); features apply to. These features use whole-program information, so they; require the entire class hierarchy to be visible in order to work correctly. If any translation unit in the program uses either of the whole-program; devirtualization or control flow integrity features, it is effectively an ODR; violation to define a class with hidden LTO visibility in multiple linkage; units. A class with public LTO visibility may be defined in multiple linkage; units, but the tradeoff is that the whole-program devirtualization and; control flow integrity features can only be applied to classes with hidden LTO; visibility. A class's LTO visibility is treated as an ODR-relevant property; of its definition, so it must be consistent between translation units. In translation units built with LTO, LTO visibility is based on the; class's symbol visibility as expressed at the source level (i.e. the; ``__attribute__((visibility(""..."")))`` attribute, or the ``-fvisibility=``; flag) or, on the Windows platform, the dllimport and dllexport attributes. When; targeting non-Windows platforms, classes with a visibility other than hidden; visibility receive public LTO visibility. When targeting Windows, classes; with dllimport or dllexport attributes receive public LTO visibility. All; other classes receive hidden LTO visibility. Classes with internal linkage; (e.g. classes declared in unnamed namespaces) also receive hidden LTO; visibility.

To prevent this unsafety,; ``-fbounds-safety`` provides the annotation ``__single`` that causes pointer; arithmetic on annotated pointers to be a compile time error. * ``__single`` : indicates that the pointer is either pointing to a single; object or null. Hence, pointers with ``__single`` do not permit pointer; arithmetic nor being subscripted with a non-zero index. Dereferencing a; ``__single`` pointer is allowed but it requires a null check. Upper and lower; bounds checks are not required because the ``__single`` pointer should point; to a valid object unless it's null. ``__single`` is the default annotation for ABI-visible pointers. This; gives strong security guarantees in that these pointers cannot be incremented or; decremented unless they have an explicit, overriding bounds annotation that can; be used to verify the safety of the operation. The compiler issues an error when; a ``__single`` pointer is utilized for pointer arithmetic or array access, as; these operations would immediately cause the pointer to exceed its bounds.; Consequently, this prompts programmers to provide sufficient bounds information; to pointers. In the following example, the pointer on parameter p is; single-by-default, and is employed for array access. As a result, the compiler; generates an error suggesting to add ``__counted_by`` to the pointer. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *p, unsigned count) {; for (unsigned i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; p[i] = i; // error; }; }.

In the following example, ``__counted_by(count)``; annotation expresses the bounds of parameter p using another parameter count.; This model works naturally with many C interfaces and structs because the bounds; of a p",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:8400,access,access,8400,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['access'],['access']

This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it. However, the loader and base libraries can also; simply refuse to map the heap, data segments, or stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again make everything hard. Unfortunately, the technique of using `orq`-instructions has a serious flaw on; x86. The very thing that makes it easy to accumulate state, the flag registers; containing predicates, causes serious problems here because they may be alive; and used by the loading instruction or subsequent instructions. On x86, the; `orq` instruction **sets** the flags and will override anything already there.; This makes inserting them into the instruction stream ve",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:30674,attack,attacker,30674,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['attack'],['attacker']

However, some; virtual addresses may only be accessible to the CPU, some only accessible; by the GPU, and some by both. Using the constant address space indicates that the data will not change; during the execution of the kernel. This allows scalar read instructions to; be used. As the constant address space could only be modified on the host; side, a generic pointer loaded from the constant address space is safe to be; assumed as a global pointer since only the device global memory is visible; and managed on the host side. The vector and scalar L1 caches are invalidated; of volatile data before each kernel dispatch execution to allow constant; memory to change values between kernel dispatches. **Region**; The region address space uses the hardware Global Data Store (GDS).

However, the same region address accessed by wavefronts; executing on different devices will access different memory. It is higher; performance than global memory. It is allocated by the runtime.

The advertised premise of Numba is that it ""makes Python code fast.""; However, there is a much more compelling reason: Numba allows developers to; stay in their chosen ecosystem, be it Python or C++, in mixed environments,; without paying for their choice in lost performance.; For example, a Python developer using Numba does not need to rewrite a kernel; into C++ just to run performantly in a C++ framework.; Similarly, a C++ developer can use Numba to compile and create function; pointers to Python code for easy, performant, access.; This becomes even more compelling if the deployment target is a GPU, which; would otherwise certainly require a rewrite of the Python code.; Add that Numba, as a JIT-compiler, is fully run-time just like ``cppyy``,; and the use case for integration is clear.; (Numba does not currently provide support for C++.). Usage; -------. ``cppyy`` does not use Numba extension hooks to minimize accidental; dependencies.; Instead, it requires that the extensions are loaded explicitly by any code; that uses it::. import cppyy.numba_ext. After that, Numba is able to trace ``cppyy`` bound code when applying the; usual ``numba.njit`` decorator. Numba type declarations are done lazily, with the ``numba_ext`` module only; initially registering hooks on proxy base classes, to keep overheads in; Numba's type-resolution to a minimum.; On use in a JITed trace, each C++ type or function call is refined to the; actual, concrete types and type-sp",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst:1912,access,access,1912,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,1,['access'],['access']

The ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata refers to one or more; access group metadata nodes (see ``llvm.access.group``). It denotes that; no loop-carried memory dependence exist between it and other instructions; in the loop with this metadata. Let ``m1`` and ``m2`` be two instructions that both have the; ``llvm.access.group`` metadata to the access group ``g1``, respectively; ``g2`` (which might be identical). If a loop contains both access groups; in its ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata, then the compiler can; assume that there is no dependency between ``m1`` and ``m2`` carried by; this loop. Instructions that belong to multiple access groups are; considered having this property if at least one of the access groups; matches the ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` list. If all memory-accessing instructions in a loop have; ``llvm.access.group`` metadata that each refer to one of the access; groups of a loop's ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata, then the; loop has no loop carried memory dependences and is considered to be a; parallel loop. Note that if not all memory access instructions belong to an access; group referred to by ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses``, then the loop must; not be considered trivially parallel. Additional; memory dependence analysis is required to make that determination. As a fail; safe mechanism, this causes loops that were originally parallel to be considered; sequential (if optimization passes that are unaware of the parallel semantics; insert new memory instructions into the loop body).

Ideally, the analysis would allow initialization of guarded members inside the; object being initialized or destroyed, while still enforcing the usual access; restrictions on everything else.

The '``llvm.memmove.element.unordered.atomic.*``' intrinsic copies ``len`` bytes; of memory from the source location to the destination location. These locations; are allowed to overlap.

In exchange for this high cost, std::list supports efficient access to both ends; of the list (like ``std::deque``, but unlike ``std::vector`` or; ``SmallVector``).

Security,"eneric_link_algorithm:. Generic Link Algorithm; ======================. JITLink provides a generic link algorithm which can be extended / modified at; certain points by the introduction of JITLink :ref:`passes`. At the end of each phase the linker packages its state into a *continuation*; and calls the ``JITLinkContext`` object to perform a (potentially high-latency); asynchronous operation: allocating memory, resolving external symbols, and; finally transferring linked memory to the executing process. #. Phase 1. This phase is called immediately by the ``link`` function as soon as the; initial configuration (including the pass pipeline setup) is complete. #. Run pre-prune passes. These passes are called on the graph before it is pruned. At this stage; ``LinkGraph`` nodes still have their original vmaddrs. A mark-live pass; (supplied by the ``JITLinkContext``) will be run at the end of this; sequence to mark the initial set of live symbols. Notable use cases: marking nodes live, accessing/copying graph data that; will be pruned (e.g. metadata that's important for the JIT, but not needed; for the link process). #. Prune (dead-strip) the ``LinkGraph``. Removes all symbols and blocks not reachable from the initial set of live; symbols. This allows JITLink to remove unreachable symbols / content, including; overridden weak and redundant ODR definitions. #. Run post-prune passes. These passes are run on the graph after dead-stripping, but before memory; is allocated or nodes assigned their final target vmaddrs. Passes run at this stage benefit from pruning, as dead functions and data; have been stripped from the graph. However new content can still be added; to the graph, as target and working memory have not been allocated yet. Notable use cases: Building Global Offset Table (GOT), Procedure Linkage; Table (PLT), and Thread Local Variable (TLV) entries. #. Asynchronously allocate memory.

Security,"ent in code,; there is a more subtle issue that opaque pointers need to contend with: A lot; of code assumes that pointer equality also implies that the used load/store; type or GEP source element type is the same. Consider the following examples; with typed and opaque pointers:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32* %p) {; store i32 0, i32* %p; %bc = bitcast i32* %p to i64*; %v = load i64, i64* %bc; ret i64 %v; }. define i32 @test(ptr %p) {; store i32 0, ptr %p; %v = load i64, ptr %p; ret i64 %v; }. Without opaque pointers, a check that the pointer operand of the load and; store are the same also ensures that the accessed type is the same. Using a; different type requires a bitcast, which will result in distinct pointer; operands. With opaque pointers, the bitcast is not present, and this check is no longer; sufficient. In the above example, it could result in store to load forwarding; of an incorrect type. Code making such assumptions needs to be adjusted to; check the accessed type explicitly:; ``LI->getType() == SI->getValueOperand()->getType()``. Frontends; ---------. Frontends need to be adjusted to track pointee types independently of LLVM,; insofar as they are necessary for lowering. For example, clang now tracks the; pointee type in the ``Address`` structure.

Users are responsible for managing the 8 integer labels (i.e., keeping; track of what labels they have used so far, picking one that is yet; unused, etc). Origin tracking trace representation; ------------------------------------. An origin tracking trace is a list of chains. Each chain has a stack trace; where the DFSan runtime records a label propagation, and a pointer to its; previous chain. The very first chain does not point to any chain. Every four 4-bytes aligned application bytes share a 4-byte origin trace ID. A; 4-byte origin trace ID contains a 4-bit depth and a 28-bit hash ID of a chain. A chain ID is calculated as a hash from a chain structure. A chain structure; contains a stack ID and the previous chain ID. The chain head has a zero; previous chain ID. A stack ID is a hash from a stack trace. The 4-bit depth; limits the maximal length of a path. The environment variable ``origin_history_size``; can set the depth limit. Non-positive values mean unlimited. Its default value; is 16. When reaching the limit, origin tracking ignores following propagation; chains. The first chain of a trace starts by `dfsan_set_label` with non-zero labels. A; new chain is appended at the end of a trace at stores or memory transfers when; ``-dfsan-track-origins`` is 1. Memory transfers include LLVM memory transfer; instructions, glibc memcpy and memmove. When ``-dfsan-track-origins`` is 2, a; new chain is also appended at loads.

Measuring the uop decomposition or inverse throughput of an instruction works similarly:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-exegesis --mode=uops --opcode-name=ADD64rr; $ llvm-exegesis --mode=inverse_throughput --opcode-name=ADD64rr.

Security,"er linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead for the dual mapping). Error Handling; --------------. JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual` for details). The link process itself, all; passes, the memory manager interface, and operations on the ``JITLinkContext``; are all permitted to fail. Link graph construction utilities (especially parsers; for object formats) are encouraged to validate input, and validate fixups; (e.g. with range checks) before application. Any error will halt the link process and notify the context of failure. In ORC,; reported failures are propagated to queries pending on definitions provided by; the failing link, and also through edges of the dependence graph to any queries; waiting on dependent symbols. .. _connection_to_orc_runtime:.

The ORC Runtime (currently under development) aims to provide runtime support; for advanced JIT features, including object format features that require; non-trivial action in the executor (e.g. running initializers, managing thread; local storage, registering with language runtimes, etc.).

Security,"er lookup. If we repeat the same ""``printf``"" lookup from above, we; would hash ""``printf``"" and find it matches ``BUCKETS[3]`` by taking the 32 bit; hash value and modulo it by ``n_buckets``. ``BUCKETS[3]`` contains ""6"" which; is the index into the ``HASHES`` table. We would then compare any consecutive; 32 bit hashes values in the ``HASHES`` array as long as the hashes would be in; ``BUCKETS[3]``. We do this by verifying that each subsequent hash value modulo; ``n_buckets`` is still 3. In the case of a failed lookup we would access the; memory for ``BUCKETS[3]``, and then compare a few consecutive 32 bit hashes; before we know that we have no match. We don't end up marching through; multiple words of memory and we really keep the number of processor data cache; lines being accessed as small as possible. The string hash that is used for these lookup tables is the Daniel J.; Bernstein hash which is also used in the ELF ``GNU_HASH`` sections. It is a; very good hash for all kinds of names in programs with very few hash; collisions. Empty buckets are designated by using an invalid hash index of ``UINT32_MAX``. Details; ^^^^^^^.

This can be done via; handling Promise results like:. ```javascript; let painter = await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; console.log('Object type in painter', painter.getClassName());; ```. One is also able to update the drawing with a new version of the object:. ```javascript; // after some interval request object again; redraw(""drawing"", obj2, ""colz"");; ```. The `redraw` function will call `draw` if the drawing was not performed before. In the case when changing of HTML layout leads to resize of element with JSROOT drawing,; one should call `resize()` to let JSROOT adjust drawing size. One should do:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"");; ```. As second argument one could specify exact size for draw elements like:. ```javascript; resize(""drawing"", { width: 500, height: 200 });; ```. To correctly cleanup JSROOT drawings from HTML element, one should call:. ```javascript; cleanup(""drawing"");; ```. ### File API. JSROOT defines the TFile class, which can be used to access binary ROOT files.; One should always remember that all I/O operations are asynchronous in JSROOT.; Therefore promises are used to retrieve results when the I/O operation is completed.; For example, reading an object from a file and displaying it will look like:. ```javascript; import { openFile, draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let filename = ""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"";; let file = await openFile(filename);; let obj = await file.readObject(""hpxpy;1"");; await draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; console.log('drawing completed');; ```.

Security,"er of the; call-site type. For a virtual call site, the type in question is the class; type; for an indirect function call it is the function signature. The; mapping from a type to an identifier is an ABI detail. In the current,; experimental, implementation the identifier of type T is calculated as; follows:. - Obtain the mangled name for ""typeinfo name for T"".; - Calculate MD5 hash of the name as a string.; - Reinterpret the first 8 bytes of the hash as a little-endian; 64-bit integer. It is possible, but unlikely, that collisions in the; ``CallSiteTypeId`` hashing will result in weaker CFI checks that would; still be conservatively correct. CFI_Check; ---------. In the general case, only the target DSO knows whether the call to; function ``f`` with type ``CallSiteTypeId`` is valid or not. To; export this information, every DSO implements. .. code-block:: none. void __cfi_check(uint64 CallSiteTypeId, void *TargetAddr, void *DiagData). This function provides external modules with access to CFI checks for; the targets inside this DSO. For each known ``CallSiteTypeId``, this; function performs an ``llvm.type.test`` with the corresponding type; identifier. It reports an error if the type is unknown, or if the; check fails. Depending on the values of compiler flags; ``-fsanitize-trap`` and ``-fsanitize-recover``, this function may; print an error, abort and/or return to the caller. ``DiagData`` is an; opaque pointer to the diagnostic information about the error, or; ``null`` if the caller does not provide this information. The basic implementation is a large switch statement over all values; of CallSiteTypeId supported by this DSO, and each case is similar to; the InlinedFastCheck() in the basic CFI mode. CFI Shadow; ----------. To route CFI checks to the target DSO's __cfi_check function, a; mapping from possible virtual / indirect call targets to the; corresponding __cfi_check functions is maintained.

Security,"er overflows on the unsafe stack cannot be used to overwrite anything; on the safe stack. SafeStack is a part of the `Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) Project; <https://dslab.epfl.ch/research/cpi/>`_. Performance; -----------. The performance overhead of the SafeStack instrumentation is less than 0.1% on; average across a variety of benchmarks (see the `Code-Pointer Integrity; <https://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/cpi.pdf>`__ paper for details). This is mainly; because most small functions do not have any variables that require the unsafe; stack and, hence, do not need unsafe stack frames to be created. The cost of; creating unsafe stack frames for large functions is amortized by the cost of; executing the function. In some cases, SafeStack actually improves the performance. Objects that end up; being moved to the unsafe stack are usually large arrays or variables that are; used through multiple stack frames. Moving such objects away from the safe; stack increases the locality of frequently accessed values on the stack, such; as register spills, return addresses, and small local variables. Compatibility; -------------. Most programs, static libraries, or individual files can be compiled; with SafeStack as is. SafeStack requires basic runtime support, which, on most; platforms, is implemented as a compiler-rt library that is automatically linked; in when the program is compiled with SafeStack. Linking a DSO with SafeStack is not currently supported. Known compatibility limitations; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Certain code that relies on low-level stack manipulations requires adaption to; work with SafeStack. One example is mark-and-sweep garbage collection; implementations for C/C++ (e.g., Oilpan in chromium/blink), which must be; changed to look for the live pointers on both safe and unsafe stacks.

Security,"error bars and fitted quadratic; function.\label{f11}][f11]-->. Quite often, the data volume to be analyzed is large - think of; fine-granular measurements accumulated with the aid of computers. A; usable tool therefore must contain easy-to-use and efficient methods for; storing and handling data. In Quantum mechanics, models typically only predict the probability; density function (""pdf"") of measurements depending on a number of; parameters, and the aim of the experimental analysis is to extract the; parameters from the observed distribution of frequencies at which; certain values of the measurement are observed. Measurements of this; kind require means to generate and visualize frequency distributions,; so-called histograms, and stringent statistical treatment to extract the; model parameters from purely statistical distributions. Simulation of expected data is another important aspect in data; analysis. By repeated generation of ""pseudo-data"", which are analysed in; the same manner as intended for the real data, analysis procedures can; be validated or compared. In many cases, the distribution of the; measurement errors is not precisely known, and simulation offers the; possibility to test the effects of different assumptions. A powerful software framework addressing all of the above requirements; is ROOT, an open source project coordinated by the European Organisation for; Nuclear Research, CERN in Geneva. ROOT is very flexible and provides both a programming interface to use in own; applications and a graphical user interface for interactive data analysis. The; purpose of this document is to serve as a beginners guide and provides extendable; examples for your own use cases, based on typical problems addressed in; student labs.

Since each; plot should contain a message, it is convenient to stress it with; additional graphics primitives. ### Text. Also text plays a fundamental role in making the plots self-explanatory.; A possibility to add text in your plot is provided by the `TLatex`; class. The objects of this class are constructed with the coordinates of; the bottom-left corner of the text and a string which contains the text; itself. The real twist is that ordinary; [Latex mathematical symbols](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTLatex.html#L5); are automatically interpreted, you just need to replace the ""\\"" by a ""\#"". If; [""\\"" is used as control character](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTLatex.html#L14); , then the; [TMathText interface](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTMathText.html); is invoked. It provides the plain TeX syntax and allow to access character's; set like Russian and Japanese. ## Interpretation and Compilation.

This; is sufficient for a wide range of applications, but you might have; already asked yourself ""how can this code be compiled ?"". There are two; answers. ### Compile a Macro with ACLiC.

A global address space address has the same value when used as a flat address; so no conversion is needed. **Global and Constant**; The global and constant address spaces both use global virtual addresses,; which are the same virtual address space used by the CPU. However, some; virtual addresses may only be accessible to the CPU, some only accessible; by the GPU, and some by both. Using the constant address space indicates that the data will not change; during the execution of the kernel. This allows scalar read instructions to; be used. As the constant address space could only be modified on the host; side, a generic pointer loaded from the constant address space is safe to be; assumed as a global pointer since only the device global memory is visible; and managed on the host side.

More high level information about XRay can be found in the `XRay whitepaper`_. This document describes how to use XRay as implemented in LLVM. XRay in LLVM; ============. XRay consists of three main parts:. - Compiler-inserted instrumentation points.; - A runtime library for enabling/disabling tracing at runtime.; - A suite of tools for analysing the traces. **NOTE:** As of July 25, 2018 , XRay is only available for the following; architectures running Linux: x86_64, arm7 (no thumb), aarch64, powerpc64le,; mips, mipsel, mips64, mips64el, NetBSD: x86_64, FreeBSD: x86_64 and; OpenBSD: x86_64. The compiler-inserted instrumentation points come in the form of nop-sleds in; the final generated binary, and an ELF section named ``xray_instr_map`` which; contains entries pointing to these instrumentation points. The runtime library; relies on being able to access the entries of the ``xray_instr_map``, and; overwrite the instrumentation points at runtime. Using XRay; ==========. You can use XRay in a couple of ways:. - Instrumenting your C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ application.; - Generating LLVM IR with the correct function attributes. The rest of this section covers these main ways and later on how to customize; what XRay does in an XRay-instrumented binary. Instrumenting your C/C++/Objective-C Application; ------------------------------------------------. The easiest way of getting XRay instrumentation for your application is by; enabling the ``-fxray-instrument`` flag in your clang invocation. For example:. ::. clang -fxray-instrument ... By default, functions that have at least 200 instructions (or contain a loop) will; get XRay instrumentation points. You can tweak that number through the; ``-fxray-instruction-threshold=`` flag:. ::. clang -fxray-instrument -fxray-instruction-threshold=1 ...

Be aware, that with *lighttpd* one should specify IP address of the host, where ROOT application is running. Address of the ROOT application will be following: `http://lighttpd_host_name/root.app/`. Example of authorization configuration for FastCGI connection:. auth.require = ( ""/root.app"" => (; ""method"" => ""digest"",; ""realm"" => ""root"",; ""require"" => ""valid-user""; ) ). ## Integration with existing applications. In many practical cases no change of existing code is required. Opened files (and all objects inside), existing canvas and histograms are automatically scanned by the server and will be available to the users. If necessary, any object can be registered directly to the server with a [THttpServer::Register()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html#a73658daf379e87a4832fe9dc5c1483ed) call. Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from a running application. By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessR",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md:13076,access,access,13076,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,1,['access'],['access']

Metadata on Loops; =================. Attributes can be attached to loops as described in :ref:`llvm.loop`.; Attributes can describe properties of the loop, disable transformations,; force specific transformations and set transformation options. Because metadata nodes are immutable (with the exception of; ``MDNode::replaceOperandWith`` which is dangerous to use on uniqued; metadata), in order to add or remove a loop attributes, a new ``MDNode``; must be created and assigned as the new ``llvm.loop`` metadata. Any; connection between the old ``MDNode`` and the loop is lost. The; ``llvm.loop`` node is also used as LoopID (``Loop::getLoopID()``), i.e.; the loop effectively gets a new identifier. For instance,; ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access`` references the LoopID. Therefore, if; the parallel access property is to be preserved after adding/removing; loop attributes, any ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access`` reference must be; updated to the new LoopID. Transformation Metadata Structure; =================================. Some attributes describe code transformations (unrolling, vectorizing,; loop distribution, etc.). They can either be a hint to the optimizer; that a transformation might be beneficial, instruction to use a specific; option, , or convey a specific request from the user (such as; ``#pragma clang loop`` or ``#pragma omp simd``). If a transformation is forced but cannot be carried-out for any reason,; an optimization-missed warning must be emitted.

As the second step, we should merge equal functions. So it should be a ""merger""; method. ""Merger"" accepts two functions *F1* and *F2*, and produces *F1F2*; function, the result of merging. Having such routines in our hands, we can process a whole module, and merge all; equal functions. In this case, we have to compare every function with every another function.

Of course we could; introduce hashing and other helpers, but it is still just an optimization, and; thus the level of O(N*N) complexity. Can we reach another level?

Security,"es to the Policy; =====================. The LLVM Security Policy may be changed by majority vote of the LLVM Security Group. Such changes also need to be approved by the LLVM Board. What is considered a security issue?; ====================================. The LLVM Project has a significant amount of code, and not all of it is; considered security-sensitive. This is particularly true because LLVM is used in; a wide variety of circumstances: there are different threat models, untrusted; inputs differ, and the environment LLVM runs in is varied. Therefore, what the; LLVM Project considers a security issue is what its members have signed up to; maintain securely. As this security process matures, members of the LLVM community can propose that; a part of the codebase be designated as security-sensitive (or no longer; security-sensitive). This requires a rationale, and buy-in from the LLVM; community as for any RFC. In some cases, parts of the codebase could be handled; as security-sensitive but need significant work to get to the stage where that's; manageable. The LLVM community will need to decide whether it wants to invest in; making these parts of the code securable, and maintain these security; properties over time. In all cases the LLVM Security Group should be consulted,; since they'll be responding to security issues filed against these parts of the; codebase. If you're not sure whether an issue is in-scope for this security process or; not, err towards assuming that it is. The Security Group might agree or disagree; and will explain its rationale in the report, as well as update this document; through the above process. The security-sensitive parts of the LLVM Project currently are the following.; Note that this list can change over time. * None are currently defined. Please don't let this stop you from reporting; issues to the security group that you believe are security-sensitive.

Security,"es to update the headers in the heap; memory, and avoid any type of double-fetching. Randomness; ----------; Randomness is a critical factor to the additional security provided by the; allocator. The allocator trusts the memory mapping primitives of the OS to; provide pages at (mostly) non-predictable locations in memory, as well as the; binaries to be compiled with ASLR. In the event one of those assumptions is; incorrect, the security will be greatly reduced. Scudo further randomizes how; blocks are allocated in the Primary, can randomize how caches are assigned to; threads. Memory reclaiming; -----------------; Primary and Secondary allocators have different behaviors with regard to; reclaiming. While Secondary mapped allocations can be unmapped on deallocation,; it isn't the case for the Primary, which could lead to a steady growth of the; RSS of a process. To counteract this, if the underlying OS allows it, pages; that are covered by contiguous free memory blocks in the Primary can be; released: this generally means they won't count towards the RSS of a process and; be zero filled on subsequent accesses). This is done in the deallocation path,; and several options exist to tune this behavior. Usage; =====. Platform; --------; If using Fuchsia or an Android version greater than 11, your memory allocations; are already service by Scudo (note that Android Svelte configurations still use; jemalloc). Library; -------; The allocator static library can be built from the LLVM tree thanks to the; ``scudo_standalone`` CMake rule. The associated tests can be exercised thanks to; the ``check-scudo_standalone`` CMake rule. Linking the static library to your project can require the use of the; ``whole-archive`` linker flag (or equivalent), depending on your linker.; Additional flags might also be necessary. Your linked binary should now make use of the Scudo allocation and deallocation; functions. You may also build Scudo like this:. .. code:: console. cd $LLVM/compiler-rt/l",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.rst:5422,access,accesses,5422,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.rst,1,['access'],['accesses']

See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host memory accessed as; MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2 cache. This also; causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not invalidated by; ``*_vol``.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory it is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent); and so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the private address space is; only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is; never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1 cache. Hence all cache; invalidates are done as ``*_vol`` to only invalidate the volatile cache lines.

This allows a single name to have; multiple matching DIEs in a single file, which could come up with an inlined; function for instance. Future tables could include more information about the; DIE such as flags indicating if the DIE is a function, method, block,; or inlined.

When a new issue is filed, a template is provided to help issue reporters provide all relevant information. *FUTURE*: The `Github security`_ workflow allows publicly disclosing resolved security issues on the github project page, and we would be interested in adopting it for that purpose. However, it does not easily allow confidential reporting of security issues, as creating Github Security Advisories is currently restricted to Github project admins. That is why we have started with the `chromium issue tracker`_ instead.

If a ``MemoryAccess`` is a *clobber* of another, it means that these two; ``MemoryAccess``\ es may access the same memory. For example, ``x = MemoryDef(y)``; means that ``x`` potentially modifies memory that ``y`` modifies/constrains; (or has modified / constrained).; In the same manner, ``a = MemoryPhi({BB1,b},{BB2,c})`` means that; anyone that uses ``a`` is accessing memory potentially modified / constrained; by either ``b`` or ``c`` (or both). And finally, ``MemoryUse(x)`` means; that this use accesses memory that ``x`` has modified / constrained; (as an example, think that if ``x = MemoryDef(...)``; and ``MemoryUse(x)`` are in the same loop, the use can't; be hoisted outside alone). Another useful way of looking at it is in terms of memory versions.; In that view, operands of a given ``MemoryAccess`` are the version; of the entire memory before the operation, and if the access produces; a value (i.e. ``MemoryDef/MemoryPhi``),; the value is the new version of the memory after the operation. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() {; entry:; %p1 = alloca i8; %p2 = alloca i8; %p3 = alloca i8; ; 1 = MemoryDef(liveOnEntry); store i8 0, ptr %p3; br label %while.cond. while.cond:; ; 6 = MemoryPhi({entry,1},{if.end,4}); br i1 undef, label %if.then, label %if.else. if.then:; ; 2 = MemoryDef(6); store i8 0, ptr %p1; br label %if.end. if.else:; ; 3 = MemoryDef(6); store i8 1, ptr %p2; br label %if.end. if.end:; ; 5 = MemoryPhi({if.then,2},{if.else,3}); ; MemoryUse(5); %1 = load i8, ptr %p1; ; 4 = MemoryDef(5); store i8 2, ptr %p2; ; MemoryUse(1); %2 = load i8, ptr %p3; br label %while.cond; }.

It contains the various pieces of state that are required to coherently; read tokens out of a translation unit. The core interface to the ``Preprocessor`` object (once it is set up) is the; ``Preprocessor::Lex`` method, which returns the next :ref:`Token <Token>` from; the preprocessor stream. There are two types of token providers that the; preprocessor is capable of reading from: a buffer lexer (provided by the; :ref:`Lexer <Lexer>` class) and a buffered token stream (provided by the; :ref:`TokenLexer <TokenLexer>` class). .. _Token:. The Token class; ---------------. The ``Token`` class is used to represent a single lexed token. Tokens are; intended to be used by the lexer/preprocess and parser libraries, but are not; intended to live beyond them (for example, they should not live in the ASTs). Tokens most often live on the stack (or some other location that is efficient; to access) as the parser is running, but occasionally do get buffered up. For; example, macro definitions are stored as a series of tokens, and the C++; front-end periodically needs to buffer tokens up for tentative parsing and; various pieces of look-ahead. As such, the size of a ``Token`` matters. On a; 32-bit system, ``sizeof(Token)`` is currently 16 bytes. Tokens occur in two forms: :ref:`annotation tokens <AnnotationToken>` and; normal tokens. Normal tokens are those returned by the lexer, annotation; tokens represent semantic information and are produced by the parser, replacing; normal tokens in the token stream. Normal tokens contain the following; information:. * **A SourceLocation** --- This indicates the location of the start of the; token. * **A length** --- This stores the length of the token as stored in the; ``SourceBuffer``. For tokens that include them, this length includes; trigraphs and escaped newlines which are ignored by later phases of the; compiler.

Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```.

Locating clobbers yourself; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you choose to make your own walker, you can find the clobber for a; ``MemoryAccess`` by walking every ``MemoryDef`` that dominates said; ``MemoryAccess``. The structure of ``MemoryDef``\ s makes this relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize. In other words, the; ``definingAccess`` of a ``MemoryDef`` is always the nearest dominating; ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` of said ``MemoryDef``. Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``.

Name Hash Tables; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". To solve the issues mentioned above we have structured the hash tables a bit; differently: a header, buckets, an array of all unique 32 bit hash values,; followed by an array of hash value data offsets, one for each hash value, then; the data for all hash values:. .. code-block:: none. .-------------.; | HEADER |; |-------------|; | BUCKETS |; |-------------|; | HASHES |; |-------------|; | OFFSETS |; |-------------|; | DATA |; `-------------'.

If we repeat the same ""``printf``"" lookup from above, we; would hash ""``printf``"" and find it matches ``BUCKETS[3]`` by taking the 32 bit; hash value and modulo it by ``n_buckets``. ``BUCKETS[3]`` contains ""6"" which; is the index into the ``HASHES`` table. We would then compare any consecutive; 32 bit hashes values in the ``HASHES`` array as long as the hashes would be in; ``BUCKETS[3]``. We do this by verifying that each subsequent hash value modulo; ``n_buckets`` is still 3. In the case of a failed lookup we would access the; memory for ``BUCKETS[3]``, and then compare a few consecutive 32 bit hashes; before we know that we have no match. We don't end up marching through; multiple words of memory and we really keep the number of processor data cache; lines being accessed as small as possible.

Security,"etrical and physical; constraints. We will hereby describe the user interface of **`TGeo`** to access; tracking functionality. This allows either developing a tracker for; simple navigation within a given geometry, either interfacing to an; external tracking engine such as GEANT. Note that the abstract interface; for external trackers can be found in `$ROOTSYS/vmc` folder and it can; be used to run GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA-based simulations (\*) by using; directly a geometry described with ROOT. The interface methods related to tracking are incorporated into; **`TGeoManager`** class and implemented in the navigator class; **`TGeoNavigator`**. In order to be able to start tracking, one has to; define the initial state providing the starting point $\vec{r_0}$; and direction $\vec{n_0}$ .; There are several ways of doing that. ### TGeoNavigator Class. One geometry may have several independent navigators to query to; localize points or compute distances. The geometry manager holds a list; of active navigators accessible via:. ``` {.cpp}; TObjArray *navigators = gGeoManager->GetListOfNavigators();; ```. Upon closing the geometry a default navigator is provided as first one; in this list, but one may add its own via:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoNavigator *navig = new TGeoNavigator(gGeoManager);; // Store the index of the user navigator; Int_t inav = gGeoManager->AddNavigator(navig);; // Make its own navigator the active one; gGeoManager->SetCurrentNavigator(inav);; // Switch between navigators; gGeoManager->SetCurrentNavigator(0);; ```. A navigator holds several variables describing the current navigation; state: current point position, current direction distance to next; boundary, isotropic safety, pointer to current and next nods as well as; several tracking flags related to volume boundary conditions or other; properties required for track propagation in geometry.

Security,"ets are properly folded due to call; instructions, and can provide a list of pointers in each set. As an example user of this, the `Loop Invariant Code Motion; <doxygen/structLICM.html>`_ pass uses ``AliasSetTracker``\s to calculate alias; sets for each loop nest. If an ``AliasSet`` in a loop is not modified, then all; load instructions from that set may be hoisted out of the loop. If any alias; sets are stored to **and** are must alias sets, then the stores may be sunk; to outside of the loop, promoting the memory location to a register for the; duration of the loop nest. Both of these transformations only apply if the; pointer argument is loop-invariant. The AliasSetTracker implementation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The AliasSetTracker class is implemented to be as efficient as possible. It; uses the union-find algorithm to efficiently merge AliasSets when a pointer is; inserted into the AliasSetTracker that aliases multiple sets. The primary data; structure is a hash table mapping pointers to the AliasSet they are in. The AliasSetTracker class must maintain a list of all of the LLVM ``Value*``\s; that are in each AliasSet. Since the hash table already has entries for each; LLVM ``Value*`` of interest, the AliasesSets thread the linked list through; these hash-table nodes to avoid having to allocate memory unnecessarily, and to; make merging alias sets extremely efficient (the linked list merge is constant; time). You shouldn't need to understand these details if you are just a client of the; AliasSetTracker, but if you look at the code, hopefully this brief description; will help make sense of why things are designed the way they are. Using the ``AliasAnalysis`` interface directly; ----------------------------------------------.

ROOT executables will get the config automatically, using a static version of the config library, `libROOTStaticSanitizerConfig.a`.; All ROOT executables statically link against it, so they start up without reporting lots of unfixable memory leaks (e.g. llvm). #### Small linker magic to get the config symbols into ROOT's executables; When linking a ROOT executable, the setup functions from the sanitiser config library might get ignored, because they are not used in any of our executables.; In `cmake/modules/SetUp{Linux|MacOS}.cmake`, the functions are therefore marked as ""undefined"" for the linker, so it starts copying; them into all ROOT executables.; This way, root.exe, cling, ... can start up with a sane default config. ### Use your own address/leak sanitizer configuration; The default configurations can be overridden using the environment variables `ASAN_OPTIONS` and `LSAN_OPTIONS`.

It should be sufficient to; - Link all executables against this target; - And have `-fsanitize=address` in the `CXXFLAGS`. ## Use sanitised ROOT libraries from a non-sanitised executable (e.g. `python`); When ROOT libraries are built with sanitizers, the address sanitizer runtime needs to be l",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/core/sanitizer/README.md:1674,sanitiz,sanitizer,1674,core/sanitizer/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/core/sanitizer/README.md,1,['sanitiz'],['sanitizer']

The most interesting part of this is that we ignore top-level; semicolons. Why is this, you ask? The basic reason is that if you type; ""4 + 5"" at the command line, the parser doesn't know whether that is the; end of what you will type or not. For example, on the next line you; could type ""def foo..."" in which case 4+5 is the end of a top-level; expression. Alternatively you could type ""\* 6"", which would continue; the expression. Having top-level semicolons allows you to type ""4+5;"",; and the parser will know you are done. Conclusions; ===========. With just under 400 lines of commented code (240 lines of non-comment,; non-blank code), we fully defined our minimal language, including a; lexer, parser, and AST builder. With this done, the executable will; validate Kaleidoscope code and tell us if it is grammatically invalid.; For example, here is a sample interaction:. .. code-block:: bash. $ ./a.out; ready> def foo(x y) x+foo(y, 4.0);; Parsed a function definition.; ready> def foo(x y) x+y y;; Parsed a function definition.; Parsed a top-level expr; ready> def foo(x y) x+y );; Parsed a function definition.; Error: unknown token when expecting an expression; ready> extern sin(a);; ready> Parsed an extern; ready> ^D; $.

The class names; the destructor but with a prefix \~ which is the C++ one's complement; i.e. bit wise complement, and hence has destruction overtones! We; declare it in the .h file and define it in the `.cxx` file. It does; not do much except print out that it has been called (still a useful; debug technique despite today's powerful debuggers!). Now run root, load the Quad class and create a heap object:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L Quad.cxx; root[] Quad *my_objptr = new Quad(1.,2.,-3.);; ```. To delete the object:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] delete my_objptr;; root[] my_objptr = 0;; ```. You should see the print out from its destructor. Setting the pointer; to zero afterwards is not strictly necessary (and Cling does it; automatically), but the object is no more accessible, and any attempt; to use the pointer again will, as has already been stated, cause; grief. So much for heap objects, but how are stack objects deleted? In; C++, a stack object is deleted as soon as control leaves the innermost; compound statement that encloses it. Therefore, it is singularly; futile to do something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] { Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.); }; ```. Cling does not follow this rule; if you type in the above line, you; will not see the destructor message. As explained in the Script; lesson, you can load in compound statements, which would be a bit; pointless if everything disappeared as soon as it was loaded!

Security,"f the approaches (random-access and logarithmical) have been implemented; and tested and both give a very good improvement. What was most; surprising is that logarithmical search was faster; sometimes by up to 15%. The; hashing method needs some extra CPU time, which is the main reason why it works; slower; in most cases, total ""hashing"" time is greater than total; ""logarithmical-search"" time. So, preference has been granted to the ""logarithmical search"". Though in the case of need, *logarithmical-search* (read ""total-ordering"") could; be used as a milestone on our way to the *random-access* implementation. Every comparison is based either on the numbers or on the flags comparison. In; the *random-access* approach, we could use the same comparison algorithm.; During comparison, we exit once we find the difference, but here we might have; to scan the whole function body every time (note, it could be slower). Like in; ""total-ordering"", we will track every number and flag, but instead of; comparison, we should get the numbers sequence and then create the hash number.; So, once again, *total-ordering* could be considered as a milestone for even; faster (in theory) random-access approach.

By writing it in the second form consistently, you; eliminate the issue entirely and don't even have to think about it. The second (even bigger) issue is that writing the loop in the first form hints; to the reader that the loop is mutating the container (a fact that a comment; would handily confirm!). If you write the loop in the second form, it is; immediately obvious without even looking at the body of the loop that the; container isn't being modified, which makes it easier to read the code and; understand what it does.

The [TUnfold package](https://www.desy.de/~sschmitt/tunfold.html) inside ROOT is upgraded from version 17.6 to version 17.9. ## Math Libraries. ### Usage of `std::span<const double>` in Minuit 2 interfaces. To avoid forcing the user to do manual memory allocations via `std::vector`, the interfaces of Minuit 2 function adapter classes like `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNBase` or `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNGradientBase` were changed to accept `std::span<const double>` arguments instead of `std::vector<double> const&`.; This should have minimal impact on users, since one should usual use Minuit 2 via the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface, which is unchanged. ## RooFit Libraries. ### Miscellaneous. * Setting `useHashMapForFind(true)` is not supported for RooArgLists anymore, since hash-assisted finding by name hash can be ambiguous: a RooArgList is allowed to have different elements with the same name. If you want to do fast lookups by name, convert your RooArgList to a RooArgSet. * The function `RooFit::bindFunction()` now supports arbitrary many input variables when binding a Python function. * The `ExportOnly()` attribute of the `RooStats::HistFactory::Measurement` object is now switched on by default, and the associated getter and setter functions are deprecated. They will be removed in ROOT 6.36. If you want to fit the model as well instead of just exporting it to a RooWorkspace, please do so with your own code as demonstrated in the `hf001` tutorial. ### Deprecations. * The `RooStats::MarkovChain::GetAsDataSet` and `RooStats::MarkovChain::GetAsDataHist` functions are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36.

Security,"f7893912e06 in main umr2.cc:4. By default, MemorySanitizer collects both allocation points and all; intermediate stores the uninitialized value went through. Origin; tracking has proved to be very useful for debugging MemorySanitizer; reports. It slows down program execution by a factor of 1.5x-2x on top; of the usual MemorySanitizer slowdown and increases memory overhead. Clang option ``-fsanitize-memory-track-origins=1`` enables a slightly; faster mode when MemorySanitizer collects only allocation points but; not intermediate stores. Use-after-destruction detection; ===============================. MemorySanitizer includes use-after-destruction detection. After invocation of; the destructor, the object will be considered no longer readable, and using; underlying memory will lead to error reports in runtime. Refer to the standard; for `lifetime <https://eel.is/c++draft/basic.life#1>`_ definition. This feature can be disabled with either:. #. Pass addition Clang option ``-fno-sanitize-memory-use-after-dtor`` during; compilation.; #. Set environment variable `MSAN_OPTIONS=poison_in_dtor=0` before running; the program. Handling external code; ======================. MemorySanitizer requires that all program code is instrumented. This; also includes any libraries that the program depends on, even libc.; Failing to achieve this may result in false reports.; For the same reason you may need to replace all inline assembly code that writes to memory; with a pure C/C++ code. Full MemorySanitizer instrumentation is very difficult to achieve. To; make it easier, MemorySanitizer runtime library includes 70+; interceptors for the most common libc functions. They make it possible; to run MemorySanitizer-instrumented programs linked with; uninstrumented libc. For example, the authors were able to bootstrap; MemorySanitizer-instrumented Clang compiler by linking it with; self-built instrumented libc++ (as a replacement for libstdc++).

By default, a **`TObject`** is not; sort able. - `Hash() `returns a hash value. It needs to be implemented if an; object has to be stored in a collection using a hashing technique,; like **`THashTable`**, **`THashList`** and **`TMap`**. By default,; `Hash(`) returns the address of the object. It is essential to; choose a good hash function. The example below shows how to use and override these member functions. ``` {.cpp}; class TObjNum : public TObject {; private:; Int_t num; // TObjNum is a simple container for an integer.; public:; TObjNum(Int_t i = 0) : num(i) { }; ~TObjNum() { }; void SetNum(Int_t i) { num = i; }; Int_t GetNum() const { return num; }; void Print(Option_t *) const; { printf(""num = %dn"", num); }; Bool_t IsEqual(TObject *obj) const; { return num == ((TObjNum*)obj)->num; }; Bool_t IsSortable() const { return kTRUE; }; Int_t Compare(const TObject *obj) const; { if (num < ((TObjNum*)obj)->num) return -1;; else if (num > ((TObjNum*)obj)->num) return 1;; else return 0; }; ULong_t Hash() const { return num; }; };; ```. ## The TIter Generic Iterator. As stated above, the **`TIterator`** class is abstract; it is not; possible to create **`TIterator`** objects.

In particular, this means that mutexes and other; capabilities must be declared before they can be used in an attribute.; Use-before-declaration is okay within a single class, because attributes are; parsed at the same time as method bodies. (C++ delays parsing of method bodies; until the end of the class.) However, use-before-declaration is not allowed; between classes, as illustrated below. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo;. class Bar {; void bar(Foo* f) REQUIRES(f->mu); // Error: mu undeclared.; };. class Foo {; Mutex mu;; };. Private Mutexes; ---------------. Good software engineering practice dictates that mutexes should be private; members, because the locking mechanism used by a thread-safe class is part of; its internal implementation. However, private mutexes can sometimes leak into; the public interface of a class.; Thread safety attributes follow normal C++ access restrictions, so if ``mu``; is a private member of ``c``, then it is an error to write ``c.mu`` in an; attribute. One workaround is to (ab)use the ``RETURN_CAPABILITY`` attribute to provide a; public *name* for a private mutex, without actually exposing the underlying; mutex. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. class MyClass {; private:; Mutex mu;. public:; // For thread safety analysis only. Does not need to be defined.; Mutex* getMu() RETURN_CAPABILITY(mu);. void doSomething() REQUIRES(mu);; };. void doSomethingTwice(MyClass& c) REQUIRES(c.getMu()) {; // The analysis thinks that c.getMu() == c.mu; c.doSomething();; c.doSomething();; }. In the above example, ``doSomethingTwice()`` is an external routine that; requires ``c.mu`` to be locked, which cannot be declared directly because ``mu``; is private. This pattern is discouraged because it; violates encapsulation, but it is sometimes necessary, especially when adding; annotations to an existing code base. The workaround is to define ``getMu()``; as a fake",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst:20216,access,access,20216,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.rst,1,['access'],['access']

If necessary, one can add custom path as well, using [THttpServer::AddLocation](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html#a5322c3bbfddb8eb6849297d83ccaf87f) method:. ```cpp; serv->AddLocation(""mydir/"", ""/home/user/specials"");; ```. Then files from that directory could be addressed via URL like ""http://localhost:8080/mydir/myfile.root"". ## Command interface. THttpServer class provide simple interface to invoke command from web browser.; One just register command like:. ```cpp; serv->RegisterCommand(""/DoSomething"", ""SomeFunction()"");; ```.

Every lock must have a corresponding unlock, and the analysis; will detect both double locks, and double unlocks. A function is allowed to; acquire a lock without releasing it, (or vice versa), but it must be annotated; as such (using ``ACQUIRE``/``RELEASE``). Running The Analysis; --------------------. To run the analysis, simply compile with the ``-Wthread-safety`` flag, e.g. .. code-block:: bash. clang -c -Wthread-safety example.cpp. Note that this example assumes the presence of a suitably annotated; :ref:`mutexheader` that declares which methods perform locking,; unlocking, and so on. Basic Concepts: Capabilities; ============================. Thread safety analysis provides a way of protecting *resources* with; *capabilities*. A resource is either a data member, or a function/method; that provides access to some underlying resource. The analysis ensures that; the calling thread cannot access the *resource* (i.e. call the function, or; read/write the data) unless it has the *capability* to do so. Capabilities are associated with named C++ objects which declare specific; methods to acquire and release the capability. The name of the object serves; to identify the capability. The most common example is a mutex. For example,; if ``mu`` is a mutex, then calling ``mu.Lock()`` causes the calling thread; to acquire the capability to access data that is protected by ``mu``. Similarly,; calling ``mu.Unlock()`` releases that capability. A thread may hold a capability either *exclusively* or *shared*. An exclusive; capability can be held by only one thread at a time, while a shared capability; can be held by many threads at the same time. This mechanism enforces a; multiple-reader, single-writer pattern. Write operations to protected data; require exclusive access, while read operations require only shared access.

Sections make it easy to iterate over the symbols or blocks associated with; a particular section in the source object file. * ``blocks()`` returns an iterator over the set of blocks defined in the; section (as ``Block*`` pointers). * ``symbols()`` returns an iterator over the set of symbols defined in the; section (as ``Symbol*`` pointers). * ``Name`` is represented as an ``llvm::StringRef``, and is accessible via the; ``getName`` method. * ``ProtectionFlags`` are represented as a sys::Memory::ProtectionFlags enum,; and accessible via the ``getProtectionFlags`` method. These flags describe; whether the section is readable, writable, executable, or some combination; of these. The most common combinations are ``RW-`` for writable data,; ``R--`` for constant data, and ``R-X`` for code. * ``SectionOrdinal``, accessible via ``getOrdinal``, is a number used to order; the section relative to others. It is usually used to preserve section; order within a segment (a set of sections with the same memory protections); when laying out memory.

On the other hand, the ``-fgpu-rdc`` mode allows the definition and use of function pointers across different TUs, as resource usage calculations can accommodate functions from disparate TUs. Virtual Function Support; ========================. In Clang with HIP, support for calling virtual functions of an object in device or host code is contingent on where the object is constructed. - **Constructed in Device Code**: Virtual functions of an object can be called in device code on a specific offloading device if the object is constructed in device code on an offloading device with the same architecture.; - **Constructed in Host Code**: Virtual functions of an object can be called in host code if the object is constructed in host code. In other scenarios, calling virtual functions is not allowed. Explanation; -----------. An object constructed on the device side contains a pointer to the virtual function table on the device side, which is not accessible in host code, and vice versa. Thus, trying to invoke virtual functions from a context different from where the object was constructed will be disallowed because the appropriate virtual table cannot be accessed. The virtual function tables for offloading devices with different architecures are different, therefore trying to invoke virtual functions from an offloading device with a different architecture than where the object is constructed is also disallowed. Example Usage; -------------. .. code-block:: c++. class Base {; public:; __device__ virtual void virtualFunction() {; // Base virtual function implementation; }; };. class Derived : public Base {; public:; __device__ void virtualFunction() override {; // Derived virtual function implementation; }; };. __global__ void kernel() {; Derived obj;; Base* basePtr = &obj;; basePtr->virtualFunction(); // Allowed since obj is constructed in device code; }; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HIPSupport.rst:9951,access,accessible,9951,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HIPSupport.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HIPSupport.rst,2,['access'],"['accessed', 'accessible']"

But the YAML I/O model uses; static typing, so there are limits to how you can use tags with the YAML I/O; model. Recently, we added support to YAML I/O for checking/setting the optional; tag on a map. Using this functionality it is even possible to support different; mappings, as long as they are convertible. To check a tag, inside your mapping() method you can use io.mapTag() to specify; what the tag should be. This will also add that tag when writing yaml. Validation; ----------. Sometimes in a YAML map, each key/value pair is valid, but the combination is; not. This is similar to something having no syntax errors, but still having; semantic errors. To support semantic level checking, YAML I/O allows; an optional ``validate()`` method in a MappingTraits template specialization. When parsing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is call *after* all key/values in; the map have been processed. Any error message returned by the ``validate()``; method during input will be printed just a like a syntax error would be printed.; When writing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is called *before* the YAML; key/values are written. Any error during output will trigger an ``assert()``; because it is a programming error to have invalid struct values. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llvm::yaml::IO;. struct Stuff {; ...; };. template <>; struct MappingTraits<Stuff> {; static void mapping(IO &io, Stuff &stuff) {; ...; }; static std::string validate(IO &io, Stuff &stuff) {; // Look at all fields in 'stuff' and if there; // are any bad values return a string describing; // the error.

With this mapping established code added to the JIT can refer to printf; symbolically rather than requiring the address of printf to be ""baked in"".; This in turn allows cached versions of the JIT'd code (e.g. compiled objects); to be re-used across JIT sessions as the JIT'd code no longer changes, only the; absolute symbol definition does.

However the absoluteSymbols function is still useful; for making non-global objects in your JIT visible to JIT'd code. For example,; imagine that your JIT standard library needs access to your JIT object to make; some calls.

The KeyType for the DWARF table is a 32 bit string table offset into the; "".debug_str"" table. The "".debug_str"" is the string table for the DWARF which; may already contain copies of all of the strings. This helps make sure, with; help from the compiler, that we reuse the strings between all of the DWARF; sections and keeps the hash table size down. Another benefit to having the; compiler generate all strings as DW_FORM_strp in the debug info, is that; DWARF parsing can be made much faster. After a lookup is made, we get an offset into the hash data. The hash data; needs to be able to deal with 32 bit hash collisions, so the chunk of data; at the offset in the hash data consists of a triple:. .. code-block:: c. uint32_t str_offset; uint32_t hash_data_count; HashData[hash_data_count].

Typedef Preservation and Selective Unwrapping; Many programmers use high-level user defined types, typedefs, and other; syntactic sugar to refer to types in their program. This is useful because they; can abbreviate otherwise very long types and it is useful to preserve the; typename in diagnostics. However, sometimes very simple typedefs can wrap; trivial types and it is important to strip off the typedef to understand what; is going on. Clang aims to handle both cases well.; The following example shows where it is important to preserve; a typedef in C. $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:15:11: error: can't convert between vector values of different size ('__m128' and 'int const *'); myvec[1]/P;; ~~~~~~~~^~. The following example shows where it is useful for the compiler to expose; underlying details of a typedef. If the user was somehow confused about how the; system ""pid_t"" typedef is defined, Clang helpfully displays it with ""aka"". $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:13:9: error: member reference base type 'pid_t' (aka 'int') is not a structure or union; myvar = myvar.x;; ~~~~~ ^.

It; represents a typed value that may be used (among other things) as an operand to; an instruction. There are many different types of ``Value``\ s, such as; Constant_\ s, Argument_\ s. Even Instruction_\ s and :ref:`Function; <c_Function>`\ s are ``Value``\ s. A particular ``Value`` may be used many times in the LLVM representation for a; program. For example, an incoming argument to a function (represented with an; instance of the Argument_ class) is ""used"" by every instruction in the function; that references the argument. To keep track of this relationship, the ``Value``; class keeps a list of all of the ``User``\ s that is using it (the User_ class; is a base class for all nodes in the LLVM graph that can refer to ``Value``\ s).; This use list is how LLVM represents def-use information in the program, and is; accessible through the ``use_*`` methods, shown below. Because LLVM is a typed representation, every LLVM ``Value`` is typed, and this; Type_ is available through the ``getType()`` method. In addition, all LLVM; values can be named. The ""name"" of the ``Value`` is a symbolic string printed; in the LLVM code:. .. code-block:: llvm. %foo = add i32 1, 2. .. _nameWarning:. The name of this instruction is ""foo"". **NOTE** that the name of any value may; be missing (an empty string), so names should **ONLY** be used for debugging; (making the source code easier to read, debugging printouts), they should not be; used to keep track of values or map between them. For this purpose, use a; ``std::map`` of pointers to the ``Value`` itself instead. One important aspect of LLVM is that there is no distinction between an SSA; variable and the operation that produces it.

What was most; surprising is that logarithmical search was faster; sometimes by up to 15%. The; hashing method needs some extra CPU time, which is the main reason why it works; slower; in most cases, total ""hashing"" time is greater than total; ""logarithmical-search"" time. So, preference has been granted to the ""logarithmical search"". Though in the case of need, *logarithmical-search* (read ""total-ordering"") could; be used as a milestone on our way to the *random-access* implementation. Every comparison is based either on the numbers or on the flags comparison. In; the *random-access* approach, we could use the same comparison algorithm.; During comparison, we exit once we find the difference, but here we might have; to scan the whole function body every time (note, it could be slower). Like in; ""total-ordering"", we will track every number and flag, but instead of; comparison, we should get the numbers sequence and then create the hash number.; So, once again, *total-ordering* could be considered as a milestone for even; faster (in theory) random-access approach.

For example, a function pass receives an analysis; manager that only provides function-level analyses. This works for many; passes which work on a fixed scope. However, some passes want to peek up or; down the IR hierarchy. For example, an SCC pass may want to look at function; analyses for the functions inside the SCC. Or it may want to look at some; immutable global analysis. In these cases, the analysis manager can provide a; proxy to an outer or inner level analysis manager. For example, to get a; ``FunctionAnalysisManager`` from a ``CGSCCAnalysisManager``, you can call. .. code-block:: c++. FunctionAnalysisManager &FAM =; AM.getResult<FunctionAnalysisManagerCGSCCProxy>(InitialC, CG); .getManager();. and use ``FAM`` as a typical ``FunctionAnalysisManager`` that a function pass; would have access to.

Asking for a cached and immutable outer level IR analysis works via; ``getCachedResult()``, but getting direct access to an outer level IR analysis; manager to compute an outer level IR analysis is not allowed. This is for a; couple reasons. The first reason is that running analyses across outer level IR in inner level; IR passes can result in quadratic compile time behavior. For example, a module; analysis often scans every function and allowing function passes to run a module; analysis may cause us to scan functions a quadratic number of times. If passes; could keep outer level analyses up to date rather than computing them on demand; this wouldn't be an issue, but that would be a lot of work to ensure every pass; updates all outer level analyses, and so far this hasn't been necessa",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:8416,access,access,8416,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,1,['access'],['access']

With LTO, we know that all code which can see the declaration of ``B`` is; visible to us. However, a pointer to a ``B`` could be cast to ``A*`` and passed; to another linkage unit, which could then call ``f`` on it. This call would; load from the vtable for ``B`` (using the object pointer), and then call; ``B::f``. This means we can't remove the function pointer from ``B``'s vtable,; or the implementation of ``B::f``. However, if we can see all code which knows; about any dynamic base class (which would be the case if ``B`` only inherited; from classes with hidden visibility), then this optimisation would be valid.

This matches how CLANG and LLVM have added support for; CUDA-like languages on top of existing C++ language support.

An alternative approach is to define ``DW_MSPACE_LLVM_none`` as being the; global memory space and then change ``DW_MSPACE_LLVM_global`` to; ``DW_MSPACE_LLVM_generic``. This would match the reality that languages that; do not support multiple memory spaces only have one default global memory; space. Generally, in these languages if they expose that the target; architecture supports multiple memory spaces, the default one is still the; global memory space. Then a language that does support multiple memory spaces; has to explicitly indicate which pointers have the added ability to reference; more than the global memory space.

The next section explains how subscripting expressions map to accessor; methods. Subscripting Methods; --------------------. Objective-C supports two kinds of subscript expressions: *array-style*; subscript expressions use integer typed subscripts; *dictionary-style*; subscript expressions use Objective-C object pointer typed subscripts.; Each type of subscript expression is mapped to a message send using a; predefined selector. The advantage of this design is flexibility: class; designers are free to introduce subscripting by declaring methods or by; adopting protocols. Moreover, because the method names are selected by; the type of the subscript, an object can be subscripted using both array; and dictionary styles. Array-Style Subscripting; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

A name like; ``SmallVectorHeader`` might be more appropriate. .. _dss_pagedvector:. llvm/ADT/PagedVector.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``PagedVector<Type, PageSize>`` is a random access container that allocates; ``PageSize`` elements of type ``Type`` when the first element of a page is; accessed via the ``operator[]``. This is useful for cases where the number of; elements is known in advance; their actual initialization is expensive; and; they are sparsely used. This utility uses page-granular lazy initialization; when the element is accessed. When the number of used pages is small; significant memory savings can be achieved. The main advantage is that a ``PagedVector`` allows to delay the actual; allocation of the page until it's needed, at the extra cost of one pointer per; page and one extra indirection when accessing elements with their positional; index. In order to minimise the memory footprint of this container, it's important to; balance the PageSize so that it's not too small (otherwise the overhead of the; pointer per page might become too high) and not too big (otherwise the memory; is wasted if the page is not fully used). Moreover, while retaining the order of the elements based on their insertion; index, like a vector, iterating over the elements via ``begin()`` and ``end()``; is not provided in the API, due to the fact accessing the elements in order; would allocate all the iterated pages, defeating memory savings and the purpose; of the ``PagedVector``.

Key sub-expressions must be of an; Objective-C object pointer type that implements the; ``<NSCopying>`` protocol. Discussion; ----------. Neither keys nor values can have the value ``nil`` in containers. If the; compiler can prove that a key or value is ``nil`` at compile time, then; a warning will be emitted. Otherwise, a runtime error will occur. Using array and dictionary literals is safer than the variadic creation; forms commonly in use today. Array literal expressions expand to calls; to ``+[NSArray arrayWithObjects:count:]``, which validates that all; objects are non-``nil``. The variadic form,; ``+[NSArray arrayWithObjects:]`` uses ``nil`` as an argument list; terminator, which can lead to malformed array objects.

An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration. The compiler inserts a; bounds check before ``p`` is dereferenced to ensure that the access remains; within the specified bounds. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, unsigned count) {; // off-by-one error (i < count); for (unsigned i = 0; i <= count; ++i) {; // bounds check inserted:; // if (i >= count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }.

The development of; ROOT is a continuous conversation between users and developers with; the line between the two blurring at times and the users becoming; co-developers.

In the bazaar view, software is released early and frequently to; expose it to thousands of eager co-developers to pound on, report; bugs, and contribute possible fixes. More users find more bugs,; because they stress the program in different ways. By now, after ten; years, the age of ROOT is quite mature.

In the past, you had to create the correct C++ class in Python, but now you can usually pass a Python dictionary instead. For example, a RooCategory can be created like this:; ```Python; sample = ROOT.RooCategory(""sample"", ""sample"", {""Sample1"": 1, ""Sample2"": 2, ""Sample3"": 3}); ```. #### RooWorkspace accessors. In Python, you can now get objects stored in a [RooWorkspace](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooWorkspace.html) with the item retrieval operator, and the return value is also always downcasted to the correct type.

Some of them were; already implicitly introduced (for example in the section; [Configure ROOT at start-up](#configure-root-at-start-up)).; The most important among them are presented in the following:. - **[gROOT](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTROOT.html)**: the `gROOT`; variable is the entry point to the ROOT system. Technically it is an; instance of the `TROOT` class. Using the `gROOT` pointer one has; access to basically every object created in a ROOT based program.; The `TROOT` object is essentially a container of several lists; pointing to the main `ROOT` objects. - **[gStyle](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTStyle.html)**: By default; ROOT creates a default style that can be accessed via the `gStyle`; pointer. This class includes functions to set some of the following; object attributes. - Canvas; - Pad; - Histogram axis; - Lines; - Fill areas; - Text; - Markers; - Functions; - Histogram Statistics and Titles; - etc ... - **[gSystem](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTSystem.html)**: An; instance of a base class defining a generic interface to the; underlying Operating System, in our case `TUnixSystem`. - **[gInterpreter](http://root.cern.ch/htmldoc/html/TInterpreter.html)**: The; entry point for the ROOT interpreter. Technically an abstraction level; over a singleton instance of `TCling`. At this point you have already learnt quite a bit about some basic; features of ROOT. ***Please mo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md:20356,access,access,20356,documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md,1,['access'],['access']

The following memory scopes are; currently supported:. * ``__MEMORY_SCOPE_SYSTEM``; * ``__MEMORY_SCOPE_DEVICE``; * ``__MEMORY_SCOPE_WRKGRP``; * ``__MEMORY_SCOPE_WVFRNT``; * ``__MEMORY_SCOPE_SINGLE``. This controls whether or not the atomic operation is ordered with respect to the; whole system, the current device, an OpenCL workgroup, wavefront, or just a; single thread.

It supports mapping an arbitrary range of bytes to an; arbitrary other object. The StringMap implementation uses a quadratically-probed hash table, where the; buckets store a pointer to the heap allocated entries (and some other stuff).; The entries in the map must be heap allocated because the strings are variable; length. The string data (key) and the element object (value) are stored in the; same allocation with the string data immediately after the element object.; This container guarantees the ""``(char*)(&Value+1)``"" points to the key string; for a value. The StringMap is very fast for several reasons: quadratic probing is very cache; efficient for lookups, the hash value of strings in buckets is not recomputed; when looking up an element, StringMap rarely has to touch the memory for; unrelated objects when looking up a value (even when hash collisions happen),; hash table growth does not recompute the hash values for strings already in the; table, and each pair in the map is store in a single allocation (the string data; is stored in the same allocation as the Value of a pair).

These invalidations happen after the; inner pass manager finishes, so accessing mutable analyses would give invalid; results. The exception to not being able to access outer level analyses is accessing; function analyses in loop passes. Loop passes often use function analyses such; as the dominator tree. Loop passes inherently require modifying the function the; loop is in, and that includes some function analyses the loop analyses depend; on. This discounts future concurrency over separate loops in a function, but; that's a tradeoff due to how tightly a loop and its function are coupled.

Security,"hich deserves a bit of explanation: if a; register class constraint allocates a register which is too small for the value; type operand provided as input, the input value will be split into multiple; registers, and all of them passed to the inline asm. However, this feature is often not as useful as you might think. Firstly, the registers are *not* guaranteed to be consecutive. So, on those; architectures that have instructions which operate on multiple consecutive; instructions, this is not an appropriate way to support them. (e.g. the 32-bit; SparcV8 has a 64-bit load, which instruction takes a single 32-bit register. The; hardware then loads into both the named register, and the next register. This; feature of inline asm would not be useful to support that.). A few of the targets provide a template string modifier allowing explicit access; to the second register of a two-register operand (e.g. MIPS ``L``, ``M``, and; ``D``). On such an architecture, you can actually access the second allocated; register (yet, still, not any subsequent ones). But, in that case, you're still; probably better off simply splitting the value into two separate operands, for; clarity.

Indirect output or input constraints can be specified by the ""``*``"" modifier; (which goes after the ""``=``"" in case of an output). This indicates that the asm; will write to or read from the contents of an *address* provided as an input; argument. (Note that in this way, indirect outputs act more like an *input* than; an output: just like an input, they consume an argument of the call expression,; rather than producing a return value.

Some unwinders (such as the; libgcc 4.9 unwinder) do not understand this unwind info and will segfault; when encountering it. LLVM libunwind processes this unwind info correctly,; however. This means that if exceptions are used together with ShadowCallStack,; the program must use a compatible unwinder. Security; ========. ShadowCallStack is intended to be a stronger alternative to; ``-fstack-protector``. It protects from non-linear overflows and arbitrary; memory writes to the return address slot. The instrumentation makes use of the ``SCSReg`` register to reference the shadow; call stack, meaning that references to the shadow call stack do not have; to be stored in memory. This makes it possible to implement a runtime that; avoids exposing the address of the shadow call stack to attackers that can; read arbitrary memory. However, attackers could still try to exploit side; channels exposed by the operating system `[1]`_ `[2]`_ or processor `[3]`_; to discover the address of the shadow call stack. .. _`[1]`: https://eyalitkin.wordpress.com/2017/09/01/cartography-lighting-up-the-shadows/; .. _`[2]`: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-16/materials/eu-16-Goktas-Bypassing-Clangs-SafeStack.pdf; .. _`[3]`: https://www.vusec.net/projects/anc/. Unless care is taken when allocating the shadow call stack, it may be; possible for an attacker to guess its address using the addresses of; other allocations. Therefore, the address should be chosen to make this; difficult. One way to do this is to allocate a large guard region without; read/write permissions, randomly select a small region within it to be; used as the address of the shadow call stack and mark only that region as; read/write. This also mitigates somewhat against processor side channels.; The intent is that the Android runtime `will do this`_, but the platform will; first need to be `changed`_ to avoid using ``setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS)`` to limit; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.rst:5222,attack,attackers,5222,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.rst,2,"['attack', 'expose']","['attackers', 'exposed']"

In order to support opaque pointers, two types of changes tend to be necessary.; The first is the removal of all calls to ``PointerType::getElementType()`` and; ``Type::getPointerElementType()``. In the LLVM middle-end and backend, this is usually accomplished by inspecting; the type of relevant operations instead. For example, memory access related; analyses and optimizations should use the types encoded in the load and store; instructions instead of querying the pointer type. Here are some common ways to avoid pointer element type accesses:. * For loads, use ``getType()``.; * For stores, use ``getValueOperand()->getType()``.; * Use ``getLoadStoreType()`` to handle both of the above in one call.; * For getelementptr instructions, use ``getSourceElementType()``.; * For calls, use ``getFunctionType()``.; * For allocas, use ``getAllocatedType()``.; * For globals, use ``getValueType()``.; * For consistency assertions, use; ``PointerType::isOpaqueOrPointeeTypeEquals()``.; * To create a pointer type in a different address space, use; ``PointerType::getWithSamePointeeType()``.; * To check that two pointers have the same element type, use; ``PointerType::hasSameElementTypeAs()``.; * While it is preferred to write code in a way that accepts both typed and; opaque pointers, ``Type::isOpaquePointerTy()`` and; ``PointerType::isOpaque()`` can be used to handle opaque pointers specially.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:6607,access,access,6607,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,1,['access'],['access']

It should only be used when iteration over the symbol table names; themselves are required, which is very special purpose. Note that not all LLVM; Value_\ s have names, and those without names (i.e. they have an empty name) do; not exist in the symbol table. Symbol tables support iteration over the values in the symbol table with; ``begin/end/iterator`` and supports querying to see if a specific name is in the; symbol table (with ``lookup``).

The reason is that the code; generator would need to insert a jump table in order to form a CFI-valid; address for assembly functions, but there is no way in general for the; code generator to determine the language of the function. This may be; possible with LTO in the intra-DSO case, but in the cross-DSO case the only; information available is the function declaration. One possible solution; is to add a C wrapper for each assembly function, but these wrappers can; present a significant maintenance burden for heavy users of assembly in; addition to adding runtime overhead. For these reasons, we provide the option of making the jump table non-canonical; with the flag ``-fno-sanitize-cfi-canonical-jump-tables``. When the jump; table is made non-canonical, symbol table entries point directly to the; function body. Any instances of a function's address being taken in C will; be replaced with a jump table address. This scheme does have its own caveats, however.

Security,"ic information in the IR. Why do struct member indices always use ``i32``?; ------------------------------------------------. The specific type i32 is probably just a historical artifact, however it's wide; enough for all practical purposes, so there's been no need to change it. It; doesn't necessarily imply i32 address arithmetic; it's just an identifier which; identifies a field in a struct. Requiring that all struct indices be the same; reduces the range of possibilities for cases where two GEPs are effectively the; same but have distinct operand types. What's an uglygep?; ------------------. Some LLVM optimizers operate on GEPs by internally lowering them into more; primitive integer expressions, which allows them to be combined with other; integer expressions and/or split into multiple separate integer expressions. If; they've made non-trivial changes, translating back into LLVM IR can involve; reverse-engineering the structure of the addressing in order to fit it into the; static type of the original first operand. It isn't always possibly to fully; reconstruct this structure; sometimes the underlying addressing doesn't; correspond with the static type at all. In such cases the optimizer instead will; emit a GEP with the base pointer casted to a simple address-unit pointer, using; the name ""uglygep"". This isn't pretty, but it's just as valid, and it's; sufficient to preserve the pointer aliasing guarantees that GEP provides. Summary; =======. In summary, here's some things to always remember about the GetElementPtr; instruction:. #. The GEP instruction never accesses memory, it only provides pointer; computations. #. The second operand to the GEP instruction is always a pointer and it must be; indexed. #. There are no superfluous indices for the GEP instruction. #.

Security,"ic on arbitrary pointers and this has been; a source of many bounds safety issues. In practice, many pointers are merely; pointing to a single object and incrementing or decrementing such a pointer; immediately makes the pointer go out-of-bounds. To prevent this unsafety,; ``-fbounds-safety`` provides the annotation ``__single`` that causes pointer; arithmetic on annotated pointers to be a compile time error. * ``__single`` : indicates that the pointer is either pointing to a single; object or null. Hence, pointers with ``__single`` do not permit pointer; arithmetic nor being subscripted with a non-zero index. Dereferencing a; ``__single`` pointer is allowed but it requires a null check. Upper and lower; bounds checks are not required because the ``__single`` pointer should point; to a valid object unless it's null. ``__single`` is the default annotation for ABI-visible pointers. This; gives strong security guarantees in that these pointers cannot be incremented or; decremented unless they have an explicit, overriding bounds annotation that can; be used to verify the safety of the operation. The compiler issues an error when; a ``__single`` pointer is utilized for pointer arithmetic or array access, as; these operations would immediately cause the pointer to exceed its bounds.; Consequently, this prompts programmers to provide sufficient bounds information; to pointers. In the following example, the pointer on parameter p is; single-by-default, and is employed for array access. As a result, the compiler; generates an error suggesting to add ``__counted_by`` to the pointer. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *p, unsigned count) {; for (unsigned i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; p[i] = i; // error; }; }.

This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it. We wondered whether only the *first* load in a basic block could be checked. If; the check works as intended, it forms an invalid pointer that doesn't even; virtual-address translate in the hardware. It should fault very early on in its; processing. Maybe that would stop things in time for the misspeculated path to; fail to leak any secrets. This doesn't end up working because the processor is; fundamentally out-of-order, even in its speculative domain. As a consequence,; the attacker could cause the initial address computation itself to stall and; allow an arbitrary number of unrelated loads (including attacked loads of; secret data) to pass through. #### Interprocedural Checking.

For performance reasons, a pad is not updated with every change. For; example, changing the coordinates of the pad does not automatically; redraw it. Instead, the pad has a ""bit-modified"" that triggers a redraw.; This bit is automatically set by:. - Touching the pad with the mouse - for example resizing it with the; mouse. - Finishing the execution of a script. - Adding a new primitive or modifying some primitives for example the; name and title of an object. - You can also set the ""bit-modified"" explicitly with the `Modified`; method:. ``` {.cpp}; // the pad has changed; root[] pad1->Modified(); // recursively update all modified pads:; root[] c1->Update(); ```. A subsequent call to `TCanvas::Update()` scans the list of sub-pads; and repaints the pads declared modified. In compiled code or in a long macro, you may want to access an object; created during the paint process. To do so, you can force the painting; with a `TCanvas::Update()`. For example, a **`TGraph`** creates a; histogram (**`TH1`**) to paint itself. In this case the internal; histogram obtained with `TGraph::GetHistogram()` is created only after; the pad is painted. The pad is painted automatically after the script is; finished executing or if you force the painting with `TPad::Modified()`; followed by a `TCanvas::Update()`. Note that it is not necessary to call; `TPad::Modified()` after a call to `Draw()`. The ""bit-modified"" is set; automatically by `Draw()`. A note about the ""bit-modified"" in sub pads:; when you want to update a sub pad in your canvas, you need to call; `pad->Modified()` rather than `canvas->Modified()`, and follow it with a; `canvas->Update()`. If you use `canvas->Modified()`, followed by a call; to `canvas->Update()`, the sub pad has not been declared modified and it; will not be updated.

Nomination process; ------------------. Anyone who feels they meet these criteria can nominate themselves, or may be nominated by a third party such as an existing LLVM Security Group member. The nomination should state whether the nominee is nominated as an individual, researcher, or as a vendor contact. It should clearly describe the grounds for nomination. For the moment, nominations are generally proposed, discussed, and voted on using Phabricator. An `example nomination is available here`_. The use of Phabricator helps keep membership discussions open, transparent, and easily accessible to LLVM developers in many ways. If, for any reason, a fully-world-readable nomination seems inappropriate, you may `open a new issue`_, and a discussion can be had about the best way to approach nomination, given the constraints that individuals are under.

This document discusses the key designs of ``-fbounds-safety``. The document is; subject to be actively updated with a more detailed specification. The; implementation plan can be found in :doc:`BoundsSafetyImplPlans`. Programming Model; =================. Overview; --------. ``-fbounds-safety`` ensures that pointers are not used to access memory beyond; their bounds by performing bounds checking. If a bounds check fails, the program; will deterministically trap before out-of-bounds memory is accessed. In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking. Consider the; example below where the ``__counted_by(count)`` annotation indicates that; parameter ``p`` points to a buffer of integers containing ``count`` elements. An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration. The compiler inserts a; bounds check before ``p`` is dereferenced to ensure that the access remains; within the specified bounds. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, unsigned count) {; // off-by-one error (i < count); for (unsigned i = 0; i <= count; ++i) {; // bounds check inserted:; // if (i >= count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. A bounds annotation defines an invariant for the pointer type, and the model; ensures that this invariant remains true.

The browser shows several; folders under `//root`. New folders can be added and removed to/from a folder. ## Why Use Folders?. One reason to use folders is to reduce class dependencies and improve; modularity. Each set of data has a producer class and one or many; consumer classes. When using folders, the producer class places a; pointer to the data into a folder, and the consumer class retrieves a; reference to the folder. The consumer can access the objects in a folder by specifying the path; name of the folder. Here is an example of a folder's path name:. `//root/Event/Hits/TCP`. One does not have to specify the full path name. If the partial path; name is unique, it will find it; otherwise it will return the first; occurrence of the path. The first diagram shows a system without folders. The objects have; pointers to each other to access each other's data. Pointers are an; efficient way to share data between classes. However, a direct pointer; creates a direct coupling between classes. This design can become a very; tangled web of dependencies in a system with a large number of classes. ![](pictures/020000E2.jpg). In the second diagram, a reference to the data is in the folder and the; consumers refer to the folder rather than each other to access the data.; The naming and search service provided by the ROOT folders hierarchy; provides an alternative. It loosely couples the classes and greatly; enhances I/O operations. In this way, folders separate the data from the; algorithms and greatly improve the modularity of an application by; minimizing the class dependencies. ![](pictures/020000E3.jpg). In addition, the folder hierarchy creates a picture of the data; organization. This is useful when discussing data design issues or when; learning the data organization. The example below illustrates this; poin",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FoldersTasks.md:1214,access,access,1214,documentation/users-guide/FoldersTasks.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FoldersTasks.md,1,['access'],['access']

Build LLVM/Clang with `CMake <https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html>`_. Usage; =====. Use ``clang++`` to compile and link your program with the ``-fsanitize=undefined``; option. Make sure to use ``clang++`` (not ``ld``) as a linker, so that your; executable is linked with proper UBSan runtime libraries, unless all enabled; checks use trap mode.

For most checks (:ref:`checks <ubsan-checks>`), the instrumented program prints; a verbose error report and continues execution upon a failed check.; You can use the following options to change the error reporting behavior:. * ``-fno-sanitize-recover=...``: print a verbose error report and exit the program;; * ``-fsanitize-trap=...``: execute a trap instruction (doesn't require UBSan; run-time support).

They're; just physically stored apart and each instruction can only access registers from; A or B but never a mix of the two. If we want to perform an operation on data; that's in split between the two register files, we must first copy all the data; into a single register file. Given a processor like this, we would benefit from clustering related data; together into one register file so that we minimize the cost of copying data; back and forth to satisfy the (possibly conflicting) requirements of all the; instructions. Register Banks are a means to constrain the register allocator to; use a particular register file for a virtual register. In practice, register files A and B are rarely equal. They can typically store; the same data but there's usually some restrictions on what operations you can; do on each register file. A fairly common pattern is for one of them to be; accessible to integer operations and the other accessible to floating point; operations. To accommodate this, let's rename A and B to GPR (general purpose; registers) and FPR (floating point registers). We now have some additional constraints that limit us. An operation like G_FMUL; has to happen in FPR and G_ADD has to happen in GPR. However, even though this; prescribes a lot of the assignments we still have some freedom. A G_LOAD can; happen in both GPR and FPR, and which we want depends on who is going to consume; the loaded data. Similarly, G_FNEG can happen in both GPR and FPR. If we assign; it to FPR, then we'll use floating point negation. However, if we assign it to; GPR then we can equivalently G_XOR the sign bit with 1 to invert it. In summary, Register Banks are a means of disambiguating between seemingly; equivalent choices based on some analysis of the differences when each choice; is applied in a given context.

The value of gDirectory and gFile are now all accessed via a static function of their respective class. The access is made transparent via a CPP macro.

In particular this means that several I/O operations (including TDirectory::Write) are thread safe (as long as all the required TClass and TStreamerInfo has been previously setup).; Note: This model does not support sharing TFile amongst threads (i.e. a TFile must be accessed from exactly one thread). This means that whenever a TFile's control is passed from a thread to another, the code must explicitly reset gDirectory to another value or there is a risk for this gDirectory to point to a stale pointer if the other thread deletes the TFile object.

The operation is equivalent to performing ``DW_OP_regx R``. 2. ``DW_OP_regx``. ``DW_OP_regx`` has a single unsigned LEB128 integer operand that represents; a target architecture register number R. If the current call frame is the top call frame, it pushes a location; description L that specifies one register location description SL on the; stack. SL specifies the register location storage that corresponds to R with; a bit offset of 0 for the current thread. If the current call frame is not the top call frame, call frame information; (see :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`) is used to determine the; location description that holds the register for the current call frame and; current program location of the current thread. The resulting location; description L is pushed. *Note that if call frame information is used, the resulting location; description may be register, memory, or undefined.*. *An implementation may evaluate the call frame information immediately, or; may defer evaluation until L is accessed by an operation. If evaluation is; deferred, R and the current context can be recorded in L. When accessed, the; recorded context is used to evaluate the call frame information, not the; current context of the access operation.*. *These operations obtain a register location. To fetch the contents of a; register, it is necessary to use* ``DW_OP_regval_type``\ *, use one of the*; ``DW_OP_breg*`` *register-based addressing operations, or use* ``DW_OP_deref*``; *on a register location description.*. .. _amdgpu-dwarf-implicit-location-description-operations:.

When you add a popup menu to the menu; bar, a **`TGMenuTitle`** object is created by the menu bar. It is the; name of the popup menu. A menu title should have a one-word name that; reflects the purpose of all items within the corresponding popup menu.; It should also have a defined character as its unique access key. The; second parameter is the popup menu we would like to add. The third one; is an object of **`TGLayoutHints`** type that defines how the menu title; will be laid out in the menu bar. In our example the *`File`* and `Test`; menus will be laid out to the left of the menu bar with 4 pixels; distance in between, the `Help` menu - will be laid out to the right. The menu classes provide a very flexible menu system: you can enable,; disable, add or remove menu items dynamically. The method; `HideEntry(menuID)` hides the menu entry (the entry will not be shown in; the popup menu). To enable a hidden entry you should call; `EnableEntry(menuID)` method.

When reading the file back, the object is reconstructed; in memory. The requirement to be satisfied to perform I/O of instances; of a certain class is that the ROOT type system is aware of the layout; in memory of that class.; This topic is beyond the scope of this document: it is worth to mention; that I/O can be performed out of the box for the almost complete set; of ROOT classes. We can explore this functionality with histograms and two simple macros. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/write_to_file.C; ```. Not bad, eh ? Especially for a language that does not foresees; persistency natively like C++. The *RECREATE* option forces ROOT to; create a new file even if a file with the same name exists on disk. Now, you may use the Cling command line to access information in the file; and draw the previously written histogram:. ``` {.cpp}; > root my_rootfile.root; root [0]; Attaching file my_rootfile.root as _file0...; root [1] _file0->ls(); TFile** my_rootfile.root; TFile* my_rootfile.root; KEY: TH1F	my_histogram;1 My Title; root [2] my_histogram->Draw(); ```; \newpage; Alternatively, you can use a simple macro to carry out the job:. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/read_from_file.C; ```. ## N-tuples in ROOT ##. ### Storing simple N-tuples ###.

This takes an easy problem that the analyzer does; well at (modeling typestate) and turns it into a hard one that the analyzer is; bad at (reasoning about the contents of the heap).

That is, does the library expose the region as a pointer that can be; read to or written from in the client program? If so, then it makes sense for; this to be in the store: we are modeling reachable storage as storage.

A variable may be defined as a global ``constant``, which indicates that; the contents of the variable will **never** be modified (enabling better; optimization, allowing the global data to be placed in the read-only; section of an executable, etc). Note that variables that need runtime; initialization cannot be marked ``constant`` as there is a store to the; variable. LLVM explicitly allows *declarations* of global variables to be marked; constant, even if the final definition of the global is not. This; capability can be used to enable slightly better optimization of the; program, but requires the language definition to guarantee that; optimizations based on the 'constantness' are valid for the translation; units that do not include the definition. As SSA values, global variables define pointer values that are in scope; (i.e. they dominate) all basic blocks in the program. Global variables; always define a pointer to their ""content"" type because they describe a; region of memory, and all memory objects in LLVM are accessed through; pointers. Global variables can be marked with ``unnamed_addr`` which indicates; that the address is not significant, only the content. Constants marked; like this can be merged with other constants if they have the same; initializer. Note that a constant with significant address *can* be; merged with a ``unnamed_addr`` constant, the result being a constant; whose address is significant. If the ``local_unnamed_addr`` attribute is given, the address is known to; not be significant within the module.

The; pixel color is derived from the properties of the first crossed surface,; according some illumination model and material optical properties. While; there are currently existing quite sophisticated ray tracing models,; **`TGeo`** is currently using a very simple approach where the light; source is matching the eye position (no shadows or back-tracing of the; reflected ray). In future we are considering providing a base class in; order to be able to derive more complex models. Due to the fact that the number of rays that have to be tracked matches; the size in pixels of the pad, the time required by this algorithm is; proportional to the pad size. On the other hand, the speed is quite; acceptable for the default ROOT pad size and the images produced by; using this technique have high quality. Since the algorithm is; practically using all navigation features, producing ray-traced pictures; is also a geometry validation check. Ray tracing can be activated at; volume level as the normal `Draw()`. ![Ray-traced view in a pad](pictures/020001E4.jpg). ``` {.cpp}; myVolume->Raytrace(); ```. Once ray-tracing a view, this can be zoomed or rotated as a usual one.; Objects on the screen are no longer highlighted when picking the; vertices but the corresponding volumes is still accessible. #### Clipping Ray-traced Images. A ray-traced view can be `clipped` with any shape known by the modeller.; This means that the region inside the clipping shape is subtracted from; the current drawn geometry (become invisible). In order to activate; clipping, one has to first define the clipping shape(s):. `1. TGeoShape *clip1, *clip2, ...`. One might switch between several clipping shapes. Note that these shapes; are considered defined in the current `MARS`. Composite shapes may be; used. 2`. gGeoManager->SetClippingShape(clip1);`.

Security,"ing; dynamic libraries with SafeStack is not supported. Signal handlers that use ``sigaltstack()`` must not use the unsafe stack (see; ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""safe-stack"")))`` below). Programs that use APIs from ``ucontext.h`` are not supported yet. Security; --------. SafeStack protects return addresses, spilled registers and local variables that; are always accessed in a safe way by separating them in a dedicated safe stack; region. The safe stack is automatically protected against stack-based buffer; overflows, since it is disjoint from the unsafe stack in memory, and it itself; is always accessed in a safe way. In the current implementation, the safe stack; is protected against arbitrary memory write vulnerabilities though; randomization and information hiding: the safe stack is allocated at a random; address and the instrumentation ensures that no pointers to the safe stack are; ever stored outside of the safe stack itself (see limitations below). Known security limitations; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. A complete protection against control-flow hijack attacks requires combining; SafeStack with another mechanism that enforces the integrity of code pointers; that are stored on the heap or the unsafe stack, such as `CPI; <https://dslab.epfl.ch/research/cpi/>`_, or a forward-edge control flow integrity; mechanism that enforces correct calling conventions at indirect call sites,; such as `IFCC <https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/42808.pdf>`_ with arity; checks. Clang has control-flow integrity protection scheme for :doc:`C++ virtual; calls <ControlFlowIntegrity>`, but not non-virtual indirect calls. With; SafeStack alone, an attacker can overwrite a function pointer on the heap or; the unsafe stack and cause a program to call arbitrary location, which in turn; might enable stack pivoting and return-oriented programming.

Security,"ing](pictures/pad_02.png). In some cases a pad need to be painted during a macro execution. To; force the pad painting `gPad->Update()` (see next section) should be performed. The list of primitives stored in the pad is also used to pick objects; and to interact with them. ### The Global Pad: gPad. When an object is drawn, it is always in the so-called active pad. For; every day use, it is comfortable to be able to access the active pad,; whatever it is. For that purpose, there is a global pointer, called; ***`gPad`***. It is always pointing to the active pad. If you want to; change the fill color of the active pad to blue but you do not know its; name, do this. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetFillColor(38); ```. To get the list of colors, go to the paragraph ""Color and color; palettes"" or if you have an opened canvas, click on the `View` menu,; selecting the `Colors` item. #### Finding an Object in a Pad. Now that we have a pointer to the active pad, ***`gPad`*** and that we; know this pad contains some objects, it is sometimes interesting to; access one of those objects. The method `GetPrimitive()` of **`TPad`**,; i.e. `TPad::GetPrimitive(const char* name)` does exactly this. Since; most of the objects that a pad contains derive from **`TObject`**, they; have a name. The following statement will return a pointer to the object; `myobjectname` and put that pointer into the variable `obj`. As you can; see, the type of returned pointer is `TObject*`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] obj = gPad->GetPrimitive(""myobjectname""); (class TObject*)0x1063cba8; ```. Even if your object is something more complicated, like a histogram; **`TH1F`**, this is normal. A function cannot return more than one type.; So the one chosen was the lowest common denominator to all possible; classes, the class from which everything derives, **`TObject`**. How do; we get the right pointer then? Simply do a cast of the function output; that will transform the output (pointer) into the right type.

For example, if; you have a ``GlobalVariable`` (a subclass of ``GlobalValue)`` that is an array; of 24 ints, type ``[24 x i32]``, then the ``GlobalVariable`` is a pointer to; that array.

The first element's type is; ``i32.`` Because of this, accessing a global value requires you to dereference; the pointer with ``GetElementPtrInst`` first, then its elements can be accessed.; This is explained in the `LLVM Language Reference Manual; <LangRef.html#globalvars>`_. .. _m_GlobalValue:.

Tracking is the feature allowing the transport of a given particle; knowing its kinematics. A state is determined by any combination of the; position $\vec{r}$ and direction $\vec{n}$ with respect to the world; reference frame. The direction $\vec{n}$ must be a unit vector having as; components the director cosines. The full classification of a given; state will provide the following information: the deepest physical node; containing the position vector, the distance to the closest boundary; along the direction vector, the next physical node after propagating the; current point with this distance and the safety distance to the nearest; boundary. This information allows the propagation of particles inside a; detector geometry by taking into account both geometrical and physical; constraints. We will hereby describe the user interface of **`TGeo`** to access; tracking functionality. This allows either developing a tracker for; simple navigation within a given geometry, either interfacing to an; external tracking engine such as GEANT. Note that the abstract interface; for external trackers can be found in `$ROOTSYS/vmc` folder and it can; be used to run GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA-based simulations (\*) by using; directly a geometry described with ROOT. The interface methods related to tracking are incorporated into; **`TGeoManager`** class and implemented in the navigator class; **`TGeoNavigator`**. In order to be able to start tracking, one has to; define the initial state providing the starting point $\vec{r_0}$; and direction $\vec{n_0}$ .; There are several ways of doing that. ### TGeoNavigator Class.

We would then compare any consecutive; 32 bit hashes values in the ``HASHES`` array as long as the hashes would be in; ``BUCKETS[3]``. We do this by verifying that each subsequent hash value modulo; ``n_buckets`` is still 3. In the case of a failed lookup we would access the; memory for ``BUCKETS[3]``, and then compare a few consecutive 32 bit hashes; before we know that we have no match. We don't end up marching through; multiple words of memory and we really keep the number of processor data cache; lines being accessed as small as possible.

Since; the LLVM ``memfence`` instruction does not allow an address space to be; specified the OpenCL fence has to conservatively assume both local and; global address space was specified. However, optimizations can often be; done to eliminate the additional ``s_waitcnt`` instructions when there are; no intervening memory instructions which access the corresponding address; space. The code sequences in the table indicate what can be omitted for the; OpenCL memory. The target triple environment is used to determine if the; source language is OpenCL (see :ref:`amdgpu-opencl`). ``ds/flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions to local memory are termed LDS; operations. ``buffer/global/flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions to global memory are; termed vector memory operations. Private address space uses ``buffer_load/store`` using the scratch V#; (GFX6-GFX8), or ``scratch_load/store`` (GFX9-GFX11). Since only a single thread; is accessing the memory, atomic memory orderings are not meaningful, and all; accesses are treated as non-atomic. Constant address space uses ``buffer/global_load`` instructions (or equivalent; scalar memory instructions).

Security,"ions will require an extra null check to avoid a null pointer; dereference. Internal bounds annotations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A wide pointer (sometimes known as a ""fat"" pointer) is a pointer that carries; additional bounds information internally (as part of its data). The bounds; require additional storage space making wide pointers larger than normal; pointers, hence the name ""wide pointer"". The memory layout of a wide pointer is; equivalent to a struct with the pointer, upper bound, and (optionally) lower; bound as its fields as shown below. .. code-block:: c. struct wide_pointer_datalayout {; void* pointer; // Address used for dereferences and pointer arithmetic; void* upper_bound; // Points one past the highest address that can be; // accessed; void* lower_bound; // (Optional) Points to lowest address that can be; // accessed; };. Even with this representational change, wide pointers act syntactically as; normal pointers to allow standard pointer operations, such as pointer; dereference (``*p``), array subscript (``p[i]``), member access (``p->``), and; pointer arithmetic, with some restrictions on bounds-unsafe uses. ``-fbounds-safety`` has a set of ""internal"" bounds annotations to turn pointers; into wide pointers. These are ``__bidi_indexable`` and ``__indexable``. When a; pointer has either of these annotations, the compiler changes the pointer to the; corresponding wide pointer. This means these annotations will break the ABI and; will not be compatible with plain C, and thus they should generally not be used; in ABI surfaces. * ``__bidi_indexable`` : A pointer with this annotation becomes a wide pointer; to carry the upper bound and the lower bound, the layout of which is; equivalent to ``struct { T *ptr; T *upper_bound; T *lower_bound; };``. As the; name indicates, pointers with this annotation are ""bidirectionally indexable"",; meaning that they can be indexed with either a negative or a positive offset; and the pointers can be incremented or decre",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:13721,access,access,13721,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['access'],['access']

The reader can create `RNTupleView` objects for the independent reading of individual fields.; The reader can create `RBulk` objects for bulk reading of individual fields. Additionally, the reader provides access to a cached copy of the descriptor.; It can display individual entries (`RNTupleReader::Show()`) and summary information (`RNTupleReader::PrintInfo()`). ### RNTupleView<T>; RNTuple views provide read access to individual fields.; Views are created from an RNTupleReader.; Views are templated; for simple types (e.g., `float`, `int`), views provide read-only access directly to an RNTuple page in memory.; Complex types and void views require additional memory copies to populate an object in memory from the column data. A view can iterate over the entry range, over the field range, and over the range of a collection within an entry.; For instance, for a field `std::vector<float> pt`, a view can iterate over all `pt` values of all entries, or over the `pt` values of a particular entry. A view can safely outlive its originating reader.; Once the reader is deconstructed, any attempt to read data will throw an exception, but the view is still properly destructed. Views that originate from the same reader _cannot_ be used concurrently by different threads.

Security,"is a summary of the changes made. All of these changes are; transparent to end-use cases ; ; ; New implementation of RooFit data types. The implementation of data stored in RooDataSet and RooDataHist; was historically handled by ROOT TTrees (though class RooTreeDataStore). The default storage type; has now been changed to class RooVectorDataStore which stores the information in STL arrays. Existing; datasets based on trees can be read in transparently, and are converted to vector form in the ; persistent-to-transient conversion (the datafile is not modified in this operation); ; The vector store has two important advantages: 1) faster data access (raw data access times are 70 times ; faster than for TTrees), 2) ability to rewrite columns on the fly. The first advantage is important; for the existing constant-term precalculation optimization in roofit likelihoods as these are now; also stored in vectors rather than trees. The faster access speed of vectors make that the constant; term optimization inside likelihoods results in a larger speed increase. This is particulatly noticeable in pdfs with; many constant expressions from pdfs that were moderately fast to begin with (e.g. RooHistPdf).; The second advantages allows new types of algorithmic likelihood optimization in RooFit detailed below. New algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs. So far - in the likelihood - two classes of; objects are identified: those that change with every event (i.e. the pdf) and those that change; only with the parameters (typically pdf normalization integrals). Pdfs are always recalculated; for every event, whereas integrals are only evaluated when needed. The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation.

This rule isn't quite what we want: it will rewrite ``my_object.child().foo()`` to; ``my_object.foo()``, but it will also rewrite ``my_ptr->child().foo()`` to; ``my_ptr.foo()``, which is not what we intend. We could fix this by restricting; the pattern with ``not(isArrow())`` in the definition of ``child_call``. Yet, we; *want* to rewrite calls through pointers. To capture this idiom, we provide the ``access`` combinator to intelligently; construct a field/method access. In our example, the member access is expressed; as:. .. code-block:: c++. access(e, cat(member(m))). The first argument specifies the object being accessed and the second, a; description of the field/method name. In this case, we specify that the method; name should be copied from the source -- specifically, the source range of ``m``'s; member. To construct the method call, we would use this expression in ``cat``:. .. code-block:: c++. cat(access(e, cat(member(m))), ""()"").

We should take advantage of one of the services out there (GitHub, GitLab,; and BitBucket, among others) that offer better service (24/7 stability, disk; space, Git server, code browsing, forking facilities, etc) for free. Why Git?; --------. Many new coders nowadays start with Git, and a lot of people have never used; SVN, CVS, or anything else. Websites like GitHub have changed the landscape; of open source contributions, reducing the cost of first contribution and; fostering collaboration. Git is also the version control many LLVM developers use. Despite the; sources being stored in a SVN server, these developers are already using Git; through the Git-SVN integration. Git allows you to:. * Commit, squash, merge, and fork locally without touching the remote server.; * Maintain local branches, enabling multiple threads of development.; * Collaborate on these branches (e.g. through your own fork of llvm on GitHub).; * Inspect the repository history (blame, log, bisect) without Internet access.; * Maintain remote forks and branches on Git hosting services and; integrate back to the main repository. In addition, because Git seems to be replacing many OSS projects' version; control systems, there are many tools that are built over Git.; Future tooling may support Git first (if not only). Why GitHub?; -----------. GitHub, like GitLab and BitBucket, provides free code hosting for open source; projects. Any of these could replace the code-hosting infrastructure that we; have today. These services also have a dedicated team to monitor, migrate, improve and; distribute the contents of the repositories depending on region and load. GitHub has one important advantage over GitLab and; BitBucket: it offers read-write **SVN** access to the repository; (https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support).; This would enable people to continue working post-migration as though our code; were still canonically in an SVN repository.

This utility uses page-granular lazy initialization; when the element is accessed. When the number of used pages is small; significant memory savings can be achieved. The main advantage is that a ``PagedVector`` allows to delay the actual; allocation of the page until it's needed, at the extra cost of one pointer per; page and one extra indirection when accessing elements with their positional; index. In order to minimise the memory footprint of this container, it's important to; balance the PageSize so that it's not too small (otherwise the overhead of the; pointer per page might become too high) and not too big (otherwise the memory; is wasted if the page is not fully used). Moreover, while retaining the order of the elements based on their insertion; index, like a vector, iterating over the elements via ``begin()`` and ``end()``; is not provided in the API, due to the fact accessing the elements in order; would allocate all the iterated pages, defeating memory savings and the purpose; of the ``PagedVector``.

Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`.

The `address discriminator` argument is a pointer value.; The `integer discriminator` argument is a small integer, as specified by the; target. ##### Semantics:. The '`llvm.ptrauth.blend`' intrinsic combines a small integer discriminator; with a pointer address discriminator, in a way that is specified by the target; implementation. ### Operand Bundle. Function pointers used as indirect call targets can be signed when materialized,; and authenticated before calls. This can be accomplished with the; [`llvm.ptrauth.auth`](#llvm-ptrauth-auth) intrinsic, feeding its result to; an indirect call. However, that exposes the intermediate, unauthenticated pointer, e.g., if it; gets spilled to the stack. An attacker can then overwrite the pointer in; memory, negating the security benefit provided by pointer authentication.; To prevent that, the `ptrauth` operand bundle may be used: it guarantees that; the intermediate call target is kept in a register and never stored to memory.; This hardening benefit is similar to that provided by; [`llvm.ptrauth.resign`](#llvm-ptrauth-resign)). Concretely:. ```llvm; define void @f(void ()* %fp) {; call void %fp() [ ""ptrauth""(i32 <key>, i64 <data>) ]; ret void; }; ```. is functionally equivalent to:. ```llvm; define void @f(void ()* %fp) {; %fp_i = ptrtoint void ()* %fp to i64; %fp_auth = call i64 @llvm.ptrauth.auth(i64 %fp_i, i32 <key>, i64 <data>); %fp_auth_p = inttoptr i64 %fp_auth to void ()*; call void %fp_auth_p(); ret void; }; ```. but with the added guarantee that `%fp_i`, `%fp_auth`, and `%fp_auth_p`; are not stored to (and reloaded from) memory. ## AArch64 Support.

For the Alpha target; (in ``AlphaJITInfo.cpp``), the ``getLazyResolverFunction`` implementation is; simply:. .. code-block:: c++. TargetJITInfo::LazyResolverFn AlphaJITInfo::getLazyResolverFunction(; JITCompilerFn F) {; JITCompilerFunction = F;; return AlphaCompilationCallback;; }. For the X86 target, the ``getLazyResolverFunction`` implementation is a little; more complicated, because it returns a different callback function for; processors with SSE instructions and XMM registers. The callback function initially saves and later restores the callee register; values, incoming arguments, and frame and return address. The callback; function needs low-level access to the registers or stack, so it is typically; implemented with assembler.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst:83586,access,access,83586,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMBackend.rst,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"izer restriction which applies in; concurrent environments, which gets a bit more of an extended description; because any optimization dealing with stores needs to be aware of it. From the optimizer's point of view, the rule is that if there are not any; instructions with atomic ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }. The following is equivalent in non-concurrent situations:. .. code-block:: c. int x;; void f(int* a) {; int xtemp = x;; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); xtemp += 1;; }; x = xtemp;; }. However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (wh",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst:3720,access,access,3720,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,1,['access'],['access']

This attribute; overrides ``no_sanitize(""thread"")``. Ignorelist; ----------. ThreadSanitizer supports ``src`` and ``fun`` entity types in; :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`, that can be used to suppress data race reports; in the specified source files or functions. Unlike functions marked with; ``no_sanitize(""thread"")`` attribute, ignored functions are not instrumented; at all. This can lead to false positives due to missed synchronization via; atomic operations and missed stack frames in reports. Limitations; -----------. * ThreadSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run. At the default; settings the memory overhead is 5x plus 1Mb per each thread. Settings with 3x; (less accurate analysis) and 9x (more accurate analysis) overhead are also; available.; * ThreadSanitizer maps (but does not reserve) a lot of virtual address space.; This means that tools like ``ulimit`` may not work as usually expected.; * Libc/libstdc++ static linking is not supported.; * Non-position-independent executables are not supported. Therefore, the; ``fsanitize=thread`` flag will cause Clang to act as though the ``-fPIE``; flag had been supplied if compiling without ``-fPIC``, and as though the; ``-pie`` flag had been supplied if linking an executable.

A mutex is usually used to ensure; that only one thread at a time executes some critical section of code.; Before entering a critical section, a thread will attempt to lock the; mutex, which guards that section. If the mutex is already locked, the; thread will block until the mutex is unlocked, at which time it will; lock the mutex, execute the critical section, and unlock the mutex upon; leaving the critical section. A **`semaphore`** is a synchronization mechanism that starts out; initialized to some positive value. A thread may ask to wait on a; semaphore in which case the thread blocks until the value of the; semaphore is positive. At that time the semaphore count is decremented; and the thread continues. When a thread releases semaphore, the; semaphore count is incremented. Counting semaphores are useful for; coordinating access to a limited pool of some resource. **`Readers/Writer Lock`** - a multiple-reader, single-writer lock is one; that allows simultaneous read access by many threads while restricting; write access to only one thread at a time.

LLVM uses a PC relative; (PIC) or static addressing for accessing global values, so no TOC (r2) is; used. Second, r31 is used as a frame pointer to allow dynamic growth of a stack; frame. LLVM takes advantage of having no TOC to provide space to save the frame; pointer in the PowerPC linkage area of the caller frame. Other details of; PowerPC ABI can be found at `PowerPC ABI; <http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/LowLevelABI/Articles/32bitPowerPC.html>`_\; . Note: This link describes the 32 bit ABI. The 64 bit ABI is similar except; space for GPRs are 8 bytes wide (not 4) and r13 is reserved for system use. Frame Layout; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The size of a PowerPC frame is usually fixed for the duration of a function's; invocation. Since the frame is fixed size, all references into the frame can be; accessed via fixed offsets from the stack pointer. The exception to this is; when dynamic alloca or variable sized arrays are present, then a base pointer; (r31) is used as a proxy for the stack pointer and stack pointer is free to grow; or shrink. A base pointer is also used if llvm-gcc is not passed the; -fomit-frame-pointer flag. The stack pointer is always aligned to 16 bytes, so; that space allocated for altivec vectors will be properly aligned.

The instrumentation makes use of the ``SCSReg`` register to reference the shadow; call stack, meaning that references to the shadow call stack do not have; to be stored in memory. This makes it possible to implement a runtime that; avoids exposing the address of the shadow call stack to attackers that can; read arbitrary memory. However, attackers could still try to exploit side; channels exposed by the operating system `[1]`_ `[2]`_ or processor `[3]`_; to discover the address of the shadow call stack. .. _`[1]`: https://eyalitkin.wordpress.com/2017/09/01/cartography-lighting-up-the-shadows/; .. _`[2]`: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-16/materials/eu-16-Goktas-Bypassing-Clangs-SafeStack.pdf; .. _`[3]`: https://www.vusec.net/projects/anc/.

To avoid this, LLVM will emit a slower; sequence of loads, shifts and masks (or load-right + load-left on MIPS) for; all cases where the load / store does not have a sufficiently high alignment; in the IR. The alignment is used to guarantee the alignment on allocas and globals,; though in most cases this is unnecessary (most targets have a sufficiently; high default alignment that they’ll be fine). It is also used to provide a; contract to the back end saying ‘either this load/store has this alignment, or; it is undefined behavior’. This means that the back end is free to emit; instructions that rely on that alignment (and mid-level optimizers are free to; perform transforms that require that alignment). For x86, it doesn’t make; much difference, as almost all instructions are alignment-independent. For; MIPS, it can make a big difference. Note that if your loads and stores are atomic, the backend will be unable to; lower an under aligned access into a sequence of natively aligned accesses.; As a result, alignment is mandatory for atomic loads and stores. Other Things to Consider; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Use ptrtoint/inttoptr sparingly (they interfere with pointer aliasing; analysis), prefer GEPs. #.

One example is mark-and-sweep garbage collection; implementations for C/C++ (e.g., Oilpan in chromium/blink), which must be; changed to look for the live pointers on both safe and unsafe stacks. SafeStack supports linking statically modules that are compiled with and; without SafeStack. An executable compiled with SafeStack can load dynamic; libraries that are not compiled with SafeStack. At the moment, compiling; dynamic libraries with SafeStack is not supported. Signal handlers that use ``sigaltstack()`` must not use the unsafe stack (see; ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""safe-stack"")))`` below). Programs that use APIs from ``ucontext.h`` are not supported yet. Security; --------. SafeStack protects return addresses, spilled registers and local variables that; are always accessed in a safe way by separating them in a dedicated safe stack; region.

Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it. We wondered whether only the *first* load in a basic block could be checked. If; the check works as intended, it forms an invalid pointer that doesn't even; virtual-address translate in the hardware.

Modern x86 processors may speculate into called functions and out of functions; to their return address. As a consequence, we need a way to check loads that; occur after a misspeculated predicate but where the load and the misspeculated; predicate are in different functions. In essence, we need some interprocedural; generalization of the predicate state tracking. A primary challenge to passing; the predicate state between functions is that we would like to not require a; change to the ABI or calling convention in order to make this mitigation more; deployable, and further would like code mitigated in this way to be easily; mixed with code not mitigated in this way and without completely losing the; value of the mitigation. ##### Embed the predicate state into the high bit(s) of the stack pointer.

The exception to not being able to access outer level analyses is accessing; function analyses in loop passes. Loop passes often use function analyses such; as the dominator tree. Loop passes inherently require modifying the function the; loop is in, and that includes some function analyses the loop analyses depend; on. This discounts future concurrency over separate loops in a function, but; that's a tradeoff due to how tightly a loop and its function are coupled.

This should generally only be used when; the IR that the result is keyed on becomes invalid. For example, a function; is deleted, or a CGSCC has become invalid due to call graph changes. The typical way to invalidate analysis results is for a pass to declare what; types of analyses it preserves and what types it does not. When transforming; IR, a pass either has the option to update analyses alongside the IR; transformation, or tell the analysis manager that analyses are no longer; valid and should be invalidated.

They; differ in the base image that they use, i.e. they have a different set of; preinstalled binaries. Debian8 is very minimal, nvidia-cuda is larger, but has; preinstalled CUDA libraries and allows to access a GPU, installed on your; machine. If you need a minimal linux distribution with only clang and libstdc++ included,; you should try Debian10-based image. If you want to use CUDA libraries and have access to a GPU on your machine,; you should choose nvidia-cuda-based image and use `nvidia-docker; <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_ to run your docker containers. Note; that you don't need nvidia-docker to build the images, but you need it in order; to have an access to GPU from a docker container that is running the built; image. If you have a different use-case, you could create your own image based on; ``example/`` folder. Any docker image can be built and run using only the docker binary, i.e. you can; run debian10 build on Fedora or any other Linux distribution. You don't need to; install CMake, compilers or any other clang dependencies. It is all handled; during the build process inside Docker's isolated environment.

It will be used for technical discussions of security issues, as well as process discussions about matters such as disclosure timelines and group membership. Members have access to all security issues. Confidentiality; ---------------. Members of the LLVM Security Group will be expected to treat LLVM security issue information shared with the group as confidential until publicly disclosed:. * Members should not disclose security issue information to non-members unless both members are employed by the same vendor of a LLVM based product, in which case information can be shared within that organization on a need-to-know basis and handled as confidential information normally is within that organization.; * If the LLVM Security Group agrees, designated members may share issues with vendors of non-LLVM based products if their product suffers from the same issue. The non-LLVM vendor should be asked to respect the issue’s embargo date, and to not share the information beyond the need-to-know people within their organization.; * If the LLVM Security Group agrees, key experts can be brought in to help address particular issues. The key expert should be asked to respect the issue’s embargo date, and to not share the information. Disclosure; ----------. Following the process below, the LLVM Security Group decides on embargo date for public disclosure for each Security issue.

One interesting (and somewhat unusual) aspect of normal tokens is that they; don't contain any semantic information about the lexed value. For example, if; the token was a pp-number token, we do not represent the value of the number; that was lexed (this is left for later pieces of code to decide).; Additionally, the lexer library has no notion of typedef names vs variable; names: both are returned as identifiers, and the parser is left to decide; whether a specific identifier is a typedef or a variable (tracking this; requires scope information among other things). The parser can do this; translation by replacing tokens returned by the preprocessor with ""Annotation; Tokens"". .. _AnnotationToken:. Annotation Tokens; -----------------. Annotation tokens are tokens that are synthesized by the parser and injected; into the preprocessor's token stream (replacing existing tokens) to record; semantic information found by the parser. For example, if ""``foo``"" is found; to be a typedef, the ""``foo``"" ``tok::identifier`` token is replaced with an; ``tok::annot_typename``.

Given an LLVM opcode name and a benchmarking mode, :program:`llvm-exegesis`; generates a code snippet that makes execution as serial (resp. as parallel) as; possible so that we can measure the latency (resp. inverse throughput/uop decomposition); of the instruction.; The code snippet is jitted and, unless requested not to, executed on the; host subtarget. The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured using; hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML; to the standard output. The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM's TableDef; scheduling models. To that end, we also provide analysis of the results. :program:`llvm-exegesis` can also benchmark arbitrary user-provided code; snippets. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` currently only supports X86 (64-bit only), ARM (AArch64; only), MIPS, and PowerPC (PowerPC64LE only) on Linux for benchmarking. Not all; benchmarking functionality is guaranteed to work on every platform.; :program:`llvm-exegesis` also has a separate analysis mode that is supported; on every platform that LLVM is. SNIPPET ANNOTATIONS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` supports benchmarking arbitrary snippets of assembly.; However, benchmarking these snippets often requires some setup so that they; can execute properly. :program:`llvm-exegesis` has five annotations and some; additional utilities to help with setup so that snippets can be benchmarked; properly. * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <register name>` - Adding this annotation to the text; assembly snippet to be be",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:963,validat,validate,963,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,1,['validat'],['validate']

Security,"lly allocated when the hardware creates work-groups of wavefronts, and; freed when all the wavefronts of a work-group have terminated. The data store; (DS) instructions can be used to access it. The private memory space uses the hardware scratch memory support. If the kernel; uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory that is accessed using; wavefront lane dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping used from private; address to physical address is:. ``wavefront-scratch-base +; (private-address * wavefront-size * 4) +; (wavefront-lane-id * 4)``. There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is determined; by a wavefront (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). This; memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer instruction with; the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch offset, by the scratch; instructions, or by flat instructions. If each lane of a wavefront accesses the; same private address, the interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed; and hence requires fewer cache lines to be fetched. Multi-dword access is not; supported except by flat and scratch instructions in GFX9-GFX11. The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support available in; GFX7-GFX11. This uses two fixed ranges of virtual addresses (the private and; local apertures), that are outside the range of addressible global memory, to; map from a flat address to a private or local address. FLAT instructions can take a flat address and access global, private (scratch); and group (LDS) memory depending on if the address is within one of the; aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and; setup in the kernel prologue (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`). Flat access to LDS requires; hardware aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register setup (see; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`).

Pointers to default address space should get lowered into a pointer to a generic; address space (or flat to reuse more general terminology). But depending on the; allocation context, the default address space of a non-pointer type is assigned; to a specific address space. This is described in; `common address space deduction rules <https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-2020/html/sycl-2020.html#subsec:commonAddressSpace>`_; section.

The most important; thing when choosing a container is the algorithmic properties of how you plan to; access the container. Based on that, you should use:. * a :ref:`map-like <ds_map>` container if you need efficient look-up of a; value based on another value. Map-like containers also support efficient; queries for containment (whether a key is in the map). Map-like containers; generally do not support efficient reverse mapping (values to keys).

In many common situations, ARC knows when an; object is created and when it is destroyed and can ensure that these; operations are performed correctly.

The IR [Intrinsics](#intrinsics) described above map onto these; instructions as such:; * [`llvm.ptrauth.sign`](#llvm-ptrauth-sign): `PAC{I,D}{A,B}{Z,SP,}`; * [`llvm.ptrauth.auth`](#llvm-ptrauth-auth): `AUT{I,D}{A,B}{Z,SP,}`; * [`llvm.ptrauth.strip`](#llvm-ptrauth-strip): `XPAC{I,D}`; * [`llvm.ptrauth.blend`](#llvm-ptrauth-blend): The semantics of the blend; operation are specified by the ABI. In both the ELF PAuth ABI Extension and; arm64e, it's a `MOVK` into the high 16 bits. Consequently, this limits; the width of the integer discriminator used in blends to 16 bits.; * [`llvm.ptrauth.sign_generic`](#llvm-ptrauth-sign-generic): `PACGA`; * [`llvm.ptrauth.resign`](#llvm-ptrauth-resign): `AUT*+PAC*`. These are; represented as a single pseudo-instruction in the backend to guarantee that; the intermediate raw pointer value is not spilled and attackable. #### Assembly Representation. At the assembly level, authenticated relocations are represented; using the `@AUTH` modifier:. ```asm; .quad _target@AUTH(<key>,<discriminator>[,addr]); ```. where:; * `key` is the Armv8.3-A key identifier (`ia`, `ib`, `da`, `db`); * `discriminator` is the 16-bit unsigned discriminator value; * `addr` signifies that the authenticated pointer is address-discriminated; (that is, that the relocation's target address is to be blended into the; `discriminator` before it is used in the sign operation. For example:; ```asm; _authenticated_reference_to_sym:; .quad _sym@AUTH(db,0); _authenticated_reference_to_sym_addr_disc:; .quad _sym@AUTH(ia,12,addr); ```. #### ELF Object File Representation.

Security,"ly degrade also handle; this problem (e.g. GlobalsAA), but they run into the issue of having to be; manually recomputed somewhere in the optimization pipeline if we want precision,; and they block potential future concurrency. The second reason is to keep in mind potential future pass concurrency, for; example parallelizing function passes over different functions in a CGSCC or; module. Since passes can ask for a cached analysis result, allowing passes to; trigger outer level analysis computation could result in non-determinism if; concurrency was supported. A related limitation is that outer level IR analyses; that are used must be immutable, or else they could be invalidated by changes to; inner level IR. Outer analyses unused by inner passes can and often will be; invalidated by changes to inner level IR. These invalidations happen after the; inner pass manager finishes, so accessing mutable analyses would give invalid; results. The exception to not being able to access outer level analyses is accessing; function analyses in loop passes. Loop passes often use function analyses such; as the dominator tree. Loop passes inherently require modifying the function the; loop is in, and that includes some function analyses the loop analyses depend; on. This discounts future concurrency over separate loops in a function, but; that's a tradeoff due to how tightly a loop and its function are coupled. To; make sure the function analyses that loop passes use are valid, they are; manually updated in the loop passes to ensure that invalidation is not; necessary. There is a set of common function analyses that loop passes and; analyses have access to which is passed into loop passes as a; ``LoopStandardAnalysisResults`` parameter. Other mutable function analyses are; not accessible from loop passes. As with any caching mechanism, we need some way to tell analysis managers; when results are no longer valid. Much of the analysis manager complexity; comes from trying to invalidate a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:10566,access,access,10566,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,2,['access'],"['access', 'accessing']"
Security,"ly if buffered writing is turned off.; The parallel writer assumes exclusive access to the underlying file during all operations on the writer (e.g. construction and destruction) and all operations on any created fill context (e.g. `Fill()` and `FlushCluster()`).; Notable exceptions are `FlushColumns()` and `FillNoFlush()` which are guaranteed to never access the underlying `TFile` during parallel writing (which is always buffered). A `TFile` does not take ownership of any `RNTuple` objects. When reading data, RNTuple uses the `RMiniFile` and `RRawFile` classes to open a given storage path and find the `RNTuple` anchor.; When creating a `RNTupleReader` from an existing anchor object, RNTuple uses `RRawFile` only for files of dynamic type `TFile`, `TDavixFile`, and `TNetXNGFile`.; In either case, the `RRawFile` owns its own file descriptor and does not interfere with `TFile` objects concurrently reading the file.; For anchors from files of other dynamic type, including all other `TFile` subclasses, the file is wrapped in a `RRawFileTFile` and access is shared. On-Disk Encoding; ----------------. ### Writing Case; The following steps are taken to write RNTuple data to disk:. 1. On creation of the RNTupleWriter, the header is written to disk; 2. Upon `RNTupleWriter::Fill()`, the RField<T> class _serializes_ the object into its column representation.; To this end, it uses the `RColumn` class to append elements to the columns page buffer (`RPage`); 3. When a page buffer is full (cf. tuning.md), it is sent to the page sink for writing it to disk.; Note that page boundaries do _not_ need to align with entry boundaries,; e.g. information from a single entry can span multiple pages.; 1. The page is _packed_:; depending on the type of the page, a light encoding is applied to facilitate compression, e.g., byte splitting (`RColumnElement`).; Big-endian / little-endian conversion takes place here.; 2. The packed page is _compressed_ according to the user-provided compression set",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md:19098,access,access,19098,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/Architecture.md,1,['access'],['access']

If necessary, one also can automatically open ROOT file when web page is opened:. ```cpp; serv->SetItemField(""/"", ""_loadfile"", ""currentdir/hsimple.root""); // name of ROOT file to load; ```. ## Configuring user access. By default, the http server is open for anonymous access. One could restrict the access to the server for authenticated users only. First of all, one should create a password file, using the **htdigest** utility. ```bash; [shell] htdigest -c .htdigest domain_name user_name; ```. It is recommended not to use special symbols in domain or user names. Several users can be add to the "".htdigest"" file. When starting the server, the following arguments should be specified:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080?auth_file=.htdigest&auth_domain=domain_name"");; ```. After that, the web browser will automatically request to input a name/password for the domain ""domain_name"". Based on authorized accounts, one could restrict or enable access to some elements in the server objects hierarchy, using `THttpServer::Restrict()` method. For instance, one could hide complete folder from 'guest' account:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder"", ""hidden=guest"");; ```. Or one could hide from all but 'admin' account:. ```cpp; serv->Restrict(""/Folder"", ""visible=admin"");; ```.

Target description classes; ==========================. The LLVM target description classes (located in the ``include/llvm/Target``; directory) provide an abstract description of the target machine independent of; any particular client. These classes are designed to capture the *abstract*; properties of the target (such as the instructions and registers it has), and do; not incorporate any particular pieces of code generation algorithms. All of the target description classes (except the :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>` class) are designed to be subclassed by the concrete target; implementation, and have virtual methods implemented. To get to these; implementations, the :raw-html:`<tt>` `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` class; provides accessors that should be implemented by the target. .. _TargetMachine:. The ``TargetMachine`` class; ---------------------------. The ``TargetMachine`` class provides virtual methods that are used to access the; target-specific implementations of the various target description classes via; the ``get*Info`` methods (``getInstrInfo``, ``getRegisterInfo``,; ``getFrameInfo``, etc.). This class is designed to be specialized by a concrete; target implementation (e.g., ``X86TargetMachine``) which implements the various; virtual methods. The only required target description class is the; :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` class, but if the code; generator components are to be used, the other interfaces should be implemented; as well. .. _DataLayout:.

Security,"mary technique is known as ""Bounds Check Bypass Store"" and is discussed; in this research paper: https://people.csail.mit.edu/vlk/spectre11.pdf. We will analyze these two variants independently. First, variant #1.1 works by; speculatively storing over the return address after a bounds check bypass. This; speculative store then ends up being used by the CPU during speculative; execution of the return, potentially directing speculative execution to; arbitrary gadgets in the binary. Let's look at an example.; ```; unsigned char local_buffer[4];; unsigned char *untrusted_data_from_caller = ...;; unsigned long untrusted_size_from_caller = ...;; if (untrusted_size_from_caller < sizeof(local_buffer)) {; // Speculative execution enters here with a too-large size.; memcpy(local_buffer, untrusted_data_from_caller,; untrusted_size_from_caller);; // The stack has now been smashed, writing an attacker-controlled; // address over the return address.; minor_processing(local_buffer);; return;; // Control will speculate to the attacker-written address.; }; ```. However, this can be mitigated by hardening the load of the return address just; like any other load. This is sometimes complicated because x86 for example; *implicitly* loads the return address off the stack. However, the; implementation technique below is specifically designed to mitigate this; implicit load by using the stack pointer to communicate misspeculation between; functions. This additionally causes a misspeculation to have an invalid stack; pointer and never be able to read the speculatively stored return address. See; the detailed discussion below. For variant #1.2, the attacker speculatively stores into the vtable or jump; table used to implement an indirect call or indirect jump. Because this is; speculative, this will often be possible even when these are stored in; read-only pages.

In several cases, the misunderstanding of the interface caused invalid memory accesses to the already destructed; temporary `TString` returned by `GetString()`, e.g. `objStr->GetString().Data()`. This will be fixed automatically by the; new return type. In rare cases, the caller expected `GetString()` to return a (non-const) reference to the embedded `TString`, e.g.; `objString->GetString().ReplaceAll(""a"", ""b""); // WRONG!` This will now fail to compile, instead of not doing what the author of the; code expected.

In practice, there are usually only a small number; of named streams and these are enumerated in the table of streams in :doc:`index`.; A corollary of this is if a stream does have a name (and as such is in the named; stream map) then consulting the Named Stream Map is likely to be the only way to; discover the stream's MSF stream index. Several important streams (such as the; global string table, which is called ``/names``) can only be located this way, and; so it is important to both produce and consume this correctly as tools will not; function correctly without it. .. important::; Some streams are located by fixed indices (e.g TPI Stream has index 2), but; other streams are located by fixed names (e.g. the string table is called; ``/names``) and can only be located by consulting the Named Stream Map. The on-disk layout of the Named Stream Map consists of 2 components. The first is; a buffer of string data prefixed by a 32-bit length. The second is a serialized; hash table whose key and value types are both ``uint32_t``. The key is the offset; of a null-terminated string in the string data buffer specifying the name of the; stream, and the value is the MSF stream index of the stream with said name.; Note that although the key is an integer, the hash function used to find the right; bucket hashes the string at the corresponding offset in the string data buffer.

Developers often disagree, and erring on the side of the; developer asking for more review prevents any lingering disagreement over; code in the tree. This does not indicate any fault from the patch author,; this is inherent to our post-commit review practices.; Reverting a patch ensures that design discussions can happen without blocking; other development; it's entirely possible the patch will end up being reapplied; essentially as-is once concerns have been resolved. Before being recommitted, the patch generally should undergo further review.; The community member who identified the problem is expected to engage; actively in the review. In cases where the problem is identified by a buildbot,; a community member with access to hardware similar to that on the buildbot is; expected to engage in the review. Please note: The bar for post-commit feedback is not higher than for pre-commit; feedback. Don't delay unnecessarily in providing feedback. However, if you see; something after code has been committed about which you would have commented; pre-commit (had you noticed it earlier), please feel free to provide that; feedback at any time.

Precommit workflow for tests; ----------------------------. If the test does not crash, assert, or infinite loop, commit the test with; baseline check-lines first. That is, the test will show a miscompile or; missing optimization. Add a ""TODO"" or ""FIXME"" comment to indicate that; something is expected to change in a test.

Baseline tests (no-functional-change or NFC patch) may be pushed to main; without pre-commit review if you have commit access. Best practices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test. If there; are relevant issues in the bug tracker, add references to those bug reports; (for example, ""See PR999 for more details"").; - Avoid undefined behavior and poison/undef values unless necessary. For; example, do not use patterns like ``br i1 undef``, which are likely to break; as a result of future optimizations.; - Minimize tests by removing unnecessary instructions, metadata, attributes,; etc. Tools like ``llvm-reduce`` can help automate this.; - Outside PhaseOrdering tests, only run a minimal set of passes.

The ``TargetRegisterInfo`` class; --------------------------------. The ``TargetRegisterInfo`` class is used to describe the register file of the; target and any interactions between the registers. Registers are represented in the code generator by unsigned integers. Physical; registers (those that actually exist in the target description) are unique; small numbers, and virtual registers are generally large. Note that; register ``#0`` is reserved as a flag value. Each register in the processor description has an associated; ``TargetRegisterDesc`` entry, which provides a textual name for the register; (used for assembly output and debugging dumps) and a set of aliases (used to; indicate whether one register overlaps with another). In addition to the per-register description, the ``TargetRegisterInfo`` class; exposes a set of processor specific register classes (instances of the; ``TargetRegisterClass`` class). Each register class contains sets of registers; that have the same properties (for example, they are all 32-bit integer; registers). Each SSA virtual register created by the instruction selector has; an associated register class. When the register allocator runs, it replaces; virtual registers with a physical register in the set. The target-specific implementations of these classes is auto-generated from a; :doc:`TableGen/index` description of the register file. .. _TargetInstrInfo:. The ``TargetInstrInfo`` class; -----------------------------. The ``TargetInstrInfo`` class is used to describe the machine instructions; supported by the target.

AMDGPU supports programming languages that include online compilation where the; source text may be created at runtime. For example, the OpenCL and HIP language; runtimes support online compilation. To support is, a way to embed the source; text in the debug information is provided. See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-line-number-information`. 2.17 Allow MD5 Checksums to be Optionally Present; -------------------------------------------------. In DWARF Version 5 the file timestamp and file size can be optional, but if the; MD5 checksum is present it must be valid for all files. This is a problem if; using link time optimization to combine compilation units where some have MD5; checksums and some do not. Therefore, sSupport to allow MD5 checksums to be; optionally present in the line table is added.

Another example is vectorization that can exploit SIMD; hardware to allow a single instruction to execute multiple iterations using; vector registers.

The three different forms of LLVM are; all equivalent. This document describes the human readable; representation and notation. The LLVM representation aims to be light-weight and low-level while; being expressive, typed, and extensible at the same time. It aims to be; a ""universal IR"" of sorts, by being at a low enough level that; high-level ideas may be cleanly mapped to it (similar to how; microprocessors are ""universal IR's"", allowing many source languages to; be mapped to them).

Security,"n bitcasting a pointer value to an arbitrary; pointer type. The types in a GEP serve only to define the parameters for the; underlying integer computation. They need not correspond with the actual type of; the underlying object. Furthermore, loads and stores don't have to use the same types as the type of; the underlying object. Types in this context serve only to specify memory size; and alignment. Beyond that there are merely a hint to the optimizer indicating; how the value will likely be used. Can I cast an object's address to integer and add it to null?; -------------------------------------------------------------. You can compute an address that way, but if you use GEP to do the add, you can't; use that pointer to actually access the object, unless the object is managed; outside of LLVM. The underlying integer computation is sufficiently defined; null has a defined; value --- zero --- and you can add whatever value you want to it. However, it's invalid to access (load from or store to) an LLVM-aware object; with such a pointer. This includes ``GlobalVariables``, ``Allocas``, and objects; pointed to by noalias pointers. If you really need this functionality, you can do the arithmetic with explicit; integer instructions, and use inttoptr to convert the result to an address. Most; of GEP's special aliasing rules do not apply to pointers computed from ptrtoint,; arithmetic, and inttoptr sequences. Can I compute the distance between two objects, and add that value to one address to compute the other address?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. As with arithmetic on null, you can use GEP to compute an address that way, but; you can't use that pointer to actually access the object if you do, unless the; object is managed outside of LLVM.

These classes are designed to capture the *abstract*; properties of the target (such as the instructions and registers it has), and do; not incorporate any particular pieces of code generation algorithms. All of the target description classes (except the :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_; :raw-html:`</tt>` class) are designed to be subclassed by the concrete target; implementation, and have virtual methods implemented. To get to these; implementations, the :raw-html:`<tt>` `TargetMachine`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` class; provides accessors that should be implemented by the target. .. _TargetMachine:. The ``TargetMachine`` class; ---------------------------. The ``TargetMachine`` class provides virtual methods that are used to access the; target-specific implementations of the various target description classes via; the ``get*Info`` methods (``getInstrInfo``, ``getRegisterInfo``,; ``getFrameInfo``, etc.). This class is designed to be specialized by a concrete; target implementation (e.g., ``X86TargetMachine``) which implements the various; virtual methods. The only required target description class is the; :raw-html:`<tt>` `DataLayout`_ :raw-html:`</tt>` class, but if the code; generator components are to be used, the other interfaces should be implemented; as well. .. _DataLayout:. The ``DataLayout`` class; ------------------------. The ``DataLayout`` class is the only required target description class, and it; is the only class that is not extensible (you cannot derive a new class from; it). ``DataLayout`` specifies information about how the target lays out memory; for structures, the alignment requirements for various data types, the size of; pointers in the target, and whether the target is little-endian or; big-endian. .. _TargetLowering:.

Once the; function is finished and validated, we return it. .. code-block:: c++. // Error reading body, remove function.; TheFunction->eraseFromParent();; return nullptr;; }. The only piece left here is handling of the error case. For simplicity,; we handle this by merely deleting the function we produced with the; ``eraseFromParent`` method. This allows the user to redefine a function; that they incorrectly typed in before: if we didn't delete it, it would; live in the symbol table, with a body, preventing future redefinition. This code does have a bug, though: If the ``FunctionAST::codegen()`` method; finds an existing IR Function, it does not validate its signature against the; definition's own prototype. This means that an earlier 'extern' declaration will; take precedence over the function definition's signature, which can cause; codegen to fail, for instance if the function arguments are named differently.; There are a number of ways to fix this bug, see what you can come up with! Here; is a testcase:. ::. extern foo(a); # ok, defines foo.; def foo(b) b; # Error: Unknown variable name. (decl using 'a' takes precedence). Driver Changes and Closing Thoughts; ===================================. For now, code generation to LLVM doesn't really get us much, except that; we can look at the pretty IR calls. The sample code inserts calls to; codegen into the ""``HandleDefinition``"", ""``HandleExtern``"" etc; functions, and then dumps out the LLVM IR.

A transformation should merge instruction locations if it replaces multiple; instructions with a single merged instruction, *and* that merged instruction; does not correspond to any of the original instructions' locations.

You can use the :ref:`-fno-sanitize-trap=; <controlling-code-generation>` flag to cause CFI to print a diagnostic; similar to the one below before the program aborts. .. code-block:: console. bad-cast.cpp:109:7: runtime error: control flow integrity check for type 'B' failed during base-to-derived cast (vtable address 0x000000425a50); 0x000000425a50: note: vtable is of type 'A'; 00 00 00 00 f0 f1 41 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 20 5a 42 00; ^.

This scheme checks that virtual calls take place using a vptr of the correct; dynamic type; that is, the dynamic type of the called object must be a; derived class of the static type of the object used to make the call.; This CFI scheme can be enabled on its own using ``-fsanitize=cfi-vcall``.

""Merger"" accepts two functions *F1* and *F2*, and produces *F1F2*; function, the result of merging. Having such routines in our hands, we can process a whole module, and merge all; equal functions. In this case, we have to compare every function with every another function. As; the reader may notice, this way seems to be quite expensive. Of course we could; introduce hashing and other helpers, but it is still just an optimization, and; thus the level of O(N*N) complexity. Can we reach another level? Could we introduce logarithmical search, or random; access lookup? The answer is: ""yes"". Random-access; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; How it could this be done? Just convert each function to a number, and gather; all of them in a special hash-table. Functions with equal hashes are equal.; Good hashing means, that every function part must be taken into account. That; means we have to convert every function part into some number, and then add it; into the hash. The lookup-up time would be small, but such an approach adds some; delay due to the hashing routine. Logarithmical search; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; We could introduce total ordering among the functions set, once ordered we; could then implement a logarithmical search. Lookup time still depends on N,; but adds a little of delay (*log(N)*). Present state; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; Both of the approaches (random-access and logarithmical) have been implemented; and tested and both give a very good improvement. What was most; surprising is that logarithmical search was faster; sometimes by up to 15%. The; hashing method needs some extra CPU time, which is the main reason why it works; slower; in most cases, total ""hashing"" time is greater than total; ""logarithmical-search"" time. So, preference has been granted to the ""logarithmical search"".

Security,"n the translation unit, the program is ill-formed but; no diagnostic is required. A ``goto`` or ``switch`` is ill-formed if it jumps into the scope of; an object of automatic storage duration whose type is non-trivial to; destroy. C specifies that it is generally undefined behavior to access an l-value; if there is no object of that type at that location. Implementations; are often lenient about this, but non-trivial types generally require; it to be enforced more strictly. The following rules apply:. The *static subobjects* of a type ``T`` at a location ``L`` are:. - an object of type ``T`` spanning from ``L`` to ``L + sizeof(T)``;. - if ``T`` is a struct type, then for each field ``f`` of that struct,; the static subobjects of ``T`` at location ``L + offsetof(T, .f)``; and. - if ``T`` is the array type ``E[N]``, then for each ``i`` satisfying; ``0 <= i < N``, the static subobjects of ``E`` at location; ``L + i * sizeof(E)``. If an l-value is converted to an r-value, then all static subobjects; whose types are non-trivial to copy are accessed. If an l-value is; assigned to, or if an object of automatic storage duration goes out of; scope, then all static subobjects of types that are non-trivial to destroy; are accessed. A dynamic object is created at a location if an initialization initializes; an object of that type there. A dynamic object ceases to exist at a; location if the memory is repurposed. Memory is repurposed if it is; freed or if a different dynamic object is created there, for example by; assigning into a different union member. An implementation may provide; additional rules for what constitutes creating or destroying a dynamic; object. If an object is accessed under these rules at a location where no such; dynamic object exists, the program has undefined behavior.; If memory for a location is repurposed while a dynamic object that is; non-trivial to destroy exists at that location, the program has; undefined behavior. .. admonition:: Rationale.

Enabling All Diagnostics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In addition to the traditional ``-W`` flags, one can enable **all** diagnostics; by passing :option:`-Weverything`. This works as expected with; :option:`-Werror`, and also includes the warnings from :option:`-pedantic`. Some; diagnostics contradict each other, therefore, users of :option:`-Weverything`; often disable many diagnostics such as `-Wno-c++98-compat` and `-Wno-c++-compat`; because they contradict recent C++ standards. Since :option:`-Weverything` enables every diagnostic, we generally don't; recommend using it. `-Wall` `-Wextra` are a better choice for most projects.; Using :option:`-Weverything` means that updating your compiler is more difficult; because you're exposed to experimental diagnostics which might be of lower; quality than the default ones. If you do use :option:`-Weverything` then we; advise that you address all new compiler diagnostics as they get added to Clang,; either by fixing everything they find or explicitly disabling that diagnostic; with its corresponding `Wno-` option.

If you like, you can easily extend the example to also plot the; interference pattern of a single slit, using function `double single`,; or of a grid with narrow slits, function `double nslit0`, in `TF1`; instances. Here, we used a macro, some sort of lightweight program, that the; interpreter distributed with ROOT, Cling, is able to execute. This is a; rather extraordinary situation, since `C++` is not natively an interpreted; language! There is much more to say: chapter is indeed dedicated to; macros. ## Controlling ROOT ##. One more remark at this point: as every command you type into ROOT is; usually interpreted by Cling, an ""escape character"" is needed to pass; commands to ROOT directly. This character is the dot at the beginning of; a line:. ``` {.cpp}; root [1] .<command>; ```. This is a selection of the most common commands. - **quit root**, simply type `.q` or `.quit` or `.exit`. - obtain the full **list of commands**, use `.?` or `.help`. - **access the shell** of the operating system, type `.!<OS_command>`;; try, e.g. `.!ls` or `.!pwd`. - **execute a macro**, enter `.x <file_name>`; in the above example,; you might have used `.x slits.C` at the ROOT prompt. - **load a macro**, type `.L <file_name>`; in the above example, you; might instead have used the command `.L slits.C` followed by the; function call `slits();`. Note that after loading a macro all; functions and procedures defined therein are available at the ROOT; prompt. - **compile a macro**, type `.L <file_name>+`; ROOT is able to manage; for you the `C++` compiler behind the scenes and to produce machine; code starting from your macro. One could decide to compile a macro; in order to obtain better performance or to get nearer to the; production environment. ## Plotting Measurements ##. To display measurements in ROOT, including errors, there exists a; powerful class `TGraphErrors` with different types of constructors. In; the example here, we use data from the file `ExampleData.txt` in ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md:8002,access,access,8002,documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/ROOT_as_calculator.md,1,['access'],['access']

Look at one of your plots again and move the mouse across. You will; notice that this is much more than a static picture, as the mouse; pointer changes its shape when touching objects on the plot. When the; mouse is over an object, a right-click opens a pull-down menu displaying; in the top line the name of the ROOT class you are dealing with, e.g.; `TCanvas` for the display window itself, `TFrame` for the frame of the; plot, `TAxis` for the axes, `TPaveText` for the plot name. Depending on; which plot you are investigating, menus for the ROOT classes `TF1`,; `TGraphErrors` or `TH1F` will show up when a right-click is performed on; the respective graphical representations. The menu items allow direct; access to the members of the various classes, and you can even modify; them, e.g. change colour and size of the axis ticks or labels, the; function lines, marker types and so on.

After generating the input MIR file, you'll have to add a run line that uses; the ``-run-pass`` option to it.

All histogram types support fixed or variable bin sizes. 2-D; histograms may have fixed size bins along X and variable size bins; along Y or vice-versa. The functions to fill, manipulate, draw, or; access histograms are identical in both cases. ### Convention. For all histogram types: `nbins` , `xlow` , `xup`. Bin\# 0 contains the underflow. Bin\# 1 contains the first bin with low-edge ( `xlow` INCLUDED). The second to last bin (bin\# `nbins`) contains the upper-edge; (`xup` EXCLUDED). The Last bin (bin\# `nbins+1)` contains the overflow. In case of 2-D or 3-D histograms, a ""global bin"" number is defined.; For example, assuming a 3-D histogram `h` with `binx`, `biny`, `binz`,; the function returns a global/linear bin number. ``` {.cpp}; Int_t bin = h->GetBin(binx, biny, binz);; ```. This global bin is useful to access the bin information independently; of the dimension. ### Re-binning; \index{histogram!rebin}. At any time, a histogram can be re-binned via the **`TH1`**`::Rebin()`; method. It returns a new histogram with the re-binned contents. If bin; errors were stored, they are recomputed during the re-binning. ## Filling Histograms. A histogram is typically filled with statements like:. ``` {.cpp}; h1->Fill(x);; h1->Fill(x,w); // with weight; h2->Fill(x,y);; h2->Fill(x,y,w);; h3->Fill(x,y,z);; h3->Fill(x,y,z,w);; ```. The `Fill` method computes the bin number corresponding to the given; x, y or z argument and increments this bin by the given weight. The; `Fill()` method returns the bin number for 1-D histograms or global; bin number for 2-D and 3-D histograms. If **`TH1`**`::Sumw2()` has; been called before filling, the sum of squares is also stored. One can; increment a bin number directly by calling; **`TH1`**`::AddBinContent()`, replace the existing content via; **`TH1`**`::SetBinContent()` , and acce",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Histograms.md:6933,access,access,6933,documentation/users-guide/Histograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Histograms.md,1,['access'],['access']

VP (value profile) metadata can be attached to instructions that have; value profile information. Currently this is indirect calls (where it; records the hottest callees) and calls to memory intrinsics such as memcpy,; memmove, and memset (where it records the hottest byte lengths). Each VP metadata node contains ""VP"" string, then a uint32_t value for the value; profiling kind, a uint64_t value for the total number of times the instruction; is executed, followed by uint64_t value and execution count pairs.; The value profiling kind is 0 for indirect call targets and 1 for memory; operations. For indirect call targets, each profile value is a hash; of the callee function name, and for memory operations each value is the; byte length. Note that the value counts do not need to add up to the total count; listed in the third operand (in practice only the top hottest values; are tracked and reported). Indirect call example:. .. code-block:: llvm. call void %f(), !prof !1; !1 = !{!""VP"", i32 0, i64 1600, i64 7651369219802541373, i64 1030, i64 -4377547752858689819, i64 410}.

The following process occurs on the discussion medium for each reported issue:. * A security issue reporter (not necessarily an LLVM contributor) reports an issue.; * Within two business days, a member of the Security Group is put in charge of driving the issue to an acceptable resolution. This champion doesn’t need to be the same person for each issue. This person can self-nominate.; * Members of the Security Group discuss in which circumstances (if any) an issue is relevant to security, and determine if it is a security issue.; * Negotiate an embargo date for public disclosure, with a default minimum time limit of ninety days.; * Security Group members can recommend that key experts be pulled in to specific issue discussions. The key expert can be pulled in unless there are objections from other Security Group members.; * Patches are written and reviewed.; * Backporting security patches from recent versions to old versions cannot always work. It is up to the Security Group to decide if such backporting should be done, and how far back.; * The Security Group figures out how the LLVM project’s own releases, as well as individual vendors’ releases, can be timed to patch the issue simultaneously.; * Embargo date can be delayed or pulled forward at the Security Group’s discretion.; * The issue champion obtains a CVE entry from MITRE_.; * Once the embargo expires, the patch is posted publicly according to LLVM’s usual code review process.; * All security issues (as well as nomination / removal discussions) become public within approximately fourteen weeks of the fix landing in the LLVM repository.

Security,"natural semantics of value propagation, where; all basic operations on the type come down to copies and destroys,; and everything else is just an optimization on top of those. The most glaring weakness of programming with non-trivial types in C; is that there are no language mechanisms (akin to C++'s placement; ``new`` and explicit destructor calls) for explicitly creating and; destroying objects. Clang should consider adding builtins for this; purpose, as well as for common optimizations like destructive; relocation. Application of the formal C rules to nontrivial ownership qualifiers; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Nontrivially ownership-qualified types are considered non-trivial; to copy, destroy, and default-initialize. A dynamic object of nontrivially ownership-qualified type contingently; exists at a location if the memory is filled with a zero pattern, e.g.; by ``calloc`` or ``bzero``. Such an object can be safely accessed in; all of the cases above, but its memory can also be safely repurposed.; Assigning a null pointer into an l-value of ``__weak`` or; ``__strong``-qualified type accesses the dynamic object there (and thus; may have undefined behavior if no such object exists), but afterwards; the object's memory is guaranteed to be filled with a zero pattern; and thus may be either further accessed or repurposed as needed.; The upshot is that programs may safely initialize dynamically-allocated; memory for nontrivially ownership-qualified types by ensuring it is zero-initialized, and they may safely deinitialize memory before; freeing it by storing ``nil`` into any ``__strong`` or ``__weak``; references previously created in that memory.

Security,"nch->Fill();; }; t3->Write("""",TObject::kOverwrite); // save only the new version of; // the tree; }; ```. Adding a branch is often not possible because the tree is in a read-only; file and you do not have permission to save the modified tree with the; new branch. Even if you do have the permission, you risk loosing the; original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification.; Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the; 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the; original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to; a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to; read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these; reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains). We; encourage you to use `TTree::AddFriend` rather than adding a branch; manually. ### TTree::AddFriend. A tree keeps a list of friends. In the context of a tree (or a chain),; friendship means unrestricted access to the friends data. In this way it; is much like adding another branch to the tree without taking the risk; of damaging it. To add a friend to the list, you can use the; `TTree::AddFriend` method. The **`TTree`** (`tree`) below has two; friends (`ft1` and `ft2`) and now has access to the variables; `a,b,c,i,j,k,l` and `m`. ![](pictures/02000101.jpg). The `AddFriend` method has two parameters, the first is the tree name; and the second is the name of the ROOT file where the friend tree is; saved. `AddFriend` automatically opens the friend file. If no file name; is given, the tree called `ft1` is assumed to be in the same file as the; original tree. ``` {.cpp}; tree.AddFriend(""ft1"",""friendfile1.root"");; ```. If the friend tree has the same name as the original tree, you can give; it an alias in the context of the friendship:. ``` {.cpp}; tree.AddFriend(""tree1 = tree"",""friendfile1.root"");; ```. Once the tree has friends, we can use `TTree::Draw` as if the fri",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:52857,access,access,52857,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['access'],['access']

The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method. The second method is preferable - one just inserts in the application regular calls of the THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method, like:. ```cpp; serv->ProcessRequests();; ```. In such case, one can fully disable the timer of the server:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(0, kTRUE);; ```. ## Data access from command shell. The big advantage of the http protocol is that it is not only supported in web browsers, but also in many other applications. One could use http requests to directly access ROOT objects and data members from any kind of scripts. If one starts a server and register an object like for example:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; TNamed* n1 = new TNamed(""obj"", ""title"");; serv->Register(""subfolder"", n1);; ```. One could request a JSON representation of such object with the command:. ```bash; [shell] wget http://localhost:8080/Objects/subfolder/obj/root.json; ```.

The `AliasAnalysis <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasAnalysis.html>`__; class defines the interface that the various alias analysis implementations; should support. This class exports two important enums: ``AliasResult`` and; ``ModRefResult`` which represent the result of an alias query or a mod/ref; query, respectively. The ``AliasAnalysis`` interface exposes information about memory, represented in; several different ways. In particular, memory objects are represented as a; starting address and size, and function calls are represented as the actual; ``call`` or ``invoke`` instructions that performs the call. The; ``AliasAnalysis`` interface also exposes some helper methods which allow you to; get mod/ref information for arbitrary instructions. All ``AliasAnalysis`` interfaces require that in queries involving multiple; values, values which are not :ref:`constants <constants>` are all; defined within the same function. Representation of Pointers; --------------------------. Most importantly, the ``AliasAnalysis`` class provides several methods which are; used to query whether or not two memory objects alias, whether function calls; can modify or read a memory object, etc. For all of these queries, memory; objects are represented as a pair of their starting address (a symbolic LLVM; ``Value*``) and a static size.

A segment override; prefix byte on an instruction causes the instruction's memory access to go to; the specified segment. LLVM address space 0 is the default address space, which; includes the stack, and any unqualified memory accesses in a program. Address; spaces 1-255 are currently reserved for user-defined code.

Other x86 segments; have yet to be allocated address space numbers. While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory. There are no type qualifiers; involved, and these variables can be pointed to with normal pointers and; accessed with normal loads and stores. The ``thread_local`` keyword is; target-independent at the LLVM IR level (though LLVM doesn't yet have; implementations of it for some configurations).

In practice, very few places in the API require the explicit specification of a; ``LLVMContext``, other than the ``Type`` creation/lookup APIs. Because every; ``Type`` carries a reference to its owning context, most other entities can; determine what context they belong to by looking at their own ``Type``. If you; are adding new entities to LLVM IR, please try to maintain this interface; design. .. _jitthreading:. Threads and the JIT; -------------------. LLVM's ""eager"" JIT compiler is safe to use in threaded programs. Multiple; threads can call ``ExecutionEngine::getPointerToFunction()`` or; ``ExecutionEngine::runFunction()`` concurrently, and multiple threads can run; code output by the JIT concurrently. The user must still ensure that only one; thread accesses IR in a given ``LLVMContext`` while another thread might be; modifying it. One way to do that is to always hold the JIT lock while accessing; IR outside the JIT (the JIT *modifies* the IR by adding ``CallbackVH``\ s).; Another way is to only call ``getPointerToFunction()`` from the; ``LLVMContext``'s thread. When the JIT is configured to compile lazily (using; ``ExecutionEngine::DisableLazyCompilation(false)``), there is currently a `race; condition <https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5184>`_ in updating call sites; after a function is lazily-jitted. It's still possible to use the lazy JIT in a; threaded program if you ensure that only one thread at a time can call any; particular lazy stub and that the JIT lock guards any IR access, but we suggest; using only the eager JIT in threaded programs. .. _advanced:.

Security,"nfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths.

Furthermore it also preserves; all floating-point registers (XMMs/YMMs). - On AArch64 the callee preserve all general purpose registers, except X0-X8; and X16-X18.

The access; function generally has an entry block, an exit block and an initialization; block that is run at the first time. The entry and exit blocks can access; a few TLS IR variables, each access will be lowered to a platform-specific; sequence. This calling convention aims to minimize overhead in the caller by; preserving as many registers as possible (all the registers that are; preserved on the fast path, composed of the entry and exit blocks). This calling convention behaves identical to the `C` calling convention on; how arguments and return values are passed, but it uses a different set of; caller/callee-saved registers. Given that each platform has its own lowering sequence, hence its own set; of preserved registers, we can't use the existing `PreserveMost`. - On X86-64 the callee preserves all general purpose registers, except for; RDI and RAX.; ""``tailcc``"" - Tail callable calling convention; This call",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:19944,access,access,19944,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,3,['access'],['access']

It's a separate type so that it can be specialized to; be properly aligned also for the case of small buffer size = 0; - `RVecInlineStorageSize`: calculates the size of the small buffer in `RVec`. ## Memory adoption. We need RVec to be able to act as a view over an existing buffer rather than use its own; to save copies and allocations when reading ROOT data into `RVec`s, e.g. in `RDataFrame`. The feature is exposed via a dedicated constructor: `RVec(pointer, size)`.; `RVec` then switches to its own storage as soon as a resize is requested.; `fCapacity == -1` indicates that we are in ""memory adoption mode"". ## Exception safety guarantees. As per [its docs](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1SmallVector.html), LLVM's; `SmallVector` implementation ""does not attempt to be exception-safe"".; In its current implementation, `RVec` does not attempt to fix that.; This should not be a problem for `RVec`'s usecases (an exception thrown during; construction of an `RVec` typically means there is a bug to fix in the analysis code),; and we expect to be able to revisit the implementation and fix broken behavior if it; ever turns out to be problematic.

Dependency does not propagate through stores of dependent pointer; values because doing so would allow dependency to outlive the; full-expression which produced the original value. For example, the; address of an instance variable could be written to some global; location and then freely accessed during the lifetime of the local,; or a function could return an inner pointer of an object and store; it to a local.

This section describes the interaction of the LLVM APIs with multithreading,; both on the part of client applications, and in the JIT, in the hosted; application. Note that LLVM's support for multithreading is still relatively young. Up; through version 2.5, the execution of threaded hosted applications was; supported, but not threaded client access to the APIs. While this use case is; now supported, clients *must* adhere to the guidelines specified below to ensure; proper operation in multithreaded mode. Note that, on Unix-like platforms, LLVM requires the presence of GCC's atomic; intrinsics in order to support threaded operation. If you need a; multithreading-capable LLVM on a platform without a suitably modern system; compiler, consider compiling LLVM and LLVM-GCC in single-threaded mode, and; using the resultant compiler to build a copy of LLVM with multithreading; support. .. _shutdown:.

On the other hand, the internal M minimizing routines only want to; ""see"" variable parameters without limits, and so they have access only; to the *internal parameter list* which is created from the external list; by the following transformation:. - Squeeze out all parameters that are not variable. - Transform all variable parameters with limits, so that the; transformed parameter can vary without limits. (See the next section; for details concerning this transformation.) Because this; transformation is non-linear, it is recommended to avoid putting; limits on parameters where they are not needed. As an example, suppose that the user has defined the following; parameters:. - Parameter 0, constant. - Parameter 1, freely variable. - Parameter 2, variable with limits. - Parameter 3, constant. - Parameter 4, freely variable.

They are listed in order of strength; each; level includes all the guarantees of the previous level except for; Acquire/Release. (See also `LangRef Ordering <LangRef.html#ordering>`_.). .. _NotAtomic:. NotAtomic; ---------. NotAtomic is the obvious, a load or store which is not atomic. (This isn't; really a level of atomicity, but is listed here for comparison.) This is; essentially a regular load or store. If there is a race on a given memory; location, loads from that location return undef. Relevant standard; This is intended to match shared variables in C/C++, and to be used in any; other context where memory access is necessary, and a race is impossible. (The; precise definition is in `LangRef Memory Model <LangRef.html#memmodel>`_.). Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior. If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute. (Per the C/C++ standards,; volatile does provide some limited guarantees around asynchronous signals, but; atomics are generally a better solution.). Notes for optimizers; Introducing loads to shared variables along a codepath where they would not; otherwise exist is allowed; introducing stores to shared variables is not. See; `Optimization outside atomic`_. Notes for code generation; The one interesting restriction here is that it is not allowed to write to; bytes outside of the bytes relevant to a store. This is mostly relevant to; unaligned stores: it is not allowed in general to convert an unaligned store; into two aligned stores of the same width as",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst:6564,access,accessed,6564,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,1,['access'],['accessed']

Global variables; always define a pointer to their ""content"" type because they describe a; region of memory, and all memory objects in LLVM are accessed through; pointers. Global variables can be marked with ``unnamed_addr`` which indicates; that the address is not significant, only the content. Constants marked; like this can be merged with other constants if they have the same; initializer. Note that a constant with significant address *can* be; merged with a ``unnamed_addr`` constant, the result being a constant; whose address is significant.

Since any strongly; connected component of the graph is a maximal subgraph of all the nodes; that form a cycle, pi-blocks are at most one level deep. In other words,; no pi-blocks are nested inside another pi-block, resulting in a; hierarchical representation that is at most one level deep.

If a global; does not have its address taken, the pass knows that no pointers alias the; global. This pass also keeps track of functions that it knows never access; memory or never read memory.

Instead, it is an arbitrary data value. #### '`llvm.ptrauth.blend`'. ##### Syntax:. ```llvm; declare i64 @llvm.ptrauth.blend(i64 <address discriminator>, i64 <integer discriminator>); ```. ##### Overview:. The '`llvm.ptrauth.blend`' intrinsic blends a pointer address discriminator; with a small integer discriminator to produce a new ""blended"" discriminator. ##### Arguments:. The `address discriminator` argument is a pointer value.; The `integer discriminator` argument is a small integer, as specified by the; target. ##### Semantics:. The '`llvm.ptrauth.blend`' intrinsic combines a small integer discriminator; with a pointer address discriminator, in a way that is specified by the target; implementation. ### Operand Bundle. Function pointers used as indirect call targets can be signed when materialized,; and authenticated before calls. This can be accomplished with the; [`llvm.ptrauth.auth`](#llvm-ptrauth-auth) intrinsic, feeding its result to; an indirect call. However, that exposes the intermediate, unauthenticated pointer, e.g., if it; gets spilled to the stack. An attacker can then overwrite the pointer in; memory, negating the security benefit provided by pointer authentication.; To prevent that, the `ptrauth` operand bundle may be used: it guarantees that; the intermediate call target is kept in a register and never stored to memory.; This hardening benefit is similar to that provided by; [`llvm.ptrauth.resign`](#llvm-ptrauth-resign)). Concretely:. ```llvm; define void @f(void ()* %fp) {; call void %fp() [ ""ptrauth""(i32 <key>, i64 <data>) ]; ret void; }; ```. is functionally equivalent to:. ```llvm; define void @f(void ()* %fp) {; %fp_i = ptrtoint void ()* %fp to i64; %fp_auth = call i64 @llvm.ptrauth.auth(i64 %fp_i, i32 <key>, i64 <data>); %fp_auth_p = ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PointerAuth.md:6511,authenticat,authenticated,6511,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PointerAuth.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PointerAuth.md,1,['authenticat'],['authenticated']

Because this; attribute may not be supported by other compilers, it is recommended to use it; together with ``__has_feature(coverage_sanitizer)``. Disabling instrumentation without source modification; =====================================================. It is sometimes useful to tell SanitizerCoverage to instrument only a subset of the; functions in your target without modifying source files.; With ``-fsanitize-coverage-allowlist=allowlist.txt``; and ``-fsanitize-coverage-ignorelist=blocklist.txt``,; you can specify such a subset through the combination of an allowlist and a blocklist. SanitizerCoverage will only instrument functions that satisfy two conditions.; First, the function should belong to a source file with a path that is both allowlisted; and not blocklisted.; Second, the function should have a mangled name that is both allowlisted and not blocklisted. The allowlist and blocklist format is similar to that of the sanitizer blocklist format.; The default allowlist will match every source file and every function.; The default blocklist will match no source file and no function. A common use case is to have the allowlist list folders or source files for which you want; instrumentation and allow all function names, while the blocklist will opt out some specific; files or functions that the allowlist loosely allowed. Here is an example allowlist:. .. code-block:: none. # Enable instrumentation for a whole folder; src:bar/*; # Enable instrumentation for a specific source file; src:foo/a.cpp; # Enable instrumentation for all functions in those files; fun:*. And an example blocklist:. .. code-block:: none. # Disable instrumentation for a specific source file that the allowlist allowed; src:bar/b.cpp; # Disable instrumentation for a specific function that the allowlist allowed; fun:*myFunc*.

ROOT has a set of global variables that apply to the session. For; example,; ***`gDirectory`*** always holds the current directory, and; ***`gStyle`*** holds the current style. All global variables begin with ""*g*"" followed by a capital letter. ### gROOT. The single instance of **`TROOT`** is accessible via the global; ***`gROOT`*** and holds information relative to the current session.; By using the ***`gROOT`*** pointer, you get the access to every object; created in a ROOT program. The **`TROOT`** object has several lists; pointing to the main ROOT objects. During a ROOT session, the; ***`gROOT`*** keeps a series of collections to manage objects. They; can be accessed via ***`gROOT`***`::GetListOf...` methods. ``` {.cpp}; gROOT->GetListOfClasses(); gROOT->GetListOfColors(); gROOT->GetListOfTypes(); gROOT->GetListOfGlobals(); gROOT->GetListOfGlobalFunctions(); gROOT->GetListOfFiles(); gROOT->GetListOfMappedFiles(); gROOT->GetListOfSockets(); gROOT->GetListOfCanvases(); gROOT->GetListOfStyles(); gROOT->GetListOfFunctions(); gROOT->GetListOfSpecials(); gROOT->GetListOfGeometries(); gROOT->GetListOfBrowsers(); gROOT->GetListOfMessageHandlers(); ```. These methods return a **`TSeqCollection`**, meaning a collection of; objects, and they can be used to do list operations such as finding an; object, or traversing the list and calling a method for each of the; members. See the **`TCollection`** class description for the full set; of methods supported for a collection.

Furthermore, because of this approach,; \<`tab`\>-completion will usually not be available until after the first; use (and hence creation) of a class. Access to class static functions, public data members, enums, etc. is as; expected. Many more example uses of ROOT classes from Python can be; found in the tutorials directory in the ROOT distribution. The recipes; section contains a description on working with your own classes (see; ""Using Your Own Classes""). #### Access to STL Classes. The STL classes live in the ROOT.std namespace (or, if you prefer to get; them from there, in the ROOT module directly, but doing so makes the; code less clear, of course). Be careful in their use, because Python; already has types called ""`string`"" and ""`list`."". In order to understand how to get access to a templated class, think of; the general template as a meta class. By instantiating the meta class; with the proper parameters, you get an actual class, which can then be; used to create object instances. An example usage:. ``` {.cpp}; >>> from ROOT import std; >>> v = std.vector(int)(); >>> for i in range(0,10):; ... v.push_back(i); ...; >>> for i in v:; ... print(i, end=' '); 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; >>>; >>> list(v); [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; >>>; ```. The parameters to the template instantiation can either be an actual; type or value (as is used here, ""int""), or a string representation of; the parameters (e.g. ""'double'""), or a mixture of both (e.g. ""'TCanvas,; 0'"" or ""'double', 0"" ).

A set of miscellaneous elementary mathematical functions is provided along with a set of basic trigonometrical functions. Some of this functions refer to basic mathematical functions like the square root, the power to a number of the calculus of a logarithm, while others are used for number treatment, like rounding. Although there are some functions that are not in the standard C math library (like `Factorial`), most of the functionality offered here is just a wrapper of the first ones. Nevertheless, some of the them also offer some security checks or a better precision, like the trigonometrical functions `ASin(x)`, `ACos(x)` or `ATan(x)`. ```{.cpp}; // Generate a vector with 10 random numbers; vector<double> v(10);; std::generate(v.begin(), v.end(), rand);. // Find the minimum value of the vector (iterator version); vector<double>::iterator it;; it = TMath::LocMin(v.begin(), v.end());; std::cout << *it << std::endl;. // The same with the old-style version; int i;; i = TMath::LocMin(10, &v[0]);; std::cout << v[i] << std::endl;; ```. Another example of these functions can be found in $ROOTSYS/tutorials/permute.C. ### Statistic Functions Operating on Arrays.

This will cause a fuzzer to treat; two similar inputs as significantly different and it will blow up the test corpus.; E.g. libxml uses ``rand()`` inside its hash table.; - The target code uses checksums to protect from invalid inputs.; E.g. png checks CRC for every chunk. In many cases it makes sense to build a special fuzzing-friendly build; with certain fuzzing-unfriendly features disabled.

Having a list of the headers that are part of the ``std`` module allows the compiler to build the ``std`` module as a standalone entity, and having the mapping from header names to (sub)modules allows the automatic translation of ``#include`` directives to module imports. Module maps are specified as separate files (each named ``module.modulemap``) alongside the headers they describe, which allows them to be added to existing software libraries without having to change the library headers themselves (in most cases [#]_). The actual `Module map language`_ is described in a later section. .. note::. To actually see any benefits from modules, one first has to introduce module maps for the underlying C standard library and the libraries and headers on which it depends. The section `Modularizing a Platform`_ describes the steps one must take to write these module maps. One can use module maps without modules to check the integrity of the use of header files. To do this, use the ``-fimplicit-module-maps`` option instead of the ``-fmodules`` option, or use ``-fmodule-map-file=`` option to explicitly specify the module map files to load. Compilation model; -----------------; The binary representation of modules is automatically generated by the compiler on an as-needed basis. When a module is imported (e.g., by an ``#include`` of one of the module's headers), the compiler will spawn a second instance of itself [#]_, with a fresh preprocessing context [#]_, to parse just the headers in that module. The resulting Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is then persisted into the binary representation of the module that is then loaded into translation unit where the module import was encountered. The binary representation of modules is persisted in the *module cache*. Imports of a module will first query the module cache and, if a binary representation of the required module is already available, will load that r",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:12885,integrity,integrity,12885,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['integrity'],['integrity']

By default, ``MemorySSA`` provides a walker that can optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s; and ``MemoryUse``\ s by consulting whatever alias analysis stack you happen to; be using. Walkers were built to be flexible, though, so it's entirely reasonable; (and expected) to create more specialized walkers (e.g. one that specifically; queries ``GlobalsAA``, one that always stops at ``MemoryPhi`` nodes, etc). Default walker APIs; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are two main APIs used to retrieve the clobbering access using the walker:. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA);`` return the; clobbering memory access for ``MA``, caching all intermediate results; computed along the way as part of each access queried. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA, const MemoryLocation &Loc);``; returns the access clobbering memory location ``Loc``, starting at ``MA``.; Because this API does not request the clobbering access of a specific memory; access, there are no results that can be cached. Locating clobbers yourself; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you choose to make your own walker, you can find the clobber for a; ``MemoryAccess`` by walking every ``MemoryDef`` that dominates said; ``MemoryAccess``. The structure of ``MemoryDef``\ s makes this relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize.

The exception is; ``DW_CFA_val_offset`` which uses the address to set the value of a register. In; order to support address spaces, the CFA DWARF expression is defined to be a; memory location description. This allows it to specify an address space which is; used to convert the offset address back to an address in that address space. See; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`. This approach of extending memory location descriptions to support address; spaces, allows all existing DWARF Version 5 expressions to have the identical; semantics. It allows the compiler to explicitly specify the address space it is; using. For example, a compiler could choose to access private memory in a; swizzled manner when mapping a source language thread to the lane of a wavefront; in a SIMT manner. Or a compiler could choose to access it in an unswizzled; manner if mapping the same language with the wavefront being the thread. It also allows the compiler to mix the address space it uses to access private; memory. For example, for SIMT it can still spill entire vector registers in an; unswizzled manner, while using a swizzled private memory for SIMT variable; access. This approach also allows memory location descriptions for different address; spaces to be combined using the regular ``DW_OP_*piece`` operations. Location descriptions are an abstraction of storage. They give freedom to the; consumer on how to implement them. They allow the address space to encode lane; information so they can be used to read memory with only the memory location; description and no extra information. The same set of operations can operate on; locations independent of their kind of storage. The ``DW_OP_deref*`` therefore; can be used on any storage kind, including memory location descriptions of; different address spaces.

The debugger lets developer inspect Objective C interfaces and their instance; variables and class variables.

This proposal describes DWARF extensions to; encode Objective C properties, which the debugger can use to let developers; inspect Objective C properties. Proposal; ^^^^^^^^. Objective C properties exist separately from class members. A property can be; defined only by ""setter"" and ""getter"" selectors, and be calculated anew on each; access. Or a property can just be a direct access to some declared ivar.; Finally it can have an ivar ""automatically synthesized"" for it by the compiler,; in which case the property can be referred to in user code directly using the; standard C dereference syntax",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:49440,access,accessor,49440,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['access'],['accessor']

The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method. The second method is preferable - one just inserts in the application regular calls of the THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method, like:. ```cpp; serv->ProcessRequests();; ```. In such case, one can fully disable the timer of the server:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(0, kTRUE);; ```. ## Data access from command shell. The big advantage of the http protocol is that it is not only supported in web browsers, but also in many other applications. One could use http requests to directly access ROOT objects and data members from any kind of scripts. If one starts a server and register an object like for example:. ```cpp; auto serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; TNamed* n1 = new TNamed(""obj"", ""title"");; serv->Register(""subfolder"", n1);; ```.

You can use ``-fsanitize=cfi`` to enable all the schemes and use; ``-fno-sanitize`` flag to narrow down the set of schemes as desired.; For example, you can build your program with; ``-fsanitize=cfi -fno-sanitize=cfi-nvcall,cfi-icall``; to use all schemes except for non-virtual member function call and indirect call; checking.

Security,"ode Insertion:. Prolog/Epilog Code Insertion; ----------------------------. .. note::. To Be Written. Compact Unwind; --------------. Throwing an exception requires *unwinding* out of a function. The information on; how to unwind a given function is traditionally expressed in DWARF unwind; (a.k.a. frame) info. But that format was originally developed for debuggers to; backtrace, and each Frame Description Entry (FDE) requires ~20-30 bytes per; function. There is also the cost of mapping from an address in a function to the; corresponding FDE at runtime. An alternative unwind encoding is called *compact; unwind* and requires just 4-bytes per function. The compact unwind encoding is a 32-bit value, which is encoded in an; architecture-specific way. It specifies which registers to restore and from; where, and how to unwind out of the function. When the linker creates a final; linked image, it will create a ``__TEXT,__unwind_info`` section. This section is; a small and fast way for the runtime to access unwind info for any given; function. If we emit compact unwind info for the function, that compact unwind; info will be encoded in the ``__TEXT,__unwind_info`` section. If we emit DWARF; unwind info, the ``__TEXT,__unwind_info`` section will contain the offset of the; FDE in the ``__TEXT,__eh_frame`` section in the final linked image. For X86, there are three modes for the compact unwind encoding:. *Function with a Frame Pointer (``EBP`` or ``RBP``)*; ``EBP/RBP``-based frame, where ``EBP/RBP`` is pushed onto the stack; immediately after the return address, then ``ESP/RSP`` is moved to; ``EBP/RBP``. Thus to unwind, ``ESP/RSP`` is restored with the current; ``EBP/RBP`` value, then ``EBP/RBP`` is restored by popping the stack, and the; return is done by popping the stack once more into the PC. All non-volatile; registers that need to be restored must have been saved in a small range on; the stack that starts ``EBP-4`` to ``EBP-1020`` (``RBP-8`` to; ``RBP-1020``).

""Merger"" accepts two functions *F1* and *F2*, and produces *F1F2*; function, the result of merging. Having such routines in our hands, we can process a whole module, and merge all; equal functions. In this case, we have to compare every function with every another function. As; the reader may notice, this way seems to be quite expensive. Of course we could; introduce hashing and other helpers, but it is still just an optimization, and; thus the level of O(N*N) complexity. Can we reach another level? Could we introduce logarithmical search, or random; access lookup? The answer is: ""yes"". Random-access; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; How it could this be done? Just convert each function to a number, and gather; all of them in a special hash-table. Functions with equal hashes are equal.; Good hashing means, that every function part must be taken into account.

The other supported categories are ``discard``, ``functional``; and ``custom``. * ``discard`` -- To the extent that this function writes to (user-accessible); memory, it also updates labels in shadow memory (this condition is trivially; satisfied for functions which do not write to user-accessible memory).

Security,"oming from: if control flow comes; from the cond\_false block, X.2 gets the value of X.1. Alternatively, if; control flow comes from cond\_true, it gets the value of X.0. The intent; of this chapter is not to explain the details of SSA form. For more; information, see one of the many `online; references <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_. The question for this article is ""who places the phi nodes when lowering; assignments to mutable variables?"". The issue here is that LLVM; *requires* that its IR be in SSA form: there is no ""non-ssa"" mode for; it. However, SSA construction requires non-trivial algorithms and data; structures, so it is inconvenient and wasteful for every front-end to; have to reproduce this logic. Memory in LLVM; ==============. The 'trick' here is that while LLVM does require all register values to; be in SSA form, it does not require (or permit) memory objects to be in; SSA form. In the example above, note that the loads from G and H are; direct accesses to G and H: they are not renamed or versioned. This; differs from some other compiler systems, which do try to version memory; objects. In LLVM, instead of encoding dataflow analysis of memory into; the LLVM IR, it is handled with `Analysis; Passes <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ which are computed on demand. With this in mind, the high-level idea is that we want to make a stack; variable (which lives in memory, because it is on the stack) for each; mutable object in a function. To take advantage of this trick, we need; to talk about how LLVM represents stack variables. In LLVM, all memory accesses are explicit with load/store instructions,; and it is carefully designed not to have (or need) an ""address-of""; operator. Notice how the type of the @G/@H global variables is actually; ""i32\*"" even though the variable is defined as ""i32"". What this means is; that @G defines *space* for an i32 in the global data area, but its; *name* actually refers to the address for that spa",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst:3740,access,accesses,3740,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl07.rst,1,['access'],['accesses']

When a new issue is filed, a template is provided to help issue reporters provide all relevant information. *FUTURE*: The `Github security`_ workflow allows publicly disclosing resolved security issues on the github project page, and we would be interested in adopting it for that purpose. However, it does not easily allow confidential reporting of security issues, as creating Github Security Advisories is currently restricted to Github project admins. That is why we have started with the `chromium issue tracker`_ instead. We also occasionally need to discuss logistics of the LLVM Security Group itself:. * Nominate new members.; * Propose member removal.; * Suggest policy changes. We often have these discussions publicly, in our :ref:`monthly public sync-up call <online-sync-ups>` and on the Discourse forums. For internal or confidential discussions, we also use a private mailing list. Process; =======. The following process occurs on the discussion medium for each reported issue:. * A security issue reporter (not necessarily an LLVM contributor) reports an issue.; * Within two business days, a member of the Security Group is put in charge of driving the issue to an acceptable resolution. This champion doesn’t need to be the same person for each issue. This person can self-nominate.; * Members of the Security Group discuss in which circumstances (if a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst:11454,confidential,confidential,11454,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Security.rst,2,"['confidential', 'secur']","['confidential', 'security']"

For example with the following input the `ls` command is also; executed after the contents of `/etc/shadow` is printed.; `Input: /etc/shadow ; ls /`. The analysis implemented in this checker points out this problem. One can protect against such attack by for example checking if the provided; input refers to a valid file and removing any invalid user input. .. code-block:: c. // No vulnerability anymore, but we still get the warning; void sanitizeFileName(char* filename){; if (access(filename,F_OK)){// Verifying user input; printf(""File does not exist\n"");; filename[0]='\0';; }; }; int main(int argc, char** argv) {; char cmd[2048] = ""/bin/cat "";; char filename[1024];; printf(""Filename:"");; scanf ("" %1023[^\n]"", filename); // The attacker can inject a shell escape here; sanitizeFileName(filename);// filename is safe after this point; if (!filename[0]); return -1;; strcat(cmd, filename);; system(cmd); // Superfluous Warning: Untrusted data is passed to a system call; }.

The page source also gives access to an `RNTupleDescriptor` through a read/write lock guard.; The `RNTupleDescriptor` owned by the page source changes only when new cluster meta-data are loaded.; The header and the cluster group summary information is stable throughout its lifetime (cf. format specification). ### R{NTuple,Field,Column,Cluster,...}Descriptor; The descriptor classes provide read-only access to the on-disk meta-data of an RNTuple.; The meta-data include the schema (fields and columns), information about clusters and the page locations.; The descriptor classes are closely related to the format specification. For normal read and write tasks, access to the descriptor is not necessary.; One notable exception is bulk reading, where the descriptor can be used to determine entry boundaries of clusters.; The descriptors are used internally, e.g. to build an RNTupleModel from the on-disk information.; The descriptors are also useful for inspection purposes. The descriptor classes contain a copy of the meta-data; they are not linked to an open page source.; A descriptor can be used after its originating page source has been deleted. ### RField<T>; The RField<T> classes are central in RNTuple:; they link the in-memory representation of data types to their on-disk representation.; All field classes inherit from `RFieldBase`.

Security,"on](https://lwn.net/Articles/744287/) so far focuses on mitigating; specific known attackable components in the Linux kernel (or other kernels) by; manually rewriting the code to contain an instruction sequence that is not; vulnerable. For x86 systems this is done by either injecting an `lfence`; instruction along the code path which would leak data if executed speculatively; or by rewriting memory accesses to have branch-less masking to a known safe; region. On Intel systems, `lfence` [will prevent the speculative load of secret; data](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/Intel-Analysis-of-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channels.pdf).; On AMD systems `lfence` is currently a no-op, but can be made; dispatch-serializing by setting an MSR, and thus preclude misspeculation of the; code path ([mitigation G-2 +; V1-1](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Managing-Speculation-on-AMD-Processors.pdf)). However, this relies on finding and enumerating all possible points in code; which could be attacked to leak information. While in some cases static; analysis is effective at doing this at scale, in many cases it still relies on; human judgement to evaluate whether code might be vulnerable. Especially for; software systems which receive less detailed scrutiny but remain sensitive to; these attacks, this seems like an impractical security model. We need an; automatic and systematic mitigation strategy. ### Automatic `lfence` on Conditional Edges. A natural way to scale up the existing hand-coded mitigations is simply to; inject an `lfence` instruction into both the target and fallthrough; destinations of every conditional branch. This ensures that no predicate or; bounds check can be bypassed speculatively. However, the performance overhead; of this approach is, simply put, catastrophic. Yet it remains the only truly; ""secure by default"" approach known prior to this effort and serves as the; baseline for performance.

In older versions of RooFit, the objects held by *e.g.* `RooRealProxy` had to be; accessed like this:; RooAbsArg* absArg = realProxy.absArg();; RooAbsPdf* pdf = dynamic_cast<RooAbsPdf*>(absArg);; assert(pdf); // This *should* work, but the proxy doesn't have a way to check; pdf->fitTo(...);; That is, a `RooRealProxy` stores a pointer to a RooAbsArg, and this pointer has to be cast. There was no type; safety, *i.e.*, any object deriving from RooAbsArg could be stored in that proxy, and the user had to take care; of ensuring that types are correct.; Now, if one uses; RooTemplateProxy<RooAbsPdf> pdfProxy;; instead of; RooRealProxy realProxy;; in RooFit classes, the above code can be simplified to; pdfProxy->fitTo(...);. Check the [doxygen reference guide](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooTemplateProxy.html) for `RooTemplateProxy` for; more information on how to modernise old code. ### HistFactory. #### Switch default statistical MC errors to Poisson; When defining HistFactory samples with statistical errors from C++, e.g.; Sample background1( ""background1"", ""background1"", I",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md:4340,access,accessed,4340,README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,1,['access'],['accessed']

It is always visible, having a; scroll bar when the displayed area is not enough to show all items. The; choices may be mutually exclusive (a list box with single selection) or; not mutually exclusive (a list box with multiple selection). ![](pictures/02000219.jpg). The proper usage of the list boxes is for selecting values, or objects,; or setting attributes. You have to create them to display 4 to 8 choices; at one time (3 is a required minimum in case of lack of screen space).; The list should contain not more than 40 items accessible by scrolling; view (vertical scroll bar). If more are required, you should provide a; method for using search criteria or scoping the options. The best list; boxes use is for textual data or choices. They should be wide enough to; display fully all items. When it is not possible, break the long items; with ellipsis and provide tool tip that displays the full item text. The list box widget is represented by **`TGListBox`**,; **`TGLBContainer`**, **`TGLBEntry`** and **`TGTextLBEntry`** classes.; Currently entries are simple text strings (**`TGTextLBEntry`**). A; **`TGListBox`** looks a lot like a **`TGCanvas`**. It has a; **`TGViewPort`** containing a **`TGLBContainer`** which contains the; entries and it also has a vertical scrollbar which becomes visible if; there are more items than fit in the visible part of the container.

For this purpose, the header is; checksummed and corruption of the header will be detected when said header is; accessed (note that if the corrupted header is not accessed, the corruption; will remain undetected). The following information is stored in the header:. - the class ID for that chunk, which identifies the region where the chunk; resides for Primary backed allocations, or 0 for Secondary backed allocations;. - the state of the chunk (available, allocated or quarantined);. - the allocation type (malloc, new, new[] or memalign), to detect potential; mismatches in the allocation APIs used;. - the size (Primary) or unused bytes amount (Secondary) for that chunk, which is; necessary for reallocation or sized-deallocation operations;. - the offset of the chunk, which is the distance in bytes from the beginning of; the returned chunk to the beginning of the backend allocation (the ""block"");. - the 16-bit checksum;. This header fits within 8 bytes on all platforms supported, and contributes to a; small overhead for each allocation. The checksum is computed using a CRC32 (made faster with hardware support); of the global secret, the chunk pointer itself, and the 8 bytes of header with; the checksum field zeroed out. It is not intended to be cryptographically; strong. The header is atomically loaded and stored to prevent races. This is important; as two consecutive chunks could belong to different threads.

Object Loading; ==============. Once an object image has been obtained, either through code generation or; having been retrieved from an ObjectCache, it is passed to RuntimeDyld to; be loaded. The RuntimeDyld wrapper class examines the object to determine; its file format and creates an instance of either RuntimeDyldELF or; RuntimeDyldMachO (both of which derive from the RuntimeDyldImpl base; class) and calls the RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject method to perform that; actual loading. .. image:: MCJIT-dyld-load.png. RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject begins by creating an ObjectImage instance; from the ObjectBuffer it received. ObjectImage, which wraps the; ObjectFile class, is a helper class which parses the binary object image; and provides access to the information contained in the format-specific; headers, including section, symbol and relocation information. RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject then iterates through the symbols in the; image. Information about common symbols is collected for later use. For; each function or data symbol, the associated section is loaded into memory; and the symbol is stored in a symbol table map data structure. When the; iteration is complete, a section is emitted for the common symbols. Next, RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject iterates through the sections in the; object image and for each section iterates through the relocations for; that sections. For each relocation, it calls the format-specific; processRelocationRef method, which will examine the relocation and store; it in one of two data structures, a section-based relocation list map and; an external symbol relocation map. .. image:: MCJIT-load-object.png.

Basic Blocks; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. Concretely, an instance of ``CFG`` is a collection of basic blocks. Each basic; block is an instance of ``CFGBlock``, which simply contains an ordered sequence; of ``Stmt*`` (each referring to statements in the AST). The ordering of; statements within a block indicates unconditional flow of control from one; statement to the next. :ref:`Conditional control-flow; <ConditionalControlFlow>` is represented using edges between basic blocks. The; statements within a given ``CFGBlock`` can be traversed using the; ``CFGBlock::*iterator`` interface.

In Clang's AST file format, deserializing a declaration that is a; ``DeclContext`` is a separate operation from deserializing all of the; declarations stored within that declaration context. Therefore, Clang will; deserialize the translation unit declaration without deserializing the; declarations within that translation unit. When required, the declarations; stored within a declaration context will be deserialized. There are two; representations of the declarations within a declaration context, which; correspond to the name-lookup and iteration behavior described above:. * When the front end performs name lookup to find a name ``x`` within a given; declaration context (for example, during semantic analysis of the expression; ``p->x``, where ``p``'s type is defined in the precompiled header), Clang; refers to an on-disk hash table that maps from the names within that; declaration context to the declaration IDs that represent each visible; declaration with that name. The actual declarations will then be; deserialized to provide the results of name lookup.; * When the front end performs iteration over all of the declarations within a; declaration context, all of those declarations are immediately; de-serialized.

Then, when the item is clicked by the user, the command ends-up in a gROOT->ProcessLineSync() call. ##### Custom Properties ; Custom properties can be configured for any item in the server. For example, one could configure an icon for each item visible in the browser. Or one could 'hide' any item from the user (but keep access with normal http requests). With such properties one could specify which item is drawn when web page is loaded, or configure monitoring. See tutorials/http/httpcontrol.C macro for more details. ##### Method Calls; Implement exe.json requests to be able to execute any method of registered objects. This request is used to provide remote TTree::Draw() functionality. ##### Misc; Correctly set 'Cache-Control' headers when replying to http requests.; Better support of STL containers when converting objects into json with TBufferJSON class. ## JavaScript ROOT. - Several files can now be loaded simultaneously; - Use d3.time.scale to display time scales; - Implemented drag and drop to superimpose histograms or graphs; - Allow selection of drawing option via context menu; - Better support of touch devices; - Provide simple layout, making it default; - Allow to open ROOT files in online session (via url parameter); - One could monitor simultaneously objects from server and root f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md:9811,access,access,9811,README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v604/index.md,1,['access'],['access']

Check the address; sanitizer documentation or the link below for details. In clang, which allows to blacklist functions, the build will continue. See [core/sanitizer](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/core/sanitizer) for information. ### Optimization of ROOT header files. Many (but intentionally not all) unused includes were removed from ROOT header files. For instance, `#include ""TObjString.h""` and; `#include ""ThreadLocalStorage.h""` were removed from `TClass.h`. Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from; `TDirectory.h` header file . Or `#include ""TDatime.h""` was removed from `TFile.h`.; This change may cause errors during compilation of ROOT-based code. To fix it, provide missing the includes; where they are really required.; This improves compile times and reduces code inter-dependency; see https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/master/docs/WhyIWYU.md for a good overview of the motivation.

Security,"operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. Two register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the index if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi,%rcx), %edi; ```. This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it.

The data store; (DS) instructions can be used to access it. The private memory space uses the hardware scratch memory support. If the kernel; uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory that is accessed using; wavefront lane dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping used from private; address to physical address is:. ``wavefront-scratch-base +; (private-address * wavefront-size * 4) +; (wavefront-lane-id * 4)``. There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is determined; by a wavefront (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`).

Finalized allocations (represented by ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects) can be; deallocated by calling the ``JITLinkMemoryManager::dealloc`` method. This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process. JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process. JITLinkMemoryManager and Security; ---------------------------------. JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:30829,secur,security,30829,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,1,['secur'],['security']

This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``. This API will cache information; as part of ``MA``.; Optimizing all ``MemoryDef``\ s has quadratic time complexity and is not done; by default. A walk of the uses for any MemoryDef can find the accesses that were optimized; to it.; A code snippet for such a walk looks like this:. .. code-block:: c++. MemoryDef *Def; // find who's optimized or defining for this MemoryDef; for (auto& U : Def->uses()) {; MemoryAccess *MA = cast<MemoryAccess>(Use.getUser());; if (auto *DefUser = cast_of_null<MemoryDef>MA); if (DefUser->isOptimized() && DefUser->getOptimized() == Def) {; // User who is optimized to Def; } else {; // User who's defining access is Def; optimized to something else or not optimized.; }; }.

As you see the parameter's value is preceded by the equation symbol (=).; Please note that this method of passing arguments by value works only; if the signal has less arguments than the slot.; If the signal method has the same number of arguments, then the slot; argument will be overwritten with the signal argument. In the; example below, the Draw option would be overwritten in the first line; by the emitted signal argument. The second line would be ok, the; argument passed by value would not be overwritten. ``` {.cpp}; Connect(myComboBox, ""Selected(const char*)"", ""TTree"", myTree, ""Draw(=\""x\"")"");; Connect(myComboBox, ""Selected(const char*)"", ""TTree"", myTree, ""Draw(const char*, =\"" y==1 \"")"");; ```. In addition, if the signal and slot arguments differ in argument type,; passing arguments by value leads to undefined behaviour and illegal; memory access, as the signal argument will be casted to another data; type. In the example below, if Selected emits Int_t = 1, then ChangeText; will try to read a TString at address 0x1. ``` {.cpp}; Connect(myComboBox, ""Selected(Int_t)"", ""TGTextButton"", myButton, ""ChangeText(=\""Hello\"")"");; ```.

Note that some of the methods mentioned above only exist to support both typed; and opaque pointers at the same time, and will be dropped once the migration; has completed. For example, ``isOpaqueOrPointeeTypeEquals()`` becomes; meaningless once all pointers are opaque. While direct usage of pointer element types is immediately apparent in code,; there is a more subtle issue that opaque pointers need to contend with: A lot; of code assumes that pointer equality also implies that the used load/store; type or GEP source element type is the same. Consider the following examples; with typed and opaque pointers:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32* %p) {; store i32 0, i32* %p; %bc = bitcast i32* %p to i64*; %v = load i64, i64* %bc; ret i64 %v; }. define i32 @test(ptr %p) {; store i32 0, ptr %p; %v = load i64, ptr %p; ret i64 %v; }. Without opaque pointers, a check that the pointer operand of the load and; store are the same also ensures that the accessed type is the same. Using a; different type requires a bitcast, which will result in distinct pointer; operands. With opaque pointers, the bitcast is not present, and this check is no longer; sufficient. In the above example, it could result in store to load forwarding; of an incorrect type. Code making such assumptions needs to be adjusted to; check the accessed type explicitly:; ``LI->getType() == SI->getValueOperand()->getType()``. Frontends; ---------. Frontends need to be adjusted to track pointee types independently of LLVM,; insofar as they are necessary for lowering. For example, clang now tracks the; pointee type in the ``Address`` structure. Frontends using the C API through an FFI interface should be aware that a; number of C API functions are deprecated and will be removed as part of the; opaque pointer transition::.

Because of this, if the SmallVector is; dynamically smaller than N, no malloc is performed.

It is stored along-side the documentation, and it; will be automatically regenerated when the documentation is updated. The; handling of the Latex directive is done by the class; **`TDocLatexDirective`**. The `BEGIN_LATEX` keyword can take the following parameters:. - `fontsize`: sets the **`TLatex`** font size. The default value is 16. - `separator`: sets a list of characters for which a new column will; be started. This allows aligned, multi-line, multi-column layout,; which can be useful for e.g. mathematical derivations. It is unset; by default, meaning the Latex directive will only generate one; column. - `rseparator`: like separator, but a regular expression. Columns; start with a match of this regular expression.

Let ``m1`` and ``m2`` be two instructions that both have the; ``llvm.access.group`` metadata to the access group ``g1``, respectively; ``g2`` (which might be identical). If a loop contains both access groups; in its ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata, then the compiler can; assume that there is no dependency between ``m1`` and ``m2`` carried by; this loop. Instructions that belong to multiple access groups are; considered having this property if at least one of the access groups; matches the ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` list. If all memory-accessing instructions in a loop have; ``llvm.access.group`` metadata that each refer to one of the access; groups of a loop's ``llvm.loop.parallel_accesses`` metadata, then the; loop has no loop carried memory dependences and is considered to be a; parallel loop.

Also, because DenseMap allocates space for a large number of; key/value pairs (it starts with 64 by default), it will waste a lot of space if; your keys or values are large. Finally, you must implement a partial; specialization of DenseMapInfo for the key that you want, if it isn't already; supported.

A header declaration that does not contain ``exclude`` nor ``textual`` specifies a header that contributes to the enclosing module. Specifically, when the module is built, the named header will be parsed and its declarations will be (logically) placed into the enclosing submodule. A header with the ``umbrella`` specifier is called an umbrella header. An umbrella header includes all of the headers within its directory (and any subdirectories), and is typically used (in the ``#include`` world) to easily access the full API provided by a particular library. With modules, an umbrella header is a convenient shortcut that eliminates the need to write out ``header`` declarations for every library header. A given directory can only contain a single umbrella header. .. note::; Any headers not included by the umbrella header should have; explicit ``header`` declarations. Use the; ``-Wincomplete-umbrella`` warning option to ask Clang to complain; about headers not covered by the umbrella header or the module map. A header with the ``private`` specifier may not be included from outside the module itself. A header with the ``textual`` specifier will not be compiled when the module is; built, and will be textually included if it is named by a ``#include``; directive.

Not only; can the class itself change, but any of its parent classes or data; member classes can change also. This makes the support for schema; evolution necessary. ROOT fully supports schema evolution. The next figure below illustrates; some of the scenarios. ![The ROOT schema evolution](pictures/020000ED.jpg). The top half represents different versions of the shared library with; the class definitions. These are the in-memory class versions. The; bottom half represents data files that contain different versions of the; classes. - An old version of a shared library and a file with new class; definitions - this can be the case when someone has not updated the; library and is reading a new file. - Reading a file with a shared library that is missing a class; definition (i.e. missing class D).

This feature has a potential to discover many interesting inputs,; but there are two downsides.; First, the extra instrumentation may bring up to 2x additional slowdown.; Second, the corpus may grow by several times. Fuzzer-friendly build mode; ---------------------------; Sometimes the code under test is not fuzzing-friendly. Examples:. - The target code uses a PRNG seeded e.g. by system time and; thus two consequent invocations may potentially execute different code paths; even if the end result will be the same. This will cause a fuzzer to treat; two similar inputs as significantly different and it will blow up the test corpus.; E.g. libxml uses ``rand()`` inside its hash table.; - The target code uses checksums to protect from invalid inputs.; E.g. png checks CRC for every chunk. In many cases it makes sense to build a special fuzzing-friendly build; with certain fuzzing-unfriendly features disabled.

That means that new backends are likely to have implications on the RNTuple format specification. The page sources and sinks are ROOT internal classes.; They are not meant to be extended by users. Multi-Threading; ---------------. The following options exist in RNTuple for multithreaded data processing. ### Implicit Multi-Threading; When `ROOT::EnableImplicitMT()` is used, RNTuple uses ROOT's task arena to compress and decompress pages.; That requires writes to be buffered and reads uses the cluster pool resp.; The RNTuple data source for RDataFrame lets RDataFrame full control of the thread pool.; That means that RDataFrame uses a separate data source for every thread, each of the data sources runs in sequential mode. ### Concurrent Readers; Multiple readers can read the same RNTuple concurrently as long as access to every individual reader is sequential. ### Parallel REntry Preparation; Multiple `REntry` object can be concurrently prepared by multiple threads.; I.e., construction and binding of the objects can happen in parallel.; The actual reading and writing of entries (`RNTupleReader::LoadEntry()`, `RNTupleWriter::Fill()`) needs to be protected by a mutex.; This is considered ""mild scalability parallelization"" in RNTuple. ### RNTupleParallelWriter; The parallel writer offers the most scalable parallel writing interface.; Multiple _fill contexts_ can concurrently serialize and compress data.; Every fill context prepares a set of entire clusters in the final on-disk layout.; When a fill context flushes data,; a brief serialization point handles the RNTuple meta-data updates and the reservation of disk space to write into.

It allows specifying the possible access kinds (``none``,; ``read``, ``write``, or ``readwrite``) for the possible memory location; kinds (``argmem``, ``inaccessiblemem``, as well as a default). It is best; understood by example:. - ``memory(none)``: Does not access any memory.; - ``memory(read)``: May read (but not write) any memory.; - ``memory(write)``: May write (but not read) any memory.; - ``memory(readwrite)``: May read or write any memory.; - ``memory(argmem: read)``: May only read argument memory.; - ``memory(argmem: read, inaccessiblemem: write)``: May only read argument; memory and only write inaccessible memory.; - ``memory(read, argmem: readwrite)``: May read any memory (default mode); and additionally write argument memory.; - ``memory(readwrite, argmem: none)``: May access any memory apart from; argument memory.

This is the process in LLVM, using a C++ backend:; ```; TableGen source -> llvm-tblgen -> backend (within llvm-tblgen) -> results; ```; This is what we will be doing:; ```; TableGen source -> llvm-tblgen -> JSON -> Python -> results; ```. The backend here is ported from one of several in ""SQLGen"" which was written by Min-Yih Hsu.; * SQLGen C++ sources - https://github.com/mshockwave/SQLGen; * LLVM dev presentation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP-LBRbvI_U. I encourage you to use those resources to supplement this notebook. ## Compiling TableGen. Unlike the other tutorial notebooks we are not using the TableGen kernel. This is an iPython notebook and we're going to run `llvm-tblgen` as a subprocess. First let's find it, in the same way the TableGen kernel does. ```python; import os; import shutil. def find_tblgen():; path = os.environ.get(""LLVM_TBLGEN_EXECUTABLE""); if path is not None and os.path.isfile(path) and os.access(path, os.X_OK):; return path; else:; path = shutil.which(""llvm-tblgen""); if path is None:; raise OSError(""llvm-tblgen not found""); return path; ; _ = find_tblgen(); ```. If the above cell raises an exception, either put `llvm-tblgen` on your `PATH` or point to it using the `LLVM_TBLGEN_EXECUTABLE` environment variable.

Security,"pproach is to use an std::vector (or other sequential container) with; std::sort+std::unique to remove duplicates. This approach works really well if; your usage pattern has these two distinct phases (insert then query), and can be; coupled with a good choice of :ref:`sequential container <ds_sequential>`. This combination provides the several nice properties: the result data is; contiguous in memory (good for cache locality), has few allocations, is easy to; address (iterators in the final vector are just indices or pointers), and can be; efficiently queried with a standard binary search (e.g.; ``std::lower_bound``; if you want the whole range of elements comparing; equal, use ``std::equal_range``). .. _dss_smallset:. llvm/ADT/SmallSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you have a set-like data structure that is usually small and whose elements; are reasonably small, a ``SmallSet<Type, N>`` is a good choice. This set has; space for N elements in place (thus, if the set is dynamically smaller than N,; no malloc traffic is required) and accesses them with a simple linear search.; When the set grows beyond N elements, it allocates a more expensive; representation that guarantees efficient access (for most types, it falls back; to :ref:`std::set <dss_set>`, but for pointers it uses something far better,; :ref:`SmallPtrSet <dss_smallptrset>`. The magic of this class is that it handles small sets extremely efficiently, but; gracefully handles extremely large sets without loss of efficiency. .. _dss_smallptrset:. llvm/ADT/SmallPtrSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``SmallPtrSet`` has all the advantages of ``SmallSet`` (and a ``SmallSet`` of; pointers is transparently implemented with a ``SmallPtrSet``). If more than N; insertions are performed, a single quadratically probed hash table is allocated; and grows as needed, providing extremely efficient access (constant time; insertion/deleting/queries with low constant factors) and is very stingy with; malloc traffic.

Security,"pproved by the LLVM Board. What is considered a security issue?; ====================================. The LLVM Project has a significant amount of code, and not all of it is; considered security-sensitive. This is particularly true because LLVM is used in; a wide variety of circumstances: there are different threat models, untrusted; inputs differ, and the environment LLVM runs in is varied. Therefore, what the; LLVM Project considers a security issue is what its members have signed up to; maintain securely. As this security process matures, members of the LLVM community can propose that; a part of the codebase be designated as security-sensitive (or no longer; security-sensitive). This requires a rationale, and buy-in from the LLVM; community as for any RFC. In some cases, parts of the codebase could be handled; as security-sensitive but need significant work to get to the stage where that's; manageable. The LLVM community will need to decide whether it wants to invest in; making these parts of the code securable, and maintain these security; properties over time. In all cases the LLVM Security Group should be consulted,; since they'll be responding to security issues filed against these parts of the; codebase. If you're not sure whether an issue is in-scope for this security process or; not, err towards assuming that it is. The Security Group might agree or disagree; and will explain its rationale in the report, as well as update this document; through the above process. The security-sensitive parts of the LLVM Project currently are the following.; Note that this list can change over time. * None are currently defined. Please don't let this stop you from reporting; issues to the security group that you believe are security-sensitive.

The YAML I/O; library provides support for translating between YAML scalars and specific; C++ types.

That is, you can use those types in fields of MappingTraits or as element type; in sequence. When reading, YAML I/O will validate that the string found; is convertible to that type and error out if not. Unique types; ------------; Given that YAML I/O is trait based, the selection of how to convert your data; to YAML is based on the type of your data. But in C++ type matching, typedefs; do not generate unique type names. That means if you have two typedefs of; unsigned int, to YAML I/O both types look exactly like unsigned int. To; facilitate make unique type names, YAML I/O provides a macro which is used; like a typedef on built-in types, but expands to create a class with conversion; operators to and from the base type. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. LLVM_YAML_STRONG_TYPEDEF(uint32_t, MyFooFlags); LLVM_YAML_STRONG_TYPEDEF(uint32_t, MyBarFlags). This generates two classes MyFooFlags and MyBarFlags which you can use in your; native data structures instead of uint32_t. They are implicitly; converted to and from uint32_t.

Accessing a pointer with any of these bounds; annotations will require an extra null check to avoid a null pointer; dereference. Internal bounds annotations; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A wide pointer (sometimes known as a ""fat"" pointer) is a pointer that carries; additional bounds information internally (as part of its data). The bounds; require additional storage space making wide pointers larger than normal; pointers, hence the name ""wide pointer"". The memory layout of a wide pointer is; equivalent to a struct with the pointer, upper bound, and (optionally) lower; bound as its fields as shown below. .. code-block:: c. struct wide_pointer_datalayout {; void* pointer; // Address used for dereferences and pointer arithmetic; void* upper_bound; // Points one past the highest address that can be; // accessed; void* lower_bound; // (Optional) Points to lowest address that can be; // accessed; };. Even with this representational change, wide pointers act syntactically as; normal pointers to allow standard pointer operations, such as pointer; dereference (``*p``), array subscript (``p[i]``), member access (``p->``), and; pointer arithmetic, with some restrictions on bounds-unsafe uses. ``-fbounds-safety`` has a set of ""internal"" bounds annotations to turn pointers; into wide pointers. These are ``__bidi_indexable`` and ``__indexable``. When a; pointer has either of these annotations, the compiler changes the pointer to the; corresponding wide pointer. This means these annotations will break the ABI and; will not be compatible with plain C, and thus they should generally not be used; in ABI surfaces. * ``__bidi_indexable`` : A pointer with this annotation becomes a wide pointer; to carry the upper bound and the lower bound, the layout of which",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:13419,access,accessed,13419,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,2,['access'],['accessed']

The single vector elements can be set or retrieved using the _operator[i]_ , _operator(i)_; or the iterator interface. Notice that the index starts from zero and not from one as in; FORTRAN. Also no check is performed on the passed index. Furthermore, all the matrix; elements can be set also by using the ROOT::SVector::SetElements function passing a generic; iterator. The elements can be accessed also by using the ROOT::Math::SVector::apply(i) function. ~~~ {.cpp}; v[0] = 1; // set the first element; v(1) = 2; // set the second element; *(v.begin()+3) = 3; // set the third element; // set vector elements from a std::vector<double>::iterator</double>; std::vector <double> w(3);; v.SetElements(w.begin(),w.end());. double x = m(i); // return the i-th element; x = m.apply(i); // return the i-th element; x = *(m.begin()+i); // return the i-th element; ~~~. In addition there are methods to place a sub-vector in a vector. If the size of the the; sub-vector is larger than the vector size a static assert ( a compilation error) is produced. ~~~ {.cpp}; SVector<double,N> v;; SVector<double,M> w; // M <= N otherwise a compilation error is obtained later; // place a vector of size M starting from element ioff, v[ioff + i] = w[i]; v.Place_at(w,ioff);; // return a sub-vector of size M starting from v[ioff]: w[i] = v[ioff + i]; w = v.Sub < SVector>double,M> > (ioff);; ~~~.

Security,"r the arguments have been; translated. A long term goal is to remove this tool chain specific translation, and; instead force each tool to change its own logic to do the right thing on; the untranslated original arguments. Unused Argument Warnings; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The driver operates by parsing all arguments but giving Tools the; opportunity to choose which arguments to pass on. One downside of this; infrastructure is that if the user misspells some option, or is confused; about which options to use, some command line arguments the user really; cared about may go unused. This problem is particularly important when; using clang as a compiler, since the clang compiler does not support; anywhere near all the options that gcc does, and we want to make sure; users know which ones are being used. To support this, the driver maintains a bit associated with each; argument of whether it has been used (at all) during the compilation.; This bit usually doesn't need to be set by hand, as the key ArgList; accessors will set it automatically. When a compilation is successful (there are no errors), the driver; checks the bit and emits an ""unused argument"" warning for any arguments; which were never accessed. This is conservative (the argument may not; have been used to do what the user wanted) but still catches the most; obvious cases. Relation to GCC Driver Concepts; -------------------------------. For those familiar with the gcc driver, this section provides a brief; overview of how things from the gcc driver map to the clang driver. - **Driver Driver**. The driver driver is fully integrated into the clang driver. The; driver simply constructs additional Actions to bind the architecture; during the *Pipeline* phase. The tool chain specific argument; translation is responsible for handling ``-Xarch_``. The one caveat is that this approach requires ``-Xarch_`` not be used; to alter the compilation itself (for example, one cannot provide; ``-S`` as an ``-Xarch_`` argument",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:14705,access,accessors,14705,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['access'],['accessors']
Security,"r the entire array?; // There is not, but it is a stack variable, so we use; // ""uninitialized"" as the default value (and emit a; // diagnostic!). NOTE: The fact that bindings are stored as a base region plus an offset limits; the Default Binding strategy, because in C aggregates can contain other; aggregates. In the current implementation of RegionStore, there is no way to; distinguish a Default binding for an entire aggregate from a Default binding; for the sub-aggregate at offset 0. Lazy Bindings (LazyCompoundVal); -------------------------------. RegionStore implements an optimization for copying aggregates (structs and; arrays) called ""lazy bindings"", implemented using a special SVal called; LazyCompoundVal. When the store is asked for the ""binding"" for an entire; aggregate (i.e. for an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion), it returns a; LazyCompoundVal instead. When this value is then stored into a variable, it is; bound as a Default value. This makes copying arrays and structs much cheaper; than if they had required memberwise access. Under the hood, a LazyCompoundVal is implemented as a uniqued pair of (region,; store), representing ""the value of the region during this 'snapshot' of the; store"". This has important implications for any sort of liveness or; reachability analysis, which must take the bindings in the old store into; account. Retrieving a value from a lazy binding happens in the same way as any other; Default binding: since there is no direct binding, the store manager falls back; to super-regions to look for an appropriate default binding. LazyCompoundVal; differs from a normal default binding, however, in that it contains several; different values, instead of one value that will appear several times. Because; of this, the store manager has to reconstruct the subregion chain on top of the; LazyCompoundVal region, and look up *that* region in the previous store. Here's a concrete example:. .. code-block:: cpp. CGPoint p;; p.x = 42; // A Direct binding is ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/RegionStore.rst:7088,access,access,7088,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/RegionStore.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/RegionStore.rst,1,['access'],['access']

This header fits within 8 bytes on all platforms supported, and contributes to a; small overhead for each allocation. The checksum is computed using a CRC32 (made faster with hardware support); of the global secret, the chunk pointer itself, and the 8 bytes of header with; the checksum field zeroed out. It is not intended to be cryptographically; strong. The header is atomically loaded and stored to prevent races. This is important; as two consecutive chunks could belong to different threads. We work on local; copies and use compare-exchange primitives to update the headers in the heap; memory, and avoid any type of double-fetching. Randomness; ----------; Randomness is a critical factor to the additional security provided by the; allocator. The allocator trusts the memory mapping primitives of the OS to; provide pages at (mostly) non-predictable locations in memory, as well as the; binaries to be compiled with ASLR. In the event one of those assumptions is; incorrect, the security will be greatly reduced. Scudo further randomizes how; blocks are allocated in the Primary, can randomize how caches are assigned to; threads. Memory reclaiming; -----------------; Primary and Secondary allocators have different behaviors with regard to; reclaiming. While Secondary mapped allocations can be unmapped on deallocation,; it isn't the case for the Primary, which could lead to a steady growth of the; RSS of a process. To counteract this, if the underlying OS allows it, pages; that are covered by contiguous free memory blocks in the Primary can be; released: this generally means they won't count towards the RSS of a process and; be zero filled on subsequent accesses).

Like in scalar type descriptors the actual; value of this name operand is irrelevant to LLVM. After the name operand,; the struct type descriptors have a sequence of alternating ``MDNode`` and; ``ConstantInt`` operands.

Security,"r. In; order to support address spaces, the CFA DWARF expression is defined to be a; memory location description. This allows it to specify an address space which is; used to convert the offset address back to an address in that address space. See; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`. This approach of extending memory location descriptions to support address; spaces, allows all existing DWARF Version 5 expressions to have the identical; semantics. It allows the compiler to explicitly specify the address space it is; using. For example, a compiler could choose to access private memory in a; swizzled manner when mapping a source language thread to the lane of a wavefront; in a SIMT manner. Or a compiler could choose to access it in an unswizzled; manner if mapping the same language with the wavefront being the thread. It also allows the compiler to mix the address space it uses to access private; memory. For example, for SIMT it can still spill entire vector registers in an; unswizzled manner, while using a swizzled private memory for SIMT variable; access. This approach also allows memory location descriptions for different address; spaces to be combined using the regular ``DW_OP_*piece`` operations. Location descriptions are an abstraction of storage. They give freedom to the; consumer on how to implement them. They allow the address space to encode lane; information so they can be used to read memory with only the memory location; description and no extra information. The same set of operations can operate on; locations independent of their kind of storage. The ``DW_OP_deref*`` therefore; can be used on any storage kind, including memory location descriptions of; different address spaces. Therefore, the ``DW_OP_xderef*`` operations are; unnecessary, except to become a more compact way to encode a non-default address; space address followed by dereferencing it.

See DWARF Version 5; section 2.5 which is updated by *DWARF Extensions For Heterogeneous Debugging*; section :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`. For AMDGPU, the lane identifier corresponds to the hardware lane ID of a; wavefront. It is numbered from 0 to the wavefront size minus 1. Operation Expressions; ---------------------. DWARF expressions are used to compute program values and the locations of; program objects. See DWARF Version 5 section 2.5 and; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`. DWARF location descriptions describe how to access storage which includes memory; and registers. When accessing storage on AMDGPU, bytes are ordered with least; significant bytes first, and bits are ordered within bytes with least; significant bits first. For AMDGPU CFI expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used to describe; unwinding vector registers that are spilled under the execution mask to memory:; the zero-single location description is the vector register, and the one-single; location description is the spilled memory location description. The; ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` is used to specify the address space of the; memory location description. In AMDGPU expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used by the; ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute expression where divergent control flow is; controlled by the execution mask. An undefined location description together; with ``DW_OP_LLVM_extend`` is used to indicate the lane was not active on entry; to the subprogram.

The first image does all the work: installs; build dependencies, checks out LLVM source code, compiles LLVM, etc.; The first image is only used during build and does not have a descriptive name,; i.e. it is only accessible via the hash value after the build is finished.; The second image is our resulting image. It contains only the built binaries; and not any build dependencies. It is also accessible via a descriptive name; (specified by -d and -t flags).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Docker.rst:7967,access,accessible,7967,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Docker.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Docker.rst,3,"['access', 'hash']","['accessible', 'hash']"

Security,"rcing bounds safety for C; ==================================================. .. contents::; :local:. Overview; ========. ``-fbounds-safety`` is a C extension to enforce bounds safety to prevent; out-of-bounds (OOB) memory accesses, which remain a major source of security; vulnerabilities in C. ``-fbounds-safety`` aims to eliminate this class of bugs; by turning OOB accesses into deterministic traps. The ``-fbounds-safety`` extension offers bounds annotations that programmers can; use to attach bounds to pointers. For example, programmers can add the; ``__counted_by(N)`` annotation to parameter ``ptr``, indicating that the pointer; has ``N`` valid elements:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(int *__counted_by(N) ptr, size_t N);. Using this bounds information, the compiler inserts bounds checks on every; pointer dereference, ensuring that the program does not access memory outside; the specified bounds. The compiler requires programmers to provide enough bounds; information so that the accesses can be checked at either run time or compile; time — and it rejects code if it cannot. The most important contribution of ``-fbounds-safety`` is how it reduces the; programmer's annotation burden by reconciling bounds annotations at ABI; boundaries with the use of implicit wide pointers (a.k.a. ""fat"" pointers) that; carry bounds information on local variables without the need for annotations. We; designed this model so that it preserves ABI compatibility with C while; minimizing adoption effort. The ``-fbounds-safety`` extension has been adopted on millions of lines of; production C code and proven to work in a consumer operating system setting. The; extension was designed to enable incremental adoption — a key requirement in; real-world settings where modifying an entire project and its dependencies all; at once is often not possible. It also addresses multiple of other practical; challenges that have made existing approaches to safer C dialects difficult to; adopt, offering these",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:1072,access,accesses,1072,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['access'],['accesses']

Special unwind information is required on functions that are compiled; with ShadowCallStack and that may be unwound, i.e. functions compiled with; ``-fexceptions`` (which is the default in C++). Some unwinders (such as the; libgcc 4.9 unwinder) do not understand this unwind info and will segfault; when encountering it. LLVM libunwind processes this unwind info correctly,; however. This means that if exceptions are used together with ShadowCallStack,; the program must use a compatible unwinder. Security; ========. ShadowCallStack is intended to be a stronger alternative to; ``-fstack-protector``. It protects from non-linear overflows and arbitrary; memory writes to the return address slot. The instrumentation makes use of the ``SCSReg`` register to reference the shadow; call stack, meaning that references to the shadow call stack do not have; to be stored in memory. This makes it possible to implement a runtime that; avoids exposing the address of the shadow call stack to attackers that can; read arbitrary memory. However, attackers could still try to exploit side; channels exposed by the operating system `[1]`_ `[2]`_ or processor `[3]`_; to discover the address of the shadow call stack. .. _`[1]`: https://eyalitkin.wordpress.com/2017/09/01/cartography-lighting-up-the-shadows/; .. _`[2]`: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-16/materials/eu-16-Goktas-Bypassing-Clangs-SafeStack.pdf; .. _`[3]`: https://www.vusec.net/projects/anc/. Unless care is taken when allocating the shadow call stack, it may be; possible for an attacker to guess its address using the addresses of; other allocations. Therefore, the address should be chosen to make this; difficult. One way to do this is to allocate a large guard region without; read/write permissions, randomly select a small region within it to be; used as the address of the shadow call stack and mark only that region as; read/write.

When a memory access overruns the allocated buffer, it will touch the; inaccessible guard page, causing memory exception. This exception is caught and; handled by the internal crash handler. Because each allocation is recorded with; metadata about where (and by what thread) it was allocated and deallocated, we; can provide information that will help identify the root cause of the bug.

The new package allows distributing RDataFrame applications through one of the supported distributed backends. The package was designed so that different backends can be easily plugged in. Currently the [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) backend is supported and support for [Dask](https://dask.org/) is coming soon. The backend submodules of this package expose their own `RDataFrame` objects. The only needed change in user code is to substitute `ROOT.RDataFrame` calls with such backend-specific `RDataFrame`s. For example:. ```python; import ROOT. # Point RDataFrame calls to the Spark specific RDataFrame; RDataFrame = ROOT.RDF.Experimental.Distributed.Spark.RDataFrame. # It still accepts the same constructor arguments as traditional RDataFrame; df = RDataFrame(""mytree"",""myfile.root""). # Continue the application with the traditional RDataFrame API; ```. The main goal of this package is to support running any RDataFrame application distributedly. Nonetheless, not all RDataFrame operations currently work with this package. The subset that is currently available is:. - AsNumpy; - Count; - Define; - Fill; - Filter; - Graph; - Histo[1,2,3]D; - Max; - Mean; - Min; - Profile[1,2,3]D; - Snapshot; - Sum. with support for more operations coming in the future.

This proposal describes DWARF extensions to; encode Objective C properties, which the debugger can use to let developers; inspect Objective C properties. Proposal; ^^^^^^^^. Objective C properties exist separately from class members. A property can be; defined only by ""setter"" and ""getter"" selectors, and be calculated anew on each; access.

Another good performance benchmark for this mechanism is the; virtual-call-heavy SPEC 2006 xalancbmk. Note that this scheme has not yet been optimized for binary size; an increase; of up to 15% has been observed for Chromium. Bad Cast Checking; =================. This scheme checks that pointer casts are made to an object of the correct; dynamic type; that is, the dynamic type of the object must be a derived class; of the pointee type of the cast. The checks are currently only introduced; where the class being casted to is a polymorphic class. Bad casts are not in themselves control flow integrity violations, but they; can also create security vulnerabilities, and the implementation uses many; of the same mechanisms. There are two types of bad cast that may be forbidden: bad casts; from a base class to a derived class (which can be checked with; ``-fsanitize=cfi-derived-cast``), and bad casts from a pointer of; type ``void*`` or another unrelated type (which can be checked with; ``-fsanitize=cfi-unrelated-cast``). The difference between these two types of casts is that the first is defined; by the C++ standard to produce an undefined value, while the second is not; in itself undefined behavior (it is well defined to cast the pointer back; to its original type) unless the object is uninitialized and the cast is a; ``static_cast`` (see C++14 [basic.life]p5). If a program as a matter of policy forbids the second type of cast, that; restriction can normally be enforced. However it may in some cases be necessary; for a function to perform a forbidden cast to conform with an external API; (e.g. the ``allocate`` membe",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst:5550,integrity,integrity,5550,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst,2,"['integrity', 'secur']","['integrity', 'security']"

For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, ptr }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, ptr }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1; %arr = load ptr, ptr %idx; %idx = getelementptr [40 x i32], ptr %arr, i64 0, i64 17. In this example, we have a global variable, ``@MyVar``, which is a pointer to; a structure containing a pointer. Let's assume that this inner pointer points; to an array of type ``[40 x i32]``. The above IR will first compute the address; of the inner pointer, then load the pointer, and then compute the address of; the 18th array element. This cannot be expressed in a single GEP instruction, because it requires; a memory dereference in between. However, the following example would work; fine:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, [40 x i32 ] }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, [40 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1, i64 17. In this case, the structure does not contain a pointer and the GEP instruction; can index through the global variable, into the second field of the structure; and access the 18th ``i32`` in the array there. Why don't GEP x,0,0,1 and GEP x,1 alias?; ----------------------------------------. Quick Answer: They compute different address locations. If you look at the first indices in these GEP instructions you find that they; are different (0 and 1), therefore the address computation diverges with that; index.

LLVM address space 0 is the default address space, which; includes the stack, and any unqualified memory accesses in a program. Address; spaces 1-255 are currently reserved for user-defined code.

Other x86 segments; have yet to be allocated address space numbers. While these address spaces may seem similar to TLS via the ``thread_local``; keyword, and often use the same underlying hardware, there are some fundamental; differences. The ``thread_local`` keyword applies to global variables and specifies that they; are to be allocated in thread-local memory.

Of course we could; introduce hashing and other helpers, but it is still just an optimization, and; thus the level of O(N*N) complexity. Can we reach another level? Could we introduce logarithmical search, or random; access lookup? The answer is: ""yes"". Random-access; """"""""""""""""""""""""""; How it could this be done? Just convert each function to a number, and gather; all of them in a special hash-table.

Stack Map Intrinsics; --------------------. LLVM provides experimental intrinsics to support runtime patching; mechanisms commonly desired in dynamic language JITs. These intrinsics; are described in :doc:`StackMaps`. Element Wise Atomic Memory Intrinsics; -------------------------------------. These intrinsics are similar to the standard library memory intrinsics except; that they perform memory transfer as a sequence of atomic memory accesses. .. _int_memcpy_element_unordered_atomic:.

Overview:; """""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.memcpy.element.unordered.atomic.*``' intrinsic is a specialization of the; '``llvm.memcpy.*``' intrinsic.

Security,"rip Symbols"")));. This defines a variable that is conceptually of the type; ""``std::vector<enum Opts>``"". Thus, you can access it with standard vector; methods:. .. code-block:: c++. for (unsigned i = 0; i != OptimizationList.size(); ++i); switch (OptimizationList[i]); ... ... to iterate through the list of options specified. Note that the ""``cl::list``"" template is completely general and may be used with; any data types or other arguments that you can use with the ""``cl::opt``""; template. One especially useful way to use a list is to capture all of the; positional arguments together if there may be more than one specified. In the; case of a linker, for example, the linker takes several '``.o``' files, and; needs to capture them into a list. This is naturally specified as:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; cl::list<std::string> InputFilenames(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<Input files>""), cl::OneOrMore);; ... This variable works just like a ""``vector<string>``"" object. As such, accessing; the list is simple, just like above. In this example, we used the; `cl::OneOrMore`_ modifier to inform the CommandLine library that it is an error; if the user does not specify any ``.o`` files on our command line. Again, this; just reduces the amount of checking we have to do. Collecting options as a set of flags; ------------------------------------. Instead of collecting sets of options in a list, it is also possible to gather; information for enum values in a **bit vector**. The representation used by the; `cl::bits`_ class is an ``unsigned`` integer. An enum value is represented by a; 0/1 in the enum's ordinal value bit position. 1 indicating that the enum was; specified, 0 otherwise. As each specified value is parsed, the resulting enum's; bit is set in the option's bit vector:. .. code-block:: c++. bits |= 1 << (unsigned)enum;. Options that are specified multiple times are redundant. Any instances after; the first are discarded. Reworking the above list example, we could replace `cl::li",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:21097,access,accessing,21097,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,1,['access'],['accessing']
Security,"ript that comes with ROOT; it; prints all flags and libraries needed to compile code and link it with; the ROOT libraries. In order to make the code executable stand-alone, an; entry point for the operating system is needed, in C++ this is the; procedure `int main();`. The easiest way to turn a ROOT macro code into; a stand-alone application is to add the following ""dressing code"" at the; end of the macro file. This defines the procedure main, the only purpose; of which is to call your macro:. ``` {.cpp}; int main() {; ExampleMacro();; return 0;; }; ```. To create a stand-alone program from a macro called `ExampleMacro.C`, simply type. ``` {.cpp}; > g++ -o ExampleMacro ExampleMacro.C `root-config --cflags --libs`; ```. and execute it by typing. ``` {.cpp}; > ./ExampleMacro; ```. This procedure will, however, not give access to the ROOT graphics, as; neither control of mouse or keyboard events nor access to the graphics; windows of ROOT is available. If you want your stand-alone application; have display graphics output and respond to mouse and keyboard, a; slightly more complex piece of code can be used. In the example below, a; macro `ExampleMacro_GUI` is executed by the ROOT class `TApplication`. As; a additional feature, this code example offers access to parameters; eventually passed to the program when started from the command line.; Here is the code fragment:. ``` {.cpp}; void StandaloneApplication(int argc, char** argv) {; // eventually, evaluate the application parameters argc, argv; // ==>> here the ROOT macro is called; ExampleMacro_GUI();; }; // This is the standard ""main"" of C++ starting; // a ROOT application; int main(int argc, char** argv) {; TApplication app(""ROOT Application"", &argc, argv);; StandaloneApplication(app.Argc(), app.Argv());; app.Run();; return 0;; }; ```.

Security,"rizing predicated basic blocks on these targets. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of branches that guard scalar store operations.; The result of this operation is equivalent to a load-modify-store sequence. However, using this intrinsic prevents exceptions and data races on memory access to masked-off lanes. ::. call void @llvm.masked.store.v16f32.p0(<16 x float> %value, ptr %ptr, i32 4, <16 x i1> %mask). ;; The result of the following instructions is identical aside from potential data races and memory access exceptions; %oldval = load <16 x float>, ptr %ptr, align 4; %res = select <16 x i1> %mask, <16 x float> %value, <16 x float> %oldval; store <16 x float> %res, ptr %ptr, align 4. Masked Vector Gather and Scatter Intrinsics; -------------------------------------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for vector gather and scatter operations. They are similar to :ref:`Masked Vector Load and Store <int_mload_mstore>`, except they are designed for arbitrary memory accesses, rather than sequential memory accesses. Gather and scatter also employ a mask operand, which holds one bit per vector element, switching the associated vector lane on or off.
