Testability,"ype(variable) is not None then do_something(variable)` or its close cousin `if variable is not None then do_something(variable)`; * `if exists(file) then do_something(file)`. In Cromwell-flavored WDL (perhaps all WDL?), it doesn't seem you can do any of those. The first one will throw an ""Expected X but got X?"" error and the other two don't seem to have equivalents. Compare that to Python, where I can explicitly do the second or third one, and implicitly do the first one. In Python, if I try to do_something() on a variable that isn't defined, Python throws a Name Error, but in Cromwell!WDL trying to do_something() on an optional throws a ""Expected X but got X?"" error that doesn't tell you if X is actually defined or not. The fact that the WDL spec doesn't explicitly say that defined() can coerce a variable doesn't really matter -- I would wager that most people would expect this sort of thing to work. It seems to be a logical conclusion that if a file exists, you can do something to that file, without having to call a totally different function to create a new variable. I did check your workaround, but it throws the same error. So, my understanding is the only way to do this in Cromwell is this:. ```; String basename_tsv = basename(select_first([tsv_file_input, ""bogus fallback value""])); String arg_tsv = if(basename_tsv == ""bogus fallback value"") then """" else basename_tsv; ```. ...which just isn't intuitive. It shouldn't be so complicated to get the basename of an optional file. . Even less intuitive is the fact that if you separate out the select_first() part into a new variable, my workaround doesn't work anymore. ```; String maybe_tsv = select_first([tsv_file_input, ""bogus fallback value""]); String basename_tsv = basename(maybe_tsv); String arg_tsv = if(basename_tsv == ""bogus fallback value"") then """" else basename_tsv; ```. _Failed to process task definition 'parse_terratable' (reason 1 of 1): Failed to process expression 'select_first([basename_tsv, basename(may",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6840#issuecomment-1245893354:1242,log,logical,1242,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6840#issuecomment-1245893354,1,['log'],['logical']

One could use isAlive intermittently, but it was introduced mainly for recovering jobs at re-startup, & I would not have isAlive poll as often as we check for the rc file. Btw, GATK Queue actually only checks drmaa every 30 seconds, so that it doesn’t overload dispatchers. Something like isAlive could be checked with similar frequency.

Usability," Singularity container. But if that's the case, then why has this command:. ```bash; singularity run shub://vsoch/hello-world; ```. turned into needing Cromwell (java and the jar), an inputs json file, a wdl specification, a backend configuration, and a runtime command that I can't seem to remember, and then the entire thing takes much longer than an instance to echo a tiny Rawwwwr! If this is the goal we are going for, is this making life easier for the scientist? If I'm a programmer person, and this is the minimum I am allowed for this to just run a simple container, what happens when it gets harder? I realized that without a proper services API, singularity is no more special than python, bash, samtools, it's just a binary. . And I realize also that it's easy to get caught up in details like ""Should we use Travis or Circle?"" Does it work on Amazon with this kind of input? And there will always be bugs! But I think the forest is being a bit lost for the trees. . ## Question 4: What is the direction to go in?. You can probably take what I'm saying with a grain of salt because I'm new to this entire universe, and there is so much invested there is no turning back or rethinking. But all of this seems too complicated, and too hard. What is needed is a solution that is just really stupid and simple. You have a container that understands its data. You point the container at a dataset and run it. You outsource the workflow part to the technologies that big players are building already. This definitely isn't a ""throw hands in the air"" sort of deal, because most of this stuff is working already it seems? I don't know if this perspective is useful, but as a new person (outsider) I wanted to offer it because if I'm confused and find this hard, probably others are too.

Usability," backend configuration, since whether this is something you want to do or not will depend on the infrastucture your workflow is running on. One potential way to configure this, might be to add multipliers for certain runtime attributes in the backend configuration:; ```; [...]; config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int? cpu = 1; Int? memory = 4; """"""; runtime-attribute-retry-multipliers = {; memory: 1.5; }; [...]; }; [...]; ```. This would, for example, cause the memory attribute to be multiplied by `1.5` with each retry. For the first attempt it would be `4`, for the the second `6`, the third `9` etc. Another option might be that the values here indicate a fraction of the original attribute which it should be increased it by each retry, so in the above example it would be: `4` -> `10` -> `16` etc. You would probably want set a lower value in that case, though. Another option would be to supply a list of numbers with each indicating a multiplier for a certain attempt. A value of `[1.5, 2]` (or maybe `[1, 1.5, 2]`) would cause the value to be multiplied by `1.5` on the second attempt and `2` on the third, repeating the last multiplier if neccesary. (ie. `4` -> `6` -> `8` -> `8`). <!--; Hi! Thanks for taking the time to report feedback.

(e.g, take a look at [https://www.openneuro.org](https://www.openneuro.org). # Development of my Thinking; Finally, I want to share how I came to the thinking above. Here are the steps that I've taken in the last few weeks, and resulting thoughts from them. I started with this issue board actually, and a general goal to ""Add Singularity to Cromwell."" Ok. ### Question 1: How do I develop Cromwell?; It first was hard for me to know where to start to develop Cromwell, because the docs just went into how to compile it on a host. So it made sense to make it easy for the developer to develop Cromwell so I made a Dockerfile to do that:; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4002. Woohoo merged! We needed to have tests too, so I followed up on that:; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4015 . But unfortunately it was decided that CircleCI was too new / needed to learn stuff (this is ok!) so it's going to be closed. . ## Question 2: How do we add a Singularity backend?. But this is actually ok, because we realize that we don't need to add Singularity to Cromwell proper, it can just be a backend! But I didn't understand wdl, or any of the formats, so my crew in Cherry lab gave me a solid repo to startwith, and then it started to click!; - https://github.com/vsoch/wgbs-pipeline/pull/1. I was waiting for the Dockerfile test PR to pass, but realized it probably wouldn't, so I jumped on adding the example backend workflows (still without totally understanding what/why/how, but figuring out as I went):; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4039. ## Question 3: But what about Cromwell+Singularity on Travis?. I got confused again when there were [requests for additional tests](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4039#issuecomment-416313519) (and something entirely different) that it made me step back.

Usability," do_something() on an optional throws a ""Expected X but got X?"" error that doesn't tell you if X is actually defined or not. The fact that the WDL spec doesn't explicitly say that defined() can coerce a variable doesn't really matter -- I would wager that most people would expect this sort of thing to work. It seems to be a logical conclusion that if a file exists, you can do something to that file, without having to call a totally different function to create a new variable. I did check your workaround, but it throws the same error. So, my understanding is the only way to do this in Cromwell is this:. ```; String basename_tsv = basename(select_first([tsv_file_input, ""bogus fallback value""])); String arg_tsv = if(basename_tsv == ""bogus fallback value"") then """" else basename_tsv; ```. ...which just isn't intuitive. It shouldn't be so complicated to get the basename of an optional file. . Even less intuitive is the fact that if you separate out the select_first() part into a new variable, my workaround doesn't work anymore. ```; String maybe_tsv = select_first([tsv_file_input, ""bogus fallback value""]); String basename_tsv = basename(maybe_tsv); String arg_tsv = if(basename_tsv == ""bogus fallback value"") then """" else basename_tsv; ```. _Failed to process task definition 'parse_terratable' (reason 1 of 1): Failed to process expression 'select_first([basename_tsv, basename(maybe_tsv)])' (reason 1 of 1): Invalid parameter 'IdentifierLookup(maybe_tsv)'. Expected 'File' but got 'String?'_. In other words -- it is unnecessarily complicated to work with optionals, and the workarounds that do exist appear to be inconsistent. It seems this could all be sidestepped by having ""if X exists, do something to X"" logic. (I want to make clear I'm coming at this from a perspective of someone who uses WDL heavily, mostly in the context of Terra/Cromwell, and wants wider adoption. From my experience, oddities like this are serious obstacles for both newcomers and heavy users like myself.)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6840#issuecomment-1245893354:2663,clear,clear,2663,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6840#issuecomment-1245893354,1,['clear'],['clear']
Usability," message always results in the same hash; 2. it is quick to compute the hash value for any given message; 3. it is infeasible to generate a message that yields a given hash value; 4. it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value; 5. a small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value (avalanche effect). I contest point 2, in that many cryptographic explicitly strife for being slow to calculate in order to negate brute force attempts.; Anyway: for call caching we only need points 1. and 4. All the rest is unnecessary ballast. . ## xxHash; Luckily there is a hashing algorithm that is designed explicitly for content hashing only. It was made to generate reliably different hashes for file content as fast as possible. It's called [xxHash](https://www.xxhash.com). There are Java implementations available and I did [some extensive benchmarking](https://github.com/rhpvorderman/hashtest/) to find out which one was best. The xxh64 (xxhash for 64 bit machines) algorithm was 15 times faster than the java implementation of md5 we currently use in Cromwell. This PR implements the xxhash algorithm for call-caching in Cromwell:. + The default strategy will still be using md5 for backwards compatibility.; + A new `xxh64` strategy is implemented using the 64-bit xxhash algorithm. (I didn't make the xxh32 algorithm available. Is there any Cromwell server still running on 32-bit?) This can be set in the call caching configuration.; + A new `fingerprint` strategy suggested by @illusional, which takes the modtime, size and a xxh64 hash of the first 10 mb of the file to create a virtually unique fingerprint.; + The `file` strategy get's a new alias `md5` which is more clear. Although `file` will still work in the config for backwards compatibility. . I feel we should move to xxh64 as default after it has proven itself in a few releases.

Usability,"### Description. Currently, and as described in https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7535, only general-purpose machine types are supported in Google Backend, which prevents running wdl workflows on many machine types available on GCP, including those provisioned with modern GPUs. I believe the simplest and most general solution would be to pass the machine type directly from the wdl configuration to the Google Batch API. The idea is that this approach would be more resilient to machine types being added or deprecated on GCP, as users would only need to update their wdl workflows in such cases. An alternative approach of mapping machine specs (e.g.: cpu platform and gpu requirements) to standard machine types would potentially introduce an additional layer of maintenance with little benefit. This PR adds support for a new standardMachineType key in the runtime section, which is only parsed for the Google backend. ### Testing. I deployed this internally and verified I can successfully run the following wdl workflow:. ```; version 1.0. task nvidia_smi {; input {; String docker_version; }. command <<<; nvidia-smi. touch .done; echo ""Finished at $(date)""; >>>. runtime {; docker: <internal image>; disks: ""local-disk 50 SSD""; memory: ""32G""; preemptible: 0; gpuCount: 1; gpuType: ""nvidia-tesla-a100""; standardMachineType: ""a2-highgpu-1g""; }. output {; File done = "".done""; }; }. workflow nvidia_smi_wf {; input {; String docker_version; }; ; call nvidia_smi as nvidia_smi_call {; input:; docker_version = docker_version; }. output {; File done = "".done""; }; }; ```. ### Next steps. - [ ] Confirm this approach is in the right direction with the cromwell team.; - [ ] Work on proper unit tests and get this PR ready to be merged. ### Release Notes Confirmation. #### `CHANGELOG.md`; - [ ] I updated `CHANGELOG.md` in this PR; - [ ] I assert that this change shouldn't be included in `CHANGELOG.md` because it doesn't impact community users. #### Terra Release Notes; - [ ] I a",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7545:309,simpl,simplest,309,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7545,1,['simpl'],['simplest']

Usability,"### Description. The PR exercises the ""retry with more memory"" Centaur tests on the GCP Batch backend. Minimal changes to production code, all of which are in the GCP Batch backend:. - The constant`RunnableUtils#MountPoint` was created with value `/mnt/disks/cromwell_root` and applied where appropriate.; - A copy/paste bug in code brought over from PAPIv2 was corrected (the `/cromwell_root` of PAPIv2 has become `/mnt/disks/cromwell_root` in Batch), using the constant described above.; - If a job fails, the *last* event message is now propagated rather than the first event message. The first event message is often a benign state transition, while the last event message is more likely to contain the actual reason for job failure.; ; Unfortunately Cromwell does not allow for dynamic backend selection (i.e. the backend name cannot be a variable), which necessitated copy/paste/renaming the Centaur test WDLs from their PAPIv2 versions, hence the magnitude of these diffs. The existing `preemptible_and_memory_retry ` Centaur test is heavily tailored to the quirks of Papi v2: a preemptible PAPI VM deletes itself and depends on the Lifesciences system mistaking that for a preemption event. tbh this is kind of a weird test and as I don't know how to induce a preemption on demand, I simply `ignore`d the GCPBATCH version. ### Release Notes Confirmation. #### `CHANGELOG.md`; - [x] I updated `CHANGELOG.md` in this PR; - [ ] I assert that this change shouldn't be included in `CHANGELOG.md` because it doesn't impact community users. #### Terra Release Notes; - [ ] I added a suggested release notes entry in this Jira ticket; - [x] I assert that this change doesn't need Jira release notes because it doesn't impact Terra users",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7494:1292,simpl,simply,1292,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7494,1,['simpl'],['simply']

There are actually multiple existing PAPI v2 Centaur tests in this vein; the one test enabled here for GCP Batch seems to be the simplest and demonstrates the issues clearly enough. The crux of this test is that the Docker image that is specified for the task is in a private repo to which the Centaur service account has been granted access. This test passes on PAPI v2 but on GCP Batch jobs fail with messages like the following visible in `gcloud batch jobs describe`:. ```; Job state is set from RUNNING to FAILED for job projects/1005074806481/locations/us-central1/jobs/job-27607753-d2d5-404d-89af-a786da8ad383.Job; failed due to task failure.

Briefly, the intention is to move the ""rendering"" process inside the `ServiceRegistryActor` so that in the future calls to the ServiceRegistry return JSON rather than event lists. This allows the ""pre-rendered JSON"" metadata service to fulfil the same service interface as the ""database-event driven"" metadata service. ### PR Review Guidance. Most of the PR is noise but the ""signal"" is very important to get right!. Things to consider when reviewing this (perhaps otherwise unwieldy) PR:. - Does the actor structure in the diagrams below make sense?; - ... and does it match reality as implemented in this PR?; - Have the newly introduced actors been implemented well? (ie please review these as though they were brand new actors); - `ReadMetadataRegulatorActor`; - `MetadataBuilderActor`; - `ReadDatabaseMetadataWorkerActor`; - Have the responsibilities of the replaced actors been taken care of appropriately?; - Has the API of Cromwell changed inappropriately?; - I had to refactor the `CallCacheDiffActor` because it was using the metadata service directly. Did I do a good job? And are its new tests appropriately equivalent to its old ones?; - Are there sufficient tests between unit, CI and ""perf"" to make you feel good about me merging this PR?; - Am I forgetting anything?. ### Structure before the changes:. ![Before BA-5842_ Metadata Service Actor (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13006282/64040517-426d4380-cb2b-11e9-8a40-fa11edd33b58.png). ### Structure after the changes:. ![After BA-5842_ Metadata Service Actor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13006282/64040066-24531380-cb2a-11e9-8a74-98d7c976e6ec.png). ### Concerns.

Try using the `default` AWS auth scheme along with the [AWS default credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default) setup on the system / environment. ### Background. Starting in cromwell 37, the AWS S3 SDK was upgraded from `2.0.0-preview-9` to `2.3.9`. Along with this upgrade several cromwell calls to the S3 SDK were updated to match changes in the library. Post upgrade, the existing Cromwell AWS CI tests continue to pass, however there have been reports of permissions problems or other errors.; - https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/discussion/comment/56245/#Comment_56245; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4541; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4686; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4731. Because the CI tests are passing, and they use default credentials, it is possible that each of these issues may be also be worked around by using the [AWS default credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default) scheme. It is unclear how the very similar SDK calls worked with `2.0.0-preview-9` and not `2.3.9`. However the fix might include passing in credentials via the `Map env` / `Properties props`. | Type | Cromwell copy targeting `2.3.9` | ""Original"" targeting `2.0.0-preview-9` |; |----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|; | (Attempted) setting of key/secret from props | [cromwell-37/AmazonS3Factory.java](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/37/filesystems/s3/src/main/java/org/lerch/s3fs/AmazonS3Factory.java",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4740:160,guid,guide,160,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4740,1,['guid'],['guide']
Usability,"### Progress update . I made a fix in liquibase and it was pulled. As a result I can now successfully create a correct cromwell database in SQLite. (At least I think so). There are some problems where SQLite has different types. (I.e. a timestamp is a text field, there is no separate TIMESTAMP column type only TEXT). This causes issues mainly in the testing, but I should be able to resolve this. There are some issues during the testing where Slick (?) or some other part does not seem to recognize foreign keys, primary keys and unique constraints, despite these being clearly there when I look at them with sqlitebrowser. This will require some more digging. As of yet running cromwell in server mode still spawns some errors when using a sqlite database, so I guess it will take some time before I have everything figured out. .

The unit tests should check that the path generation, including paths sent to metadata, are ""hardcoded"" to the current expected paths.

TBD: This is probably something that should be addressed for _all_ backends that can resume jobs on startup.

Usability,"**Edit:** I've encountered more issues here, so putting this on pause. ---. **Short version:** rather than an InstrumentationPath being a `NonEmptyList[String]`, it is now [a more complex type](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/DDO-1728-handle-metric-variance/services/src/main/scala/cromwell/services/instrumentation/CromwellInstrumentation.scala#L48). Everything else is refactoring to match that change. **Long version:**. There's basically two competing models for metric names--""lots of metrics, no labels"" and ""smaller a number of metrics, with labels for variation"". Statsd uses the first, and Prometheus (and Stackdriver too, ideally) use the second. By way of example:. ```; api.response.count.200; ```. versus. ```; api_response_count{code=""200""}; ```. This boils down to how the different systems query metrics. In a StatsD world, you can have a query like `api.response.count.*`, but that's not possible for Prometheus/Stackdriver--the actual metric name needs to be fully static, and you conceptually do `api_response_count{code=""*""}`. Cromwell metric names right now are this:. ```scala; type InstrumentationPath = NonEmptyList[String]. CromwellBucket(prefix: List[String], path: InstrumentationPath); ```. Metric names are guaranteed to not be empty by the path. The path is what is actually assembled in code and passed around, and prefix (or an empty list) is added at the outer edge--most of Cromwell treats the `NonEmptyList[String]` as the metric name. When the metrics are actually sent to StatsD, the strings are joined with periods and sent off. I spent several days trying to figure out a way to reliably parse labels out from these names, and I couldn't figure it out. There's two key pieces of info known at the time the `NonEmptyList[String]` is assembled that are not recorded:; - When a particular string being added to the list is expected to vary frequently (and thus needs to be a label); - What that string means (labels are key-value pairs and we're usu",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6681:64,pause,pause,64,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6681,1,['pause'],['pause']

Usability,"**Update: Non-additive retry counts**. If failures due to preemption can be clearly distinguished from failures due to other causes, I would prefer the failed_task_retries count to be independent of the preemptible count, rather than additive. For example, with failed_task_retries: 2 and preemptible: 2, I would expect the following behavior:; - try 1: preemptible machine, got preempted; - try 2: preemptible machine, other error (not preemption); - try 3: non-preemptible machine, error; - try 4: non-preemptible machine, error; - task fails. We have only retried 3 times here, because one of the non-preemption retries was ""used up"" when try 2 failed. (With additive behavior, we would have retried 4 times.). This behavior would allow users to independently set the retries due to preemption from those due to other causes, to more finely tune the desired behavior.

Usability,"- `.cache` always appears to be `true`, and thus not needed.; - `!isAliveCache.contains` followed by `isAliveCache.get` should be `isAliveCache.getOrElseUpdate(job, IsAliveCache(Instant.now))`.; - There should be only one `SharedFileSystemJob` per `SharedFileSystemAsyncJobExecutionActor`. The reason the values are passed around is because the actor is also partially stateless, using `context.become` to track the `SharedFileSystemJob`. This PR adds state more to the actor, outside of the context, but that shouldn't be needed if the `isAlive` check is switched to running due to multiple `scheduleOnce` calls. The tests are likely timing out because the of the extra checks to `isAlive`. The tests are meant to run as quickly as possible. In general, the order of the job completion checking should always be 1) multiple rc file polls, 2) 30 seconds later `isAlive` checks as necessary. This individual polling per job may overwhelm the SGE scheduler if hundreds or thousands of scatter jobs are running, so more work may need to be done in the future to simplify the qstat process to check jobs in batches. Notes on configuration:. The initial scheduling should also be configurable. It should be off by default. Also, the error code that is returned may want to be configurable and/or we would want the actor to handle this special case differently and reattempt instead of fail. Cromwell's SFS implementation assumes jobs will always be writing their rc files. If something else out there is truly killing the jobs, we will have to wire in a way for `poll` to return a `FailedRetryableExecutionHandle`. I'm not sure that writing a value into the rc file is the best way to do this, and not yet sure what a suitable alternative is also. That's all I've got for now. Thanks again for all your work so far! I'm also game if we move this discussion over to a github issue instead of a PR, as I suspect the final version will look a bit different, and we can discuss and capture any other design the",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/1346#issuecomment-243562238:2384,simpl,simplify,2384,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/1346#issuecomment-243562238,1,['simpl'],['simplify']

Usability,". Path+modtime should guarantee that files are the same. . I have expanded the SFS test scala file so it properly tests the new `cached-inputs` strategy. I have added information on how to use the strategy in the docs, and added this PR to the changelog. ### Help still needed. There are two things that I could not figure out without cromwell developer help:. ~~* Checking whether a file exists and copying it to the cache should never be done by multiple threads simeltaneously. I have used the `synchronized` method to prevent this. I used an object for this, because I am sure it is unique within the JVM at cromwell runtime. This works fine, but I can imagine this can be solved in a nicer way using akka? However the akka documentation is an extensive jungle on its own, and requires quite some expertise to navigate. I could not find very quickly what I needed, and the `synchronization` primitive works fine. It is also **just 2 lines of extra code**. So if the akka solution is quite elegant as well I would like to learn about that. If not, well, it is not too bad having 2 lines of understandable commented code that is not ""the proper way of doing things(TM)"".~~. * I used the SFS scalatests to make sure everything worked correctly. However this did not test whether the thread safety was working correctly. I have added a test wdl in centaur: `standardTestCases/cached_copy/cached_copy.wdl`. This workflow creates 10 jobs that read the same input file. This workflow will crash if the `cached-inputs` cache is not used in a thread-safe way. I tested this manually with `java -Dbackend.providers.Local.config.filesystems.local.localization.0=""cached-copy"" -jar server/target/scala-2.12/cromwell-41-*-SNAP.jar run centaur/src/main/resources/standardTestCases/cached_copy/cached_copy.wdl` . Is there a way to integrate such a test in scalatest file? I have tried the `.par` method, but that did not quite work. I hope you will consider this PR as it solves an important issue for us.

On a related note I personally would love to see cromwell+singularity running under our CI, so that we could all a) point others at the working example and b) be sure the examples continue to work in the future. Most Broadies I know are even greener on Singularity than CircleCI, but I would be keen to learn sometime. Google turned up your earlier work on installing (parts-of?) [Singularity on a Travis VM](https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-ci). That combined with these commented out configs could be a fantastic starting point to getting singularity+cromwell regularly tested together. For a similar example, with cromwell+TES, here is where that CI script installs and runs `funnel`:. https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/9f33e2a867fe20924e4f24e0cba8774f7d6d3132/src/ci/bin/testCentaurTes.sh#L14-L36. A similar script that installs the singularity binaries plus a small cluster(?) and then uses a working config file to run our Centaur test suite would be amazing for users. After it's all working, users are being pointed to docs under https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/, such as https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/TES/. A similar entry should be added for a working/tested singularity setup.

[WDL Forums discussion](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/wdl/discussion/12295/how-to-submit-labels-to-gcs-backend). In #3233 the ability to customize GCS VM labels was removed. My understanding was that this was to lift Google's restrictions on VM labels from the workflow labels. However, I would benefit greatly from the ability to optionally supply labels to each VM. . Specifically, I'm operating my own fork of the [cromwell_on_google](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/tree/master/runners/cromwell_on_google/wdl_runner) tool which I use to spin up large batches of VMs to execute workflows. However, it's hard to pick out individual VMs from the compute api console, especially when running multiple unrelated submissions. My tool creates one Cromwell VM for each submission, which then (via the Google JES backend) starts new VMs for each workflow. To distinguish and filter the VMs in the console, I want to attach two labels to every vm:. * `execution-role` : A label to distinguish between Cromwell VMs and worker VMs; * `submission-id` : A label with submission IDs generated by my tool to distinguish between VMs working on different submissions. The `cromwell-workflow-id` label is helpful, but not convenient if I wish to operate on all VMs working on a single submission _en masse_. The Google genomics API allows me to set `execution-role=Cromwell` and `submission-id={ID}` labels on the Cromwell VMs. However, without Cromwell support, I can't set `execution-role=Worker` and `",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3900:47,feedback,feedback,47,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3900,1,['feedback'],['feedback']

Please attach as much information as possible. -->. # Description. I believe this is a bug. I tried to use `stderr()` in the `output` section of a `workflow`, rather than the output section of a `task`. The resulting WDL validated fine using `womtool validate` (and it validated fine on Terra with the automatic validation they do). But the job would run about halfway and then automatically switch to ""Aborting"" status with no explanation or error message. The workflow would eventually fail after a huge delay (about 22 hours), and there would be no real error message. All tasks that ran were successful (but not all tasks ran). # Minimal WDL example. Here is a working example:. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow my_workflow {; call my_task; }. task my_task {; command {; echo ""hello world""; }; output {; File out = stdout(); }; }; ```. And here is a non-working example that still validates fine using `womtool validate`:. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow my_workflow {; input {; Boolean run_task; }. if (run_task) {; call my_task; }. output {; File out = select_first([my_task.out, stdout()]); }; }. task my_task {; command {; echo ""hello world""; }; output {; File out = stdout(); }; }; ```. The above gives; ```console; (cromwell) [sfleming@laptop:~/cromwell]$ womtool validate test.wdl ; Success!; ```. # The problem. The problem is that the non-working WDL example above should not validate successfully, as it is NOT a valid WDL. The `stdout()` built-in inside the `select_first()` in the `output` block of the `workflow` is not actually allowed. It will cause a very bizarre err",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6976:47,feedback,feedback,47,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6976,1,['feedback'],['feedback']

When running a workflow with `google_project` and/or `google_compute_service_account` workflow options defined, those two options don't take/have any effect on the workflow. The workflow executes in the project defined in the Batch backend config, using the service account defined in the Batch backend config. This breaks the ability to run workflows cross-project from a single cromwell instance with a single gcp backend (which was supported in PAPI). Workarounds like defining multiple backends (each for a separate project/compute sa) are not ideal. Looking through the Batch [backend code](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/4cddc6163b0b1d73e02f3723a82634df852b754b/supportedBackends/google/batch/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/batch/api/GcpBatchRequestFactoryImpl.scala#L168-L169), it seems the issue is the `parent` and `gcpSa` are populated from `batchAttributes` and `gcpBatchParameters` rather than `createParameters` where the workflow options would override the values defined in the backend config.

Normally if there is a few minutes gap between workflows the instances will be terminated by batch and the disks will be reclaimed so each workflow starts from scratch.

Usability,"> I don't have a big problem with this change except that it only half-solves the problem as far as I can see - because one image might have a different root requirement than another image, and restarting Cromwell between running those two tasks is not going to be a viable answer. @cjllanwarne I do agree that different containers might have different requirements. You are completely right. However I do not think this will be a big problem in practice. . - On docker this does not matter. The docker runtime will simply create the required root folder. So there never was a problem here. - For singularity it does. But luckily there is [biocontainers](https://github.com/BioContainers/containers). These all have a `/data` folder. So there this problem is also not applicable. - In case there are people who prefer to invent their own containers instead of using those from biocontainers, they will probably invent their own standard. And if they use some other solution and build on top of that, they will probably adhere to that standard. Furthermore, implementing a solution that enables a per task configuration would:; * Drastically increase the configuration time needed to get a cromwell workflow running with singularity. By orders of magnitude. Since setting a per-task configuration is not going to be fast by any measure.; * Require more complex code to fix.; * Require complex test code to cover all use cases. I think the cost/benefit ratio is rather bad in this case. I do not think there are much use cases for fine-grained control as I outlinded above, and the code requirements are rather high. The fix in the pull request solves the problem that we have (and probably other singularity users have) in the simplest way possible. I think it covers most singularity use cases.

Usability,"> May I get a review on the design, but not the scala?. Wow thanks for adding this. This is exactly what we need on our cluster. Sometimes the scheduler aggressively kills jobs based on VMEM (instead of actual mem). So retrying with upping the memory requirements is a nice way to circumvent this annoying issue. (Instead of using insane memory requirements to make sure it passes in 99% of the cases). As for the design. I would add; 1. A number of attempts configurable parameter in the config. A sane default would be 1. Meaning that this feature will not be used by default, for reasons elaborated on later.; 2. A factor with which the memory is increased on each attempt. So if the factor is 1.5 > Attempt 1 will be 1.5^0 = 1 times the memory, Attempt 2 1.5^1 = 1.5, Attempt 3 = 1.5^2 = 2.25. A sane default here would be 2 I guess. As for @cjllanwarne's concerns:. > The spec defines a maximum memory value, above which Cromwell will never go; ; I think the spec just states the value that should be given to whatever backend. But semantics aside, I guess that means the same as saying it is the maximum. > Cromwell will be able to run WDLs which will not run anywhere else... and thus we would have to be very strict in policing our ""best practices"" WDL to makes sure it can be run on other engines. This is a very good reason to not enable this feature by default. But since there are very good reasons for having this feature, having it as a configurable option will be very very nice. Let the user decide how they want to treat their memory requirements. That is the most user-friendly way to do.

Usability,"@adamstruck I still need to do a more in depth review if you're looking for scala syntax feedback (ex: `case … => { … }` could be `case … => …`). Early feedback:. - PR 1930 contains a few more changes to the standard backend api. I tested cherry-picking 1930 onto this PR to see what would be left to patch up. Using an ""Obsolete"" set of bridge code for now, [these](https://github.com/kshakir/cromwell/commit/19f3bad4ca752ac47ab6f37b694dbdaec8850b36) are the minimal changes for the updated path api, plus changes for standardized command line generation. NOTE: 1930 is still under review and may change, plus the linked github commit will be deleted once these two PRs are merged. - The standard backend will continue to change for a while as we move more common code. For example, the script generation for globs is now centralized as of PR 1930. The only CI testing I am aware of at the moment is `sbt tesBackend/test` that runs under travis. Is there a dockerized solution yet for TES that we could use with travis centaur, like we have for JES and Local? Otherwise, the minimal patches above pass the very, very basic sbt test unit tests. - Your PR is ok as is, but I need to think about necessity of `Async.await` a bit more. The standard backend api is synchronous, requiring the `Async.await`. But the underlying ""basic"" backend trait is using scala futures, and I need more insight into how those are interacting with the akka actors. For example, I wouldn't want the actors receiving multiple akka poll messages in the mailbox and then queuing up dozens of overlapping poll futures in the thread pool. I also really like that your awaits have timeouts and aren't infinite futures. More to come.

Usability,"@aednichols . I implemented the changes. The lock should have a negligible performance impact. It only locks when cached-copy strategy is used, threads which use other strategies are not blocked by this. (This was already true before the changes). A dictionary is used to keep track which files are being copied within the process. Filesystem lock files are too slow for this because during scatters cromwell creates a lot of threads that need exactly the same file at the same time. . A lock file is now used so other cromwell processes know the file is being copied. The chances of two processes needing the same file at exactly the same time is negligible, so lock files are fast enough here. Due to the `synchronized` lock, there can not be race conditions where more than one thread modifies the dictionary and/or creates the lock file at the same time. (The lock is absolutely necessary for cached-copy to work). The amount of time spent in the lock per thread is negligible. . I implemented a waitOnCopy function which lets a thread wait for the locks in the dictionary on the filesystem to clear. This structure allows a lot of paths to be copied to the cache at the same time. So the copying is still multithreaded, maintaining high performance.

Usability,"@cjllanwarne I'm going to take this the complete opposite direction but I'll give you all the credit as it was what you said that led me here. Specifically it started with your statement "" a WDL author can decide when they want their globs to be exploded ..."" my reaction was ""hell no!"" as the point here is system sanctity and not user desire. If the point is to not allow a large glob to take down a cromwell server then we should not allow users to be the ones deciding what's getting processed in a more/less efficient manner. To bend an old gem of wisdom a bit beyond its original meaning, ""never trust the client"". That got me thinking that I think all of this (including my original post) is coming at this all wrong. To the WDL user they should only ever have to think in terms of `File` and `Array[File]`, but that should imply no specific implementation under the hood. I think some of this goes to how tightly coupled WDL is to implementation in Cromwell and how that fact tends to guide our thinking in certain directions. If instead we *always* treated `Array[File]` as a FOFN behind the scenes in a completely invisible to the user manner we'd be able to keep the simplistic sugar of WDL but go even beyond glob situations when it comes to memory savings. That way both `File` and `Array[File]` are internally managed as just a single file path.

Then we get an error:; ```; Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.Exception: Can't build WOM executable from WDL namespace:; No input b found evaluating inputs for expression b; key not found: b; ```. ---. @Horneth commented on [Mon Sep 18 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl4s/issues/217#issuecomment-330214878). This has implications in Cromwell. Namely if `b` was a Call instead of being a boolean, and `import_me.inner` depended on an output of `b`, when we evaluate the inputs of `import_me.inner` it will make a difference whether or not `b` is a sibling of `import_me.inner`. If it is we want to get the output with the same shard number from the output store, otherwise the output with no index (if we rule out nested scatters). We could simplify and say ""always look for the same index and if it's not there take the output with no index"" but it would be better to know for sure which one we need. ---. @mcovarr commented on [Fri Sep 22 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl4s/issues/217#issuecomment-331568932). Sorry if this is a dumb question, but do you understand what's going wrong here? It's obvious looking at this statically what `b` is supposed to be whether it's inside or outside the scatter.

Usability,"@gauravs90 To be clear my primary objection is the assumption will always be tied to state changes and/or all actors involved will be FSM. The analogy to DataAccess isn't the same - the issue with DataAccess was that you were handing the keys to shared mutable state (the DB) to async processes. In this case the metadata service was designed to not work like that. . In my mind there already _is_ an abstraction for metadata, the metadata service. While I'm not opposed to putting something between the engine and it, I still fall back to the point that when the akka people talk about setting up your system so that one actor can share info with another they tend to recommend passing the reference directly and it's only particular situations where things start listening on eventstreams and such. So even if the proposal was to have an intermediary I'd still say to pass the actorref around ... and I still don't see the value in that intermediary if one were to do away with the notion that metadata always equaled state changes. Also I think it'll be far easier to transition _to_ the direction you're talking about than _from_, if things get more complicated we can always do osmething like you're proposing.

Usability,"@geoffjentry Verbosity is just a small part of that. Making different parts of the code aware of the each other, where avoidable, doesn't seem like a very good idea. If I'm not mistaken, what you're saying (and what I initially implemented) is something like the erstwhile `DataAccess` (which would be the `ServiceRegistoryActor` in the current world). With this, each step (actor) of the workflow had a reference to it and pushed to it independently. Any change to the dataAccess might have required changes to all the classes which were accessing it. Alternatively, if there was just one entity which handled the responsibility of collecting the metadata, by sniffing around the actors without their knowledge, and then pushed to the database, we need only change this entity for any modifications if there were to happen to the data access stuff. I'll try to explain with a very simple (and silly) analogy: (Honestly, couldn't come up with anything better.); Consider a ginormous Octopus (= `ServiceRegistry`) with a black ink on the tips of it's tentacles, with each of it's legs touching upon different rooms (= classes) in a house. If someday we decide to replace that octopus with something else, we'll be needing to wipe that ink from all the rooms upon which it was standing. On the other hand, if it were to sit and cuddle up just in a single room, there's simply less and comparatively easy work to do to wipe that up. It's simply the same idea here. The Metadata producing entities in the engine can just go about minding their own business, while a third party (those classes with some weird names currently [CromwellProfilerFsm and WorkflowProfilerActor]) handle what they are meant to do: Profile a given workflow execution.

Usability,"@geoffjentry asked me to clarify, so here I am!. Currently, PAPI doesn't understand FOFN... so they are really just a File that contains strings. Often they are created by taking the file output of a scatter call as an array and writing it to an array like. ```; Array[File] vcfs = PreviousTask.output ...; File fofn = write_lines(vcfs); ```. Then that FOFN is used as the parameter to the task, and used by the tool in the command directly. The only thing that gets localized by PAPI is the FOFN itself. Keep in mind right now that the only scenario where this works is where your docker has access to the file, which on Google means when you're running in service account mode, but hopefully we can overcome that in the future. Just for context, my use case here is more like 'resume' than call caching. I don't expect to find results from some previous/other run of the pipeline. It's really that something broke, I tweaked the WDL, and now want to basically pick up where I left off. That's the specific problem I have (and any methods developer will have with a FOFN step). There are two ways I can think of going about this:. 1. Fix call caching to handle FOFNs specifically. This is tricky I think, but is most robust. In this case, I want Cromwell to understand a File of File references as a specific type but just for call caching purposes. 2. Change call caching to re-use files rather than copying, thus the path of the file doesn't changes, the FOFN doesn't change, and the call cache hits. This is how I ended up working around this by splitting the WDL into pieces where I supply the inputs to avoid the cache-miss step. I believe we have this option in the SFS?. In your proposal @cjllanwarne a FileRef would be hashed like a file for job avoidance, but treated like a string for all other purposes (e.g. passing to PAPI, etc)?

Usability,"@horneth - so I see 2 Futures in here. One the little bit changing the state (around the Props) and the other was resolveAndEvaluate. As background for my statement I'll say the following:; - We've already seen firsthand the havoc which can erupt from having Futures rolling around inside an Actor. They break the Actor Model's abstraction that the internals of an actor are single threaded, meaning you now have to reason about shared mutable state, etc. We _can_ do that, but there are easier paths than actors to deal with that. We've been better about this recently but my concern is that it's too easy for stuff like that to sneak into what were previously pure Futures. Mixing Futures & Actors is not really a great idea.; - There are two async operations in the actor, which means that it is certainly doing two different things (I'll admit that the creation of an actor is a fairly lame 'thing'), disrupting Akka's mantra that actors should do one thing only. What I was suggesting was that the work being performed by these Futures be themselves pushed to their own actors. When they complete they can message back to this one, and those messages could be use to manage state transitions and such.

I don't see why it should be left to the user to perform the caching manually. This would be more similar to what was hacked for the shared filesystem backend in #5063 and maybe a more general solution non-specific to the PAPIv2 backend would eliminate the need for such a hack.

Or do I point out that they should be changed as I did on this one and you get upset again? . TBH what really catches my eye and leads me to closer scrutiny in the first place is that you consistently bounce between multiple styles of calling these things, often within the same larger block of code. Unlike the style guide, I don't have a preference between the two primary modes people use (admittedly it's because I prefer the one they don't, although I begrudgingly use their favorite) as long as they're generally self-consistent (and/or there's a reason to deviate for a particular one, it happens). Similarly little things like is it `case (k, v)` or `case (k,v)`. I don't care, but I'd rather not see it bouncing back and forth all over the place over 50 lines of code. Pick one and be consistent.

Usability,"AWS default credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default) setup on the system / environment. ### Background. Starting in cromwell 37, the AWS S3 SDK was upgraded from `2.0.0-preview-9` to `2.3.9`. Along with this upgrade several cromwell calls to the S3 SDK were updated to match changes in the library. Post upgrade, the existing Cromwell AWS CI tests continue to pass, however there have been reports of permissions problems or other errors.; - https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/discussion/comment/56245/#Comment_56245; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4541; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4686; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4731. Because the CI tests are passing, and they use default credentials, it is possible that each of these issues may be also be worked around by using the [AWS default credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default) scheme. It is unclear how the very similar SDK calls worked with `2.0.0-preview-9` and not `2.3.9`.

Usability,"Because writing to the call caching store and the job store is not atomic, the following chain of events is possible and not necessarily desirable:. - A job start; - A cache hit is found; - The outputs are copied; - The hashes / simpletons are written to the DB; - ** Cromwell Stops **: This is after the hashes are written successfully but before the EJEA had a chance to write the outputs to the job store and mark the job as complete.; - Cromwell starts; - The workflow is restarted; - The job is not found in the job store; - At this point the EJEA has a state to check if there are hashes existing for this job already. If there is, it disables call caching (so that the EJEA doesn't try to call cache to himself, and that we don't write to the hash store again - which would fail because of the unique index in the call cache table).; - However since we've disabled call caching we then proceed to try and recover the job, which fails because it was never run (since we found a cache hit the first time), and then falls back to running the job for reals. This is not great because this job already has all the outputs it needs, files have been copied already, but we run the job on top of it, which seems to increase the likelihood of having empty files at least locally when trying to read outputs and cause `cannot create an Int from """"` types of failures. Maybe a better way would be to re-use the outputs that have been written to the cache to make the job succeed and bypass all the rest.

I queried METADATA_ENTRY with this WHERE condition: `(WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UUID ='29791b64-b47a-44ba-aff0-7ab48bc10677' or WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UUID ='5de042e3-7a03-4c77-8972-f0e4cd010e4b') and CALL_FQN = 'sampleLevelWorkflow_WGS.align' and JOB_SCATTER_INDEX =0`; 2.

The implementation here could be very similar to (though simpler than) the [file hash caching](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4143/files) system.,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4226:393,simpl,simpler,393,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4226,1,['simpl'],['simpler']

Usability,"For further clarification. There are two `exec` statements in the config. The `exec` statement **before** the submit command will execute a simple echo command. If singularity notices the image is not there it will pull it to `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`. ; Then the job is submitted and the `exec` statement **in** the submit command is executed. If `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` is on a shared filesystem the image will already be present. The image will *not* be pulled by the execution node and the job executes right away. Using `exec` instead of `pull` means that Singularity will decide where the image goes, and not the user. This is quite useful as Singularity has all the functionality to make a functional image cache already built-in.

Usability,"Full sketch of the idea as it applied to the pluggable_backends branch below. This particular ticket is concerned only with moving the DB code and having the engine be able to work with backends to determine which calls are resumable. Those might really be two separate pieces that two people could work in parallel. Cromwell would need to wake up and scan its database for Running workflows with Running calls. Something in Cromwell would then need to classify calls into resumable or not resumable. e.g. for JES, figure out if Cromwell has a JES Run ID that could be used to resume polling an already-launched JES run. Only the JES backend would know how to make this determination, but backends don’t have access to the database. So Cromwell would need to gather up representations of possibly resumable executions, examine on which backend type the executions had been running, create CallActors for each execution using a specified backend type (not a currently supported use case), and send a Restart message parameterized by the representation of the execution. The CallActor would need to create a backend of the specified type and then ask that backend if the execution is resumable. Resumable executions would result in a Resumed message making its way back to the WorkflowActor, otherwise WorkflowActor would get a NotResumable message. For NotResumable executions the WorkflowActor should be free to choose whatever backend it pleases to restart the call and shouldn’t necessarily be bound by the backend type that was chosen for the previous attempt.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/581#issuecomment-197643112:577,resume,resume,577,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/581#issuecomment-197643112,2,"['Resume', 'resume']","['Resumed', 'resume']"

Usability,"Greetings, my illustrious Cromwellian friends!. I find your workflow engine indispensable but am still running into problems related to this issue. PR #2280 fixes part of the problem, but only for the local backend. I am trying to use the official Picard docker:; https://hub.docker.com/r/broadinstitute/picard/~/dockerfile/. Here is a simplified version of my WDL for illustration purposes:. task picard{; command {; CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics; }; runtime{; docker:""broadinstitute/picard""; }; }. workflow picardwf {; call picard; }. If I locally do; `docker run broadinstitute/picard CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics`. I get the behavior I expect -- in this simplified example, it prints out the help command for CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics. (The Dockerfile specifies an entrypoint that calls a script in the container and passes ""CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics"" to it.). When running with the JES backend, however, I get:; '/tmp/ggp-298770331' is not a valid command. See PicardCommandLine -h for more information.'. Cromwell has inserted a file path immediately after the image name in the docker run command:; `Running command: docker run -v /tmp/ggp-298770331:/tmp/ggp-298770331 -v /mnt/local-disk:/cromwell_root -e exec=/cromwell_root/exec.sh -e picard-rc.txt=/cromwell_root/picard-rc.txt -e __extra_config_gcs_path=gs://<path_redacted> broadinstitute/picard@sha256:1ddf5888182718c55054c96dca6a5d65d23a703f98e66832400e4837d04854a7 /tmp/ggp-298770331`. I don't think this default behavior makes sense for any backend. It should either override the entrypoint by default (as the local backend now does) or -- this would be much better -- it would work with the existing entrypoint. A lot of published containers specify an entrypoint, which means when running in Cromwell they can't really be used as intended with that entrypoint. To get them running at all requires changing Cromwell's config to ignore the entrypoint, and then if you want to use the entrypoint you have to re-specify it as",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2256#issuecomment-322892247:336,simpl,simplified,336,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2256#issuecomment-322892247,2,['simpl'],['simplified']

Usability,"Hi @geoffjentry - thanks for the prompt and detailed response. It makes sense to submit using curl instead. That might save most of the 2.5 seconds. But since your fast-polling hello world test still took 7 seconds from pickup to completion, I still think this would be frustratingly slow. I'm familiar with Snakemake (and about two dozen other similar tools to be found scattered across the web) but I think WDL is better in a number of ways. The main points that I like are (1) that the workflow language is clearly separated from the execution engine, (2) that the language is much more human-readable than CWL, and (3) the possibility to serialize/deserialize values, e.g., so that (3a) simple operations, e.g., concatenation of different results can be done in the workflow language and (3b) one can do things like mapping a task over a set of values coming out of another task. It is also nice that (4) there is a rather solid set of backing organizations behind WDL and Cromwell. As far as I know, this combination of properties gives WDL a rather unique value proposition. Maybe there is room for a simpler local-only WDL execution engine focused on speed and rapid iteration. That could be used for development and then the execution of production workflows on various cloud backends etc could still be done by Cromwell. I was dabbling one weekend a few months ago with a local-only Python compiler/execution engine for WDL. If optimal execution speed is not a must, it does not look too hard to support most of the WDL spec on a local machine. I'm closing this issue for now.

Usability,"Hi Kristian,. I understand, but what you're asking is very possible - see my previous discussion here about creating 1 billion simultaneous connections, and anything that is not accessible can be pre-cached via buckets during idle periods (i.e. nightly):. https://github.com/googlegenomics/utils-java/issues/62#issuecomment-220444203. So you should be able to create your own Pipeline implementation very easily via `gloud create`, [VM metadata startup scripts](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/step-by-step-guide/setting-metadata-and-startup-scripts) and/or Dataflow Pipelines, and mimic JES:. https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/create. https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/step-by-step-guide/setting-metadata-and-startup-scripts. https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/pipelines/constructing-your-pipeline#applying-transforms-to-process-pipeline-data. If you look at the JES API, you'll notice most of it mirrors the `gcloud` commands and parameters:. https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/genomics/v1alpha2/rest. Again the concepts to speed up searches on dynamically streaming (processed) analysis results has a foundation via inverted indices, which search engines use all the time - I posted a couple of these here:. https://github.com/ga4gh/schemas/pull/253#issuecomment-97525342. https://github.com/ga4gh/schemas/issues/142#issuecomment-55518571.

Usability,"Hi Luyu,. Thanks for the feedback. This is an interesting case. Normally if there is; a few minutes gap between workflows the instances will be terminated by; batch and the disks will be reclaimed so each workflow starts from scratch. However in your case there isn’t a pause in work long enough for Batch to; shut down the instances. Also because these files are written to a mounted disk they are not deleted; when the container terminates. I think this fix is simple if I add a cleanup step. I will do this ASAP. Thanks,; Mark.

Usability,"Hi all, . I'm encountering an issue when using the AWS Batch backend. I'm using the EFS (local) file system for the backend, not S3. I've got a workflow that downloads fastq files as an initial step. These jobs fail non-deterministically ; a fraction of the time. These jobs are a scatter over an input array of fastq files, and most of them generally complete. However, 20% of the shards might fail in any given scatter. A complete job will have the following outputs in the shard output folder:; ```; download_fastq-0-rc.txt ; download_fastq-0-stderr.log ; download_fastq-0-stdout.log ; input_fastq_specified_R1.fq.gz ; script ; tmp.71626c8d/; ```. When cromwell submits the job, it auto-generates a script to download the fastq. It's a very simple job, so here's an example script:. ```; #!/bin/bash. cd /EFSROOT/cromwell_execution/FE_Somatic_Mutect2/ed746149-883f-4ef1-8b95-d3e9d7cd1423/call-download_normal/shard-1; tmpDir=$(mkdir -p ""/gstore/cromwell_execution/FE_Somatic_Mutect2/ed746149-883f-4ef1-8b95-d3e9d7cd1423/call-download_normal/shard-1/tmp.bf92fa27"" && echo ""/gstore/cromwell_execution/FE_Somatic_Mutect2/ed746149-883f-4ef1-8b95-d3e9d7cd1423/call-download_normal/shard-1/tmp.bf92fa27""); chmod 777 ""$tmpDir""; export _JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.io.tmpdir=""$tmpDir""; export TMPDIR=""$tmpDir""; export HOME=""$HOME""; (; cd /gstore/cromwell_execution/FE_Somatic_Mutect2/ed746149-883f-4ef1-8b95-d3e9d7cd1423/call-download_normal/shard-1. ); outed746149=""${tmpDir}/out.$$"" erred746149=""${tmpDir}/err.$$""; mkfifo ""$outed746149"" ""$erred746149""; trap 'rm ""$outed746149"" ""$erred746149""' EXIT; tee '/gstore/cromwell_execution/FE_Somatic_Mutect2/ed746149-883f-4ef1-8b95-d3e9d7cd1423/call-download_normal/shard-1/download_normal-1-stdout.log' < ""$outed746149"" &; tee '/gstore/cromwell_execution/FE_Somatic_Mutect2/ed746149-883f-4ef1-8b95-d3e9d7cd1423/call-download_normal/shard-1/download_normal-1-stderr.log' < ""$erred746149"" >&2 &; (; cd /gstore/cromwell_execution/FE_Somatic_Mutect2/ed746149-883f-4ef1-8b95",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5421:744,simpl,simple,744,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5421,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"Hi everyone, . When I use cromwell + PBS backend I found the way that jobs are scheduled has some differences from using PBS alone. For example, I have a pipeline of 2 steps, A-B, where B depends on A. Now I want to submit this pipeline for 2 times which will generate 4 jobs A1 B1 A2 B2. Let's assume the cluster only have resource to run one of the jobs at a time. . When I use PBS alone all of the 4 jobs will be in the queue, at the beginning A1 gets to run and the others waiting. When A1 is done B1, A2 both have a chance to run depending on the priority PBS assigns to them. So the order of the four jobs might be A1-B1-A2-B2 or A1-A2-B1-B2. When I use cromwell + PBS backend cromwell will first send A1 and A2 to the queue without B1 and B2 since they won't be ready to run until A1 and A2 are done. When A1 is done A2 gets to run because it's the only job in the queue while B1 is on its way to the queue. So in this case the order of these jobs can only be A1-A2-B1-B2. This is not big issue when there are only a few pipelines to run. However, when I have, say 100 such pipelines, B1 has to wait until A100 to finish since when A1 finishes A2-A99 are already in the queue waiting and B1 has just set off. This means the finishing time of pipeline1(A1-B1) will be affected a lot by the total number of pipelines submitted to cromwell engine. . Is there any way for cromwell to change this situation (like sending all jobs to the backend without blocking any of them)? I really don't want to wait until all ""A""s to finish to get the first result of submitted pipelines. Hope I have made this problem clear. I have read the documents of cromwell and googled quit a bit but didn't find any solution. . Any help would be appreciated!.

Usability,"Hi everyone, this is as far as I can get on my own trying to introduce SQLite support into Cromwell. I have highlighted reasons to support Sqlite on Cromwell elsewhere.

Usability,"Hi everyone,. I got an idea (read ""stole it from another tool"") that WDL files can easily be made executable using shebang lines. . Instead of calling:; ```; java -jar ${CROMWELL_JAR} run example/hello.wdl -i example/hello.input.json; ```. By using a `#!/usr/bin/env cromwexe` shebang line in our WDL file, we can call simply:; ```; example/hello.wdl -i example/hello.input.json; ```. See my working prototype:; https://github.com/prihoda/cromwexe. The only thing `cromwexe` is doing at the moment is passing all args to the regular java command:; ```python; cmd = [""java"", ""-jar"", cromwell_jar, ""run""] + sys.argv[1:]; ```; It starts to get interesting once you realize that if we can parse the workflow script inside `cromwexe`, we can automatically generate a command-line interface that parses the args directly from the command line (and even provide a help screen with descriptions of all input args):; ```; example/hello.wdl -i example/hello.defaults.json --sayHello.name World; ```. We can also parse the job metadata output of cromwell to determine the location of our output files and move them over from the execution folder to the user's working folder, if the user provides the output arg as well:; ```; example/hello.wdl -i example/hello.defaults.json --sayHello.name World --output.greeting greeting.txt; ```; Edit: I see that this can be done by the `use_relative_output_paths` or `final_workflow_outputs_dir` args. Then I guess the added functionality is that output args could be used to define each output file path separately. I have two questions :); 1) What do you think?

Usability,"Hi, I'm now getting this behaviour always - not occasionally. . This is problematic because I can never get cromwell to submit any jobs: it always crashes before it can get to submit anything. . I've found that I only get this error while I'm polling the cromwell server - stopping the polling takes the problem away (but I need to poll for status). This is my scenario - may be used as steps to reproduce:; * I've got ~8k workflows in ""running"" status. Each workflow has a WDL 120 lines long + ~300 lines of WDL imports; * Another machine polls for the status of these workflows every minute, using the POST query method; * When I start the cromwell server, it starts to recap on pending work and parse running workflows WDLs, and then crashes before getting to resume any workflow. It appears to crash when I poll for workflow status. I'm querying the status for all ~8K workflow IDs at once - this may be related.

Usability,"Hi,. Sorry for submitting an issue here but I'm consistently getting a ""Something has gone wrong"" error trying to log in to your Jira. I'm hoping someone can offer some guidance for an issue I'm having running a CWL workflow with Cromwell on GCP. I'm using bcbio to generate CWL to do joint calling. This worked fine when I tested it with a single sample to shake out any issues with the pipeline. However when scaling up to a 20 sample batch there's an issue with the get_parallel_regions_jointvc step. This step appears to be localizing multiple copies of the reference genome data (one for each sample) to the same disk. This really blows up the storage requirements as the number of samples increase and ends up exhausting the storage allocated to the worker instance.

Usability,"Hmm, that's interesting on the google side. So I'm clear you're saying that Cromwell is showing Running when they were not in Google? If so, how long did that stay the case - was it in perpetuity? I ask because as the number of jobs increases the average latency between a state change on Google's side and Cromwell detecting it increases due to QPS limitations. We're always trying to work with them to find ways to make that faster but we're limited on how many things we can query about at once, so we round robin them through. As an example the other day I submitted 200k single call workflows which each only slept for a couple of seconds but it took upwards of an hour for Cromwell to know that everything was complete due to that. I'm still going to look into the root cause of the exceptions you saw, i've been seeing those a lot myself (but had reason to believe it was an artifact of my not-at-all-standard setup, glad you chimed in to fix that for me) and wanted to make sure they weren't masking something more fundamentally wrong. re the logging aspect, I agree completely - this has always been an issue and is growing the more the people start adopting Cromwell. I found it amusing that just hours prior I said I should change that one to be less frightening and then it frightened someone ;) In general I think that logging is always a a dark art but answering the ""who is the log for?"" is even harder here as we intentionally designed cromwell to satisfy multiple use cases all of whom have different things they want to see.

Biggest issue-- 10 seconds is right on the edge for testing _and_ checking the docker server for the hash, so different docker tests currently timeout intermittently. Among other issues I saw, `Future` exception handling may be different due to refactoring. For example converting `Future { /* big block */ }` to `/* big block */ hashFuture.map(hash => ...)` allows exceptions within the block to not get caught (as expected?). Also I wasn't sure yet how we want to handle some `Failure` cases, specifically when the docker server doesn't return a hash. I assume that means that we should just run again from scratch, and NOT go to a `FailedExecution` state in the database.

Usability,"I am currently running cromwell standalone **run** mode for running jobs. However, when I try to run two jobs at the same time, I get a connection time out(*see stack trace below).

Usability,"I had a bit of troubles with getting this working, but wanted to report back and hopefully someone can learn from my misunderstandings. Just skip to the results for the tl;dr. **Goal**: Find a suitable replacement (preferably drop in) to Docker. The two main contenders were Singularity and udocker. When you run a docker container through Cromwell, it runs a special submit script that gets the [container id](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#capture-container-id---cidfile) through `--dockercid expected/path/to/dockercid`, _waits_ for the docker container to finish and then manually moves the `rc` file to the expected location. ### My misunderstanding. This docker script erroneously led me to believe that Cromwell needs job identifier and it uses some mechanism to continually check the status of that job. But in fact Cromwell doesn't really poll the workload manager, but my understanding from #1499 is that it actively polls the filesystem, looking for the `rc` file within the execution directory (potentially `stdout` too if its looking for the job id). This is also logically verified by looking at the `script` file that Cromwell generates, the way it collects the return code and places it in the expected directory. - Based on my initial incorrect understanding, I then believed if I couldn't get the containerId, then how would Cromwell know that the job has actually finished. ### My additional errors. These tended to redirect me away from the actual misunderstanding. . 1. In the udocker config I [posted before](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4039#issuecomment-454569364) (corrected with comment), I was accidentally providing the `--entry-point` param, which was causing an interactive shell to open, stopping the rest of the script from executing. 2. I failed to notice that `${out}` and `${err}` change between `submit` and `submit-docker`. When I would check the job that Cromwell schedules through SLURM, it would always fail.

Usability,"I'm trying to run a WDL file which specifies a Docker container in the runtime attributes of a task. I'm trying to do so on an SGE HPC with a shared file system. Running this with docker is not an option because I don't have root rights/access. Instead, I'm trying to run it using Singularity. This works fine when using a custom runtime attribute to define the container and using the `submit` configuration. However, if the `docker` attribute and `submit-docker` configuration are used I run into a problem:; Cromwell will use `docker_cwd` (instead of `cwd`) in the call's script. `docker_cwd` however does not exist in the container and can therefore not be mounted (due to a lack of sudo rights), like you would normally do when using Docker. The result is that the job will fail because it can't find a folder that is referenced in the script. Is there some way for me to override the `docker_cwd` value in my backend configuration? I would prefer not to use the `submit` configuration, as not all tasks currently list a container, so I need the `submit` configuration for those tasks. <!--; Hi!

Usability,"I've been working on this issue in parallel. My general recommendation would be to **not use GCR for _public_ images** as there is a perpetual risk of egress charges to the image owner. GCR is great for keeping more of your workflow infrastructure inside Google Cloud, but egress charges will be billed to you as the owner of the storage bucket. [Artifact registry seems to have its own set of egress charges](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/pricing), similar to GCS egress charges. Alternatively, services like [quay.io](https://quay.io/plans/) offer unlimited storage and serving of public repos. The consequence of not using GCR is that docker images are now hosted outside of Google Cloud, meaning workflows will need to make an external network call to download the image. The external call will require VMs to have an external IP address. Large parallel workflows will need quota for several external IP addresses, and may run into quota limits. . To alleviate this, workflow runners could be instructed to make a copy of the image into their own GCR. This also has the advantage that the workflow runner can use a repository in the same location as their VMs. Workflow publishers should include instructions on how to upload the image to a private GCR. . How does that sound as a set of guidelines for the community?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6442#issuecomment-902091238:1305,guid,guidelines,1305,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6442#issuecomment-902091238,1,['guid'],['guidelines']

Usability,"I've thought some more about this, and my guess is that this was never implemented because AWS supports auto-expanding compute disks, as explained here: https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/aws-batch/create-custom-ami/. This is of course a great feature, but unfortunately it means that WDL written for Google Cloud will fail when run on AWS because it doesn't understand more complex disk specs. To fix this, I suggest that we expand the `LocalDiskPattern` to include the disk size and type, but simply ignore it. This will mean that disk specs such as `local-disk 100 HDD` will be interpreted to have the same meaning as `local-disk`, but will add greater compatibility to the AWS executor.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4274#issuecomment-430881926:505,simpl,simply,505,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4274#issuecomment-430881926,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Usability,"In the [README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/25/README.md#sun-gridengine-backend), it's buried and could be clearer, but it says:. > There are two special runtime attribute configurations, cpu, and memory_\<unit\>.; > …; > When the runtime attribute configuration Int memory_\<unit\> or Float memory_\<unit\> is specified, it is provided to submit by the runtime attribute in WDL memory. (slightly better formatting in the README). There's more ""what"" in the README, but the ""why"" extends from the fact that JES, TES, and other backends all use a common `memory` runtime attribute. Using this common runtime attribute name, `memory`, increases the chance that a WDL will be runnable on a different backends. In a WDL run on standard backends, `memory` is specified as a WDL string, parsed by the backends into a [`MemorySize`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/25/backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/MemorySize.scala#L39). However, the Config backend used for SLURM, SGE, Local, etc., needs to covert the `MemorySize` back into a string, for embedding into the custom `submit` string. The `_<unit>` in `memory_<unit>` is how the `MemoryUnit` gets converted into a string. Say someone defines a WDL originally intended to run on the JES backend, containing a task with `memory: ""2 GB""`. If instead, this same WDL will be run on a Config backend, and the config specifies `Int memory_mb`, the string value of `memory_mb` passed into `submit` will expand to `2000`. Let us know if you have more questions and/or suggestions, or if this resolves this particular issue for now?. **TL;DR memory_\<unit\> is one of the reserved runtime-attribute names, meant to make WDLs more portable.**",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2068#issuecomment-287266090:127,clear,clearer,127,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2068#issuecomment-287266090,1,['clear'],['clearer']

While there are plenty of key-values that are easily generalized, and can be fixed for such a section, backends almost invariably have specialized specific options that are best controlled on the fly rather than via fixed configs.

Usability,"More details that emerged over the past couple weeks:. In the past, the Local and JES backends extended the ABJEA. When the Local and JES backends were merged into Standard, there was a lot of work in the Standard not to mess with the existing ABJEA. This turns out to have not been necessary. The only known extension of the ABJEA is now the Standard implementation, the `StandardAsyncExecutionActor` (SAEA). Thus, one is now free to merge the SAEA and ABJEA, and remove the promises-of-results, futures-of-handles, etc. with a simplified actor/fsm. Similarly, while there is a Standard actor that extends the `BackendJobExecutionActor` (BJEA), this isn't necessary either! As the actors are untyped, any implementation that receives and responds to correct messages will work. Thus the `StandardSyncExecutionActor` (SSEA) could be refactored also, and even merging the SSEA and the SAEA into a single actor/fsm. Also, when considering rewrites, it was also noted that the term ""sync/async"" in the SSEA/SAEA names were confusing. Possible alternatives were StandardFutureExecutionActor / StandardMessagingExecutionActor. Again this may be moot if the actors are merged into a single actor.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1218#issuecomment-289853897:529,simpl,simplified,529,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1218#issuecomment-289853897,1,['simpl'],['simplified']

Usability,"On your last question, yeah that's basically it (although there was a request by Lee to refer to it as a `Path` and there was even some discussion that perhaps it should be cloud URL only so e.g. `CloudPath`). Despite the nomenclature the idea would be a type which would be treated as a String except that Cromwell would understand that it represents a file for things like call caching and handle them appropriately. Unlike a `File` the underlying path is never localized, it's always maintained as-is. Coercion between `File` and this new type would be seamless. I'll use `FileRef` for examples w/o necessarily endorsing that term. In a much simpler example where you have a single `FileRef` it'd be treated just like a `String` when it came to a command block, e.g. task foo {; FileRef bar; File baz. command {; grep ${bar} ${baz}; }; }. This would be grepping the delocalized path referenced by `bar` in the contents of the localized file `baz`. For the `Array[FileRef]`/`writelines()` examples, the belief was that if the writelines was in the command block (or the declaration? crap, now I forget which) that call caching would work as desired as the individual `FileRef`s would have their hashes checked *prior* to the FOFN generation. Moving away from your specific situation, I alluded to `CloudPath` above.

Usability,"Part of the #2942 work involved converting the config backend to use the WOM API. The config backend uses WDL to define its commands but it does not have a workflow (it's a WdlNamespace with a bunch of tasks). This conversion mostly went smoothly with the exception of uninitialized task optionals like `docker_user` found in the Local backend's `submit-docker`:. ```; runtime-attributes = """"""; String? docker; String? docker_user; """"""; submit = ""/bin/bash ${script}""; submit-docker = """"""; docker run \; --cidfile ${docker_cid} \; --rm -i \; ${""--user "" + docker_user} \; --entrypoint /bin/bash \; -v ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} \; ${docker} ${script}; """"""; ```; Evaluating that `${""--user "" + docker_user}` expression currently blows up with no useful diagnostics in the absence of an explicit `docker_user` input. To hack around this I changed the config backend to force in `none` inputs for all optional declarations in a task, but this would have the effect of clobbering any initialized optionals:. ```; String? docker_user = ""mobydock""; ```. With the #2942 changes `docker_user` would be forced to `none` and `""mobydock""` would be lost (at sea). It's not clear why this is happening when using the WOM API at a task level and not at the workflow level.

I suspect your workflow got stuck after failing because the `WomArray` code [throws an exception](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/wom/src/main/scala/wom/values/WomArray.scala#L37) that screws up control flow.

Usability,"Since it's been a month I thought I'd post an update. Main items:; - In general I'm having to make a lot more changes to the Scala code than I expected due to queries being written in a way that Postgres doesn't like. (This isn't a criticism, more of a heads-up.) Nothing functional, just refactoring.; - The way `Blob` is handled in Slick+Postgres turns out to be a massive pain. I'm not sure if Slick is lazy-loading these fields or I just don't understand how it works under the hood, but the workaround is that the blobs need to be accessed as part of a transaction, which involved some refactoring of downstream processing.; - Semi-related question: is there a reason why the entire contents of the `importsZip` need to be stored in the database? This quickly leads to an enormous METADATA_ENTRY table - possibly because I have call caching turned on, I haven't checked whether this is the cause yet.; - The auto-incremented fields that are `Option[Long]` in the data model can't be handled the same way in Postgres; I haven't decided whether this is simply different database behavior or a bug somewhere. Anyway I found a workaround for that too.; - I may have messed up and branched from `master` in my fork by mistake, and in any case I'm definitely out of sync with your `develop`. Do you have a preferred workflow to bring my branch up to date, i.e. to minimize the mess in the Git history? (Despite using Git daily I'm still not totally sure what ""best practice"" is.).

Usability,"So I think I'm now clear regarding the options on this thread. One option, and the original one discussed, is a container entrypoint (""Orchestrator"" as @danbills put it). Another option, which is what I originally thought was being discussed, is an always-running sidecar. That entrypoint container would then launch our target container, similar to something like https://ohsu-comp-bio.github.io/funnel/ or https://github.com/delagoya/batch-task-runner. IMHO, the entrypoint/Orchestrator introduces some unnecessary complexity. It works for a simple case, but leaves a lot of configuration as TBD. To implement this properly we'd need to implement a standard task definition for the entrypoint (or Orchestrator) container (simple), but also pass to that container all the necessary docker parameters necessary for implementing the target container (much more difficult). There is also the question of supervision for the target container as the entrypoint/Orchestrator is hiding from batch and Cromwell the actual task's status. Also, the permissions issues I brought up in my comment above apply. I also have some concerns about the implementation of this approach within Cromwell, as I believe (but I'm not certain), this scheme would require some non-trivial changes to the StandardAsyncExecutionActor class as well as the AwsBatchAsyncExecutionActor logic (likely moreso on the later). I haven't investigated, but I also have some concerns over whether this mechanism would require significant rework of the process input/output and return code. It looks like @delagoya may have considered this in the batch-task-runner repo, but I'm not clear on this after the limited time I've had reviewing the repo. So, with that in mind, I spent a bit of time researching the ""always on sidecar"" approach, which I'll reference as ""cromwell agent"" moving forward for clarity.

Usability,"Something like this will be great for users who just want something simple. We may need to add warnings to the Cromwell docs depending on how this ticket is implemented. The specific behavior this ticket aims to emulate / implement should be further refined with respect to HSQLDB. Plugging in `file:` will absolutely work for ""hello world"". But if one runs cromwell(s) the wrong way the db may become corrupted/deadlocked negating the ability to call-cache. Many databases have minimal to no support for sharing an embedded instance between concurrent procs. SQLite has the most ""support"" afaik but a) would require _a lot_ of custom Cromwell code, and b) still has other issues such as in NFS environments. Depending on whomever this ticket is aimed at, if they're using an HPC environment like our methods users do we'd have to be careful not to store a multiprocess embedded DB on NFS. Today with HSQLDB `mem:` cromwell uses a pair of ephemeral database connection pools. I'm not sure the behavior if both pools are pointed at the same HSQLDB `file:`, but I think it might work as the docs only warn of connecting from multi-process not multi-pool. The default config mentioned in this ticket may still consider using separate `file:` instances just in case. All issues above have workarounds with varying degrees of difficulty and/or documentation warnings. For example one could clarify the documentation with ""Cromwell only supports one instance connecting to the pair of default _file:_ databases at a time."" Or: ""Cromwell only supports call caching when running a workflow with the same name"" because we did something like generate the db file based on the workflow name. Another option, instead of having multiple processes access the same embedded DB, is to research spinning up a background daemon db process, which do support multiple connections. Links to consider when defining acceptance criteria are below. .

Usability,"Sorry all. I was WAY off base about that ""scalability"" thing. It turns out, if one shutdowns one's database pool, the database doesn't allow you to open any new connections. :blush:. Perhaps someday, someone will run `ab` against cromwell and see where it really does fall over, but today wasn't that day. Based on the exceptions I saw, I mistakenly thought it was an internal pool being starved, but when I actually attached a debugger, found out it was because the pool wasn't really _there_ anymore.

Currently, even with simpler refactoring to remove calling `DataAccess.instance.shutdown()`, there seems to be something else weird in `data_access_singleton` that I need to figure out.

Usability,"Submitting for discussion. This change should fix some of the errors of this type we're seeing by clearing cache for both relevant workflows instead of just one. However, it will only do so in the specific case where the initial test failure happens when checking cache behavior, because that's the only time we have easy access to the id of the associated workflow. My assumption is that this will reduce the likelihood of this error but not eliminate it. . Before going back and making a larger change to pass an object containing all relevant workflow ids through a bunch of different test code, to ensure it can always be part of `CentaurTestException`, I wanted to get some initial feedback. Is this (adding additional workflow id(s) to `CentaurTestException` so that we can easily clear their cache hits from the database in `tryTryAgain`) the right direction to fix this problem? It feels wrong to update the signatures of all these unrelated methods just to populate the exception.

Usability,"The outputs of an optional scattered task that does **not** run should be undefined. Instead, Cromwell seems to think it is defined, and it has a length.

Simple example:; ```; # task_a and task_b are mutually exclusive scattered tasks; Array[File?] vcfs = select_first([task_a.vcf_out, task_b.vcf_out]); ```; Due to this bug, vcfs will yield an empty array if task_a did not run, even though task_b did run. This gets quite messy if you need to process the output of mutually exclusive tasks later. More involved example: ; ```; # variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering is an optional task, so variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering.errorcode is an optional type; if(defined(variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering.errorcode)) {. # variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering is a scattered task, so variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering.errorcode is an array; # this length check should be redundant with the defined check earlier, but neither of them seem to work properly; if(length(variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering.errorcode) > 0) {; 	; # get the first (0th) value and coerce it into type String; 	String coerced_vc_filtered_errorcode = select_first([variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering.errorcode[0], ""FALLBACK""]); 	call echo as echo_a {input: integer=length(variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering.errorcode), string=variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering.errorcode[0]}; 	call echo as echo_b {input: string=coerced_vc_filtered_errorcode}; call echo_array as echo_c {input: strings=variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering.errorcode}; }; }; ```.

I do not see the necessity for docker_cwd, but fair enough. However 'out', 'err' and 'script' do not follow the pattern. In 'submit' they are sfs paths, but in submit-docker they are docker paths.

Usability,"There are multiple related issues in this ticket. The common thread is: a WDL author expects to be able to write compound WDL statements in a task `output` section. However, there are certain WDL statements that fail parsing when strung together, but _will_ work if the statement is broken into multiple variables. The original issue identifies problems in `output` using `glob()` or `Map[,]`. In terms of a fix, I'm guessing for the right dev this is a medium<sup>1</sup> sized task, but would probably be lower on the list of TODOs as there exists a workaround. This ""workaround"" works, where all three `output` variables are relatively simple:; ```wdl; task x {; command {; echo 0 > intFile.txt; echo hello > outFile.txt; }; runtime { docker: ""ubuntu"" }; output {; Int intermediateInt = read_int(""intFile.txt""); Array[File] intermediateOuts = glob(""outFile.txt""); File out = intermediateOuts[intermediateInt]; }; }. workflow glob_indexing { call x }; ```. Starting to compress the output block into two statements, where the latter is a compound expression, this still parses and runs:; ```wdl; output {; Int intermediateInt = read_int(""intFile.txt""); File out = glob(""outFile.txt"")[intermediateInt]; }; ```. Regarding the problems with `Map[,]` this _does_ work:; ```wdl; output {; Map[String, File] intermediateMap = {""a"": ""outFile.txt""}; File out = intermediateMap[""a""]; }; ```. HOWEVER, this doesn't work, currently failing with the error `Workflow input processing failed: <string:8:20 lbrace ""ew==""> (of class wdl4s.parser.WdlParser$Terminal)`:. ```wdl; output {; File out = {""a"": ""outFile.txt""}[""a""]; }; ```.

This agent will be reading the docker event stream from /events, filter for starts with grep, and pass any start events to the small go program ""spawnoninput"". This program simply spawns a new process when it sees input. In this case, the process is a shell script that pauses the container, checks to see if it matches the target condition, then either resumes/exits (when not meeting the target condition) or leaves the container paused and launches a sidecar, which is still in development. If the target condition does not match, this has an effect of slowing startup for the launched container of approximately 100ms for the inspection process.

Usability,"This sets up a mechanism to:; 1) Collect information about ""load"" from various part of the system; 2) Summarize this information and calculate a global load; 3) Notify parts of the system of changes in the global load. Current implementation is simple:; Only 2 load levels: `NormalLoad` and `HighLoad`; Actors reporting their load are:; - WriteMetadataActor; - JobStoreReadActor; - JobStoreWriteActor; - CallCacheWriteActor; - CallCacheReadActor; - KeyValueReadActor; - KeyValueWriteActor; - IoActor; - JesAPIQueryManagerActor. Additionally free memory is also being monitored and will go to `HighLoad` if going below a certain threshold. Global load == max(all load levels). So if one actor or more say their load is high, the global load will be high, otherwise normal.; The only actor listening to changes on the global load is the job token dispenser. It will stop dispensing tokens when load is high and start again when load is back to normal. At the exception of the IoActor, all the above mentioned actors have a queue in which they store work to be done. Their load is determined by comparing the size of this queue to a threshold.; The IoActor's queue is not easily accessible because hidden in the stream implementation and its size cannot easily be known. However we know when its full because we can't add to it anymore (this is when backpressure messages are sent). When that happens the IO actor reports its load to be `High`. When it hasn't had to backpressure for 10 seconds, the load returns to normal. There are many ways this could be made smarter but it already yields improvements in terms of stability and robustness.

Usability,"Today, caching is very closely tied to the backend name of any particular job. In the case where a job is run on the PAPIv1 and re-run on the PAPIv2 backends, the job can't cache to it's previous iteration, even though they were both run on GCP in a containerized environment. . This will be a common use case for all users migrating from the PAPIv1 --> PAPIv2 backend. The only workaround to this is the ""backendName"" key in the Cromwell configuration is maintained to be the same string, and class factories and switched from v1 --> v2. However, cases where a user wants both v1 & v2 backends to be usable and jobs to be cacheable between the two, there's no proper solution.

Usability,"When running a job on PAPI the docker images used are pulled onto the boot disk. Cromwell uses a defaults the size of this disk to 10GB but it needs to be adjusted if the image is larger than that.; WDL has a `bootDiskSizeGB` runtime attribute for that purpose. However CWL doesn't have such attribute, and it would be an overall better user experience not to have to worry about this. However, it currently does not seem possible to obtain the total **uncompressed** size of an image from the docker API (more info [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/issues/1575) and [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/issues/2034)).; What the API does give is the size of each **compressed** layer. The sum of the sizes therefore does not equal to the actual size on disk when the image is pulled and uncompressed. A possible path would be to investigate whether or not a sensible and relatively stable factor can be determined with which we could estimate the uncompressed size based on the compressed one.; This is not necessarily possible as the effectiveness of the compression likely depends on the layer's content which can be arbitrary.

Usability,"[Per @mbookman]; This pull request is an initial update to address:. CROM-6718: FR: Add flag for minimizing chance of GCP cross-region network egress charges being incurred. This PR specifically focuses on the risks of egress charges incurred due to call caching. The framing of the approach here, which is a bit broader than originally noted in CROM-6718, is:; Make call caching location-aware, prioritizing copies that minimize egress charges.; Add a workflow option enabling control of what egress charges can be incurred for call cache copying.; The new workflow option would be:. call_cache_egress: [none, continental, global]. where the values affect whether call cache copies can incur egress charges:; none: only within-region copies are allowed, which generate no egress charges; continental: within content copies are allowed; within-content copies have reduced costs, such as $0.01 / GB in the US; global: copies across all regions are allowed. Cross-content egress charges can be much higher (ranging from $0.08 / GB up to $0.23 / GB). ### CURRENT STATUS OF PR:; These first few commits are a WIP/request for feedback. I would love discussion on what the best approach would be. The idea for this initial approach is to raise an exception right before copying cached outputs if the bucket locations would cause an egress charge (depending on workflow option). The CallCacheJobActor continue attempting to copy outputs until it finds one that doesn't cause an egress charge (depending on workflow option), or until it determines cache miss. . If the above approach is reasonable then I would need coding advice on:; 1) How do I properly use GcsBatchCommandBuilder.locationCommand (or something similar) in the CacheHitCopyingActor?; 2) How do I properly get the WorkflowOption CallCacheEgress in the CacheHitCopyingActor?",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6324:1121,feedback,feedback,1121,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6324,1,['feedback'],['feedback']

Solution: strip out the Host header just like CromIAM already does for Timeout-Access, and everything is happy. The impact to live environments should be zero because they clearly didn't care about the header before.

I had this growing feeling that started to solidify that there are too many layers. I am developing things and I **still** don't understand (or think Singularity is ready yet) to be any kind of backend. I'm forcing a dog into a cat shaped hole just because this is the hole I'm supposed to fill. Is that a good idea? I've lost sight of what the tool is trying to do. Cromwell is trying to make it easy to run a Singularity container. But if that's the case, then why has this command:. ```bash; singularity run shub://vsoch/hello-world; ```. turned into needing Cromwell (java and the jar), an inputs json file, a wdl specification, a backend configuration, and a runtime command that I can't seem to remember, and then the entire thing takes much longer than an instance to echo a tiny Rawwwwr! If this is the goal we are going for, is this making life easier for the scientist? If I'm a programmer person, and this is the minimum I am allowed for this to just run a simple container, what happens when it gets harder? I realized that without a proper services API, singularity is no more special than python, bash, samtools, it's just a binary. . And I realize also that it's easy to get caught up in details like ""Should we use Travis or Circle?"" Does it work on Amazon with this kind of input? And there will always be bugs! But I think the forest is being a bit lost for the trees. . ## Question 4: What is the direction to go in?. You can probably take what I'm saying with a grain of salt because I'm new to this entire universe, and there is so much invested there is no turning back or rethinking. But all of this seems too complicated, and too hard. What is needed is a solution that is just really stupid and simple. You have a container that understands its data.

Usability,"alue_2_give"": ""String (optional, default = \""default value\"")""; }; ```; We see that we are able to provide a value for ""overwrite_given_value"" of the SubTask. . I have tried to add the key to this anyway to the MainWorkflow input but womtools won't accept it:; ```; $ cat MainWorkflow_inputs.json; {; ""MainWorkflow.SubWorkflow.SubTask.overwrite_given_value"": ""test""; }; $ java -jar womtool-84.jar validate MainWorkflow.wdl -i MainWorkflow_inputs.json; WARNING: Unexpected input provided: MainWorkflow.SubWorkflow.SubTask.overwrite_given_value (expected inputs: [MainWorkflow.MainTask.overwrite_given_value, MainWorkflow.SubWorkflow.overwrite_value_2_give, MainWorkflow.value_2_give]); ```. **Conclusion**; This let me to the conclusion that it is not possible to provide values for tasks called in subworkflows. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a missing feature but it would really be helpful if it is possible to implement especially given that it is already possible for the main workflows. **Motivation**; I run and develop genomics pipelines that are using WDL+Cromwell with a HPC Slurm back-end. For each task we require variables that tells the back-end how much resources it need in order to complete it. By default these values are calculated or given by the workflow which is calling the task however it can happen that some tasks need a little bit more to complete. As you cannot overwrite variables that are given by the workflow that calls them, we decided to use optional task variables and the select_first function as a workaround. However given that my pipeline are using subworkflows a lot we cannot do so unless we move those variables up to the input of the workflow which results in a huge list of optional variables. It would be save a lot of work if this could be fixed/added. **End Note**; Thanks for reading my issue and I hope this can be easily be solved. ; _Disclaimer: I do not often write issues so feel free to give feedback and let me know if I missed a convention. 😇_",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6841:4295,feedback,feedback,4295,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6841,1,['feedback'],['feedback']
Usability,"ameter using the unique index on `WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UUID` + `CUSTOM_LABEL_KEY`. So the labels table access should be fast but the summary table is table scanning. I experimented with adding a non-unique index on `CUSTOM_LABEL_ENTRY` for `CUSTOM_LABEL_KEY` + `CUSTOM_LABEL_VALUE` in the hope that MySQL could use that first and then join back to the summary table on workflow ID. However I haven't had any luck getting MySQL to use this index for even the simplest possible queries:. ```; mysql> create index IDX_KEY_VALUE on CUSTOM_LABEL_ENTRY (CUSTOM_LABEL_KEY, CUSTOM_LABEL_VALUE); ; .; .; .; mysql> explain select WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UUID from CUSTOM_LABEL_ENTRY where CUSTOM_LABEL_KEY = 'caas-collection-name' AND CUSTOM_LABEL_VALUE = 'miguel-collection';; +----+-------------+--------------------+------------+------+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+---------+-------+------+----------+-------------+; | id | select_type | table | partitions | type | possible_keys | key | key_len | ref | rows | filtered | Extra |; +----+-------------+--------------------+------------+------+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+---------+-------+------+----------+-------------+; | 1 | SIMPLE | CUSTOM_LABEL_ENTRY | NULL | ref | UC_CUSTOM_LABEL_ENTRY_CLK_WEU,IDX_KEY_VALUE | UC_CUSTOM_LABEL_ENTRY_CLK_WEU | 1023 | const | 1 | 10.00 | Using where |; +----+-------------+--------------------+------------+------+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+---------+-------+------+----------+-------------+; ```.

Clearly, the AWS Batch job parameters are referencing a completely different set of input files from the set described in the workflow log. In this particular case, the job described in the log was started via cromwell run using v36 on an isolated EC2 instance, while the workflow described by the job parameters json was submitted to a cromwell v36.1 server running on a completely separate EC2 instance. This would point to call caching NOT being the problem but a more fundamental issue with how Cromwell interfaces with the AWS Batch backend to submit jobs. We've also observed this result using Cromwell v40 and 41, the latter using a completely new stack created just for that version, in both run and server modes.

This would need to be selected in the configuration file with an authorization with `scheme = ""service_account""` but instead both the configuration file for [PAPIv2](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/PipelinesApi101/#setting-up-papiv2) and the configuration file for [PAPIv1](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/PipelinesApi101/#lets-get-started) are configured to use an authorization with `scheme = ""application_default""`.

I'm hesitant to try to follow the same rules as Bash for parsing a command because I worry that it'll be error prone and difficult to pin down the details. It feels like we'd essentially reimplement a Bash parser in WDL. It'd be difficult and hard to get the nuances of something like this:. ```; command {; python <<CODE; print(""#octothorps!!#""); CODE; }; ```. Maybe something as simple as syntax highlighting could help too... if `#`s are not highlighted differently in the command section then that could also be a hint. Granted, I know syntax highlighters won't always be used. ---. @eddiebroad commented on [Wed Mar 23 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdltool/issues/7#issuecomment-200525363).

Usability,"d need to implement a standard task definition for the entrypoint (or Orchestrator) container (simple), but also pass to that container all the necessary docker parameters necessary for implementing the target container (much more difficult). There is also the question of supervision for the target container as the entrypoint/Orchestrator is hiding from batch and Cromwell the actual task's status. Also, the permissions issues I brought up in my comment above apply. I also have some concerns about the implementation of this approach within Cromwell, as I believe (but I'm not certain), this scheme would require some non-trivial changes to the StandardAsyncExecutionActor class as well as the AwsBatchAsyncExecutionActor logic (likely moreso on the later). I haven't investigated, but I also have some concerns over whether this mechanism would require significant rework of the process input/output and return code. It looks like @delagoya may have considered this in the batch-task-runner repo, but I'm not clear on this after the limited time I've had reviewing the repo. So, with that in mind, I spent a bit of time researching the ""always on sidecar"" approach, which I'll reference as ""cromwell agent"" moving forward for clarity. I took a look at the limitations of the permissions issue I mentioned above, and I believe I have a workable solution. The high level process would work like this:. 0. Each host runs the cromwell agent container similar to the way the ecs-agent operates today; 1. The cromwell agent container listens to the system events as described above; 2. When a cromwell task is started, the cromwell agent container will pause the target container (cromwell task) immediately; 3. It can then inspect the container and use the ECS ""AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI"" in conjunction with the ecs-agent container credentials endpoint at 169.254.170.2 to fetch the **target container credentials**; 4. Using the target container credentials, we can localize inputs, th",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3804#issuecomment-405738068:1643,clear,clear,1643,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3804#issuecomment-405738068,1,['clear'],['clear']

Usability,"e StandardAsyncExecutionActor class as well as the AwsBatchAsyncExecutionActor logic (likely moreso on the later). I haven't investigated, but I also have some concerns over whether this mechanism would require significant rework of the process input/output and return code. It looks like @delagoya may have considered this in the batch-task-runner repo, but I'm not clear on this after the limited time I've had reviewing the repo. So, with that in mind, I spent a bit of time researching the ""always on sidecar"" approach, which I'll reference as ""cromwell agent"" moving forward for clarity. I took a look at the limitations of the permissions issue I mentioned above, and I believe I have a workable solution. The high level process would work like this:. 0. Each host runs the cromwell agent container similar to the way the ecs-agent operates today; 1. The cromwell agent container listens to the system events as described above; 2. When a cromwell task is started, the cromwell agent container will pause the target container (cromwell task) immediately; 3. It can then inspect the container and use the ECS ""AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI"" in conjunction with the ecs-agent container credentials endpoint at 169.254.170.2 to fetch the **target container credentials**; 4. Using the target container credentials, we can localize inputs, then unpause the target container; 5. Upon completion of the task (we should see this from the system events stream), we can then delocalize outputs. This process feels workable with the following advantages:. * Minimal changes to the Cromwell code base/the agent can be developed and maintained separately; * Per-task IAM roles; * No changes needed to Cromwell task definitions or containers; * Cromwell task supervision stays within AWS Batch and Cromwell; * AWS Batch Job Definition configuration does not have to pass through an intermediary. Right now I have a POC to accomplish through step 3.

Usability,"e the error, but so far I can only get it from this workflow, possibly because of running time, IO, perl, seqware, I don't know. After much headdesking, I am nearly certain I have fixed the issue by changing the way cromwell executes a call. As you know, Cromwell generates a script.submit file which looks like this (in this case):. ``` bash; #!/bin/bash; docker run --rm -v /home/ubuntu/projects/debug-small-data/cromwell-executions/PcawgDelly/ebce533d-9f49-4e6d-8512-db7a182d3365/call-SeqwareWorkflow:/root/PcawgDelly/ebce533d-9f49-4e6d-8512-db7a182d3365/call-SeqwareWorkflow -i delly-docker-root /bin/bash < /home/ubuntu/projects/debug-small-data/cromwell-executions/PcawgDelly/ebce533d-9f49-4e6d-8512-db7a182d3365/call-SeqwareWorkflow/execution/script; ```. By removing input redirection into bash (i.e. removing the ""<"" character and changing the paths) I can get this workflow to run consistently without error. The new script.submit looks like:. ``` bash; #!/bin/bash; docker run --rm -v /home/ubuntu/projects/debug-small-data-alex/cromwell-executions/PcawgDelly/bdc567a9-b1f7-4530-853a-5263b890ca6a/call-SeqwareWorkflow:/root/PcawgDelly/bdc567a9-b1f7-4530-853a-5263b890ca6a/call-SeqwareWorkflow -i delly-docker-root /bin/bash /root/PcawgDelly/bdc567a9-b1f7-4530-853a-5263b890ca6a/call-SeqwareWorkflow/execution/script; ```. Basically, it runs the script from inside the docker container. I cannot, unfortunately, describe why the bug happened in this seemingly rare case, other than pointing at the dangers of shell commands being interpreted from pipes/stdin and waving my hands a lot. But, I do think avoiding input redirection of commands into bash is probably a good thing, in this case. Am I missing some case where it's necessary?. Luckily I think the fix is simple, and probably just involves updating the core conf. here:; core/src/main/resources/reference.conf. I was able to provide my own config file overrides for now as a workaround. Thanks!

Usability,"erstand yaml - it's a data structure like json, and just a way to capture a workflow. I'd be happy to answer specific questions that you might have, feel free to post them on here, and no worries about the busy-ness! I hope the :fire: calms down, at least it has been sort of not so great for CA! If it helps, I'll leave you some notes here:. - adding this circle testing doesn't interfere with your current testing; - adding the build and deploy of the docker container here is a better strategy than having travis handle everything because the two can run at the same time.; - environment variables, given docker credentials, are set on the circleci project backend (once and forgotten about). This is mostly just DOCKER for pushing to docker hub.; - The yaml uses [anchors](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/using-defaults-syntax-in-config-yaml-aka-yaml-anchors/16168) in the configuration like functions, and to pipe in defaults. I name them according to what they do (e.g., `dockersave`. Some quick learnings:. Let's say we create a defaults section that looks like this, to set some shared environment variables, working directory, docker container, anything we want really:. ```; defaults: &defaults; docker:; - image: docker:18.01.0-ce-git; working_directory: /tmp/src; ```. This syntax says ""find the section defined as defaults (above) and insert it here. ```; <<: *defaults; ```; so you don't write it twice!. This is similar, but it's like a named anchor and pointer. I might have this under a jobs step. ```; - run: *dothething; ```; which might be in reference to this. ```; dothething: &dothething; name: Do the thing; command: |; echo ""Do the thing!""; echo ""Do it again!""; ```. - The main runtime in the file is the workflow jobs section, which just does a build and deploy.; - the base container that is run is one of circle's ready to docker docker images `docker:18.01.0-ce-git`; - The main steps are to load cache, install dependencies, build the container, run to test, and then save",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4015#issuecomment-415952635:1098,learn,learnings,1098,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4015#issuecomment-415952635,1,['learn'],['learnings']

It seems like a copy and paste of the HtCondor backend (including some variable names!) and then using that to run a command inside a docker to connect to a pre-existing spark cluster with preloaded data. All this could already be done using any one of the docker-based back ends (e.g. Local or even Google). Am I missing something here? If not, it would be great to see more of a roadmap about where you see this going because it's not clear from the code here what direction it could take.

It seems like there are two known failures that can lead to that error message:. 1. As described above, when an operation self-cancels due to a timeout, Cromwell could supplement the existing message with:; ```Jobs that run for longer than a week are not yet supported, and thus this job was cancelled because it exceeded that upper-limit. Please try to reduce the duration of your job. To get more details about your jobs, here are links to the stdout/stderr files...```. 2. As described in the forum post above, when Cromwell restarts a workflow and a job had been started by the engine/backend but didn't have an op id -- it gets marked as a failed job with the same error. Instead, if Cromwell knows that the reason it couldn't find an op id was because it is restarting -- then it should not report the message it does today at all and simply say:; ```When Cromwell restarted, it realized the job was not yet started, and so this is a benign failure. Cromwell will try attempting to execute this job again.```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2496#issuecomment-424966266:1108,simpl,simply,1108,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2496#issuecomment-424966266,1,['simpl'],['simply']

The existing four centaur tests (two run in Travis, two nightly in Jenkins) should pass using non-default credentials:; - Switch the `aws_application.conf` to use auth scheme `custom_keys` in a rendered template with secrets embedded; - Remove the files `aws_credentials.ctmpl` and `aws_config`; - Update `testCentaurAws.sh` removing `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` and `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` exports; - **Maybe**: It isn't clear that installing the `awscli` should be required. Remove this from the `testCentaurAws.sh` and see if the tests still work using just the embedded Java S3 SDK.; - Update `.gitignore` replacing `aws_credentials` with `aws_application.conf`; - **Maybe**: Add a second backend that **does** use some form of default authorization; - If adding this test, please ensure that the non-default credentials are NOT accidentally falling-back to the default credentials. ### TL;DR. **It's unclear how cromwell calls to S3 broke in 37+, but CI testing with non-default credentials should hopefully reproduce reported errors.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4740:3319,clear,clear,3319,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4740,1,['clear'],['clear']
Usability,"ine this being configured via a workflow option like ""failed_task_retries: 3"", which would tell Cromwell to run each task in the workflow up to 3 times if any type of failure is encountered. # Why it would be valuable. For people running many instances of a well-tested workflow, such as Green Team and Mint Team production at Broad, the vast majority of failures are due to transient problems in the cloud, and it is very time consuming to deal with them. Having this auto-retry capability in Cromwell would be a huge help in making these workflows more robust and would greatly reduce the amount of manual work required to relaunch failed workflows (or save people from having to write their own bespoke scripts to auto-retry failed workflows). Having retries at the task level (rather than having to resubmit the whole workflow) would also be more efficient, especially when call caching is not in use. # Difference from existing issue. I believe this feature would satisfy the use cases of many (but not all) of the commenters on #1991, but in a simpler way. In contrast to that issue, no error messages need to be parsed here and there is no added functionality around auto increasing memory or disk. (For Mint Team produciton, we're interested in something like #1991, too, especially the stderr pattern matching, but I am guessing it would take longer to make happen given the wdl changes required, etc. The issue I'm filing here is the low hanging fruit for us.). # Combining with preemptibles. There is a question to resolve about what to do for a preemptible task in a workflow where failed_task_retries has also been set. My preference would be to make them additive. If the task says ""preemptible: 5"" and the workflow says ""failed_task_retries: 3"", then Cromwell will retry that task up to 8 times. The first 3 retries will use a preemptible machine -- regardless of the reason for the error. Additional retries beyond that will not use a preemptible machine.

Usability,"nfiguring it at the Cromwell level, so e.g. any user of Terra (or any other hosted Cromwell with PAPIv2 backend) could get usage reports without having to configure anything. The metrics are reported in their GCP project, so a user gets automatic access to them as long as they're a viewer. We could also easily expose a link to workflow- and task-level reports in Job Manager UI, so they will be literally point-and-click away. Each timepoint is designed to be self-sufficient, as it is labeled with:; - Cromwell-specific values, such as workflow ID, task call name, index and attempt.; - GCP instance values such as instance name, zone, number of CPU cores, total memory and disk size. Here's an example graph of cpu/memory/disk utilization for one of our production workflows, as it is running right now - one can already see we could probably save ~40% of the cost:; <img width=""1869"" alt=""screen shot 2019-01-02 at 4 43 20 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137337/50614108-c0e6e800-0ead-11e9-9ef4-02029725a44c.png"">. Reporting itself costs very little if anything at all, because Stackdriver provides a generous free tier worth ~65K instance-hours each month, and ~$0.0006 per instance-hour after that (at the current rate of 5 metric points reported each minute). @kshakir suggested using a ""vendor-neutral"" reporting library such as [Micrometer.io](http://micrometer.io/), although I have reservations around that - mostly because that may require additional setup and we want this to ""just work""; but also because the implementation is currently PAPIv2-specific anyway, so it is already non-vendor agnostic. Likewise, one could export metrics from Stackdriver monitoring if they wanted to. But we're open to the idea. Finally, I haven't added any tests yet, as it's unclear in which shape or form (if at all) you'd like to integrate this code.

Usability,"o the second or third one, and implicitly do the first one. In Python, if I try to do_something() on a variable that isn't defined, Python throws a Name Error, but in Cromwell!WDL trying to do_something() on an optional throws a ""Expected X but got X?"" error that doesn't tell you if X is actually defined or not. The fact that the WDL spec doesn't explicitly say that defined() can coerce a variable doesn't really matter -- I would wager that most people would expect this sort of thing to work. It seems to be a logical conclusion that if a file exists, you can do something to that file, without having to call a totally different function to create a new variable. I did check your workaround, but it throws the same error. So, my understanding is the only way to do this in Cromwell is this:. ```; String basename_tsv = basename(select_first([tsv_file_input, ""bogus fallback value""])); String arg_tsv = if(basename_tsv == ""bogus fallback value"") then """" else basename_tsv; ```. ...which just isn't intuitive. It shouldn't be so complicated to get the basename of an optional file. . Even less intuitive is the fact that if you separate out the select_first() part into a new variable, my workaround doesn't work anymore. ```; String maybe_tsv = select_first([tsv_file_input, ""bogus fallback value""]); String basename_tsv = basename(maybe_tsv); String arg_tsv = if(basename_tsv == ""bogus fallback value"") then """" else basename_tsv; ```. _Failed to process task definition 'parse_terratable' (reason 1 of 1): Failed to process expression 'select_first([basename_tsv, basename(maybe_tsv)])' (reason 1 of 1): Invalid parameter 'IdentifierLookup(maybe_tsv)'. Expected 'File' but got 'String?'_. In other words -- it is unnecessarily complicated to work with optionals, and the workarounds that do exist appear to be inconsistent. It seems this could all be sidestepped by having ""if X exists, do something to X"" logic.

Usability,"okay, well I just updated the linked repo to have this ""hello"" example. I've concluded that singularity makes absolutely no sense as a backend. it's more logical as just a binary that is run (Local) or with other backend (e.g., slurm). See here --> https://github.com/vsoch/wgbs-pipeline/blob/add/singularity/docs/pages/docs/tutorial/getting-started/index.md#step-4-run-test-case for the test case, and then the example wdl I'll just show you here, because it's stupid.

But I guess it's useful / helping users in other ways, so it's worth it to show how to run a singularity container as a command? /shrug. I don't totally follow what you are saying, to be honest. cromwell running singularity is just the same as cromwell running anything else, and I'm convinced (after this testing) there is no special use case. Docker has a backend and workflow runtime (because you run a docker container, the thing in a workflow) Singularity you are trying to shove into a backend or a workflow, and it has to be one or the other. It's not really making sense as a backend because it's more like an executable.

Usability,"ot accept `^chrEBV$|^NC|_random$|Un_|^HLA\-|_alt$|hap\d$` as an input variable via JSON; it will fail to import; * Terra will not accept `^chrEBV$|^NC|_random$|Un_|^HLA\-|_alt$|hap\d$` as an input variable if entered manually; it will throw token recognition error in the workflow menu and not allow you to submit; * Terra will accept the escaped version `^chrEBV$|^NC|_random$|Un_|^HLA\\-|_alt$|hap\\d$` as an input if entered manually or hardcoded, and will interpret it as `^chrEBV$|^NC|_random$|Un_|^HLA\-|_alt$|hap\d$`. Only tested via Terra-Cromwell, as I was previously told local-Cromwell is a lower development priority. ## expected behavior; 1. A user inputting a string as a variable vs that exact same string being a hardcoded default should be handled the same way.; 2. If Cromwell is supposed to handle `/` by requiring they be escaped as `//`, that should be documented if it isn't already.; 3. womtool should throw a warning when it sees a hardcoded variable/default with a `/` inside of it, and that warning should guide the user as to how it will be interpreted at runtime.; 4. The same workflow running in Cromwell and miniwdl should not result in different interpretations of a given string. The WDL spec should be updated to stop inconsistencies like this from happening, [since it currently does not seem to give guidance on this particular issue](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#whitespace-strings-identifiers-constants). (Linking WDL 1.0 spec since that's what Cromwell currently supports.). Personally I'd prefer if strings were interpreted literally, ie `/` does not need to be escaped, but that might conflict with the typical JSON standard. Consistency is more important than my mild distaste for escaping. ## related issues; https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3990#issuecomment-415665749. ## miniwdl comparison (not necessarily the ideal, just to illustrate point 4 on expected behavior); * miniwdl will accept `^chrEBV$|^NC|_",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7167:2014,guid,guide,2014,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7167,1,['guid'],['guide']

Usability,"pt for Main and Main related stuff has been moved to an `engine` subproject. Yes astute reader, you're correct - not everything actually belongs there. The idea is that we'll peel stuff out as we go along.; - Creates a `core` subproject (currently empty) for code which doesn't have a true home but should be shared. For example, if something would otherwise move from `engine` to `backend` for no other reason than the dependency direction and it really isn't a backend-y thing.; - The root project depends on `core`, `engine` and `backend`, `engine` depends on `backend` and `core` and `backend` on `core`; - Started to decompose our SBT structure into more digestible chunks to make it easier to figure out what is where. Key lowlights:; - All of the code which went into `engine` retained `cromwell` as the package instead of `cromwell.engine`, which causes IntelliJ to whine. I thought it'd be weird as there _is_ a `cromwell.engine` package already (`cromwell.engine.engine`?). However I view this as a temporary thing, I figure stuff is going to be moving around and we can figure out a package/naming structure which makes sense once we see what's where.; - Some of the abstractions are a little hokey at the moment as a side effect of 99.9999999% of the code living in one subproject. I expect that to start changing soon, mainly I was trying to give some examples of a path forward; - I'm almost positive there's a lot more stuff going on than necessary (e.g. multiple de-dups, etc). Example - I want to disable assembly on all subprojects but backend, but i still wanted to run tests. Wasn't clear how to have root assembly run tests but not assembly on other subprojects; - I'm 100% certain that some of the sbt directives aren't totally idiomatic (which causes the previous statement); - Some of the ancillary stuff (e.g. conf files) might need to be rethought.

Usability,"r, but in Cromwell!WDL trying to do_something() on an optional throws a ""Expected X but got X?"" error that doesn't tell you if X is actually defined or not. The fact that the WDL spec doesn't explicitly say that defined() can coerce a variable doesn't really matter -- I would wager that most people would expect this sort of thing to work. It seems to be a logical conclusion that if a file exists, you can do something to that file, without having to call a totally different function to create a new variable. I did check your workaround, but it throws the same error. So, my understanding is the only way to do this in Cromwell is this:. ```; String basename_tsv = basename(select_first([tsv_file_input, ""bogus fallback value""])); String arg_tsv = if(basename_tsv == ""bogus fallback value"") then """" else basename_tsv; ```. ...which just isn't intuitive. It shouldn't be so complicated to get the basename of an optional file. . Even less intuitive is the fact that if you separate out the select_first() part into a new variable, my workaround doesn't work anymore. ```; String maybe_tsv = select_first([tsv_file_input, ""bogus fallback value""]); String basename_tsv = basename(maybe_tsv); String arg_tsv = if(basename_tsv == ""bogus fallback value"") then """" else basename_tsv; ```. _Failed to process task definition 'parse_terratable' (reason 1 of 1): Failed to process expression 'select_first([basename_tsv, basename(maybe_tsv)])' (reason 1 of 1): Invalid parameter 'IdentifierLookup(maybe_tsv)'. Expected 'File' but got 'String?'_. In other words -- it is unnecessarily complicated to work with optionals, and the workarounds that do exist appear to be inconsistent. It seems this could all be sidestepped by having ""if X exists, do something to X"" logic. (I want to make clear I'm coming at this from a perspective of someone who uses WDL heavily, mostly in the context of Terra/Cromwell, and wants wider adoption. From my experience, oddities like this are serious obstacles for both newcome",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6840#issuecomment-1245893354:1826,intuit,intuitive,1826,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6840#issuecomment-1245893354,1,['intuit'],['intuitive']

Usability,"to all the great help you've provided we now have compatible WDL output that passes validation:. https://github.com/bcbio/test_bcbio_cwl/blob/master/run_info-cwl-wdl. This is brilliant, and I'd like to move into testing runs with Cromwell. Before starting this, there is one major area I know we're missing in the conversion, handling of secondary files and directories of files. CWL has the notion of secondaryFiles (http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/Workflow.html#File) which you can use to block these and ensure they get staged/run next to each other. I use this in bcbio and wanted to figure out the best way to map it into WDL. There are two cases we use these for:. - Index files associated with compressed inputs, like BAM bai indices and bgzip VCF tbi indices. These are a single index file attached to the original file that should get staged in the same directory when running.; - Directories of index files like bwa or snpeff. These are a bit trickier since they can have many files and a variable number depending on the input. What is the recommended way to deal with these cases in WDL? I'll have to re-engineer bcbio to be able to represent and pass these and wanted to do so in a way that was forward compatible with WDL's thoughts and plans. I've seen recommendations on current hacks like explicitly declaring the indexes as separate files, or tarring up a directory of files and passing that as input. I'm not clear enough on staging files from WDL/Cromwell to understand if these are guaranteed to always go in the right place (bai next to bam, all indexes in the same directory). Thanks for any thoughts/suggestions/tips.

Usability,"uently (and thus needs to be a label); - What that string means (labels are key-value pairs and we're usually missing the key). > This parsing-based approach actually did work with Rawls, by doing the parsing outside Rawls's codebase, not inside it. That worked for Rawls because Rawls has relatively few actually unique metrics, and the metrics that it does have are extremely stable--no one is going to change them--so we literally hardcode the exact glob matching and regex patterns. With the number of metric Cromwell has, that raw hardcoding approach would get unmaintainable very, very quickly. My idea was to instead have metric names effectively be the following:. ```scala; type InstrumentationPath = NonEmptyList[String | (String, String)]. CromwellBucket(prefix: List[String], path: InstrumentationPath); ```. Parts of a metric name expected to vary frequently could be stored as a key-value pair in the same list, and StatsD and Prometheus could simply handle it differently: StatsD could ignore the key and use the value to get the exact metric name as before, while Prometheus could assemble the name from just the strings and pass the key-value pairs as the labels. Unfortunately, union types are a Scala 3 thing. In Scala 2 we get `Either`, a manually-boxed type. :((((. So I did this:. ```scala; private type LowVariantPart = String; private type HighVariantPart = (String, String); private type InternalPath = NonEmptyList[Either[LowVariantPart, HighVariantPart]]. implicit class InstrumentationPath (val internalPath: InternalPath) { ... }; object InstrumentationPath { ... }. CromwellBucket(prefix: List[String], path: InstrumentationPath); ```. The implicit class provides a similar conceptual interface to the NonEmptyList, except it handles the necessary boxing (it also the includes some convenience methods that were already on a `implicit class EnhancedStatsDPath(val path: InstrumentationPath) extends AnyVal`). The object effectively provides constructors to handle the no",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6681:2854,simpl,simply,2854,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6681,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Usability,"vate images which cannot take advantage of Cromwell's call caching feartures - this is blocking a major analysis workflow's migration to Cromwell. Given that JGI also has other Docker images which are non-public, it is only the first of what is likely to be many other production workflows that cannot be used with Cromwell, blocking our institutional goal of consolidating JGI analysis workflows on Cromwell as our workflow engine. . Changelog:. Added config option docker.perform-registry-lookup-if-digest-is-provided with default True (https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/commit/e9965d8f9a385b289f15b23b3fb923ecb8c0ea38); Added logic to DockerConfiguration.scala to sendDockerRequest if performRegistryLookupIfDigestIsProvided is true, else just lookupKvsOrBuildDescriptorAndStop.; Motivation:. Cromwell only allows call-caching when a digest is provided.; The digest registry lookup fails because Cromwell isn't respecting the system proxy.; This disables call-caching, even though we've provided the digest.; From original PR:. This PR is based on a comment in the Slack, and ongoing conversation in How to configure proxies? (which stems from https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5006). Essentially, I don't want Cromwell to lookup my container when I provide it as a digest, because if the request fails (because Cromwell isn't respecting the system proxy), I still want call-caching to work. The main reason Cromwell seems to want to lookup the external registry is for the docker size which gets logged to metadata and doesn't seem to be used again. Thanks @mcovarr for the initial feedback, and sorry it took so long to action your suggestions. I've moved this to an internal branch so tests run automatically (as suggested in the past).

After seeing that a big perf bottleneck was Cromwell hashing files, I enabled all of the call caching options and also enabled `check-sibling-md5` so that it could use pre-computed hashes instead. To my surprise, this did nothing because it only works when the configured `actor-factory` is `cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory`! The documentation does **not** make that sufficiently clear:; - The `hashing-strategy` and `check-sibling-md5` options are listed under the `Local Filesystem` section (and configured under `config.filesystems.local.caching` which led me to believe they would work with any provider configured for local filesystem (e.g., TES). This is not the case, and they are in fact tied to the actor factory implementation and the only actor factory with support is `ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory` (as far as I could tell).; - The documentation does make mention of mention:; > When running a job on the **Config (Shared Filesystem) backend**, Cromwell provides some additional options in the backend's config section. However neither a Config nor a Shared Filesystem backend are mentionend in the documentation, although SFS is found under [Filesystems](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/filesystems/Filesystems/).

If Cromwell is supposed to handle `/` by requiring they be escaped as `//`, that should be documented if it isn't already.; 3. womtool should throw a warning when it sees a hardcoded variable/default with a `/` inside of it, and that warning should guide the user as to how it will be interpreted at runtime.; 4.
