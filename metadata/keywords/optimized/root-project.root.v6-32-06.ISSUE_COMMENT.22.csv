Energy Efficiency,"@vgvassilev I have updated the PR to include a similar patch for the SourceManager and at least the trivial test seems to work fine, including a nice 9MB reduction in memory allocations. I am now testing with the ALICE analysis framework. I have also done a few of the cleanups, and it now only exposes an ""expand"" interface (basically resize without shrinking). AFAICT, it's not worth to implement the full ""resize"" functionality, given it's complicated and at least the places I fixed never shrink. I think also the calloc approach might not be a good idea given realloc does not guarantee that the memory is zeroed and besides that page ranges might be a tad too big for vector of pointers and so on. I would put aside that idea, at least for now. My current plan:. * Verify with larger tests using ALICE analysis and asynchronous reconstruction.; * Unify the two PagedVector implementations I currently have (one for ASTReader and one for SourceManager).; * Use fixed size ranges, so that I can get rid of the ranges in my internal index and just keep where each page was allocated.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13000#issuecomment-1717257305:1076,allocate,allocated,1076,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13000#issuecomment-1717257305,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

Energy Efficiency,"@vgvassilev It seems that the changes in this PR provide the same performance as the current master (after the two hotfixes), while supporting leaving the `k*` constants in `TError.h` as `constexpr` so without producing a symbol in `libCore.so`. For `TString::kNPOS` I guess we want to leave the commit there since it was anyway a real fix to a bug. Another problem which is still present in both the current master and even after this PR is that the number of file operations is still quite high, i.e.; ```; 532 newfstatat(3, ; 29 newfstatat(4, ; 10141 newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, ; 546 openat(AT_FDCWD, ; 843 readlink(; ```. which are exactly the same whether current master or this patch. Consider that many of those `newfstatat` calls are spurious and I'm trying to understand where they come from. Take the following as an example; ```; newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, ""/home/vpadulan/programs/rootproject/rootbuild/reduce-symbol-search-release/gui/sessionviewer/input_line_11"", 0x7ffde442f050, 0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory); ```. Note the presence of the `rootbuild` directory, which is the path where I store the ROOT build artifacts, even though I am using ROOT from the install directory. I thought it was something in the machinery of `(T)cling` but so far my tests haven't brought me to any conclusion. Another suspicion is that the path to the build directory is hardcoded somehow in the `.pcm` or in the AST and doesn't get converted to the install directory.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14287#issuecomment-1867410890:903,reduce,reduce-symbol-search-release,903,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14287#issuecomment-1867410890,1,['reduce'],['reduce-symbol-search-release']

Energy Efficiency,"Alright, indeed massif confirms that ~30GB of heap memory is allocated by TH1D's copy-constructor, + some more to keep track of the sums of the squares of the weights. With the numbers you provided, I am not sure how that's possible: 1000 TH1Ds with 20k bins each, copied over 16 threads, should occupy less than 3GB, so we are missing one order of magnitude.

This takes ~5GB of RAM with the `Sumw2` call, ~3GB without.

The recently released Mac version brought some changes that we had to adapt to (see this recent [forum post](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/root-stopped-yesterday-working-on-osx/61693) for example). . Can I ask you to try to compile the release candidate https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06-rc1 and tell us whether this is working on your machine?.

Energy Efficiency,"Deciding how many tasks to submit to a distributed scheduler is a fine art on its own :) From what I understand of your case, I would try to test first with `npartitions ~ n_files * (n_clusters_per_file / 5)` so that each task has at least more than 100 MB of data to process and you don't incur in too many small tasks that bring more overhead than actual gain. In the future it would be nice to have some clever algorithm that figures out a better default number of partitions, we'll see.

Energy Efficiency,"Does RDF have a test for this scenario?. I thought about that and I am not really sure if that'd work. If the semantics of the Cache/Snapshot suppose resolution of missing entities while running the produced code then it'd indeed fail. I can imagine this can be detected at the string generation time and we could explicitly load the relevant library beforehand.

In short, the combination of temporary `string_view`s and `new`s in a very long function makes the time of `instcombine` explode (for yet unknown reasons). For instance, compiling the output of `generate.sh 10000` with `clang++ 12.0.1` takes 25 seconds at `-O1`, but less than a second at `-O0`. Removing one of the arguments resolves the problem with `instcombine`. To verify, I hacked RDF headers to accept `const char*` instead of `string_view`s.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @ShamrockLee ,; You _can_ reduce the memory required by reducing the number of bins or the number of threads (e.g. with `ROOT::EnableImplicitMT(4)`, but there seems to be something else going on: each thread gets a local copy of the histogram, so for their bins the amount of memory required is `8*1000*20000*16` bytes, i.e. 2.4GB. So just the number of histograms and bins does not explain what you see. #6676 is about calling `Histo1D` without specifying a binning, which does not seem to be your case. With a build of ROOT that contains debug symbols (they are available e.g. on LXPLUS), `valgrind --tool=massif` should be able to point precisely to the source of the allocations.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @greenc-FNAL,. Thanks for this request. I will try to reply inline directly to some of the concerns and try to give some public-friendly outline the bigger picture as I see it. > Generated module files are compiler-specific, which would seem likely to lead to issues with interactions between Cling-generated PCM dictionaries and any C++20 modules used by the code upon which those dictionaries depend. I am not sure if that is the case at least for the next 10 years. I see this can be an issue if we start shipping module files (`bmi`s or equivalent) instead of header files. However, in practice that won't be the case in near future because the compiler vendors cannot agree on a common file format and make it standard. Until then, there will be always some sort of a textual header file which can be processed with our clang-based rootcling and build a pcm file as basis for our dictionaries. . > My request is for the upcoming ROOT with Clang 16 to be able to accommodate the generation and use of PCM dictionaries where dependencies thereof are or use C++20 modules. Clang has at least 5 different ""flavors"" of modules. One of them is the C++20 modules as described by the C++ standard. At the moment you start using C++ 20 you could use the `import`/`export` constructs and you will be able to use that feature for encapsulation purposes. There is not enough project transitions which are bigger than toy examples. One of the challenges is how we discover module dependencies. That is, we need extra tooling to decide how to split the source files into modules. In practice we need to pre-lex all of the content before the build system can start processing project files. The community is discussing scanners (such as clang scan-deps), daemons (the gcc implementation), protocols, etc. There is increasing amount of papers trying to address how we put C++ modules at scale (https://wg21.link/p2656, https://wg21.link/P2409, https://youtu.be/_LGR0U5Opdg?si=AbLazREvyl5PXVFG).

Energy Efficiency,"Hi! The `RooTrace` cannot be used like that, because it doesn't track all the constructors and destructors of RooAbsCollection. If you want to use it, you have to change the code in the classes you want to trace. Alternatively, you can measure memory consumption with `ProcInfo`, similar to https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7933:; ```C++; #include ""RooRealVar.h""; #include ""RooGaussian.h""; #include ""RooPlot.h""; #include ""RooTrace.h"". void test() {. RooTrace::active(kTRUE);; RooTrace::mark();; RooRealVar x(""x"",""x"",-10,10);; RooDataSet d(""d"",""d"",RooArgSet(x));; RooRealVar s(""s"",""s"",1,1,10);; RooRealVar m(""m"",""m"",0,-10,10);; RooGaussian g(""gauss"",""gauss(x,m,s)"",x,m,s);; RooPlot *f=x.frame();. for (Int_t j=0; j<300; ++j){; x.setVal(gRandom->Gaus(0,1));; d.add(x);; }.

Now, I don't see any memory increase per fit iteration. The only thing that happens is that the memory consuption climbs very very slowly when you do tens of thousands of fits because of the MemPoolForRooSets (also reported in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7933). But with the recent changes to the MemPoolForRooSets, this increasing memory consumption is strongly reduced and not relevant in your example. I will close this issue because it relies on a wrong report based on `RooTrace`, but it you have any more memory issues please feel free to open another thread or reopen this one!.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi, I think this is a known limitation of the design. The issue here is not a mixture of vector classes but a negation of a vector from a coordinate system using mass (so just the `PxPyPzMVector` part):. ```cpp; root [0] auto v = ROOT::Math::PxPyPzMVector(0,0,1,0); (ROOT::Math::LorentzVector<ROOT::Math::PxPyPzM4D<double> > &) (0,0,1,0); root [1] v-v; (ROOT::Math::LorentzVector) (0,0,0,0); root [2] v+(-v); (ROOT::Math::LorentzVector) (0,0,0,2); ```. For coordinate systems represented with mass an unary `operator-` doesn't model a '4-vector negation' operation, because it returns a vector with negated momentum and negated mass instead of returning a properly negated 4-vector. A negated 4-vector should have negated momentum and negated energy but the same mass, and that can't be achieved with a representation containing only momentum and mass.

Energy Efficiency,"I am a little concerned about the basic idea. If I understood correctly, there is a (unique) global registry where the histogram are identified based on their 'full path name' (beside the fact that GetNameForRanges seems both brittle and currently seems on first reading 'wrong'/'not-as-intended'). I see two major problems, one is that the 'full path name' may never be really unique i.e. it might be impossible to avoid synonyms that are semantically distincts ... a good example is two free standings (not attached to any directory) histograms that happens to have the same name in two distinct and independent part of the code (e.g. two CMSSW modules). The other major problem is that it unnecessary tie (via that global mutex) all the 'parallel' histogram, this means that the overall scalability is inherently decreased. Rather than a completely global state, wouldn't it make sense to have a wrapper object (for example TThreadedObject) be the holder of the lock and list for a single set of related histogram.; This would both reduce contention and guarantees that the histograms are really related. A 3rd significant problem (but fixeable) is that the operation covered by the ReadWrite lock are not atomic (and/or trivial) and for the look of it could plausibly indirectly request the ROOT global lock and thus can lead to deadlocks (from some other code that hold the ROOT global locks and request the Write part of the ReadWrite lock). A 4th deficiency is that once activated for one histogram it *seems* to apply to all histogram. i.e. as far as can tell if you one parallel histograms and 10,000 single-thread histograms, filling the single-thread histogram still has to go through the multi-thread registration/mechanism. And that remind me, that another challenge for the 'unique registry' solution is to understand its scalability where reaching 10 to 100 thousands histograms.

Energy Efficiency,"I successfully ran @zzxuanyuan's version but got benchmarks far from mine, so I got suspicious if I'm seing effects of something else that changed in ROOT (or possibly me having changed the compile options with which I compile ROOT).

I anyhow don't measure the RAM consumption for individual functions and at some point concluded that this is dominated by holding the root file in the memory. | alg -level | compressed size (B) | memory reading (peak, process, B) | memory writing (peak, process, B) | cycles writing (function) | cycles reading (function) |; | --- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |; | ZLIB yours | 50704058.000000 | 330447558.000000 | 374567259.000000 | 255700352.000000 | 2443672496 |; | LZ4 yours | 69861890.000000 | 357286997.000000 | 374567259.000000 | 188653871.000000 | 1006741856 |; | ZLIB mine | 50704058.000000 | 327875161.000000 | 371586581.000000 | 255702351.000000 | 2443713877 |; | LZ4 mine | 69874907.000000 | 354320671.000000 | 371586581.000000 | 28579724.000000 | 275698694 |.

Energy Efficiency,"If you already have time to review than it should be fine to start now, yes. I think the failing test is just a matter of too strict assumptions, should be easily fixable by relaxing that. Btw, if you have suggestions there of how to construct a better test, I'm all ears. What the failing test does is: 1. assign task priorities, 2. run the tasks and record the order in which they are executed, 3. check the received order against the suggested one via the priorities. The problem is that due to random OS process scheduling delays, the received order is never 100% predictable. The only thing that is guaranteed is that if it has multiple tasks in the queue at one time that it will execute the one with highest priority first. I could introduce `sleep`s in each task so that the queue has time to fill up, but it could still fail randomly if for some reason the queue filling is delayed, so it still doesn't guarantee anything...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11627#issuecomment-1291893648:516,schedul,scheduling,516,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11627#issuecomment-1291893648,1,['schedul'],['scheduling']

The lines with both asserts make sure if the assumptions of (b) change, that is, we start to unload in a different way the stored parse buffers.

Energy Efficiency,"Indeed! a leaf field with `std::string` is special because it's the only thing that ""splits"" in column records (i.e. the string is basically a jagged vector of bytes, but a `role=1` jagged vector splits in field records). Another outlier we will run into someday is `_collection0` with only one child-field, this would look identical to a `vector` (because role=1 and each has only 1 child-field).

Energy Efficiency,"Intentional. An `std::string` has a single-char array representation underlying it, which is a Python `bytes` object, not a `str`, which is unicode. The point of `repr()` is to be able to provide a `str` object from which the original object can be reconstructed. That, therefore, has to be a `bytes` representation. The point of `str()` is to provide something that looks pretty and informational, which in practice is more likely to be a decoded `str`, hence that choice. Specifically, b/c unicode isn't properly implemented in any C++ standard string class, it's common practice to place an encoded unicode string into `std::string`. Regardless, even if it contains unencoded ASCII, whenever a C++ `std::string` is represented as a Python `str`, it needs decoding. However, no information is available on the encoding scheme. It's typically safe to assume an UTF-8 encoding b/c ASCII is a subset, but there's no guarantee. Hence the current implementation tries to avoid decoding as much as possible and only does so when absolutely necessary (e.g. when doing string comparisons or, as in this example, when calling `str()`). The implementation of `std::string` has been Pythonized so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement wherever a `str` object is expected, with the exception of when you do anything type specific, such as `repr()`, `type()`, and `isinstance()`, where it will represent as an `std::string`, which it is. For CERN, none of this is likely to matter as all European languages are encodable UTF-8 AFAIK. The most common language, in my experience, where this assumption fails is Chinese. (Edit: I read up on it and turns out that *all* languages are encodable in UTF-8, it's just that that encoding is designed to be space-efficient for Latin languages, but is rather inefficient for Asian languages, hence the common choice of different encodings there.)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15153#issuecomment-2040504962:1749,efficient,efficient,1749,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15153#issuecomment-2040504962,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

Energy Efficiency,"OK, so your approach would be to get the ""obvious"" set (I cannot think of a better term) of overloads, and for now just ignore hidden friends? (ADL can be worked around on the caller side, *if* people know where to find the suitable name.). Hidden friends are very much appreciated in the standards committee, as they reduce the size of overload sets. You will then have to work around that on the cppyy side - I could imaging that to be possible, with some help from cling. Once you have identified a hidden friend overload you cannot spell it in a fully qualified way. Especially for operators we will have to switch to expression-based operator invocation (`a @ b`) rather than function-style invocation `operator@(a,b)`. As I said, that's what C++20 and later impose anyway. I will see that we implement the generic lookup you're after.

The issue was missing pointer stability due to the fact the resizing of the backend store could have incurred in copies later than previously expected.

Energy Efficiency,"So I finally managed to get back to this and try a few things and as a result in my tests I managed to go from 82 MB of overhead to 62 MB. See https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13641 for the actual code. While there is still a few things to cleanup, I think what I have is fairly general and quite self contained change, so I would appreciate feedback and if people like it, instructions on how to proceed to make sure this ends up upstream. The solution is based on a newly introduced `PagedVector<T>` which allows registering callbacks which get invoked whenever the associated range is accessed the first time. At such point, the range is actually allocated and each element of the range is passed to the callback. Initially I developed a mechanism to be general enough to do complex initialisations of the elements, however I later realised this is not actually needed. In order to optimise the issue with the large vectors `TypesLoaded` and `DeclsLoaded` one only needs to have something which does the default construction of their elements for ranges which are small enough to avoid to large upfront allocations. The code which is currently there in root / clang is already smart enough to lazily initialise only the elements which are actually needed, so the whole issue is to find a good tradeoff between number of ranges and sparse enough ones. A few caveats:. - `PagedVector` is a bad name, I agree. Suggestions are welcome.; - At the moment the implementation allows generic callbacks for ranges, however as I said we only need default initialisation. Removing such flexibility should buy another 1 MB from my test.; - In case `DeclID*` and `QualType` can default to all 0, one could probably achieve the same result in a more elegant way using calloc / realloc.; - There are probably other vectors which can be optimised in the same way, in particular IdentifiersLoaded as already mentioned by @vgvassilev.

Energy Efficiency,"So I think it's well defined what we mean by the range of a discrete variable - each value is declared as either being in the range or not in the range. RooFit already supports this for RooCategory, so that's all well and good. I do think it makes sense then to think about the behaviour of fits when such a range is declared. It's actually possible my original jira issue might have been referring to a case where I had a PDF that wasn't a RooSimultaneous but was dependent on a RooCategory and it wasn't handled correctly, I'd have to look back at it and remind myself. But for sure in the case of the RooCategory being the index category of a RooSimultaneous I think it makes total sense for the RooSimultaneous to be 'reduced' to just the channels that are in the range.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8231#issuecomment-1163101737:722,reduce,reduced,722,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8231#issuecomment-1163101737,1,['reduce'],['reduced']

Energy Efficiency,"Synopsis of the original error report:. Description. I had thought that our `art v3_09_01` based art passed all of our validation tests but I missed a single histogram that failed. I discovered it yesterday. I traced it back to the following. We have a file. `/pnfs/mu2e/scratch/users/brownd/workflow/default/outstage/44170899/00/00000/dig.brownd.CeEndpointMix.MDC2020b.001201_00000000.art`. It was written by `art v3_06_03`. One of the data products is of type `std::vector<StepPointMC>`, where `StepPointMC` is a class in our code base. The class contains 4 data members of type `CLHEP::Hep3Vector`:. https://github.com/Mu2e/Offline/blob/da4772bcb99f7b42bd401c3b15d56a211124553a/MCDataProducts/inc/StepPointMC.hh#L209. The `art::InputTag` is `""compressDigiMCs:virtualdetector""` . When I write a small job using `art v3_09_01` to read this data product and print out it's data members, all 4 of the `Hep3Vector` are `(0,0,0)`. When I run the same job using `art v3_06_03` all of the printout is correct. Remember that between `art v3_06_03` and `art v3_09_01` there was a schema change in `CLHEP::Hep3Vector`. You already fixed one bug related to that. I will prepare a stripped down example and add it to this issue. To reproduce. Unwind the following tar file on a machine that sees `/pnfs/mu2e and /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org`; ```; tar xzf /mu2e/app/users/kutschke/Bugs/Hep3Vector/artv3_09.tar.gz ; cd artv3_09; source /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/setupmu2e-art.sh; source setup.sh; scons -j 8; mu2e -c bug.fcl; ```; This prints most of the content of the the `StepPointMCs`. The bug is that the 4 `Hep3Vectors` are **all zero**. It's OK that the non-ionizing and visual energy depositions are zero; this data product captures steps in a virtual detector embedded inside a volume with a vacuum of `10^{-4} torr`.

Energy Efficiency,"Thanks a lot for the review and the questions!. > * Are we sure it's not possible to avoid the extra call to the interpreter? That is not done in the current status (there is the `eval` but I don't think it calls directly into cling every time). That's true, but probably `eval` is even worse. It's the `gInterpreter` of Python, which is ""many orders of magnitude slower for smaller expressions/objects than plain ol’ Python"": https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/enhancingperf.html#expression-evaluation-via-eval-experimental. Also, it's more flexible. Since in Python, you have to do `ROOT.kRed`, while gInterpreter can just take `kRed`, there was this hack of adding ""ROOT."" to the string passed to eval, which reduced flexibility and would result in unexpected errors for example when the user does `""1+kRed""` instead of `""kRed+1""`. > * What happens after this change to keyword arguments? Is this tested somewhere? For instance, can I call the same Python function with a random order of the keyword arguments even after these changes?.

Energy Efficiency,"Thanks a lot for this PR, that results from very intense debugging sessions initially enabled by @silverweed . Once the tests are green, I think these changes should be merged asap. There is no point in keeping around a fully jitted RDF+TTreeCache if it won't be used any more. After the aforementioned step is completed, we might perhaps think about what can go wrong with used memory and what we can do about it. For example, suppose a workflow with N dataframes. For some reason we do not control (e.g. some Dask internals or something imposed by the infrastructure) the scheduling is such that all of them are alive until the end of the processing. Can we cap the memory used by the caches? For example we could just keep 1 buffer and assign it to the tree cache of the chain associated to the RDF pulled from the worker's rdfs cache before using that RDF to process data (effectively using 1 single cache). De facto this means assuming N RDFs in flight but one TTreeCache buffer per worker.

Energy Efficiency,"Thanks to Axel digging into clang's code generation, we understood that what clang doesn't deal with very well is a large amount of variable instantiations of types with non-trivial destructors in the same function body.

Energy Efficiency,"The fact that `wait_for_workers` waits forever looks to me like the Dask job is never actually started. You should double check that a simple Dask application with the same config but doing something else unrelated to RDF is working. Let's see, something like this should suffice (inspired by the dask [docs](https://examples.dask.org/delayed.html) and your reproducer):; ```python; import time; import random. from dask import delayed; from dask.distributed import Client; from dask_jobqueue import HTCondorCluster. cluster = HTCondorCluster(cores=1, processes=1, memory=""1GB"", disk=""0.1GB"", job_extra={""jobflavour"": ""espresso""}); cluster.scale(jobs=1); client = Client(cluster). # Try with and without this; client.wait_for_workers(1). def inc(x):; time.sleep(random.random()); return x + 1. def dec(x):; time.sleep(random.random()); return x - 1. def add(x, y):; time.sleep(random.random()); return x + y. inc = delayed(inc); dec = delayed(dec); add = delayed(add). x = inc(1); y = dec(2); z = add(x, y). print(f""Result is: {z.compute()}""); ```. Coming back to RDF, the `npartitions` parameter corresponds to how many distributed tasks will be sent to the Dask scheduler. Supposing you know something about how many resources you have or the layout of your ROOT dataset, you could set this manually in the RDataFrame constructor like; ```python; df = RDataFrame(""treename"",""filename.root"",daskclient=client,npartitions=NPARTITIONS); ``` ; A good parallelisation can often be obtained when the number of partitions is roughly 3x the amount of cores you can use.; UPDATE:. > in particular I'm interested in using Dask's adaptive worker management, so that the exact number of submitted jobs is not fixed a priori but automatically adapts to the workload...

Accessing single pages that are remotely caged is now unsupported unless page buffering is enabled as a source option (which is by default the case). More details in the updated PR description. The change precludes storing the cage sizes in metadata or upper-bounding it in `RPageSourceDaos`, though it constrains that the entire page-group is requested and fetched - as the allocated buffer size for a cage depends on the sum of all the compressed sizes stored in the individual locators of requested pages belonging to that cage.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11466#issuecomment-1359215581:461,allocate,allocated,461,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11466#issuecomment-1359215581,1,['allocate'],['allocated']

You can immediately see that the color scale in rainbow is not continuous, which is then misleading for colour-blinded in a 2D plot (not so much in a 3D surf like this one). kCMYK is also not great because it's dark, then lighter, then half-dark again. Others like kAquamarine have almost no contrast, it would be almost impossible to see sth there. So that would be a quick way to separate them. The idea is that the grayscale should be as proportional as possible, and monotonously increasing or decreasing. Unless it is symmetrical, then it is fine to have white in the borders and black in the centre (for example for example an axis that goes between -40 degrees and + 40 degrees, the 0 has a meaning).

Energy Efficiency,"While fixing the CI runs, I reordered the commits a bit as well:. 1. The first two commits are still separate from the main part of this PR, see description in first message.; 3. The third commit is the actual meat: it adds error handling to MultiProcess, including tests.; 4. The fourth commit is a bug fix, but since it is a rather rare bug that is only triggered in pathological cases (that I happened to trigger in one of the tests added in commit 3) and since it interacts with a specific other part (cache-and-tracking), I thought it was better to keep it separate, so that the commit can explain the rationale for that specific fix well.; 5. Commit 5 is again a minor refactoring to reduce some duplicated code.; 6. Commit 6 adds a strong warning message when fits end after only having tried parameters that give evaluation errors. In such a case, there will not actually be any valid value, but rather the error handling code will return zero as the function value. Minuit sees this as a valid function value and thinks the function converged and so RooFit would also think everything ended well. With this commit, at least a warning is issued. Perhaps this response should be stronger or weaker, that is up for discussion.; 7. Commit 7 applies a recommendation from the Form documentation to replace it with Format.; 8.

Energy Efficiency,"ate commits to ease review - I plan to eventually squash them before merging. > I think we should test suppressed columns with staged clusters. Done, and it was indeed broken... > I wonder if it wouldn't be better, after all, to make staged clusters part of the normal code path. We would then have `CommitCluster()` being a shorthand for `StageCluster(); CommitStagedClusters();`. As discussed, it would mean that in the code you have to use a different API of you want to use staging. But perhaps that's not such a big deal. After all, even now you have to add extra code to commit the staged clusters. Partially done:; * I propose to rename `RNTupleFillContext::CommitCluster()` to `FlushCluster()`. This conveys the user intent, but gives flexibility to the implementation. `CommitStagedClusters()` can always be called.; * The new sink methods are `StageCluster()` and `CommitStagedClusters()`, for which `CommitCluster()` is a shorthand. The exception is `RPageSinkBuf` where we should still implement it directly because we can do so more efficiently. It is also needed to guarantee sequential files, which might not be the case with two separate critical sections.

Initially I thought these errors were just a by-product of the errors coming from `TInterpreter` that were leaving the dask worker in a bad state and thus breaking the scheduler too. But then, I updated to `distributed==2022.8.1` and they were not present. So I went on and I used `git bisect` starting from `2022.8.0` going onwards. . I was able to identify the following scenarios, depending on a combination of the status of ROOT and the version of dask `distributed` module:. * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: errors like shown shown above, both those coming from `TInterepreter::Calc` from RDF and those coming from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` that I mentioned in this comment.; * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No more errors about futures after shutdown**. The errors from `TInterpreter::Calc` remain; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: **No more errors from `TInterpreter::Calc`**, but still errors from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` **and also the segfaults with Python-onl",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11515#issuecomment-1272186236:1494,schedul,scheduler,1494,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11515#issuecomment-1272186236,1,['schedul'],['scheduler']

Energy Efficiency,"er. I have made a new commit, which addresses your and @hageboeck's review comments as much as possible. Point by point, let me quickly explain what changed:. - ""Upgraded"" comments on new functionality to doxygen. I did not doxygen document everything, because most functionality was copy-pasted from the old RooMinimizerFcn. The new things are now documented though.; - Renamed snake_case to dromedary.; - Use unique_ptr for parameter lists, as suggested by Stephan.; - Remove a few obsolete __ROOFIT_NOROOMINIMIZER flags (I guess these are part of the merge conflicts).; - I realized that part of what I changed in PR #8596 could (and imho should) have been introduced here already. I moved functionality to RooAbsMinimizerFcn, namely storage of the to-be-minimized function and constant term optimization information, but did not yet remove it (in this PR) from RooMinimizer. Now it has been removed.; - While going over the above, I realized I had actually *completely* forgot to add back in a backwards compatible way of enabling offsetting for numerical precision! This has now been correctly added back in. Then, about what I did not change:. - I did not have time for doing the include reordering/optimization that @hageboeck suggested. I tried to quickly figure it out, but I couldn't change things fast enough and still be able to guarantee that everything will still work in the later PRs that build on this one. I agree it would be nice, but I hope we can postpone this to some future PR, perhaps after the other additions have been merged.; - As mentioned earlier, RooAbsMinimizerFcn is basically a way to reduce code duplication. This should be seen in light of RooGradMinimizerFcn as well (see again PR #8596) and will also be used for a later addition. I think removing all data members and also the protected vs private suggestion would complicate this goal. I think it's good to merge like this (after fixing the conflict of course), but let me know if you have further suggestions!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8569#issuecomment-875559598:1676,reduce,reduce,1676,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8569#issuecomment-875559598,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Energy Efficiency,"g target-based CMake, and I believe I have fixed the issue of ROOT picking up its own headers here:; https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8709 (needs rebasing). This fixed it at least for many builtins. There still might be more builtins that have the same problem, but let's go one step at a time. I solved the VDT-related part a bit differently. If I rebased, the diff would approximately read (done manually, sorry for possible indentation errors):; ```diff; DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR} COMPONENT extra-headers); set(vdt ON CACHE BOOL ""Enabled because builtin_vdt enabled (${vdt_description})"" FORCE); set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY ROOT_BUILTIN_TARGETS VDT); - add_library(VDT::VDT STATIC IMPORTED GLOBAL); - set_target_properties(VDT::VDT; - PROPERTIES; - IMPORTED_LOCATION ""${VDT_LIBRARIES}""; - INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES ""${VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS}""; + add_library(VDT IMPORTED SHARED); + add_dependencies(VDT BUILTIN_VDT); + set_target_properties(VDT PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION ""${VDT_LIBRARIES}""); + target_include_directories(VDT INTERFACE $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${VDT_INCLUDE_DIR}> $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/>); ); endif(); endif(); ```; Whether the target is declared global, static or shared, I'm not sure if it makes a big difference. I'm happy to call it `VDT::VDT`, though. I think the important part was to switch the include directories via generator expressions, and to use **SYSTEM** includes instead of includes in `FindVDT`. #11844 is missing the usage of the `VDT::VDT` target in RooFit and in tmva, but that would come into effect after a rebase of #8709. I guess therefore that we could proceed with merging #11844 if it's green, and then I rebase #8709, so I have to do the rebase work only once. Does that sound reasonable for @amadio, @krasznaa, @bellenot ?. ### Edit ; And to be clear, for `SearchInstalledSoftware` I would leave everything as proposed in Attila's commit but the change to `target_include_directories` with the two generator expressions.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11797#issuecomment-1339660363:1688,green,green,1688,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11797#issuecomment-1339660363,1,['green'],['green']

Energy Efficiency,"ke_canvas.C; namespace root_global { ; unique_ptr<TCanvas> c1;; }. void make_canvas() {; // we decide at the top level to use a global here:; my_subroutine(root_global::c1);. //This one doesn't use a global and will die, our choice; unique_ptr<TCanvas> local_canvas;; my_subroutine(local_canvas);; }; ```; or if being a little more lazy, I'd likely use static instead of the namespace, but the root interpreter doesn't respect translation unit boundaries well. Really I'd use a class though in case I need to add more global things easily:. ```; //display.h. class display {; private:; unique_ptr<TCanvas> c1;; public:; void make_canvas() {; c1.reset(); ; c1.reset(new TCanvas());; }; };; ```; And use it like:; ```; //make_display.C; #include ""display.h"". namespace root_global { ; display my_display;; }. // main routine:; void make_display() { ; // This one will stick around; root_global::my_display.make_canvas();. // This one wont. ; display local_display;; local_display.make_canvas();; }; ```. There are two main differences compared to the PR. 1) I'm not letting the subroutine allocate heap objects that aren't handled explicitly by the caller. 2) I'm using standard C++ that even works fine right now in root 6. That's nice because it's easier to learn, recognize, understand, and apply elsewhere. Maybe it's a bonus that syntax for creating the TCanvas is always the same and separated from syntax for keeping it. Maybe (1) can be done with RDirectory, and just isn't done in the PR example. I don't know enough about it. If the root objects all had some kind of empty non-displayed initial state, and their own reset() re-initializer, we wouldn't even need the unique_ptr. . Of course you could still end up calling make_display() as a subtroutine from another file, and if you do then it's still become a subroutine allocating ""its own"" heap objects. I just wouldn't, but with a little extra work for the usual extern declarations you could still access the memory elsewhere if you did.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7305#issuecomment-787621241:1747,allocate,allocate,1747,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7305#issuecomment-787621241,1,['allocate'],['allocate']

Energy Efficiency,"missing headers as a consequence. So I do strongly suspects a lot of conformity in distros there. As-is, this approach of trying it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for example. This would never happen if code was written with portability in mind from the get-go. But your closer exemplifies that even better: given the choice between *potential* scaling problems and *guaranteed* portability problems, you choose to accept the latter. Clearly, portability isn't high on your list. Portability is, however, very important. By providing a portable solution that works well within other environments, cppyy is now being used on large code bases in mathematics, chemistry, and biology. That work uncovers errors even deep inside Cling, because it is pushed harder and used differently than in the CINT-tamed HEP world. Here is a current problem I'm working on for example. Try it in ROOT master, and watch memory consumption grow with top or whatever:. ```; $ root -l -b; root [0] template <class T, class U> class __gmp_expr;; root [1] typedef struct{ } __mpz_struct;; root [2] typedef __gmp_expr<__mpz_struct[1],__mpz_struct[1]> mpz_class;; root [3] for (;;) gInterpreter->ClassInfo_IsEnum(""std::vector<mpz_class>::value_type""); ```. That leak occurs when `findScope` in the LookupHelper starts parsing whenever `quickFindDecl()` fails (it's nothing to do with `mpz_class` or `ClassInfo_IsEnum` per se, just that that's where it was first found). If `quickFindDecl()` succeeds, then no leak. Since this is an accumulation of internal state, it will _not_ be reported by valgrind as a leak. Use of `findScope` is pervasive, not just from Python, but also from I/O and in clingutils. So, you're sitting on a leak even in HEP (where, especially in the LHC experiments, memory is precious), but your standard test tools won't catch it. To discover these types of deep problems, you need portable software, as that ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510:3628,consumption,consumption,3628,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510,1,['consumption'],['consumption']

Energy Efficiency,"n the description of the issue above I stated `distributed==2022.7.1`, this was my starting version for the tests I will describe in the following. First, I noticed this type of error, happening between a test and another; ```; 2022-10-08 02:33:36,474 - tornado.application - ERROR - Exception in callback functools.partial(<bound method IOLoop._discard_future_result of <tornado.platform.asyncio.AsyncIOLoop object at 0x7f946cbb8340>>, <Task finished name='Task-245' coro=<SpecCluster._correct_state_internal() done, defined at /home/vpadulan/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/distributed/deploy/spec.py:330> exception=RuntimeError('cannot schedule new futures after shutdown')>); Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/home/vpadulan/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tornado/ioloop.py"", line 741, in _run_callback; ret = callback(); File ""/home/vpadulan/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tornado/ioloop.py"", line 765, in _discard_future_result; future.result(); RuntimeError: cannot schedule new futures after shutdown; ```. Initially I thought these errors were just a by-product of the errors coming from `TInterpreter` that were leaving the dask worker in a bad state and thus breaking the scheduler too. But then, I updated to `distributed==2022.8.1` and they were not present. So I went on and I used `git bisect` starting from `2022.8.0` going onwards. . I was able to identify the following scenarios, depending on a combination of the status of ROOT and the version of dask `distributed` module:. * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: errors like shown shown above, both those coming from `TInterepreter::Calc` from RDF and those coming from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` that I mentioned in this comment.; * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No more errors about futures after shutdown**. The errors from `TInterpreter::Calc` remain; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: **No more errors from `TInterpreter:",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11515#issuecomment-1272186236:1284,schedul,schedule,1284,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11515#issuecomment-1272186236,1,['schedul'],['schedule']

Energy Efficiency,"o thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ). So unless ""we should never use `global`"" is a new convention being followed in ROOT, I believe it doesn't seem to track. 4. As seen in this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693392), Python used to differentiate between having a global statement or not. And even though the answer is more than ten years old, I experienced this firsthand when I started using Python (about four years back). So even though Python changed how it treats the variable binding in the newer versions, I would say it doesn't harm us by keeping them and might benefit us in the future. If these counterpoints do not convince you, I will remove the global statements in the PR. :).

I say a hard limit because we probably don't want our users to have to adjust these settings, and we can batch submit calls when the number of files is larger than the ring size.

By default the completion queue size is twice that of the submission queue (what we specify in the setup call). Before kernel 5.5., this means we run the risk of overflowing the completion queue buffer if we keep submitting events without handling them! (see io_uring section of this [article](https://ndportmann.com/io_uring-foundation/)). After 5.5 the kernel maintains an overflow list for us. . I don't know how many files we're typically opening, but based on everything else I'd suggest a ring size of 512 as a default? ; We can measure whether different ring sizes make a difference.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5919#issuecomment-658821831:1431,allocate,allocate,1431,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5919#issuecomment-658821831,5,"['allocate', 'power']","['allocate', 'power']"

Energy Efficiency,"of prefixing messages with a string to indicate the origin, e.g. when you logged from MnHesse, messages would be prefixed with ""MnHesse:"". Inside ``MnHesse``, to stay with the example, you might have seen code like this; ```c++; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some foo happened"");; [...]; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; Setting the prefix by hand was error prone and repetetive and made the logging code more distractive from the actual code. Especially now, since all the debug messages should also have this prefix, I wanted to automate this. So I turned MnPrint into a class that one can instantiate with a prefix for a given scope.; ```c++; MnPrint print(""MnHesse""); // appears once at the beginning of a long method; [...]; print.Info(""Some foo happened"");; [...]; print.Info(""Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; print.Info(""Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; The method ``MnPrint::Info`` uses the prefix set in the MnPrint ctor. The ctor of MnPrint also has an optional argument to print with a local print level. If this is not set, the global print level is used. In the long run (not in this patch), we should get rid of the global print level, because global mutable variables are difficult to reason about and in particular do not play nice with multi-threading. This design prepares for that step.; * I generally made sure that the logging messages contain the same information as the previous ones, but I reduced excess whitespace and improved the formatting. Some debug messages added several empty lines to the output, which made the logs hard to read.; * In very few isolated cases I removed redundant messages. I did this only when two messages printed the same information in succession.; * In a few cases, I changed debug output so that variables are printed in one line that were printed in several lines. A log is easier to grep and scroll through when variables are on the same line as the prefix.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-719713799:1791,reduce,reduced,1791,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-719713799,1,['reduce'],['reduced']

Energy Efficiency,"ors from `TInterpreter::Calc` remain; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: **No more errors from `TInterpreter::Calc`**, but still errors from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` **and also the segfaults with Python-only stacktrace** that I wrote in a previous comment; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No errors at all!**. So it seems that a mix of adding the fix suggested by Philippe (a `R_LOCKGUARD` in `TClingClassInfo::IsEnum`) plus updating to `distributed==2022.8.1` fixes all our problems. ## More details about the `distributed` versions. Thanks to the `git bisect` I could identify more closely the sources of errors on the dask side. For the very weird Python stacktrace leading to a full segfault, I found that https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/6684 seems to fix it. In test runs where the segfault is triggered, before getting it (and the Python stacktrace), I can see these lines ; ```; RuntimeError: cannot schedule new futures after shutdown; Exception in thread AsyncProcess Dask Worker process (from Nanny) watch process join:; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/usr/lib64/python3.10/threading.py"", line 1016, in _bootstrap_inner; self.run(); File ""/usr/lib64/python3.10/threading.py"", line 953, in run; self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs); File ""/home/vpadulan/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/distributed/process.py"", line 238, in _watch_process; assert exitcode is not None; AssertionError; ```. The line `assert exitcode is not None` in `process.py` is exactly what is being changed by the linked PR above. For the more generic error `RuntimeError: cannot schedule new futures after shutdown`, which practically happens every time the test ends, at shutdown time of the dask cluster object, it seems like the proper fix was given by https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/6847 .

Energy Efficiency,"r::Calc` remain; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: **No more errors from `TInterpreter::Calc`**, but still errors from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` **and also the segfaults with Python-only stacktrace** that I wrote in a previous comment; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No errors at all!**. So it seems that a mix of adding the fix suggested by Philippe (a `R_LOCKGUARD` in `TClingClassInfo::IsEnum`) plus updating to `distributed==2022.8.1` fixes all our problems. ## More details about the `distributed` versions. Thanks to the `git bisect` I could identify more closely the sources of errors on the dask side. For the very weird Python stacktrace leading to a full segfault, I found that https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/6684 seems to fix it. In test runs where the segfault is triggered, before getting it (and the Python stacktrace), I can see these lines ; ```; RuntimeError: cannot schedule new futures after shutdown; Exception in thread AsyncProcess Dask Worker process (from Nanny) watch process join:; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/usr/lib64/python3.10/threading.py"", line 1016, in _bootstrap_inner; self.run(); File ""/usr/lib64/python3.10/threading.py"", line 953, in run; self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs); File ""/home/vpadulan/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/distributed/process.py"", line 238, in _watch_process; assert exitcode is not None; AssertionError; ```. The line `assert exitcode is not None` in `process.py` is exactly what is being changed by the linked PR above. For the more generic error `RuntimeError: cannot schedule new futures after shutdown`, which practically happens every time the test ends, at shutdown time of the dask cluster object, it seems like the proper fix was given by https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/6847 .

Energy Efficiency,"rging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. No, the approaches are different. In the approach without `RDataFrame::Merge` I save twice the modified trees with the new column added, so the whole thing is slower than the second approach where the looping and saving can be done only once. . > ; > ## Current possible approaches; > If you need to process a dataset with RDF and need to concatenate parts of it, the current best approach is to use the `RDataFrame(TTree &tree)` constructor after having created the correct tree with all the information you need. If for example you need to concatenate vertically 2 or more TTrees (i.e. if all have the same schema with column `a` and you want to append values of the same column into a single entity), than you can create a TChain and add all the trees to it. If you need horizontal concatenation (i.e. the trees have different schema but same number of entries) you can use friends pattern (e.g. `tree.AddFriend`). This has the big advantage that you don't need to merge any of the files/trees together and thus you also don't need to save them again before creating the RDF object. At the same time, once you do create the RDF object with this; concatenated dataset, you will still be able to call `Snapshot` and get practically a ""merged"" dataset in your output file. OK, I agree with this and this is a third approach what you propose. The trees can be added as a chain to the `RDataFrame`, the chain can get branches added with `Define` and then `Snapshot` would make a merged version. This would probably mean looping and saving only once and it is efficient. However what if we have 3 trees in the brach and we need a branch `index` whose value is `1` for the first tree `2` for the second and `3` for the third. How would we do that with `Define`? Stuff like:. ```python; df = df.Define('index', 'GetTreeNumber() + 1'); ```. would not work, right?.

Energy Efficiency,"rotocols, etc. There is increasing amount of papers trying to address how we put C++ modules at scale (https://wg21.link/p2656, https://wg21.link/P2409, https://youtu.be/_LGR0U5Opdg?si=AbLazREvyl5PXVFG). Some papers/talks are more radical claiming that we cannot even roll out modules (as written in the standard) at such scale. . For modules to be useful and work reliably we know that we need to apply modularization bottom up. That means that before modularizing cmssw/art we need everything below starting from libc and libxml to become modular. That's something we observed during our modularization efforts in cmssw (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/15248). The reasons we cannot make it yet default is discussed here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/41810#issuecomment-1578982627 and here https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13000 Not surprisingly we have observed similar comments coming from modularization efforts in gcc and msvc. . Let's assume we live in an platonic world where all of the above is resolved. It still seems we will be able to use our dictionary system as it is because we will in the end have a build system that processes textual files to build them. There we could use any custom flavor of modules (or something better) that makes our I/O work. We can go one step further and claim that, even if we introduce strict interface encapsulation via C++ 20 modules, our I/O system would require to know more about the non-exported entities so that we can serialize and deserialize the private dependencies of the exported entities. That is, we will probably end up with a very similar system that we have today. I would personally like to tackle the engineering challenge as you have described. However I believe we are not there yet and any efforts into trying to adapt to a still volatile area would probably cause disturbances in our user base for not yet clear final goal. Does that address/answer the concerns you had when you opened that request?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13536#issuecomment-1693395998:3596,adapt,adapt,3596,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13536#issuecomment-1693395998,1,['adapt'],['adapt']

Energy Efficiency,"rrow. And I am afraid this will become more complicated in the future. Instead of messing with each of them, I thought it might be better to fix the issue in a single place on the ROOT side. > I am not a huge fan of the `RTLD_DEEPBIND` approach because it is not portable and it essentially overrides the dynamic linker behavior yet one more time. I am not sure how this would translate to Windows for example.; > ; I agree, me neither. If we can find a better and cleaner way, I am absolutely in favor of that. > IIUC, `RTLD_DEEPBIND` alters the search order of the dynamic linker and using -fPIC intends to deduplicate. That seems as bad as preloading a set of llvm dependent libraries, IMO. Do we need `libgandiva.so` to be compiled with -fPIC or just the executables which 'use' ROOT?; > ; All shared libraries must be compiled with -fPIC by definition, so libgandiva is already compiler with -fPIC. The change would only be for exectuables, which usually do not have -fPIC by default. But then actually other libraries have similar requirements, e.g. Qt5 (with -reduce-relocation flag, which is the default) requires all executables to link against Qt to be compiled with -fPIC. But again, if there is a better way, I am also in favor of avoiding -fPIC-. > This check is to protect the subsequent `dlsyms` in TCling to resolve symbols from the wrong place.

Energy Efficiency,"t of the errors coming from `TInterpreter` that were leaving the dask worker in a bad state and thus breaking the scheduler too. But then, I updated to `distributed==2022.8.1` and they were not present. So I went on and I used `git bisect` starting from `2022.8.0` going onwards. . I was able to identify the following scenarios, depending on a combination of the status of ROOT and the version of dask `distributed` module:. * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: errors like shown shown above, both those coming from `TInterepreter::Calc` from RDF and those coming from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` that I mentioned in this comment.; * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No more errors about futures after shutdown**. The errors from `TInterpreter::Calc` remain; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: **No more errors from `TInterpreter::Calc`**, but still errors from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` **and also the segfaults with Python-only stacktrace** that I wrote in a previous comment; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No errors at all!**. So it seems that a mix of adding the fix suggested by Philippe (a `R_LOCKGUARD` in `TClingClassInfo::IsEnum`) plus updating to `distributed==2022.8.1` fixes all our problems. ## More details about the `distributed` versions. Thanks to the `git bisect` I could identify more closely the sources of errors on the dask side. For the very weird Python stacktrace leading to a full segfault, I found that https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/6684 seems to fix it.

Initially I thought these errors were just a by-product of the errors coming from `TInterpreter` that were leaving the dask worker in a bad state and thus breaking the scheduler too. But then, I updated to `distributed==2022.8.1` and they were not present. So I went on and I used `git bisect` starting from `2022.8.0` going onwards. . I was able to identify the following scenarios, depending on a combination of the status of ROOT and the version of dask `distributed` module:. * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: errors like shown shown above, both those coming from `TInterepreter::Calc` from RDF and those coming from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` that I mentioned in this comment.; * ROOT current master, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No more errors about futures after shutdown**. The errors from `TInterpreter::Calc` remain; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.0`: **No more errors from `TInterpreter::Calc`**, but still errors from dask about `cannot schedule new futures after shutdown` **and also the segfaults with Python-only stacktrace** that I wrote in a previous comment; * ROOT master+fix, with `distributed==2022.8.1`: **No errors at all!**. So it seems that a mix of adding the fix suggested by Philippe (a `R_LOCKGUARD` in `TClingClassInfo::IsEnum`) plus updating to `distributed==2022.8.1` fixes all our problems. ## More details about the `distributed` versions.

Energy Efficiency,"tributed execution, there is no more TTreeCache leaking leftover after the analysis (see any file ending with `_patch` and compare it with the same file ending with `_master`). Now that the main source of memory usage is gone, I have noticed a much smaller contribute that still seems to make the memory increase in the flamegraphs. And it seems to have something to do with the increased number of files, at least on the surface. Let's take the following two files to compare:; * test_agc_9sample_1file_10task_patch.html; * test_agc_9sample_10file_10task_patch.html. They are running exactly the same script, with all 9 RDF samples. In the first case we have 1 file per sample, in the second case 10 files per sample. The memray flamegraph report a total of 253.5 MB used for the first case and 260.9 MB used for the first case (7.4 MB delta). There are two main parts of the graph: the one deriving from the `clone` of the Dask process, where the actual analysis code is run, and the one deriving from the `_start` function where most of the Python code around the analysis is (things like `import`ing packages or the Dask worker-scheduler communication). The difference between the two graphs in the `clone` part is of 0.6 MB, the difference between the two `_start` parts is 6.7 MB, so I focus on that from now on. This 6.7 MB difference is in turn split between a 0.1 MB difference deriving from `_PyObject_VectorcallTState` and 6.6 MB difference deriving from. Finally, the vast majority of these 6.6 MB comes from:; * The metrics gathered by profiling (i.e. memray itself); * Dask communication protocol. [Screencast from 2024-07-26 10-47-18.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a21ea3e-c130-42af-b50b-bb324b06eaaa). TL;DR: After this patch the leftover memory increase may be attributed mostly to Dask or memray itself. To confirm this, I have executed the full AGC benchmark on the SWAN platform with 64 workers of the CERN condor pools for 10 times in a row.

Energy Efficiency,"uch luck on Windows. On the other hand, modern MSVC is fine, but then Clang5 underpinning Cling can not parse the C++ library headers of MSVC 19 with C++17 enabled. So catch-22. Shipped PCMs also prevent developers from using OpenMP with Cling, but at least that can still be done in libraries, which can be linked without otherwise exposing OpenMP. However, the baked-in choice for _not_ having AVX means not only that Cling can not use it, but also causes binary incompatability with libraries that were compiled with AVX enabled (e.g. many/most Eigen-based codes). Then there is the version of C++ being fixed by the PCMs (and worse, in RConfig.h and the ""backported"" stringview classes, so it's not a simple matter of wiping the local PCMs and rebuilding), meaning C++11 is the only supported version unless you do a full recompile (and see the forum for how much fun that is). And if you look at the whole list of nightlies of the past couple of weeks, and not only at the carefully selected all-green one out of a sea of red that you posted above, you'll see that non-Linux platforms fail disproportionally often. (In fact one of the recent ""green"" releases is only green b/c MacOS 10.15 and Windows10 are switched off.) That tells me that most of your developers work on Linux, and rely on the nightlies to catch any portability issues. That's a very poor approach b/c your matrix is necessarily limited given the enormous number of possible combinations. (That's another way of saying it's carefully selected.). I don't actually know if all those Linux systems are SLC, but did note for example that the build failed on SuSE Tumbleweed with gcc9, b/c SuSE does not install TBB by default to go with that compiler, and the build was missing headers as a consequence. So I do strongly suspects a lot of conformity in distros there. As-is, this approach of trying it, see if it fails, and if it doesn't fail declare it ""portable"" is exactly what causes folks to still cast pointers to long, for ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510:1888,green,green,1888,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-707273510,1,['green'],['green']

Energy Efficiency,"🤔 Just to understand, is it a known real leak or a false positive?. I initially thought it was something we in any case could not fix on our side and I also suppressed the sanitiser leak as described [here](https://gitlab.ep1.rub.de/fp311online/cern-root/-/tree/v6-22-08-ep1/core/sanitizer?ref_type=heads) (not sure this is an official documentation, but it's something google brought to my attention). In particular I added; ```; cd root_install/etc/; printf '\n#Full libCling for SMASH\nleak:libCling\n' >> lsan-root.supp; ```; together with; ```dockerfile; # This will let sanitizer suppress leaks according to suppressions file list of patterns; ENV LSAN_OPTIONS=""suppressions=${ROOTSYS}/etc/lsan-root.supp:print_suppressions=0""; ```; to my Dockerfile. Doing so, all the unit tests pass, but I then monitored memory usage over a long run of our application and a linear growth was evident (plot left below).

Integrability," I suppose you also need to create a new `__init__.py` file in the same directory. That would be enough for this PR I think. Here are some thoughts on what to do as we proceed (of course you can do some of it also in this PR if you like). We probably will have some common helper classes for RooFit pythonizations at some point, as there are reoccurring patterns, like the `RooCmdArg` pattern you saw in [`fitTo`](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#a8f802a3a93467d5b7b089e3ccaec0fa8). Then, I'd suggest to we don't create a new `@pythonization()` function every RooFit class we pythonize in the future, because that would mean to pattern-match all class names one after the other. Maybe we can have a single `@pythonization()` in `ROOT/pythonization/_roofit/__init__.py` that checks if the class has a name starting with `Roo`. If it does, it will call all the roofit pythonization functions that we create. As we add more pythonizations, we probably have to add some doxygen text if the pythonized interface behaves in any way dfferent from the C++ interface. An example here is [RVec](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/90116604cdd34cf296d0bbe8f636545ca239a6af/bindings/pyroot/pythonizations/python/ROOT/pythonization/_rvec.py#L11) (this is how it looks like in the [documentation](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1VecOps_1_1RVec.html#RVecdoxyref)). Finally, we can consider also adding some docstring to the pythonized function. That would be convenient in an interactive python shell, i.e. one could just type `??gaus.fitTo` and get a nice documentation for the pythonized function. However, I'm not sure if this is really worth it because it probably means duplication of documentation text. Still it's something to keep in mind. Right now, only pyROOT functions that are not pythonizations of C++ functions have such a docstring (e.g. [`RDataFrameAsNumpy`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/90116604cdd34cf296d0bbe8f636545ca239a6af/bindings/pyroot/python",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7314#issuecomment-790082105:1997,interface,interface,1997,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7314#issuecomment-790082105,2,['interface'],['interface']

Or one could see it from the other side and say that the current `-l` option is already the correct one to show multiple namecycles since ""longListing"" should include every extra detail possible about the objects in the file (including namecycles). If we go for this route though I would still say that the `-t` option is a bit confusing since it is effectively a `-l` option but just for trees.; ```; vpadulan@fedorathinkpad-T550 [~]: rootls -h; [...]; -l, --longListing Use a long listing format.; -t, --treeListing Print tree recursively and use a long listing format.; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8361#issuecomment-860019489:1912,rout,route,1912,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8361#issuecomment-860019489,1,['rout'],['route']

Integrability," between Std14 and Std17 are at least partly noise I think. I also have an implementation working now based on ```tbb::enumerable_thread_specific``` (https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/tbb-documentation/top/intel-threading-building-blocks-developer-reference/thread-local-storage/enumerablethreadspecific-template-class.html) . Now in principle what tbb is doing underneath should not so different from ``` TTHREAD_TLS_DECL```, at least for the explicit pthread-based version, so we can think about whether this is really safe from deadlocks, but the numbers looks pretty good. In the test output below ""TBB"" is using ```tbb::enumerable_thread_specific<LocalCounts>``` and ""TBBUnique"" is using ```tbb::enumerable_thread_specific<LocalCounts, tbb::cache_aligned_allocator<LocalCounts>, tbb::ets_key_per_instance>``` which is limited to a small number of instances per process (but not strictly to 1). If you would be willing to have tbb as a dependency for core/thread then I can add this (and maybe even remove the shared_mutex versions). ```; 76: Test command: /usr/bin/cmake ""-DCMD=/scratchnvme/bendavid/rootdev2/build/core/thread/test/corethreadtestUnit"" ""-DCWD=/scratchnvme/bendavid/rootdev2/build/core/thread/test"" ""-DSYS=/scratchnvme/bendavid/rootdev2/build"" ""-P"" ""/scratchnvme/bendavid/rootdev2/root/cmake/modules/RootTestDriver.cmake""; 76: Environment variables: ; 76: ROOT_HIST=0; 76: Test timeout computed to be: 1500; 76: Running main() from /scratchnvme/bendavid/rootdev2/build/googletest-prefix/src/googletest/googletest/src/gtest_main.cc; 76: [==========] Running 126 tests from 3 test suites.; 76: [----------] Global test environment set-up.; 76: [----------] 6 tests from InterpreterLock; 76: [ RUN ] InterpreterLock.ConcurrentCalc; 76: [ OK ] InterpreterLock.ConcurrentCalc (87 ms); 76: [ RUN ] InterpreterLock.ReadLocks; 76: [ OK ] InterpreterLock.ReadLocks (78 ms); 76: [ RUN ] InterpreterLock.BalancedUserReadLock; 76: [ OK ] InterpreterLock.Balanc",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6919#issuecomment-742071485:1044,depend,dependency,1044,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6919#issuecomment-742071485,1,['depend'],['dependency']

The program can be built with the options to; - Turn off task_arena isolation (-DNO_ISOLATE) at the 'module' level (this would represent removing such isolate calls in CMSSW); - Add another task arena (-DOTHER) which represents the global ROOT arena.; - Add task_arena isolate within the other arena (-DOTHER_ISOLATE) which would represent what would happen if ROOT internally called isolate within your own arena. The results are; - with only -DNO_ISOLATE see 'WRONG THREAD' message every time the program is run.

Integrability," like to give my two cents about this. > Instances of RDataFrame objects are meant to be treated like trees. I am curious about this first sentence. I have never got this impression, neither reading docs / toying with tutorials or doing more complex analyses with RDF. the first line of the [RDF docs](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html) says `ROOT's RDataFrame offers a high level interface for analyses of data stored in TTree, CSV's and other data formats. `. Just by the fact that I can read and process other formats than TTree I would say that in general RDF is not meant to be treated like a TTree. Otherwise I would also have to say that RDF is meant to be treated like a CSV file or something similar. > there should be a function that allows us to merge them. If I have to think about this function you propose, I don't see it going much further than the example you already have above. Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; ```python; # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2). # creating new columns in the datasets; df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'). # Merging the datasets in memory; df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; df_3.Snapshot('tree', ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927091065:1084,interface,interface,1084,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927091065,1,['interface'],['interface']

So we have about 2.5 issues. ; 1) The global command,; 2) the interface and ownership model, and; 2.5) with the way it's done in the PR also the non-castable syntax issue. Issue 2.5 is already covered. I do still like C++ globals better even in example 2. It separates how to make a TH1 from how to make it global. The RDirectory is more self-documenting than ""new"", but C++ one makes the file self documenting, not just the line of code. And, all else equal, vanilla is better. But by far the more important point is that I don't like example 2 or the PR. Regarding point 2, example 1 is surely more scalable. I already scaled it more than is possible with the PR. Of course you can edit the PR to make new key names on each call so that the RDirectory call can create more things. But scalable means I did it without needing to modify the underlying implementation or interface (which someone else might maintain) to get three plots instead of one. Furthermore, coming back to issue 1, **if you do edit the PR to have flexible (sequential or passed) RDirectory names, you also (edit: might) need to add explicit deletes (more lines of code) somewhere if you run it all in a batch loop, or you'll have a leak.**(**edit**: depending on exactly how the looping and naming is done, but it can easily happen) In other words a portion of the new/delete problem has just been hidden under new with a different name. This is exactly what I mean by modern ownership models. In example 1 the top level code asked for memory that it owns. In my class version it made an instance that it owns. Objects are scoped only as far as requested. When that scope dies, or the container is reset, it's cleaned up where it is made. That's what smart pointers are all about.

Acknowledged that re-interpretation of issues is difficult; in this case I would argue that I better understood the underlying reason and changed the issue to correct the description.

Yes, I would have opened the same issue if I had understood the underlying reason before; that's why I updated it. > ROOT 7 has now the same CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD requirements, so please give me a new example of why someone would do this.

The ""wrong signal"" that this sends is exactly what you describe: A valid report of something not working is thought ""not relevant to fix"".

Integrability,"(I'm not part of the root team, just someone who uses this a lot). There are a few things you may already be aware of, but if not might be helpful;. 1. The [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5) library; if all you are doing is reading from root format files and then processing with other libraries, then uproot is a much lighter weight, more modern feeling, way to read data. You don't need root installed at all to use it. Afaik, it's only got a python api, so you would still need root for c++ stuff. 2. The reason for all the TThis and TThat is the [Taligent](https://root.cern/TaligentDocs/TaligentOnline/DocumentRoot/1.0/Docs/books/WM/WM_63.html#HEADING77) naming standard. That made a lot more sense of things for me. 3. The official root docs are fairly nicely presented. E.g https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTTree.html which does start by doing it's best to describe what the heck a TTree is. Perhaps in a sense the official docs are a glossary, just not a very complete one yet? TTree and TLeaf are both well documented, TBranch is a bit sketcher. Possibly because we aren't meant to handle them directly too often. Most of your suggested translations are a reasonable description of the basic function of those classes, but sometimes it gets more complicated. For example, a TTree can be a rectangular array, but it's more often a ragged array (edit, or I suppose, not an array at all, depending what got saved there). Also a TBranch may in fact hold compiled objects, or even just a part of a compiled object.

This option is also a ROOT default for shared libraries. I tested adding it to `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` for executable as well and it doesn't change anything.

Unfortunately I cannot reproduce this on my end. It's correct that only a few files are compiled with `-fno-rtti`, all others including `TCling.cxx` interface with the rest of ROOT and must be built with RTTI.

RooRealVar par(""par"", """", -0.005, -5, 5);; RooProduct parMod(""par_mod"", """", RooArgSet(par, RooConst(10)));. RooGaussian gauss(""gauss"", """", x, parMod, RooConst(2.0));; RooGenericPdf pdf(""pdf"", ""gauss"", gauss);. std::unique_ptr<RooAbsReal> integ1{gauss.createIntegral(x, *pdf.getIntegratorConfig(), nullptr)};; integ1->Print(""v"");. std::cout << std::endl;. std::unique_ptr<RooAbsReal> integ2{pdf.createIntegral(x, *pdf.getIntegratorConfig(), nullptr)};; integ2->Print(""v"");; }; ```. The integral of the Gaussian has the correct value (`V`) servers (the parameters of the Gaussian):; ```; (0x7ffc9b9bf798,-S) RooRealVar::x """"; (0x7ffc9b9bf240,--) RooGaussian::gauss """"; (0x7ffc9b9bff68,V-) RooProduct::par_mod """"; (0x55ac531cd470,V-) RooConstVar::2 ""2""; ```. The integral of the `RooGenericPdf` should have the same value servers, but it doesn't:; ```; (0x7ffc9b9bf798,-S) RooRealVar::x """"; (0x7ffc9b9bec88,--) RooRealSumPdf::pdf """"; (0x7ffc9b9bfb80,V-) RooRealVar::par """"; (0x55ac51984c50,V-) RooConstVar::10 ""10""; (0x55ac531cd470,V-) RooConstVar::2 ""2""; ```. For some reason, the direct value server, which is `par_mod` is **skipped** now, misrepresenting the client-server relationship. The new BatchMode makes strong use of the value-server interface for the `RooFitDriver`, so it's very sensitive to `RooRealIntegrals` getting it wrong. I need to fix this problem with the value servers registered for integrals on RooRealSumPdfs. Further notes:. * The problem has always been there in RooFit, it's just that the BatchMode uncovered it; * Naturally, the problem is somehow in `getValueAndShapeServers` in [RooRealIntegral.cxx](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooRealIntegral.cxx#L68); * Whatever the fix will be, it may be a too big change to the central `RooRealIntegral` class for a patch release...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11578#issuecomment-1281427464:1632,interface,interface,1632,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11578#issuecomment-1281427464,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"**TLDR;** I repeated your tests with our environment, see below for the actual setup. Without the root file being opened, I get more preloaded dictionaries (119), but roughly the same memory footprint. Adding a ROOT file on the command line it adds an additional 60MB and I see SOFIE and PyMVA being loaded on demand (see also #13055). ### Long story:. You can set up the same environment by going to lxplus and doing:. ```bash; → ALIBUILD_ARCH_PREFIX=""Packages"" WORK_DIR=/cvmfs/alice.cern.ch/el7-x86_64 . /cvmfs/alice.cern.ch/el7-x86_64/Packages/ROOT/v6-28-04-9/etc/profile.d/init.sh; /cvmfs/alice.cern.ch/el7-x86_64/Packages/AliEn-Runtime/v2-19-le-136/etc/profile.d/init.sh:source:7: no such file or directory: /cvmfs/alice.cern.ch/el7-x86_64/Packages/ApMon-CPP/v2.2.8-alice5-40/etc/profile.d/init.sh; ```. You can safely ignore the ApMon message. Without the root file, I still see over one hundred preloaded, while ""on demand"" and the memory usage is roughly the same. ```bash; # eulisse at lxplus707.cern.ch in ~ [9:39:17]; → ROOTDEBUG=7 root.exe -l -b -q 2>&1 | grep Preloading | wc -l; 119. # eulisse at lxplus707.cern.ch in ~ [9:39:24]; → ROOTDEBUG=7 root.exe -l -b -q 2>&1 | grep 'on demand' | cut -d' ' -f 2 | sort | uniq | wc -l. 34. # eulisse at lxplus707.cern.ch in ~ [9:39:57]; → /usr/bin/time -v root.exe -l -b -q.

So, during the generation of the object file of `CudaMatrix.cu`, the include dir points only to the build include. But I can't find a copy/install target in CMake, which should copy CudaMatrix.h to this directory. Still, it seems to be a threading problem, which only occurs for the CUDA library. ---. Regarding building the method with **CUDA 7.5 on Ubuntu 16.04:**. Here the CMake config:. ```; cmake .. \; -Dalien=OFF -Dcuda=ON \; -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-7.5 \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++-4.9 \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc-4.9; ```. The error message:. ```; /usr/include/string.h: In function ‘void* __mempcpy_inline(void*, const void*, size_t)’:; /usr/include/string.h:652:42: error: ‘memcpy’ was not declared in this scope; return (char *) memcpy (__dest, __src, __n) + __n;; ```. And yes, it is fixed, if you append `-DCUDA_NVCC_FLAGS=""-D_FORCE_INLINES""` to CMake! As well, CUDA 8.0 does not break with this flag. So we could append this flag permanently, though I don't like this idea because it clutters the build system. On the other hand, every Ubuntu LTS 16.04 user for the next years will face this problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/283#issuecomment-257136223:3013,message,message,3013,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/283#issuecomment-257136223,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"705/commits/365bd46563c025a5341b48e6d199b2aa4be76c4e. I think we need to collect the prefix stack if we want to be able to filter out, for example, messages from MnLineSearch that happen inside MnMigrad, but not those that happen inside MnHesse. That's why I think the prefix stack should stay. It is also fast, since only a couple of pointers are copied around. However, there is no need to show the full stack of prefixes. By default, MnPrint could just show the prefix from the innermost scope. I added the static method `MnPrint::ShowPrefixStack(bool yes)` to toggle showing the full prefix or not. The default is off so that the messages are not too long. I also now implemented filtering of messages based on the value of the prefix stack. When no filters are set, all messages are shown. Once a filter is set, only messages that match the filter are shown. This is done with strings, using `MnPrint::AddFilter` and `MnPrint::ClearFilter` to reset the filters. Filtering works like `grep` on the full prefix, the message is shown if any of the filter strings match. To only see messages from `MnHesse`, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""MnHesse"");; ```; To only see messages from `MnHesse` called from VariableMetrixBuilder, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""VariableMetricBuilder:MnHesse"");; ```; To only match the beginning of the prefix string, use ""^"". For example,; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""^MnHesse"");; ```; only matches direct execution of MnHesse, but not MnHesse called by MnMigrad. It also works with substrings. To see all messages from any Gradient calculator, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""Gradient"");; ```; to match AnalyticalGradientCalculator, Numerical2PGradientCalculator, and InitialGradientCalculator. Filtering is not implemented in a very efficient way to keep the code simple, but the performance drop is opt-in. If no filters are used, then there is no performance loss. The filters work correctly whether or not the full prefix is displayed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-733046580:1203,message,message,1203,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6705#issuecomment-733046580,4,['message'],"['message', 'messages']"

Integrability,":thinking: As I wrote earlier, with `builtin_vdt` used for the build, `ROOTConfig.cmake` should indeed probably add the ROOT installation path as a search path for VDT. To clarify: 6.30 now makes a dependency explicit, which was always there. And which required people **not** using `builtin_vdt` (for instance ATLAS...) to call `find_package(VDT)` in their own code, and link against `VDT::VDT` on their own, just to be able to use some of the ROOT libraries. So for some people the new ROOT version behaves a lot better now... But yes, I didn't think of use-cases where people use a built-in version of VDT in ROOT, and they set up their build against ROOT without setting up the ROOT runtime environment. :thinking: (Does your build system set up the appropriate environment for running the dictionary generation, as part of the build commands? Since you do need the full ROOT runtime environment for that. Or do you just not generate any dictionaries in that particular build? :confused:)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14163#issuecomment-1837408368:198,depend,dependency,198,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14163#issuecomment-1837408368,1,['depend'],['dependency']

Though on this latter part I wasn't sure how you prefer to pass configuration options from the build to the generated `ROOTConfig.cmake` file. :thinking:. 2. Just use `VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS` and `VDT_LIBRARIES` correctly. Like:. ```diff; diff --git a/math/vecops/CMakeLists.txt b/math/vecops/CMakeLists.txt; index 09fde3eb40..dd998c1a9b 100644; --- a/math/vecops/CMakeLists.txt; +++ b/math/vecops/CMakeLists.txt; @@ -8,10 +8,6 @@; # CMakeLists.txt file for building ROOT math/vecops package; ############################################################################; ; -if(builtin_vdt); - link_directories(${CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}); -endif(); -; ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE(ROOTVecOps; HEADERS; ROOT/RVec.hxx; @@ -23,13 +19,13 @@ ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE(ROOTVecOps; Core; ); ; -if(builtin_vdt OR vdt); - target_include_directories(ROOTVecOps PRIVATE ${VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS} INTERFACE $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS}>); -endif(); -; if(builtin_vdt); - target_link_libraries(ROOTVecOps PRIVATE ${VDT_LIBRARIES}); + target_include_directories(ROOTVecOps PUBLIC $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS}>; + $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}>); + target_link_libraries(ROOTVecOps PUBLIC $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${VDT_LIBRARIES}>; + $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/${CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX}vdt${CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX}>); elseif(vdt); + target_include_directories(ROOTVecOps PUBLIC ${VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS}); target_link_libraries(ROOTVecOps PUBLIC ${VDT_LIBRARIES}); endif(); ```. I personally favour option 1, as it should be a bit more robust in the long run in my mind. But option 2 could work as well. Though it makes relocatabiity harder. (If VDT is in a different place after relocation, the `ROOTConfig-targets.cmake` file now needs to be manually updated as part of the relocation. Which is not great.)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11797#issuecomment-1339057027:3487,INTERFACE,INTERFACE,3487,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11797#issuecomment-1339057027,1,['INTERFACE'],['INTERFACE']
