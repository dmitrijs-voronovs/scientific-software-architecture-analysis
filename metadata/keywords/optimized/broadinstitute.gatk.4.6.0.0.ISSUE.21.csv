Testability,"This PR fixes two bugs. First, the SplitIntervals task would enter WeightedSplitIntervals and hang. I added an extra boolean argument to extract so you can specify that no, you really don't want to use a weighted bed. Relatedly, the code branch for running the original GATK SplitIntervals code wasn't correct, as passing weight-bed-file to it as an argument caused a failure. It uses a slightly hacky method of defining a string in WDL to be empty or not depending on if we use weighted beds, interpolating that string into the bash, then checking to see if it's empty there to transmit that state. There is likely a cleaner way to do this, and in the next revision I will likely rewrite this part cleaner. Second, after SplitIntervals passed we hit an error during ExtractTask. The way it expanded intervals to handle large deletions could sometimes subtract past the start of a chromosome, so that logic needed to be patched in a few separate places to handle the interval for the mitochondrial dna that started much closer to the beginning (instead of having a 10k base pair buffer).

Testability,"This PR is an attempt at improving SelectVariants by. - Rewriting unclear code;; - Adding documentation where needed; and; - Adding tests. The initial motivation for this code change (#7497) was to improve performance of SelectVariants by adding an option to do the ""INFO-level filtering"" before doing ""genotype filtering."" Our assumption was that this would improve performance because then we would avoid the expensive genotype ""fully-decode"" operation, which turns string format fields into appropriate object/types (int, array, etc.). This is (we think) done in `VariantContext.fullyDecode().`. This turned out not to be possible for the following reasons. First, there are roughly four types of genotype subsetting you could do:. a) By the sample names (`--sample-name NA12878`); b) JEXL (`--select GQ > 0`); c) JEXL by accessing the variant context object (`--select vc.getGenotype('NA12878').getGQ() > 1`); d) Others (e.g. `--remove-fraction-genotype`). a) does not need ""fully-decode."" It turns out b) was never supported (GATK currently removes all variants and succeed.) And from my experiments, c) does not seem to ever trigger calling `VariantContext.fullyDecode().` In fact the only code path I can see that calls fullyDecode() is by setting the `fully-decode` SelectVariants argument, which seems to just call fullyDecode at the beginning just for the sake of calling it (or so it appears to me. The utility of this command line argument is highly dubious.) . It's possible that apache code does something similar to fully decoding that could affect performance. All that is to say that we cannot achieve performance improvement with our original blueprint simply because this expensive ""fullyDecode"" operation seems to be a mythical operation that is never used in reality. So while I could not speed up SelectVariants, I cleaned up the code and added the following new arguments:. * `--select-genotype`: with this new genotype-specific JEXL argument, we support filtering by genotype f",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8092:132,test,tests,132,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8092,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"This PR modifies `HaplotypeCaller` so that it can output and genotype spanning deletion alleles represented by the `*` allele. . Currently, the output of `HaplotypeCaller` will not include spanning deletion alleles when run in single sample VCF mode or in genotype given alleles mode, even when that genotype would be more appropriate. In the joint calling workflow `GenotypeGVCFs` adds genotypes for spanning deletions, although the input likelihoods will not be broken out to specifically account for spanning deletion alleles. Some implementation notes:. - I also fixed some behavior specific to GGA mode that I encountered while testing this bug. In particular, when GGA mode was run with multiple variants with the same start position or with spanning events, `HaplotypeCaller` used to emit the warning `""Multiple valid VCF records detected in the alleles input file at site "" + loc + "", only considering the first record""` for each such site. This was a bit of a misleading message, since the other variants were in fact taken into account UNLESS HC decided to emit an empty variant context, for example due to zero coverage.; - I rewrote the `createAlleleMapper` method in `AssemblyBasedCallerGenotypingEngine`. The old version had a very brittle mapping scheme that depended heavily on the ordering of alleles in the variant context created by `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils.makeMergedVariantContext` and `getEventsAtThisLoc`. This proved to be difficult to ensure when spanning deletions were added in, and there was an ominous TODO in the old method saying that the logic was not good enough, so I ended up re-writing it from scratch. The new version is longer but I hope it is easier to read and less fragile, but let me know if I've missed anything. Test currently fail on this branch and therefore it should not be merged.

Finally, the BAM files are concatenated together after writing an initial header. This is very similar to the approach that Hadoop-BAM takes, but adapted to work on Spark. I haven't done extensive benchmarking, but when I ran MD on a ~75MB BAM the runtime dropped from >30 mins to around 8 mins.

Testability,"This feature request stems from discussion at the end of <https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1547> for CombineVariants. If the field as a whole (and its tools) does not have a deterministic logic in ordering ALT alleles in multiallelic VCF records of mixed types (@vdauwera says AFAIK there is no order), then I think it will be useful to have an option when combining sites of different types, e.g. INDEL and SNP, to be able to represent the ALT alleles according to a user-provided file. ALT alleles not present in the user-provided file would become a separate VCF record. I ask for this feature because (outside) tools like Beagle (identity-by-descent calculations) require identical representation of ALT alleles to its resource file. Records that do not match in CHROM, POS, REF and ALT are ignored by the tool. I have used an outside tool to merge records vertically so each site is represented once. It wasn't clear to me how the ALT alleles were ordered so I manually reviewed the 80-some multiallelic sites of mixed type after the merge.

The driving use-case is that we took over the GATK3 MergeVariantsAndGenotypes tool at DISCVRseq and users have been requesting the older behavior on VCF merges, such as: https://github.com/BimberLab/DISCVRSeq/issues/313. . The original PR has been languishing since March and I'm hoping to finalize this feature. Because I cant write to the GATK repo and b/c @lbergelson made some suggestions on a GATK-based branch I am going to put every together into one clean PR, which responds to the code review from the thread above. . To recap background: . - In GATK3, when merging variants, the IDs of all the source VCFs were retained. The GATK4 code path seems like it intended to do this, since the variantSources set is generated, but that variant isnt used for anything (I assume GATK3 code was partially carried forward to incompletely refactored?). . - This PR is designed to allow code to opt-in to the old GATK behavior of retaining the IDs of source VCFs in the ID field. It will not change the default behavior for existing code. - I dont think I can kick off the test suite, but these tests did pass here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8752. Again, @lbergelson and @droazen both reviewed the original PR and seemed fine with it in principle. The primary concern raised by @droazen was to avoid changing the current defaults and to not create additional burden (such as adding sorts). I believe this addresses both of those concerns. @jamesemery commented on the thread at one point as well. . Is there anything I can do to help move this forward?

The bug was causing the calculator to not include homozygous `*` genotypes in the sum of non-site specific variant allele probabilities that is the basis for the qual score. The bug was caused by an off-by-one index error: `IndexRange(0,2)` returns `[0,1]`, not `[0,1,2]` as intended. Not including this genotype inflated the quality score for these sites. . Due to interactions with QUAL-based variant and allele trimming, this causes slightly different behavior when HaplotyeCaller is run in modes where it is forced to emit variants for every locus, as can be seen in the `expected/gvcf.basepairResolution.includeNonVariantSites.vcf` test file for `GenotypeGVCFsIntegrationTest`: 1) Sites spanned by a deletion are now reported with a `*` alt allele and have QUAL 0 and a LowQual filter.

Testability,"This fixes a bug that @meganshand found. Here's the background:. By construction we do not assemble graphs with cycles (although @kvg has something to say about this). However, in rare cases recovering a dangling end may create a cycle. Although it's debatable whether this is an issue for the new, Dijkstra's algorithm-based best haplotype finding algorithm, we remove cycles before finding best haplotypes. It seems that the code for removing cycles can go into an infinite loop when, as in Mutect2's mitochondria mode, we allow for the recovery of forked dangling ends. This PR deletes a single line. `parentVertices` is the set of previously visited vertices in the depth-first search. When an edge is incident on one of these vertices it creates a cycle and we mark it for removal. My best guess (@ldgauthier could you be an extra set of brain? @droazen you're welcome to look, too.) is that the idea behind removing a `currentVertex` from `parentVertices` once all its edges were processed was to optimize the O(log n) cost of subsequent `parentVertices.contains` calls. Since it's a depth-first search, you would think that `currentVertex` will never be seen again and that this is innocuous. However, if some other branch of the depth-first search that is not descended from `currentVertex` also leads to a cycle that goes through `currentVertex`, forgetting that it has been visited creates a huge problem. I believe that forked dangling ends create this possibility. . Removing the line in question will incur a tiny performance cost, if any. By the time we get here the graph has been zipped into a `SeqGraph`, so it doesn't have very many vertices. In any case, `Set.contains` is not an expensive operation. We might even save runtime by eliminating all the `Set.remove`.

Testability,"This is a prototype of the basic infrastructure that must go in to make the junction tree based Haplotype finding work. I have pulled out a toggle for the HaplotypeCaller that that enables a separate ReadThreadingAssembler codepath for haplotype finding. Right now when this mode is enabled `ExperimentalReadThreadingAssembler` is used in conjunction with `JuncitonTreeKBestHalotypeFinder` to extract only haplotypes that show up in our junction trees with evidence of > 3 reads. This still poses problems with dangling end recovery as definitionally those branches never include complete junction tree data. . I will continue to work on this branch (as it is in a somewhat rough state still) but I would like to at least get some eyes on it before i get too deep in the weeds to at least validate the structural approach I have chosen. . Currently known issues in this branch: ; - Tests are failing due to resolution of non-unique reference sink vertexes, I would solicit help as to how best to resolve the case where junction trees point to both a reference stop allele and a continued path.; - There is at least one very degenerate edge case that might cause the code to hang, I would also ask after what is the best way to close out of looping assembly structures that never have reads to close them (i.e. a ""dangling end"" hom-var that happens to point to a non-unique reference base). ; - Probably after discussion the threshold for discarding junction trees will be changed to instead use paths from the discarded tree first. .

Testability,"This is an experiment to see if it's possible to run BWA-MEM on Spark. (Please don't merge.) The basic idea is that it uses JNI to call BWA-MEM's align function to align a batch of read pairs in one go. I think it should complement the work that @SHuang-Broad has been doing in #1701. It would be great to get your (and @akiezun's) feedback on the direction here. A few comments; - Building the native libraries is not integrated, and it's not using the Apache 2 licensed code. I think this could use some of the changes in #1701.; - The ref is assumed to be on the local FS for the moment - it should really be loaded from HDFS. Also, the output is a single SAM file on the local FS, not a sharded BAM as for the rest of the GATK Spark tools.; - It is assumed that read pairs are interleaved and reads in a pair are placed in the same split (by setting `hadoopbam.bam.keep-paired-reads-together`). However, that property only works for queryname sorted BAMs, which isn't the case here, so we need to relax that requirement in Hadoop-BAM.; - I haven't tried this on large inputs, so I don't know how well it performs. To run, I used the following on a cluster. ```; ./gatk-launch BwaSpark \; --ref /home/tom/workspace/jbwa/test/ref.fa \; --input hdfs:///user/$USER/bwa/R.bam \; --output /tmp/bwa.sam \; -- \; --sparkRunner SPARK --sparkMaster yarn-client \; --driver-memory 3G \; --num-executors 1 \; --executor-cores 1 \; --executor-memory 3G \; --archives jbwa-native.tar#jbwa-native \; --conf 'spark.executor.extraLibraryPath=jbwa-native'; ```. The interesting bit is the use of Spark's `--archives` flag to copy a tarball of native libraries (which I built manually) to every executor, and unpacks it in the working directory. Then `spark.executor.extraLibraryPath` is set to add that path to the library path of the executor.

In particular 7 of the 56 mark duplicates integration tests are failing with ""Cannot get mate information for an unpaired read"" - I'm not sure how to address that. I'd appreciate some help on this one. The code currently has four shuffles: one groupBy in transformFragments (in MarkDuplicatesSparkUtils), two groupBys in transformReads, and one combine (foldByKey) in generateMetrics. The combine is more efficient than the others since it can run on the map side, reducing the amount of data that goes through the shuffle. I think it may be possible to merge the processing of the fragments and the reads to eliminate a shuffle - so there are only two shuffles for the main transform.

Testability,"This is more of a question than an outright bug report. I've observed something very strange today, that I cannot reproduce, and am looking for some help figuring out what's going on. The long and the short of it is that I'm operating on a commercial platform where I've run the same job 4 times. I can see logs and confirm that a) the exact same docker image is used for all four runs, b) the exact same GATK command is use for all 4 runs, and c) the exact same inputs are provided to each of the four runs. I can't share details (yet) but I'm 99.99% confident that I'm executing the exact same code on the exact same input data and getting quite different results. Specifically the first job produces output that is different from the remaining three jobs, which are all identical (except for datetimes in the headers of VCFs). The outlier run misses a number variants (about 10% vs. the other three runs). And the entries in the gVCF where the variants are missed are weird. E.g. there'll be a gVCF entry for a single base where if you believed the data in the gVCF here would be no reason to emit a separate block. And that entry will have high coverage (e.g. DP=800), assign all the coverage to the REF allele (the site is clearly about 50/50 het in IGV) and emit GQ=0 for GT=0/0. . One very noticeable difference is that the three ""good"" runs complete traversal without any warnings, but that ""bad"" run emits the following warning once:. ```; WARN DepthPerSampleHC - Annotation will not be calculated, genotype is not called or alleleLikelihoodMap is null; ```. and the following warning many times (~350):. ```; 2020-10-08 21:15:12 bam_to_vcf STDERR 03:15:12.397 WARN StrandBiasBySample - Annotation will not be calculated, genotype is not called or alleleLikelihoodMap is null; ```.

Testability,"This is ready for review again, @droazen. I split the walkers in two: `ReadSliderWalker` and `VariantSliderWalker`, both based on `ReadWalker` and `VariantWalker` to traverse in a sliding-window approach.

Now `ReadShard` extends this class, but there is actually no change in the definitions. I wonder if it is worthy to maintain `ReadShard` as a separate class, because it seems that the only usage is in `AssemblyRegionWalker` and it could be easily changed by a `ShardSource<GATKRead>`.; - `FilteringIterator<T>`: another generic class for filter on iteration records. Now `ReadFilteringIterator` extends this class, but again I don't find any usage that requires an specific case instead of a generic.; - There is some repetition in the test code: `ShardSourceUnitTest` and `ReadShardUnitTest` are exactly the same. I didn't want to remove the later, but I think that it is redundant; the same for the `FilteringIteratorUnitTest` adn `ReadFilteringIterator.; - Because of the inclusion of `ArgumentCollectionDefinition`s for window-related parameters, I just want to know if I should include them in `AssemblyRegionWalker` to maintain consistency in the user options.

The tests use a mock `ReferenceDataflowSource` (rather than a mock `RefAPISource`), except for the tests for the actual implementations of each reference source which test the implementation class directly. `RefAPIMetadata` has been subsumed into `RefAPISource`. Also, the singleton has been removed, as I couldn't see what it was gaining. (The important thing is to cache the reference name table, which was stored in `RefAPIMetadata`.) It might make sense to use `@BeforeClass` in `RefAPISourceUnitTest` to ensure that only one `RefAPISource` is created, so only a single reference name table is needed. However, it looks like the test is currently creating a new table for each test case in that class.

Testability,"This should fix the travis failure by forcing lfs to overwrite the existing commit hooks. The issue seems to be this:. We install lfs in the first part of the travis build, and then we run a docker build and mount the git folder into it. Docker then installs lfs again. The problem is occurring because git lfs 3.1.1 which released 2 days ago changed the format of the pre-push and other git hooks. Then it throws an error when it's installed again and there are hooks that look different than it expects already in place. Running install with `--force` fixes it. The lfs devs actually have a system for ignoring these differences, but they forgot to update their list of allowed differences ( or however they match it) in 3.1.1. They then released 3.1.2 today which fixes this. In most cases this would fix the issue, except the git-lfs installed INSIDE the docker image is on an ancient version and never updates since the ancient image ubuntu is pegged to an out of date one. While the one in travis outside of docker gets updated to the most recent one. So we have to manually force this. We should probably also update our ubuntu image to a newer one. Of note, we don't actually NEED lfs in the docker for the tests at all, since we've already downloaded the files outside of docker and are mounting them in. Here's a passing build where I remove it https://app.travis-ci.com/github/broadinstitute/gatk/builds/246595037. I'm afraid though that some other system depends on it so I don't want to change it. .

Testability,"UPDATE: I solved the issue on my end. A collaborator was having the same issue with their haploid data, but not their diploid. The problems I described above were for haploid data. He added ""--new-qual"" to his GenotypeGVCFs command and that solved the issue. It did for me as well! Using the same combined GVCF file as I was before, genotyping finished in less than half a minute after adding the new-qual parameter. Thought it would be useful to know that:. 1, this issue appears to affect non-diploids more than diploids. 2, using --new-qual solved the issue, at least for me.

Testability,"Update: I made a list of particularly bad intervals for the DREAM4 and 20-plex Hapmap bams by scattering 500 ways, choosing the 20 slowest jobs (weighting by an empirical 3x slowness factor for jobs on nodes that couldn't use AVX PairHMM acceleration), scattering again etc to obtain 100 or so intervals of roughly 200 bp that took long. Then I confirmed that the slowness had nothing to do with SGE or cromwell (it shouldn't, because I was getting runtime from the GATK output log, not the cromwell log, but just in case. . .) by re-running each interval on gsa5. In *every* case, the slow intervals had extremely deep coverage (2,000 - 30,000) due to mapping error. Even after filtering to MQ == 60, the high coverage usually remained, although it often decreased significantly. In addition to the extreme depth, the only other sign was a significant proportion of reads with multiple SNVs relative to the reference. Unfortunately, something cheap to compute, like CIGAR complexity, was often not a sign, because many CIGARs were eg 101M, with many of the M's coming from SNVs. One quick solution would be to completely skip calling on regions with extremely high depth. It's hard to imagine being able to trust any calls from them. Another option is MQ-based downsampling, for example downsampling to the 1000 reads with the best MQ. Some people might like the downsampling option for the secure feeling of not losing sensitivity, although realistically those regions are so terrible that this security is an illusion. The only real protection is a more complete reference.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2975#issuecomment-309565338:478,log,log,478,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2975#issuecomment-309565338,2,['log'],['log']

Testability,"User Question: I'm trying to speed up the process of calling variants using SPARK. I have access to a slurm HPC cluster, so I guess it's not that straightforward to run GATK in a proper distributed master-slave architecture (if there is any tutorial on how to setup slurm jobs to use GATK Spark tools on multiple nodes I would appreciate it a lot). ; Therefore, I run GATK in local mode with some SPARK threads, eventually speeding up the process by parallelising the number of samples processed simultaneously with GNU parallel. But then, I'm having troubles because some samples crash due to SPARK errors. Perhaps you could send my logs to the developers ? I'm trying to run 8 parallel GATk jobs (8 samples) using 5 Spark cpus on each in a node with 40 cpus. . Best,; Pedro.

I am using GATK 4 Beta2 for testing HaplotypeCaller for our NGS workflow. .

I don't know, how to use multithreads (e.g. -nct) for GATK 4 version to reduce the execution time on the single node. Because, we have 32 cores per node with 512GB memory available for benchmarking. To parallelize the GATK 4 workload, I used the Spark version also. . I used **GATK 4 Beta2 Spark job on the cluster of 32 nodes** (32 nodes x 32 cores, totaling 1024 cores). The execution time is almost same as GATK 4 Beta2 ( 50 Hours, 21 min). Please help me, how to reduce the execution time for GATK 4 Beta2 HaplotypeCaller? .

Testability,"User says beta 2 is much faster than release. . ----; User Report; ----; Hi @Geraldine_VdAuwera , thanks for the quick response!. We used CCLE WES FASTQs for the purpose of testing (6GB per paired end). We scattered the tool using a custom BED file with 86 intervals. 4.0.0.0 failed due to memory with 2GB per job. It completed with 4GB per job. Each job lasted approximately 1h 10 min. 4.beta.2 completed with 2GB per job and each job lasted approximately 5m.

Pretty darn close to the same (and better than exomes -- we must still be using shorty exome reads? Because of crappy old 1000G data?). Comparing WGS metrics, number of variants went down slightly, (esp. singletons), but that's because of the things buoyed up by GQ0s (value1 is expected, value2 is actual).

Testability,"We can split the tests up into a bunch of build units, but we get rapidly diminishing returns since we spend minutes installing things and building the artifacts for every vm. Travis doesn't have any notion of a build pipeline, so we can't say ""build the artifact on 1 vm and then share it and run the tests on these 10 vms"". Since we have a hard limit of the number of VMs we can use at a time for DSDE ( currently 15) being less efficient is very bad news. ( We could of course pay for more... I recently asked travis support if we could switch to an unlimited pay for usage model and they said no. ) We could also try optimizing wasted vm time by prebuilding dockers to run in, but that's additional complication. (maybe not to much, might be worth it). We also would need a scheme for dividing tests evenly between VM's. I tried writing a testng test listener to distribute them between N nodes based on the hashcode of the test class, for use on circleci, but it fell over and exploded for some reason that I never debugged. We could either debug it, or possibly split the tests by splitting the list of test files and then passing those in specifically. (May run into character limits for command lines... ). Balancing it is going to be tricky though in any case since the tests are very unevenly expensive. (We could probably manually balance it since there are a small number of slow tests and the rest are so fast they don't really matter) . The easiest thing would be to set the test to run in parallel on their existing vm. I can try turning it on again. I remember it caused problems before though, which I assume we haven't addressed. Each vm has 2 cores, so we might see some speedup. I suspect we may be using both cores to some degree already, since performance nearly doubled when we switched from the 1 core to 2 core build machines.

Testability,"We found this trying to tie out the BQ version of the VQSR annotations with the Evoquer+Gnarly outputs, specifically in the RankSumTest annotations. This never got merged into master. The short story is... the implementation of median in the Histogram class is broken. Precisely, in this line it iterates through the bins of the histogram to find the midpoint index... however the keySet() it gets is from a HashMap and therefore not ordered. That code hasn't been touched in 2 years, so it's been this way for a while. It's tough to catch because of course there is a non-guaranteed ordering to the keys, and in the case of hashmap today when there are < 16 keys will be the hashcode of the keys modulo 16 until there is collision. The hashcode of integers is just the integer... so in our tests we have today it just happens to work because we have a small number of keys and they are close to each other so hash in the order we happen to want. I learned more about [HashMap internals](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes/java/util/HashMap.java) than I wanted to know in order to make a test case for it :/ .

Note that this feature needs to handle the companion index as well, if present. Also note that we should not add any new dependencies to htsjdk as part of this change. This change should be modeled on the equivalent change @tomwhite recently made for the reference classes in htsjdk (https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/308).

Testability,"When having a deletion that spans from before a splice site to after a splice site, Funcotator does not properly render Codon Change or Protein Change. For frame shifts, this is because Funcotator determines if a variant is a frame shift by looking at the number of bases inserted / deleted - if that number is evenly divisble by 3 it is in-frame. Deleted bases beyond the splice site should not be counted for frame shift purposes (in fact, the coding transcript should be used to determine frameshift for deletions). The following test case (defined in DataProviderForPik3caMnpFullData.java) tests this (hg19):. `new Object[] { ""PIK3CA"", 3, 178948159, 178948167, GencodeFuncotation.VariantClassification.SPLICE_SITE, GencodeFuncotation.VariantType.DEL, ""TGAGAGGTG"", ""T"", ""g.chr3:178948160_178948167delGAGAGGTG"", ""+"", ""c.2932_2936delGAGAGGTG"", ""c.(2932-2937)gagaggfs"", ""p.ER978fs"" }`. Unfortunately Oncotator also gets this wrong, so the ground truth needs to be changed for this test case. =========. For the non-frame shift case, currently Funcotator treats the bases beyond the end of the splice site as an alternate reference string, and the resulting codon change is wrong (and likely the protein change as well). The following test case (defined in DataProviderForPik3caMnpFullData.java) tests this:. `new Object[] { ""PIK3CA"", 3, 178948159, 178948168, GencodeFuncotation.VariantClassification.SPLICE_SITE, GencodeFuncotation.VariantType.DEL, ""TGAGAGGTGA"", ""T"", ""g.chr3:178948160_178948168delGAGAGGTGA"", ""+"", ""c.2932_2936delGAGAGGTGA"", ""c.(2932-2937)gagagg>g"", ""p.ER978del"" }`.

Testability,"When reads are mapped onto the genome short reads don't always find the best spot for indels. Sometimes reads are clipped at a position where a particular indel could have been mapped properly. Those regions you showed here are all homopolymer rich regions where assembly and variant calls are usually harder than other places. 3bp insertion within a GC rich region could easily be mapped wrong due to G and C nucleotide positioning and the way G/C nucleotide is handled by the sequencing instrument. Due to chemistry and optics reasons certain basecalls in GC rich regions may get convoluted with wrong nucleotide assertions such as 1 less G and one more C. . Reassembly, Realignment and PairHMM removes such artifacts by looking at basecalling metrics, mapping qualities, regional metrics etc. I cannot see it directly from the image however it is possible that some of those reads could have been soft/hard clipped due to such errors but yet they are still valid and usable by the assembly engine. .

That is, the CT->TC MNP haplotype is consistent at 152 with the T->C SNP, but it has a different start position and therefore is not marginalized into the evidence for the SNP. So the fact that the DP in sample1 is much less at 152 than at 151 makes sense. I am also confused about sample2. If we're both still confused tomorrow, let's take a look in IGV. Might even need IntelliJ.

Testability,"While testing BwaSpark on a yarn cluster, I noticed that only a single executor (the driver) was being created and running only on the master node. The worker nodes were idle. This happened when running the following command . ```; spark-submit \; --deploy-mode client \; --class org.broadinstitute.hellbender.Main \; --master yarn \; /home/hadoop/gatk-package-4.alpha.2-269-gdce8abc-SNAPSHOT-spark.jar BwaSpark \; --bwamemIndexImage /var/tmp/hs38DH-V.fasta.img \; -I hdfs:///unaligned.bam \; -O hdfs:///aligned.bam \; -R hdfs:///hg38/hs38DH-V.fasta \; --disableSequenceDictionaryValidation true; ```. I checked the spark environment settings in the spark web UI and found that `spark.master` was set to `local` despite the `--master yarn` cmd-line argument. Next I checked the gatk source and found a suspicious call to `SparkConf.setMaster()` at line 138 in ; `src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/engine/spark/SparkContextFactory.java`. I commented out this call, recompiled, and tried again, and the issue went away. I suspect that `setMaster()` was overriding the `--master yarn` cmd-line argument. I believe this is a bug and propose somehow avoiding `setMaster()` when the app is run with `spark-submit`.

Testability,"While using a custom tool that validates arguments (e.g., certain range for an `Integer` parameter), a way of handling it is override `CommandLineProgram.customCommandLineValidation()` and return an String with the error found. Nevertheless, if parsing the arguments throws a `UserException.CommandLineException`, the error is printed with a concrete format (`printDecoratedUserExceptionMessage`) after the usage. This is different from the custom validation, which is printed without any decoration and before the usage. Although this behavior could be desirable, I expect that if my custom validation thrown an `UserException.CommandLineException` it is printed in the same way as other exceptions, and the exception is re-thrown in the same way (for testing purposes, for instance). But the current behaviour just exit without any error printed because the exception is catched in `Main`.

Testability,"While working on #1394 I noticed that there are some issues with clipping op that need decisions to be made about how they work. Specifically, if you perform a Softclip operation on a read where you tell it to Softclip the entire read it will silently shorten the clip to include everything but the last base of the read in the following code from ClippingOp.java:. `if ((stop + 1 - start) == readCopied.getLength()) { ; // BAM representation issue -- we can't SOFTCLIP away all bases in a read, just leave it alone; myStop--; // just decrement stop; }`. This behavior is inconsistent with the behavior of a hardclip operation, where the tool will simply produce a read with an empty cigar string. Arbitrarily deciding not to clip the read to one particular base does not seem like the right way to deal with this.

Testability,"While working on validating #5607 I noticed that at the top of the method `isReadInformativeOfIndelOfSize()` that there is the following breakout condition:; ```; if( read.getLength() - readStart < maxIndelSize || refBases.length - refStart < maxIndelSize ) {; return false;; }; ```; This says that if the readStart is too close to the read.getLenght() then it will break out and not calculate the informativeness of a read. Unfortunately readStart isn't the readbase indexed readStart, its actually the ""IGV view"" offset for the read generated by the pileup for a particular reference position. The actual length that matters to us is: `AlignmentUtils.getBasesAlignedOneToOne(read).length` which is computed later when we realign the read bases to the reference. What this means is that if a read happens to have a long deletion in it then we will end up prematurely marking the read bases as being non-informative despite there being more than enough bases to work with when doing computations. Furthermore, since we realign the read bases later in the codepath, these bases in the gap between the realigned length and `read.getLength()` are still used to compute mismatch likelihood for bases before that point in the read. An example of this issue: I have a read with the cigar ""77M10D24M"", at position 92 of the read (the igv offset so in reality the 5th base into the last element of the cigar) the code returns false due to this condition. In reality `AlignmentUtils.getBasesAlignedOneToOne(read).length - readStart` value is 19, and thus comparable since there are >10 bases left in the read to test. .

Testability,"Wow, thanks for the detailed comments so far, @davidbenjamin! But perhaps let's quickly chat before you go any further?. There are a lot of things you commented on---temporary integration tests using local files, lots of code/arguments/etc. intentionally copied verbatim over from VQSR/tranches, and entire tools (the ""monolithic"" GMMVariantTrain and ScikitLearnVariantTrain)---that are rather in flux or will be scrapped/cleaned up shortly. That said, the comments on the code inherited from VQSR will certainly be useful in this process!. But it might save you some time if we could chat so I can give you a rough orientation and perhaps point out where the vestigial VQSR code remains. I think focusing discussion on the high level design of the tools that are likely to stay would also be most useful at this stage. Feel free to throw something on my calendar!. In the end, I think we will probably just retain the BGMM backend + the versions of the tools in the ""scalable"" package. I left the ""monolithic"" GMMVariantTrain and ScikitLearnVariantTrain tools in this branch so I could do one round of tieout. That tieout came out OK, so I think we'll abandon the monolithic tools, along with all the associated code outside of the scalable package.

A naive calculation of the relative X ploidy, i.e. calculating X_pcov = (X_total_read_counts / autosome_total_read_count) for all samples, performing a 2-mean clustering, and dividing the X_pcov by the lower ploidy cluster mean reveals that indeed, the X conting has twice more coverage on _average_ in XX samples:; ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15305869/26426348/2b2d6982-40a6-11e7-8eca-e93916bfc80c.png). Further investigation shows that the wrong behavior of TargetCoverageSexGenotyper stems from the lack of robustness of Poisson regression to outliers: there are a number of targets in the X contig with anomalously high coverage (200x median!). In the absence of Y coverage data (and bias adjustment), higher ploidy genotypes are always favored (in this case, XX). Solution: either filter read counts for outliers before calculating Poisson log likelihoods, or simply use the naive median-based ploidy estimates and perform genotyping on the estimated ploidies (rather than target-resolved read counts). The latter is proven to be robust to outliers. Update: it turns out that the issue can be fixed by simply taking into account bait count as a multiplicative bias. Otherwise, the distribution of raw read counts is multimodal and far from Poisson:; ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15305869/26516437/54da4930-4254-11e7-9093-5e5fe1e0e28e.png).

Testability,"Yeah I trimmed then down even further in #4061. Looks like they run about ~40 minutes now. This is just running a single iteration of gCNV in each of cohort (3 samples) and case mode, which is already kind of the bare minimum (2 tests---in comparison we run 8 such tests on the somatic side).

Testability,"Yeah, I don't like these new interface methods -- they make `GATKRead` significantly worse. We should cache `isUnmapped`, etc. in the adapter to accomplish the same thing, as @lbergelson suggests.

Testability,"Yeah, good idea on keeping the GATK3 tests separate as well. The javadoc changes should be pretty easy, mostly removing the `-T`, `GenomeAnalysisTK.jar` -> `./gatk'. Command line args are all lower case, hyphen-separated, and for most args except the commone ones (-V, -I, -R) we don'e use a separate short name.

Testability,"Yes, that seems to be working as intended. You'll see that in your first log, the following lines indicate that convergence has been reached after 2 iterations:. ````; 09:40:44.924 INFO MultidimensionalModeller - Smoothing iteration: 2; 09:40:44.924 INFO MultidimensionalModeller - Number of segments before smoothing iteration: 398; 09:40:44.924 INFO MultidimensionalModeller - Number of segments after smoothing iteration: 398; ````. Therefore, when you set N >= 3, the behavior is the same as when N = 2. In your second log, only one iteration goes by before we refit again. This refit yields posteriors that are sufficiently different from the approximation used when no refitting is performed so that additional smoothing needs to be performed before convergence. You'll see that in the second case, we end up with fewer segments. Whether or not this smoother result (which takes longer to arrive at, since refitting is expensive) is desired will depend on the goals of the analysis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4683#issuecomment-382807646:73,log,log,73,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4683#issuecomment-382807646,2,['log'],['log']

I have benchmarked pretty thoroughly and discovered that caching `GenotypeAlleleCounts` for the sake of iterating in sequence is totally pointless. The `GenotypeAlleleCounts::increase` method is already so efficient that it makes no difference. In fact, caching is slower than using `increase` when the allele count and ploidy yield more than a few hundred genotypes. Caching is a bit faster for the commonest cases of 2 or 3 alleles in a diploid genotype, but the savings is less than a tenth of a second over an entire WGS run.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6351#issuecomment-1067967439:106,benchmark,benchmarked,106,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6351#issuecomment-1067967439,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarked']

Testability,"Yup, as you might recall from some discussions with @bhanugandham and @mwalker174, getting automated pipeline-level CNV evaluations up and running was highest on my list before I handed over the role and went on paternity leave. I think these tests would be more useful than unit/integration tests for correctness, but they would almost certainly have to run on CARROT. That said, the current level of unit/integration test coverage is a bit different from that for the somatic tools, because 1) it's difficult to run gCNV in any useful way on Travis infrastructure, and 2) we hadn't decided on a framework/convention for python unit tests at the time the production code went in (although I think @ldgauthier has added some python unit tests by now). So we currently only have plumbing WDL/integration tests on very small data for gCNV---and these only test that the tools run, not for correctness. For somatic CNV, we have unit tests for correctness on small simulated data (e.g., for things like segmentation and modeling classes), but integration tests don't cover correctness (and it would be pretty redundant to use the same simulated data for integration, so I'd rather put effort towards pipeline-level tests on real data). It might be good for you and @mwalker174 to review the current level of testing coverage and understand where things need to be shored up---happy to discuss more.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7261#issuecomment-859563124:243,test,tests,243,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7261#issuecomment-859563124,11,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"`BaseQualityRankSumTest` gets the base qualities of read at the variant position and perform a rank sum test. Reads that are uninformative are skipped. For SNPs, this means that the annotation uses the base quality at the SNP position. So far, so good. Indels are surprising. Lets say we have a deletion ATTTCCCGGG -> A, where the position of A is 10. If we have a read that starts with ATTTCCCGGG, the base quality used is at the A. If the read starts with CCCGGG (note that this is informative because the deletion allele doesn't have CCCGGG and thus the read supports the ref even though it doesn't span it) it is assigned the base quality at the first C, etc. Insertions are similar. Suppose we have A -> ATTTCCCGGG. Then a read starting inside the TTTCCCGGG is informative but not spanning and gets annotated with the base quality at its first base. This behavior should go in the javadoc.

However, `HaplotypeCallerSpark` always processes reads in coordinate-sorted order, and produces variants in the same order, so there is no need for `VariantsSparkSink` to sort variants.

This PR removes the sort step for `HaplotypeCallerSpark` (and `PrintVariantsSpark`, which doesn't need it either). All of the concordance unit tests pass, and as an additional sanity check I compared the GVCF output from running regular `HaplotypeCaller` on a large input BAM to `HaplotypeCallerSpark` (with and without variant sorting). Removing variant sorting actually made the GVCF output more similar to regular `HaplotypeCaller` - it reduced the number of differences from three to one.

Testability,"`canDecode()` is now the exclusive means by which we test whether a codec can decode a particular file (can no longer specify the codec manually on the command line as in the old GATK). All codecs should therefore implement this method (currently, only some do). We should:. -Make `canDecode()` abstract in `AbstractFeatureCodec` to force all codec authors to provide an implementation. -Write implementations of `canDecode()` for all codecs that currently lack it. These can be file-extension-based in most cases. Eg., for `BEDCodec`:. ```; @Override; public boolean canDecode(final String path) {; return path.toLowerCase().endsWith("".bed"");; }; ```. Only some codecs need to examine file contents to determine whether it can decode a file (`VCFCodec` is one such codec, since there are different magic values at file start for different versions of VCF files).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/230:53,test,test,53,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/230,1,['test'],['test']

Hi GATK community,. I am experiencing an issue while working with GATK, and I'd appreciate your assistance in resolving it. In my BED file, I have the following line:. `chrX 31182732 31182909 DMD . .`. There is a significant variant at the position chrX-31182732 T>G. However, when I run the command with the provided BED file, I cannot see the variant at the ""chrX 31182732"" position in the output VCF file. Interestingly, when I perform a test by expanding the BED file by one base on each side (changing it to ""`chrX 31182731 31182910 DMD . .`""), I can observe the variant at the ""chrX 31182732"" position in the VCF file. Is it expected behavior for GATK not to consider variants at the boundaries of interval files? Your insights and guidance on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated. ![Screenshot from 2023-12-18 13-50-05](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/assets/57506727/62386a08-2d9d-4a03-bcad-3c6b34f35357).

It seems that this missed variant is a assembly problem. The region has quite a few events resulting in very complex graphs with may possible haplotypes. . If one adds the -debug -l DEBUG options you can see in the logs that the number of haplotypes for kmer size 10 hits the default maximum of 128. If one increases the limit to 512 ```(-maxNumHaplotypesInPopulation 512)``` then the variant comes up in the output. . When such a limit is hit, we reduce the number of haplotypes for further analysis using an algorithm that calculates a pseudo likelihood based on the reads that support different paths in the graph. . One would hope that this algorithm would pick up at least one of the haplotypes that contain that variant amongst the top 128 haplotypes for any kmer size, however in this instance this is not the case. So we need to verify that that algorithm is doing what is supposed to do and if so, whether we can change the way such a pseudo likelihood is calculated in order to make a better selection for this case and in general. ---. @vruano commented on [Wed Dec 07 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1530#issuecomment-265535122). Also increase the kmer size to 35 does the job (-kmerSize",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2954:2890,log,logs,2890,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2954,1,['log'],['logs']

Testability,"ageModelParameters` (reading/writing); - [ ] unit tests for `CoverageModelSparkUtils`; - [ ] the issue with Spark tests and custom serializers (gCNV Spark tests are currently disabled). **Discussion about gCNV ICG unit tests (May 1st, 2017):**; It is possible to automate the test for ComputableNodeFunctions. One initializes the parents to random values, calls the function, and checks whether it has had any side effects on the parents. One must make a random-data-provider-of-some-sort for each parent node because the parent INDArrays have different shapes. For other functions in CoverageModelEMComputeBlock and CoverageModelEMWorkspace that query ICG nodes -- one needs to create a firewall. One can elevate all such functions to classes that essentially behave functionally, (ICGNodeProvider, List<NodeKey>, extra arguments) -> output, as opposed to writing vanilla member functions such as CoverageModelEMComputeBlock.getBiasLatentPosteriorDataUnregularized, etc. Then we can write automated unit tests for these classes. Another approach is to write a thin ImmutableNDArray interface that blocks access to all mutators and returns instances of ImmutableNDArray when a matrix view is extracted (e.g. via INDArray.get(...)). This is also quite non-trivial and requires intimate familiarity with Nd4j codebase. Perhaps one could write an immutable DataBuffer for Nd4j. Finally, there might be a brute-force approach: substitute all in-plane operations such as muli and addi with mul and add, and in-place transformations such as Transforms.log(INDArray, boolean duplicate) with Transforms.log(INDArray, true), run gCNV, and require identical results. This is the easiest approach. This was my approach during the development. First, I wrote every function without in-place operations, ran the code, optimized the function with in-place ops, ran the code again, assert.

It also seems as if we lose the PL field for these variants when working with reblocked gvcfs (which could explain why GenotypeGVCF isn’t giving us calls for these variants). I've heard that support for hom-refs with no PLs was implemented in CombineGVCFs as of Sept 2021, but I'm still seeing the issue with CombineGVCFs 4.3.0.0. To provide more info:. - We are seeing these issues regardless of if reblocked gvcfs are analyzed together with or separate from non-reblocked gvcfs. (For reference, the downstream steps in our pipeline are GenomicsDBImport & GenotypeGVCFs, but we’re seeing the same results with CombineGVCFs & GenotypeGVCFs on a smaller set of test gvcfs.); - I have a test set of samples that I've run with and without ReblockGVCF, and have used CombineGVCFs 4.3.0.0 & GenotypeGVCFs 4.3.0.0, and we're still seeing this issue.; - I have rerun ReblockGVCF including the `--allow-missing-home-ref-data` and `--all-site-pls` flags, but neither of these seem to solve the issue either. . #### Steps to reproduce. Run WARP's [ExomeGermlineSingleSample 3.1.7](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases/tag/ExomeGermlineSingleSample_v3.1.7) pipeline. With the relocked gvcfs, run CombineGVCFs, then GenotypeGVCFs. ; Running WARP's [ExomeGermlineSingleSample 3.1.7](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases/tag/ExomeGermlineSingleSample_v3.1.7) pipeline ***but skipping the reblocking step*** and running CombineGVCFs and GenotypeGVCFs results in these same variants being called as hom-ref (which makes me think that reblocking is messing these up somehow). . Note that so far, I've only tested on our own samples.

In versions of the code prior to #3752 (I think) this set of alignments was being filtered out by the method `isNotSimpleTranslocation` in the `parseOneContig` method of `ChimericAlignment`. Now that check's logic has changed and `isLikelySimpleTranslocation` returns false instead of true and so this alignment is not being filtered out any more. . When it gets to `NovelAdjacencyReferenceLocations.TanDupBreakpointsInference()` both `upstreamBreakpointRefPos` and `downstreamBreakpointRefPos` are being set to zero.

Testability,"and likely to require some iteration so I'd be ok with starting with just the minimal ""porting"" changes to keep things simple, and then doing a code hygiene pass at the end. The ""porting"" changes should include things like updated javadoc, GATK4-style command line arguments, updating of outdated GATK3 terminology such as ""ROD"", Utils.nonNull assertions, etc. The finals and curly braces can wait for a separate pass (we will want to do those in this PR though). If you're not sure what to include or not just ask. I like the idea of keeping the GATK3 tests working as we go along. We should make a clear distinction between the old and new tests though. Ideally the GATK3 tests would be in a separate commit that we can just delete at the end, but that can get unwieldy if the files in the commit need to change as we go along. Alternatively you could isolate them into a separate directory. They should either be disabled or made dependent on a test method (see the `@Test` annotation properties `enabled` and `dependsOn`) that is easily toggled so they can be run locally, but don't run on the CI server. Otherwise the CI server build will always fail. In general, its really helpful to have the first commit in the PR contain the completely unmodified GATK3 source files. It makes it much easier for the reviewer to see what changed for the port. I noticed that you have 2 new plugins included in this. I'm not sure if that was suggested by someone on the GATK team (I'm wondering if we want to go down that path...) but I can tell you that the existing plugins required an enormous amount of test development and review iteration. If we do decide to make them plugins, I think it would be a good idea to do so in a separate PR. Also, if we choose to make an AbstractPlugin base class, we may want that to live in the Barclay repo. As @magicdgs points out, master already has your previous commits, so you should start by rebasing on that. Ideally, the branch would have the following commits bef",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-407089352:1170,test,test,1170,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-407089352,2,"['Test', 'test']","['Test', 'test']"

Testability,"ants, and depending on the flavor of output vcf, either crash, or succeed but output an incorrectly sorted vcf. The issue is that in some circumstances SelectVariants will trim alleles to their minimal representation, which can change the location of a variant record, and thus reorder them. However, SelectVariants does nothing to account for the potential order change. Since vcfWriter implementations in htsjdk seem to do minimal/inconsistent checks on the order of variants being added to them, this may write out an incorrectly sorted vcf, or throw an exception, depending on the flavor of vcfWriter. . #### Steps to reproduce; With attached (zipped because github) vcf, run ; `gatk SelectVariants -V test.input.vcf -sn SAMPLE_01 -O test.output.vcf`; Tool will succeed, but output vcf will be incorrectly sorted. Somehow, this incorrectly sorted vcf will also be accompanied by an index!

I was trying to figure out what was unique in these problematic cases, compared to the spanning deletion in the aforementioned test VCF. I noticed that the problematic cases both have the SNP at the very last base of the spanning deletion. I'm just speculating here, but maybe the issue is related to some sort of ""off-by-one"" bug?. This is based on testing with version 4.0.9.0.; I also tried with 4.0.5.1, and it didn't crash, but rather displayed warnings of the type discussed in #4963:; `00:02:10.995 WARN HaplotypeCallerEngine - Multiple valid VCF records detected in the alleles input file at site 22:16137302-16137302, only considering the first record`; `00:03:08.220 WARN HaplotypeCallerEngine - Multiple valid VCF records detected in the alleles input file at site 22:16464051-16464051, only considering the first record`",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5337:4978,test,test,4978,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5337,3,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"

I'm somewhat worried about how much else we might be losing in a similar way. Haplotype caller (3.7.0) was run as follows:. $JAVABIN/java -Xmx12g -Djava.io.tmpdir=$TMPDIR -jar $GATK/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T HaplotypeCaller -R $REF -L $INTERVALS -I $input.bam --dbsnp $DBSNP --emitRefConfidence GVCF --variant\_index\_type LINEAR--variant\_index\_parameter 128000 --pcr\_indel\_model CONSERVATIVE -l INFO -log ${branch.sample}\_pipeline.log -o $output.g.vcf. A genomicsDB was created for a 10kb interval around the locus of interest (GATK 4.1.4.1), and GenotypeGVFs rerun:. gatk --java-options ""-Xmx8g -Xms8g"" GenomicsDBImport --genomicsdb-workspace-path gVCF\_db --batch-size 50 -L ${INTERVAL} --sample-name-map sample.map -R ${REFERENCE} --reader-threads 4. gatk --java-options ""-Xmx4G"" GenotypeGVCFs -V gendb://gVCF\_db -R ${REFERENCE} -O S100A16\_locus.vcf --allow-old-rms-mapping-quality-annotation-data . Due to HaplotypeCaller being run with v3.7.0 I had to add '--allow-old-rms-mapping-quality-annotation-data'. The recommendation in the previous similar issue was to rerun haplotype caller with --ERC GVCF, however that option was already used in the initial run. . Any other suggestions as to what may be causing this variant to be lost?. Many thanks.

Testability,"ated a new SpanningDeletionRecord as a subclass of ReferenceRecord but allows us to store GT and GQ; 2. in handlePotentialSpanningDeletion when processing a deletion, we create a new SpanningDeletionRecord with the correct GT and GQ based on the deletion; 3. When processing reference data at a variant site, return ReferenceRecords/SpanningDeletionRecord instead of just a string ""state"" since we need more than just state now; 4. Because of the above, we are now returning an object for the inferred state instead of just a string. Since the inferred state is so, so common a singleton InferredReferenceRecord was created; 5. Processing of spanning deletions beyond. **Ugly**; 1. The construction of the singleton is ugly because it _requires_ a location even though we don't for this case. We could go to an tagging interface (like Cloneable) these all implement, but that seems ugly also. *Refactoring Changes*; One of the challenges with this PR was testing as the work is really done in the lower-level methods and it would be nice to have this as a unit test rather than an integration/end-to-end test. This motivated the following changes:. 1. don't write to VCF directly, instead have take a Consumer<VariantContext> to emit VariantContexts. This let's us provide a different consumer in unit tests to collect our result.; 2. we previously had a chain of calls createVariantsFromSortedRanges -> processSampleRecordsForLocation -> finalizeCurrentVariant that returned void and as a side effect wrote to VCF. These deeper methods now return a VariantContext and the writing (via consumer) is done higher up in the call stack; 3. made some private methods package-private so we could call them from tests. **Thinking Out Loud**. We have three different sets of datastructures for the same data, some of this is history, some is performance/memory, but could use some rethinking; 1. GenericRecord (pulling from BQ); 2.

Note that this will lead to `INS` records with `DUP_REPEAT_UNIT_REF_SPAN` and `DUP_SEQ_CIGARS` (when available). In addition, we are currently treating duplication expansion as insertion. ; The VCF spec doesn't force `DUP` records as such.; If we decide to allow `POS` and `END` to designate the beginning and end of the duplicated reference region, we need to make at least the following change:. - [ ] shift the left breakpoint to the right by 1 base compared to the current implementation, and ; - [ ] `downstreamBreakpointRefPos = complication.getDupSeqRepeatUnitRefSpan().getEnd();`. ### bump test coverage. - [x] `SimpleNovelAdjacencyAndChimericAlignmentEvidence` serialization test. - [x] `NovelAdjacencyAndAltHaplotype.toSimpleOrBNDTypes()` (but only related to `SimpleSvType`'s, BND's will wait for a later PR.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4663:1406,test,tests,1406,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4663,3,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"back to @droazen - all comments addressed. BaseRecalibratorSparkOptimized seems broken - when I used the correct test files, it became visible that it quite possibly is losing some overlapping variants because the counts are different than GATK3, stand-along BaseRecalibeator in GATK4, and BaseRecalibratorSpark - on exactly the same inputs.

Testability,"blish different components in different artifacts. At least I would like to have a different artifact for pure-java components separate from the rest, to be sure that python (for example) is not required. Does some of this makes sense for you? A proposed scheme will be the following:. * `common`/`engine`: this should include the engine, utils, and everything that it can be useful by itself. This should be a dependency for every other module. Components in other sub-modules might be proposed to be moved to this one if they might be useful out of their own. If the package names does not change, the interface and usage will be unmodified, and then there is no change in the API.; * `spark`: I think that this is a nice separation from other components. In this case, this can include all code related with Spark classes for removal of the huge Spark dependency in sub-projects that does not require them.; * `tools` and `spark-tools`: this can be even split in more fine grained sub-modules depending on the pipeline (e.g. CNV, Mutect, etc., if it makes sense). In addition, the separation between normal tools and spark-tools will make easier for downstream projects to support or not spark in their code.; * `experimental`: this might contain prototype code that might change in the future, and that will be nice in terms of documentation purposes (always annotated with `@BetaFeature` or `@Experimental`, etc.). In addition, code shouldn't rely on the code in this package for anything, allowing to have experimental code for play around and remove if required, without any major version bump.; * `testing`: this will contain the testing framework. It is related with #1481 and #3567. ; * `documentation`: this might be useful for code dependent on `com.sun.javadoc` to do not interact with other classes if code for documenting a downstream project is not necessary.; * Other modules might be useful for concrete components: e.g, ., the gCNV python computational kernel implemented in #3838.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3900:2055,test,testing,2055,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3900,2,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"bly well without this, though.; - [x] Evaluate algorithm on simulated data.; - Implemented simple Queue pipeline for running CLI on simulated ACNV segment files. Takes <2 minutes for ~1000 iterations for each sample, can run 100s of samples in parallel on the gsa clusters.; - Need to write up some scripts to automatically calculate and plot metrics.; - [x] Evaluate algorithm on real data; - Some initial runs on HCC1143 purity series show reasonable results for the clonal model, i.e., purity is recovered within credible intervals (question: what are the error bars on the purities of the samples?). Subclonal performance is a little less clear due to 1) no real ground truth, 2) events in the normal, and 3) lack of outlier absorption.; - Can we get a hold of some cleaner purity series?; - [ ] Document algorithm in technical whitepaper. ---. @samuelklee commented on [Thu Dec 08 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/750#issuecomment-265798051). The first release of this tool will most likely include the following:. - Some refactoring to MCMC package and addition of an EnsembleSampler, which implements affine-invariant ensemble sampling from Goodman & Weare 2010 (this is the same method used by the emcee python package). This method is critical for sampling our highly multimodal posterior well. - Output of 1) all population fraction / ploidy MCMC samples, and 2) average variant profile and 3) posterior summaries at the posterior mode (determined by naive binning of samples). - No plotting. Early next quarter:. - [ ] Unit tests for EnsembleSampler. - [ ] Allowing for >1 tumor population. The model already allows for this, but some performance optimization of the variant-profile sampling step will probably be required. - [ ] Evaluation on BAMs prepared with mixing scripts. - [ ] Writeup of model in technical white paper. - [ ] Tool to produce interactive plots.

This PR also does:; * refactoring of `FindBreakpointEvidenceSpark` and `DiscoverVariantsFromContigAlignmentsSpark` to accommodate the new tool; * added three integration test (dummy in the sense that it only makes sure they run, and no correctness check on the output) for the three tools. Known differences:. * For NA12878 test sample: The `FindBreakpointEvidenceSpark`->`DiscoverVariantsFromContigAlignmentsSpark` generated VCF and `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark` generated VCF differ by how supplementary alignment's soft clipping is treated. The `FindBreakpointEvidenceSpark`->`DiscoverVariantsFromContigAlignmentsSpark` path has an optimization turned on that soft clipped bases for supplementary alignments are hard clipped away (no contig sequence is lost as it is always saved in the primary alignment), so the CIGARs are a little different. As a consequence, the SAM file generated by the two routes also differ in this CIGAR and sequence part.; * For CHM test sample: The differences are more delicate and even master version yields slightly different results from run to run. So I summarized them in the attached zip. @tedsharpe and @cwhelan please take a look, as `FindBreakpointEvidenceSpark` is modified (no change of logic, but how code is called).; [chm.zip](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/919925/chm.zip)",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2595:328,test,test,328,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2595,4,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'test']"
