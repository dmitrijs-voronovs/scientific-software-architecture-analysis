Availability," ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them.

The palette can be interactively moved and resized. The context menu; can be used to set the axis attributes. It is possible to select a; range on the axis, to set the min/max in z. #### The SPEC Option. The ""SPEC"" option offers a large set of options/attributes to; visualize 2D histograms thanks to ""operators"" following the ""SPEC""; keyword. For example, to draw the 2-D histogram `h2` using all default; attributes except the viewing angles, one can do:. ``` {.cpp}; h2->Draw(""SPEC a(30,30,0)"");; ```. The operators' names are case insensitive (i.e. one can use ""a"" or; ""A"") and their parameters are separated by coma "","". Operators can be; put in any order in the option and must be separated by a space "" "".; No space characters should be put in an operator. All the available; operators are described below. The way how a 2D histogram will be painted is controlled by two; parameters: the ""Display modes groups"" and the ""Display Modes"".; ""Display modes groups"" can take the following values:. - 0 = Simple - simple display modes using one color only; - 1 = Light - the shading is carried out according to the position; of the fictive light source; - 2 = Height - the shading is carried out according to the channel; contents; - 3 = LightHeight - combination of two previous shading algorithms; (one can control the weight between both algorithms). ""Display modes"" can take the following values:. - 1 = Points; - 2 = Grid; - 3 = Contours; - 4 = Bars; - 5 = LinesX; - 6 = LinesY; - 7 = BarsX; - 8 = BarsY; - 9 = Needles; - 10 = Surface; - 11 = Triangles. These parameters can be set by using the ""`dm`"" operator in the; option. ``` {.cpp}; h2->Draw(""SPEC dm(1,2)"");; ```.

In addition, histograms and trees are automatically deleted when the; current directory is closed. This will automatically take care of the; clean up. See ""Input/Output"". ### Executing a Script From a Script. You may want to execute a script conditionally inside another script.; To do it you need to call the interpreter and you can do that with; `TROOT::ProcessLine()`. The example; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/cernstaff.C` calls a script to build the root; file if it does not exist:. ``` {.cpp}; void cernstaff() {; if (gSystem->AccessPathName(""cernstaff.root"")) {; gROOT->ProcessLine("".x cernbuild.C"");; }; ```. `ProcessLine` takes a parameter, which is a pointer to an `int` or to; a `TInterpreter::EErrorCode` to let you access the interpreter error; code after an attempt to interpret. This will contain the error; as defined in `enum TInterpreter::EErrorCode` with `TInterpreter::kSuccess` being; the value for a successful execution. ### Executing a Script From the Invocation. Instead if starting ROOT and running a script on the prompt you can also pass; it to ROOT in its invocation:. ```; $ root -l -b 'myCode.C(""some String"", 12)'; ```. The exact kind of quoting depends on your shell; the one shown here works for; bash-like shells. ROOT can evaluate any expression as part of the invocation; another version of; the previous example can be spelled like this:. ```; $ root -l -b -e 'gROOT->ProcessLine("".x myCode.C(\""some String\"", 12)"");'; ```. ## C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting.

Availability," ### Payload: sending local files to the remote nodes. In many cases it is necessary to send some local data to the remote; workers: it is very common, for instance, to distribute a local Grid; authentication proxy on the remote workers to let them authenticate to; access a data storage. The `payload` file must be an executable generating some output that; will be prepended to the remote environment preparation. Differently; than the other environment scripts, it is not executed: instead, it is; first run, then *the output it produces will be executed*. Let's see a practical example to better understand how it works. We need; to send our Grid proxy to the master node. This is our `payload` executable script:. ``` {.bash}; #!/bin/bash; echo ""echo '`cat /tmp/x509up_u$UID | base64 | tr -d '\r\n'`'"" \; ""| base64 -d > /tmp/x509up_u\$UID""; ```. This script will be executed locally, providing another ""script line"" as; output:. ``` {.bash}; echo 'VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUgZmFrZSBjb250ZW50IG9mIG91ciBHcmlkIHByb3h5IGZpbGUuCg==' | base64 -d > /tmp/x509up_u$UID; ```. This line will be prepended to the remote environment script and will be; executed before anything else on the remote node: it will effectively; decode the Base64 string back to the proxy file and write it into the; `/tmp` directory. Note also that the first `$UID` is not escaped and; will be substituted *locally* with your user ID *on your client; machine*, while the second one has the dollar escaped (`\$UID`) and will; be substituted *remotely* with your user ID *on the remote node*. > It is worth noting that the remote environment scripts will be sent to; > the remote node using a secure connection (SSH), thus there is no; > concern in placing sensitive user data there.

Availability," $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result. The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed. (In the limit that a; given parameter is uncorrelated with parameter $\mbox{n}$, its error; will not change when parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed.) However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors ###. The M processor $\mbox{MINOS}$ (MnMinos, see [api:minos]) was; probably the first, and may still be the only, generally available; program to calculate parameter errors taking into account both parameter; correlations and non-linearities. The $\mbox{MINOS}$ error intervals; are in general asymmetric, and may be expensive to calculate,; especially if there are a lot of free parameters and the problem is very; non-linear. $\mbox{MINOS}$ can only operate after a good minimum has already; been found, and the error matrix has been calculated, so the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ error analysis will normally follow a; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ minimization. The $\mbox{MINOS}$ error for a; given parameter is defined as the change in the value of that parameter; which causes ${\displaystyle F'}$ to increase by the amount; FCNBase::up(), where ${\displaystyle F'}$ is the minimum of; $\mbox{FCN}$ with respect to all *other* free parameters, and; FCNBase::up() is the return value of the error definition specified by; the user (default = 1.). The algorithm for finding the positive and negative $\mbox{MINOS}$; errors for parameter $\mbox{n}$ consists of varying parameter; $\mbox{n}$, each time minimizing $\mbox{FCN}$ with respect to; all the other $\mbox{npar - 1}$ variable parameters, to find; numerically the two values of parameter $\mbox{n}$ f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:17753,error,error,17753,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['error'],['error']
Availability," $m_i$.; If these uncertainties are not known, and are simply left out of the; calculation, then the fit may still have meaning, but not the; quantitative values of the resulting parameter errors. (Only the; relative errors of different parameters with respect to each other may; be meaningful.). If the $\sigma_i$ are all overestimated by a factor $\beta$, then the; resulting parameter errors from the fit will be overestimated by the; same factor $\beta$. ### The error matrix ###. The M processors $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (MnMigrad, see [api:migrad]) and; HESSE (MnHesse, see [api:hesse]) (normally) produce an error matrix.; This matrix is twice the inverse of the matrix of second derivatives of; the $\mbox{FCN}$, transformed if necessary into external coordinate; space[^2], and multiplied by FCNBase::up(). Therefore, errors based on; the M error matrix take account of all the parameter correlations, but; not the non-linearities. That is, from the error matrix alone,; two-standard-deviation errors are always exactly twice as big as; one-standard-deviation errors. When the error matrix has been calculated (for example by the successful; execution of $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (MnMigrad::operator(), see; [api:migradop]) or HESSE (MnHesse::operator())) then the parameter; errors printed by M are the square roots of the diagonal elements of; this matrix. The covariance or the correlations can be printed and shown; via std::cout as the ostream operator operator$<<$ is overloaded. The; eigenvalues of the error matrix can be calculated using MnEigen, which; should all be positive if the matrix is positive-definite (see below on; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ and positive-definiteness). The effect of correlations on the individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result.

This file is available in two different locations. * ``<LLVM_INSTALL_PACKAGE_DIR>/LLVMConfig.cmake`` where; ``<LLVM_INSTALL_PACKAGE_DIR>`` is the location where LLVM CMake modules are; installed as part of an installed version of LLVM.

The %ROOT linear algebra package provides a complete environment in %ROOT to perform matrix; calculations such as matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplications and other linear; algebra calculations like equation solving and eigenvalue decompositions. The present package implements all the basic algorithms dealing; with vectors, matrices, matrix columns, rows, diagonals, etc.; In addition eigen-Vector analysis and several matrix decomposition; have been added (LU,QRH,Cholesky,Bunch-Kaufman and SVD) .; The decompositions are used in matrix inversion, equation solving. ### Matrix classes. %ROOT provides the following matrix classes, among others:. - `TMatrixDBase`. - `TMatrixF`. - `TMatrixFSym`. - `TVectorF`. - `TMatrixD`. - `TMatrixDSym`. - `TMatrixDSparse`. - `TDecompBase`. - `TDecompChol`. For a dense matrix, elements are arranged in memory in a ROW-wise; fashion . For (n x m) matrices where n*m <=kSizeMax (=25 currently); storage space is available on the stack, thus avoiding expensive; allocation/deallocation of heap space . However, this introduces of; course kSizeMax overhead for each matrix object . If this is an; issue recompile with a new appropriate value (>=0) for kSizeMax. Sparse matrices are also stored in row-wise fashion but additional; row/column information is stored, see TMatrixTSparse source for; additional details . Another way to assign and store matrix data is through Use; see for instance stressLinear.cxx file . Unless otherwise specified, matrix and vector indices always start; with 0, spanning up to the specified limit-1. However, there are; constructors to which one can specify arbitrary lower and upper; bounds, e.g. TMatrixD m(1,10,1,5) defines a matrix that ranges; from 1..10, 1..5 (a(1,1)..a(10,5)). #### Matrix properties.

Before this release, the global observable values were always taken from the model/pdf.; With this release, a mechanism is added to store a snapshot of global observables in any `RooDataSet` or `RooDataHist`.; For toy studies where the global observables assume a different values for each toy, the bookkeeping of the set of global observables and in particular their values is much easier with this change. Usage example for a model with global observables `g1` and `g2`:; ```C++; auto data = model.generate(x, 1000); // data has only the single observables x; data->setGlobalObservables(g1, g2); // now, data also stores a snapshot of g1 and g2. // If you fit the model to the data, the global observables and their values; // are taken from the dataset:; model.fitTo(*data);. // You can still define the set of global observables yourself, but the values; // will be takes from the dataset if available:; model.fitTo(*data, GlobalObservables(g1, g2));. // To force `fitTo` to take the global observable values from the model even; // though they are in the dataset, you can use the new `GlobalObservablesSource`; // command argument:; model.fitTo(*data, GlobalObservables(g1, g2), GlobalObservablesSource(""model""));; // The only other allowed value for `GlobalObservablesSource` is ""data"", which; // corresponds to the new default behavior explained above.; ```. In case you create a RooFit dataset directly by calling its constructor, you can also pass the global observables in a command argument instead of calling `setGlobalObservables()` later:; ```C++; RooDataSet data{""dataset"", ""dataset"", x, RooFit::GlobalObservables(g1, g2)};; ```.

""Deepest"" means that `B\_3` still; contains point `P` (as well as `A\_1` and `TOP\_1`), but none of the; daughters of volume `B` does.

The algorithm for finding where a point is located in geometry is; presented in the figure 17-36. It always starts by checking if the last computed modeller state is the; answer. This optimizes the search when continuously tracking a particle.; The main actions performed are:. - moving up and down in the logical node tree while updating the; current node and its global matrix; - converting the global position into the local frame of the current; node/volume; - checking whether the local position lies within the geometrical; shape of the current volume - if this is the case continue the; search downwards for the daughters of the current node, otherwise; search upwards its containers until the top level is reached.; - the number of candidate nodes to be checked at a given level is; minimized by an additional optimization structure: voxels. This is; effective even in case there is only one daughter of the current; volume.; - in case the current node is declared as possibly overlapping, the; method FindInCluster() is invoked.

M is usually used to find the ""best"" values of a set of parameters,; where ""best"" is defined as those values which minimize a given function,; $\mbox{FCN}$. The width of the function minimum, or more generally,; the shape of the function in some neighbourhood of the minimum, gives; information about the *uncertainty* in the best parameter values, often; called by physicists the *parameter errors*. An important feature of M; is that it offers several tools to analyze the parameter errors. ### $\mbox{FCN}$ normalization and the error definition ###. Whatever method is used to calculate the parameter errors, they will; depend on the overall (multiplicative) normalization of; $\mbox{FCN}$, in the sense that if the value of $\mbox{FCN}$ is; everywhere multiplied by a constant $\beta$, then the errors will be; decreased by a factor $\sqrt{\beta}$. Additive constants do not change; the parameter errors, but may imply a different goodness-of-fit; confidence level.

Availability," -------------------------. The Clang Diagnostics subsystem is an important part of how the compiler; communicates with the human. Diagnostics are the warnings and errors produced; when the code is incorrect or dubious. In Clang, each diagnostic produced has; (at the minimum) a unique ID, an English translation associated with it, a; :ref:`SourceLocation <SourceLocation>` to ""put the caret"", and a severity; (e.g., ``WARNING`` or ``ERROR``). They can also optionally include a number of; arguments to the diagnostic (which fill in ""%0""'s in the string) as well as a; number of source ranges that related to the diagnostic. In this section, we'll be giving examples produced by the Clang command line; driver, but diagnostics can be :ref:`rendered in many different ways; <DiagnosticConsumer>` depending on how the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is; implemented. A representative example of a diagnostic is:. .. code-block:: text. t.c:38:15: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('int *' and '_Complex float'); P = (P-42) + Gamma*4;; ~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~. In this example, you can see the English translation, the severity (error), you; can see the source location (the caret (""``^``"") and file/line/column info),; the source ranges ""``~~~~``"", arguments to the diagnostic (""``int*``"" and; ""``_Complex float``""). You'll have to believe me that there is a unique ID; backing the diagnostic :).

For an example of these look at the ARM (first five lowerings) or RISC-V (last; lowering) backend. AtomicExpandPass supports two strategies for lowering atomicrmw/cmpxchg to; load-linked/store-conditional (LL/SC) loops. The first expands the LL/SC loop; in IR, calling target lowering hooks to emit intrinsics for the LL and SC; operations. However, many architectures have strict requirements for LL/SC; loops to ensure forward progress, such as restrictions on the number and type; of instructions in the loop. It isn't possible to enforce these restrictions; when the loop is expanded in LLVM IR, and so affected targets may prefer to; expand to LL/SC loops at a very late stage (i.e. after register allocation).; AtomicExpandPass can help support lowering of part-word atomicrmw or cmpxchg; using this strategy by producing IR for any shifting and masking that can be; performed outside of the LL/SC loop.

It can be used to automatically minimize the; skip and count for a debug-counter variable. .. _ViewGraph:. Viewing graphs while debugging code; -----------------------------------. Several of the important data structures in LLVM are graphs: for example CFGs; made out of LLVM :ref:`BasicBlocks <BasicBlock>`, CFGs made out of LLVM; :ref:`MachineBasicBlocks <MachineBasicBlock>`, and :ref:`Instruction Selection; DAGs <SelectionDAG>`. In many cases, while debugging various parts of the; compiler, it is nice to instantly visualize these graphs. LLVM provides several callbacks that are available in a debug build to do; exactly that. If you call the ``Function::viewCFG()`` method, for example, the; current LLVM tool will pop up a window containing the CFG for the function where; each basic block is a node in the graph, and each node contains the instructions; in the block. Similarly, there also exists ``Function::viewCFGOnly()`` (does; not include the instructions), the ``MachineFunction::viewCFG()`` and; ``MachineFunction::viewCFGOnly()``, and the ``SelectionDAG::viewGraph()``; methods. Within GDB, for example, you can usually use something like ``call; DAG.viewGraph()`` to pop up a window. Alternatively, you can sprinkle calls to; these functions in your code in places you want to debug. Getting this to work requires a small amount of setup. On Unix systems; with X11, install the `graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org>`_ toolkit, and make; sure 'dot' and 'gv' are in your path.

The most; important new feature is the support for simulataneous classification ; of multiple output classes for several multi-variate methods. ; A lot of effort went into consolidation of the software,; i.e. method performance and robustness, and framework; stability. The changes with respect to ROOT 5.27 / TMVA 4.0.7 are; in detail:. Framework. Multi-class support. The support of multiple; output classes (i.e., more than a single background and signal; class) has been enabled for these methods: MLP (NN), BDTG,; FDA.; The multiclass; functionality can be enabled with the Factory option; ""AnalysisType=multiclass"". Training data is; specified with an additional classname, e.g. via; factory->AddTree(tree,""classname"");. After the; training a genetic algorithm is invoked to determine the best; cuts for selecting a specific class, based on the figure of; merit: purity*efficiency. TMVA comes with two examples in; $ROOTSYS/tmva/test: TMVAMulticlass.C; and TMVAMulticlassApplication.C. New TMVA event vector building. The code; for splitting the input data into training and test samples for; all classes and the mixing of those samples to one training and; one test sample has been rewritten completely. The new code is; more performant and has a clearer structure. This fixes several; bugs which have been reported by some users of TMVA.; Code and performance test framework: A unit; test framework for daily software and method performance; validation has been implemented.; . Methods. BDT Automatic parameter optimisation for building the; tree architecture: The optimisation procedure uses the; performance of the trained classifier on the ""test sample"" for; finding the set of optimal parameters.

If the source language is mapped onto the AMDGPU wavefronts in a SIMT manner the; compiler can use the AMDGPU execution mask register to control which lanes are; active. To describe the conceptual location of non-active lanes requires an; attribute that has an expression that computes the source location PC for each; lane. For efficiency, the expression calculates the source location the wavefront as a; whole. This can be done using the ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` (see; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-to-create-vector-composite-location-descriptions`); operation. The AMDGPU may update the execution mask to perform whole wavefront operations.; Therefore, there is a need for an attribute that computes the current active; lane mask. This can have an expression that may evaluate to the SIMT active lane; mask register or to a saved mask when in whole wavefront execution mode. An example that uses these attributes is referenced in the; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-further-examples` appendix. See ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` and ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane`` in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-composite-location-description-operations`. 2.14 Define Source Language Memory Classes; -------------------------------------------. AMDGPU supports languages, such as OpenCL [:ref:`OpenCL <amdgpu-dwarf-OpenCL>`],; that define source language memory classes. Support is added to define language; specific memory spaces so they can be used in a consistent way by consumers. Support for using memory spaces in defining source language types and data; object allocation is also added.

Availability," .. _polymorphism:. Designing Type Hierarchies and Polymorphic Interfaces; -----------------------------------------------------. There are two different design patterns that tend to result in the use of; virtual dispatch for methods in a type hierarchy in C++ programs. The first is; a genuine type hierarchy where different types in the hierarchy model; a specific subset of the functionality and semantics, and these types nest; strictly within each other. Good examples of this can be seen in the ``Value``; or ``Type`` type hierarchies. A second is the desire to dispatch dynamically across a collection of; polymorphic interface implementations. This latter use case can be modeled with; virtual dispatch and inheritance by defining an abstract interface base class; which all implementations derive from and override. However, this; implementation strategy forces an **""is-a""** relationship to exist that is not; actually meaningful. There is often not some nested hierarchy of useful; generalizations which code might interact with and move up and down. Instead,; there is a singular interface which is dispatched across a range of; implementations. The preferred implementation strategy for the second use case is that of; generic programming (sometimes called ""compile-time duck typing"" or ""static; polymorphism""). For example, a template over some type parameter ``T`` can be; instantiated across any particular implementation that conforms to the; interface or *concept*. A good example here is the highly generic properties of; any type which models a node in a directed graph. LLVM models these primarily; through templates and generic programming. Such templates include the; ``LoopInfoBase`` and ``DominatorTreeBase``. When this type of polymorphism; truly needs **dynamic** dispatch you can generalize it using a technique; called *concept-based polymorphism*. This pattern emulates the interfaces and; behaviors of templates using a very limited form of virtual dispatch for type; er",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:129912,down,down,129912,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['down'],['down']
Availability," .. admonition:: Rationale. We are not at liberty to require all code to be recompiled with ARC;; therefore, ARC must interoperate with Objective-C code which manages retains; and releases manually. In general, there are three requirements in order for; a compiler-supported reference-count system to provide reliable; interoperation:. * The type system must reliably identify which objects are to be managed. An; ``int*`` might be a pointer to a ``malloc``'ed array, or it might be an; interior pointer to such an array, or it might point to some field or local; variable. In contrast, values of the retainable object pointer types are; never interior. * The type system must reliably indicate how to manage objects of a type.; This usually means that the type must imply a procedure for incrementing; and decrementing retain counts. Supporting single-ownership objects; requires a lot more explicit mediation in the language. * There must be reliable conventions for whether and when ""ownership"" is; passed between caller and callee, for both arguments and return values.; Objective-C methods follow such a convention very reliably, at least for; system libraries on macOS, and functions always pass objects at +0. The; C-based APIs for Core Foundation objects, on the other hand, have much more; varied transfer semantics. The use of ``__attribute__((NSObject))`` typedefs is not recommended. If it's; absolutely necessary to use this attribute, be very explicit about using the; typedef, and do not assume that it will be preserved by language features like; ``__typeof`` and C++ template argument substitution. .. admonition:: Rationale. Any compiler operation which incidentally strips type ""sugar"" from a type; will yield a type without the attribute, which may result in unexpected; behavior. .. _arc.objects.retains:.

The ``handleErrors`` function takes an error as its first argument, followed by; a variadic list of ""handlers"", each of which must be a callable type (a; function, lambda, or class with a call operator) with one argument. The; ``handleErrors`` function will visit each handler in the sequence and check its; argument type against the dynamic type of the error, running the first handler; that matches. This is the same decision process that is used decide which catch; clause to run for a C++ exception. Since the list of handlers passed to ``handleErrors`` may not cover every error; type that can occur, the ``handleErrors`` function also returns an Error value; that must be checked or propagated. If the error value that is passed to; ``handleErrors`` does not match any of the handlers it will be returned from; handleErrors. Idiomatic use of ``handleErrors`` thus looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. if (auto Err =; handleErrors(; processFormattedFile(...),; [](const BadFileFormat &BFF) {; report(""Unable to process "" + BFF.Path + "": bad format"");; },; [](const FileNotFound &FNF) {; report(""File not found "" + FNF.Path);; })); return Err;. In cases where you truly know that the handler list is exhaustive the; ``handleAllErrors`` function can be used instead. This is identical to; ``handleErrors`` except that it will terminate the program if an unhandled; error is passed in, and can therefore return void. The ``handleAllErrors``; function should generally be avoided: the introduction of a new error type; elsewhere in the program can easily turn a formerly exhaustive list of errors; into a non-exhaustive list, risking unexpected program termination.

To; obtain and iterate over all the fields:. .. code-block:: text. for (const RecordVal &Field : SomeRec->getValues()) {; ...; }. You will recall that ``RecordVal`` is the class whose instances contain; information about the fields in records. The ``getValue()`` function returns the ``RecordVal`` instance for a field; specified by name. There are multiple overloaded functions, some taking a; ``StringRef`` and others taking a ``const Init *``. Some functions return a; ``RecordVal *`` and others return a ``const RecordVal *``. If the field does; not exist, a fatal error message is printed. More often than not, you are interested in the value of the field, not all; the information in the ``RecordVal``. There is a large set of functions that; take a field name in some form and return its value. One function,; ``getValueInit``, returns the value as an ``Init *``. Another function,; ``isValueUnset``, returns a boolean specifying whether the value is unset; (uninitialized). Most of the functions return the value in some more useful form.

As an example, suppose a C++ class ``FOO`` existed with a copy constructor.; Within a code block a stack version of a ``FOO`` object is declared and used; within a ``Block`` literal expression:. .. code-block:: c++. {; FOO foo;; void (^block)(void) = ^{ printf(""%d\n"", foo.value()); };; }.

Availability," Compatibility Rules for Target ID; ---------------------------------. A code object compiled for a Target ID is considered compatible for a; target, if:. * Their processor is same.; * Their feature set is compatible as defined above. There are two forms of target ID:. *Non-Canonical Form*; The non-canonical form is used as the input to user commands to allow the user; greater convenience. It allows both the primary and alternative processor name; to be used and the target features may be specified in any order. *Canonical Form*; The canonical form is used for all generated output to allow greater; convenience for tools that consume the information. It is also used for; internal passing of information between tools. Only the primary and not; alternative processor name is used and the target features are specified in; alphabetic order. Command line tools convert non-canonical form to canonical; form. Target Specific information; ===========================. Target specific information is available for the following:. *AMD GPU*; AMD GPU supports target ID and target features. See `User Guide for AMDGPU Backend; <https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html>`_ which defines the `processors; <https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#amdgpu-processors>`_ and `target; features <https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#amdgpu-target-features>`_; supported. Most other targets do not support target IDs. Archive Unbundling; ==================. Unbundling of a heterogeneous device archive (HDA) is done to create device specific; archives.

Note that each type of vector is constructed by passing its coordinate; representation, so a **`XYZTVector`**`(1,2,3,4)` is different from a; `PtEtaPhiEVector(1,2,3,4)`. In addition, the Vector classes can be; constructed by any vector, which implements the accessors `x()`, `y()`,; `z()` and `t()`. This can be another `ROOT::Math::`**`LorentzVector`** based on a; different coordinate system or any vector of a different package, like; the CLHEP **`HepLorentzVector`** that implements the required signature. ``` {.cpp}; XYZTVector v1(1,2,3,4);; PtEtaPhiEVector v2(v1);; CLHEP::HepLorentzVector q(1,2,3,4);; XYZTVector v3(q);; ```. #### Coordinate Accessors. All the same coordinate accessors are available through the interface of; `ROOT::Math::`**`LorentzVector`**. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; //returns cartesian components for the cartesian vector v1; v1.X(); v1.X(); v1.Z(); v1.T();; //returns cartesian components for the cylindrical vector v2; v2.Px(); v2.Py(); v2.Pz(); v2.E();; //returns other components for the cartesian vector v1; v1.Pt(); v1.Eta(); v1.Phi(); v1.M(); ```.

In presence of; this option all threadprivate variables are generated the same way as thread; local variables, using TLS support. If `-fno-openmp-use-tls`; is provided or target does not support TLS, code generation for threadprivate; variables relies on OpenMP runtime library. .. _opencl:. OpenCL Features; ===============. Clang can be used to compile OpenCL kernels for execution on a device; (e.g. GPU). It is possible to compile the kernel into a binary (e.g. for AMDGPU); that can be uploaded to run directly on a device (e.g. using; `clCreateProgramWithBinary; <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/opencl-1.1.pdf#111>`_) or; into generic bitcode files loadable into other toolchains. Compiling to a binary using the default target from the installation can be done; as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ echo ""kernel void k(){}"" > test.cl; $ clang test.cl. Compiling for a specific target can be done by specifying the triple corresponding; to the target, for example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=nvptx64-unknown-unknown test.cl; $ clang --target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -mcpu=gfx900 test.cl. Compiling to bitcode can be done as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -c -emit-llvm test.cl. This will produce a file `test.bc` that can be used in vendor toolchains; to perform machine code generation. Note that if compiled to bitcode for generic targets such as SPIR/SPIR-V,; portable IR is produced that can be used with various vendor; tools as well as open source tools such as `SPIRV-LLVM Translator; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator>`_; to produce SPIR-V binary.

In many practical cases no change of existing code is required. Opened files (and all objects inside), existing canvas and histograms are automatically scanned by the server and will be available to the users. If necessary, any object can be registered directly to the server with a [THttpServer::Register()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html#a73658daf379e87a4832fe9dc5c1483ed) call. Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from a running application. By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method. The second method is preferable - one just inserts in the application regular calls of the THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method, like:. ```cpp; serv->ProcessRequests();; ```. In such case, one can fully disable the timer of the server:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(0, kTRUE);; ```. ## Data access from command shell.

You can set the; following additional options for drawing:. - ""`z`"" or ""`Z`""the horizontal and vertical small lines are not; drawn at the end of error bars. - ""`>`""an arrow is drawn at the end of the error bars. - ""`|>`""a full arrow is drawn at the end of the error bar; its size; is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the marker size. - ""`[]`""only the end vertical/horizontal lines of the error bars are; drawn; this option is interesting to superimpose systematic errors; on top of a graph with statistical errors. The constructor has six arrays as parameters: X and Y as **TGraph**; and low X-errors and high X-errors, low Y-errors and high Y-errors.; The low value is the length of the error bar to the left and down,; the high value is the length of the error bar to the right and up. ``` {.cpp}; {; c1 = new TCanvas(""c1"",""A Simple Graph with error bars"",; 200,10,700,500);; c1->SetGrid();. // create the arrays for the points; Int_t n = 10;; Double_t x[n] = {-.22,.05,.25,.35,.5, .61,.7,.85,.89,.95};; Double_t y[n] = {1,2.9,5.6,7.4,9,9.6,8.7,6.3,4.5,1};. // create the arrays with high and low errors; Double_t exl[n] = {.05,.1,.07,.07,.04,.05,.06,.07,.08,.05};; Double_t eyl[n] = {.8,.7,.6,.5,.4,.4,.5,.6,.7,.8};; Double_t exh[n] = {.02,.08,.05,.05,.03,.03,.04,.05,.06,.03};",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphs.md:7285,error,error,7285,documentation/users-guide/Graphs.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphs.md,1,['error'],['error']

Preventing the use of illegal instructions in Streaming Mode; ------------------------------------------------------------. * When executing a program in streaming-mode (PSTATE.SM=1) a subset of SVE/SVE2; instructions and most AdvSIMD/NEON instructions are invalid. * When executing a program in normal mode (PSTATE.SM=0), a subset of SME; instructions are invalid. * Streaming-compatible functions must only use instructions that are valid when; either PSTATE.SM=0 or PSTATE.SM=1. The value of PSTATE.SM is not controlled by the feature flags, but rather by the; function attributes. This means that we can compile for '``+sme``' and the compiler; will code-generate any instructions, even if they are not legal under the requested; streaming mode. The compiler needs to use the function attributes to ensure the; compiler doesn't do transformations under the assumption that certain operations; are available at runtime. We made a conscious choice not to model this with feature flags, because we; still want to support inline-asm in either mode (with the user placing; smstart/smstop manually), and this became rather complicated to implement at the; individual instruction level (see `D120261 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D120261>`_; and `D121208 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121208>`_) because of limitations in; TableGen. As a first step, this means we'll disable vectorization (LoopVectorize/SLP); entirely when the a function has either of the ``aarch64_pstate_sm_enabled``,; ``aarch64_pstate_sm_body`` or ``aarch64_pstate_sm_compatible`` attributes,; in order to avoid the use of vector instructions. Later on we'll aim to relax these restrictions to enable scalable; auto-vectorization with a subset of streaming-compatible instructions, but that; requires changes to the CostModel, Legalization and SelectionDAG lowering.

And the same could be true for the import of ``B``; (``A`` is requested to be imported before we could create the node for ``B``).; In case of the :ref:`templated-described swing <templated>` we take; extra attention to break the cyclical dependency: we import and set the; described template only after the ``CXXRecordDecl`` is created. As a best; practice, before creating the node in the ""to"" context, avoid importing of; other nodes which are not needed for the constructor of node ``A``. Error Handling; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every import function returns with either an ``llvm::Error`` or an; ``llvm::Expected<T>`` object. This enforces to check the return value of the; import functions. If there was an error during one import then we return with; that error. (Exception: when we import the members of a class, we collect the; individual errors with each member and we concatenate them in one Error; object.) We cache these errors in cases of declarations. During the next import; call if there is an existing error we just return with that. So, clients of the; library receive an Error object, which they must check. During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we recognize an error. In this case, we signal back; the error to the caller, but the ""to"" context remains polluted with those nodes; which had been created. Ideally, those nodes should not had been created, but; that time we did not know about the error, the error happened later. Since the; AST is immutable (most of the cases we can't remove existing nodes) we choose; to mark these nodes as erroneous.

In our case, this; starts 8976 and is not very long, only 53 bytes, since we have not; deleted any objects. The last entry is the address of the last byte in; the file. ### File Recovery. A file may become corrupted or it may be impossible to write it to disk; and close it properly. For example if the file is too large and exceeds; the disk quota, or the job crashes or a batch job reaches its time limit; before the file can be closed. In these cases, it is imperative to; recover and retain as much information as possible. ROOT provides an; intelligent and elegant file recovery mechanism using the redundant; directory information in the record header. If a file that has been not properly closed is opened again, it is; scanned and rebuilt according to the information in the record header.; The recovery algorithm reads the file and creates the saved objects in; memory according to the header information. It then rebuilds the; directory and file structure. If the file is opened in write mode, the; recovery makes the correction on disk when the file is closed; however; if the file is opened in read mode, the correction can not be written to; disk. You can also explicitly invoke the recovery procedure by calling; the `TFile::Recover()` method. You can recover the directory structure,; but you cannot save what you recovered to the file on disk. In the; following example, we interrupted and aborted the previous ROOT session,; causing the file not to be closed. When we start a new session and; attempt to open the file, it gives us an explanation and status on the; recovery attempt. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f(""demo.root""); Warning in <TFile::TFile>: file demo.root probably not closed, trying to recover successfully recovered 15 keys; ```. ## The Logical ROOT File: TFile and TKey.

Availability," LLVM type system is not suitable for conveying such; information though the compiler. * Insert any coordination code required for interacting with your collector.; Many collectors require running application code to periodically check a; flag and conditionally call a runtime function. This is often referred to; as a safepoint poll. You will need to identify roots (i.e. references to heap objects your collector; needs to know about) in your generated IR, so that LLVM can encode them into; your final stack maps. Depending on the collector strategy chosen, this is; accomplished by using either the ``@llvm.gcroot`` intrinsics or an; ``gc.statepoint`` relocation sequence. Don't forget to create a root for each intermediate value that is generated when; evaluating an expression. In ``h(f(), g())``, the result of ``f()`` could; easily be collected if evaluating ``g()`` triggers a collection. Finally, you need to link your runtime library with the generated program; executable (for a static compiler) or ensure the appropriate symbols are; available for the runtime linker (for a JIT compiler). Introduction; ============. What is Garbage Collection?; ---------------------------. Garbage collection is a widely used technique that frees the programmer from; having to know the lifetimes of heap objects, making software easier to produce; and maintain. Many programming languages rely on garbage collection for; automatic memory management. There are two primary forms of garbage collection:; conservative and accurate. Conservative garbage collection often does not require any special support from; either the language or the compiler: it can handle non-type-safe programming; languages (such as C/C++) and does not require any special information from the; compiler. The `Boehm collector; <https://hboehm.info/gc/>`__ is an example of a; state-of-the-art conservative collector. Accurate garbage collection requires the ability to identify all pointers in the; program at run-time (which ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst:2621,avail,available,2621,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability," Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them.

Availability," Table; ################. Low 32 bits of the GPU address for an optional buffer in the ``.data``; section of the ELF. The high 32 bits of the address match the high 32 bits; of the shader's program counter. The buffer can be anything the shader compiler needs it for, and; allows each shader to have its own region of the ``.data`` section.; Typically, this could be a table of buffer SRD's and the data pointed to; by the buffer SRD's, but it could be a flat-address region of memory as; well. Its layout and usage are defined by the shader compiler. Each shader's table in the ``.data`` section is referenced by the symbol; ``_amdgpu_``\ *xs*\ ``_shdr_intrl_data`` where *xs* corresponds with the; hardware shader stage the data is for.

It is possible for a hardware shader to need access to more *user data; entries* than there are slots available in user data registers for one; or more hardware shader stages. In that case, the PAL runtime expects; the necessary *user data entries* to be spilled to GPU memory and use; one user data register to point to the spilled user data memory.

Availability," Target Registration; ===================. You must also register your target with the ``TargetRegistry``, which is what; other LLVM tools use to be able to lookup and use your target at runtime. The; ``TargetRegistry`` can be used directly, but for most targets there are helper; templates which should take care of the work for you. All targets should declare a global ``Target`` object which is used to; represent the target during registration. Then, in the target's ``TargetInfo``; library, the target should define that object and use the ``RegisterTarget``; template to register the target. For example, the Sparc registration code; looks like this:. .. code-block:: c++. Target llvm::getTheSparcTarget();. extern ""C"" void LLVMInitializeSparcTargetInfo() {; RegisterTarget<Triple::sparc, /*HasJIT=*/false>; X(getTheSparcTarget(), ""sparc"", ""Sparc"");; }. This allows the ``TargetRegistry`` to look up the target by name or by target; triple. In addition, most targets will also register additional features which; are available in separate libraries. These registration steps are separate,; because some clients may wish to only link in some parts of the target --- the; JIT code generator does not require the use of the assembler printer, for; example. Here is an example of registering the Sparc assembly printer:. .. code-block:: c++. extern ""C"" void LLVMInitializeSparcAsmPrinter() {; RegisterAsmPrinter<SparcAsmPrinter> X(getTheSparcTarget());; }. For more information, see ""`llvm/Target/TargetRegistry.h; </doxygen/TargetRegistry_8h-source.html>`_"". Register Set and Register Classes; =================================. You should describe a concrete target-specific class that represents the; register file of a target machine.

Availability," There are two kinds of problems that can arise: the reliability of; `Minuit`'s error estimates, and their statistical interpretation,; assuming they are accurate. #### Statistical Interpretation. For discussion of basic concepts, such as the meaning of the elements; of the error matrix, or setting of exact confidence levels see the; articles:. - F.James. Determining the statistical Significance of experimental; Results. Technical Report DD/81/02 and CERN Report 81-03, CERN,; 1981. - W.T.Eadie, D.Drijard, F.James, M.Roos, and B.Sadoulet.; *Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics. North-Holland, 1971*. ### Reliability of Minuit Error Estimates. `Minuit` always carries around its own current estimates of the; parameter errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how; accurate they are at any given point in the execution. For example, at; initialization, these estimates are just the starting step sizes as; specified by the user. After a `HESSE` step, the errors are usually; quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. `Minuit`, when it; prints out error values, also gives some indication of how reliable it; thinks they are. For example, those marked `CURRENT GUESS ERROR` are; only working values not to be believed, and `APPROXIMATE ERROR` means; that they have been calculated but there is reason to believe that; they may not be accurate. If no mitigating adjective is given, then at least `Minuit` believes; the errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that; `Minuit` has been fooled. Some visible signs that `Minuit` may have; been fooled:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error; analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of EDM too big (estimated Distance to Minimum). - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:60835,error,errors,60835,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['error'],['errors']
Availability," They are expected to; be in specifically named subdirectories of <``directory``>. If; ``directory`` is left unspecified, ``configure`` uses the default value; ``/home/vadve/shared/benchmarks/speccpu2000/benchspec``. Subdirectory; names known to LLVM include:. * spec95. * speccpu2000. * speccpu2006. * povray31. Others are added from time to time, and can be determined from; ``configure``. Running Different Tests; =======================. In addition to the regular ""whole program"" tests, the ``test-suite``; module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different; ways. If the variable TEST is defined on the ``gmake`` command line, the; test system will include a Makefile named; ``TEST.<value of TEST variable>.Makefile``. This Makefile can modify; build rules to yield different results. For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses ``TEST.nightly.Makefile`` to; create the nightly test reports. To run the nightly tests, run; ``gmake TEST=nightly``. There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree. Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in the other output. Passes are not reported; explicitly. Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the output; (depending on which sometest you use). For example, the ``nightly`` test; explicitly outputs TEST-PASS or TEST-FAIL for every test after each; program.

Availability," This could be achieved by using a simple atomic operation in every thread to; bump an allocation counter.

Here, to avoid presenting a state in which the first assignment to ``!1``; disappears, the DBG_VALUE at the top of the block assigns the variable the; undefined location, until its value is available at the end of the block where; an additional DBG_VALUE is added. Were any other DBG_VALUE for ``!1`` to occur; in the instructions that the MOV32rm was sunk past, the DBG_VALUE for ``%1``; would be dropped and the debugger would never observe it in the variable. This; accurately reflects that the value is not available during the corresponding; portion of the original program. Variable locations during Register Allocation; ---------------------------------------------. To avoid debug instructions interfering with the register allocator, the; LiveDebugVariables pass extracts variable locations from a MIR function and; deletes the corresponding DBG_VALUE instructions. Some localized copy; propagation is performed within blocks. After register allocation, the; VirtRegRewriter pass re-inserts DBG_VALUE instructions in their original; positions, translating virtual register references into their physical; machine locations. To avoid encoding incorrect variable locations, in this; pass any DBG_VALUE of a virtual register that is not live, is replaced by; the undefined location.

We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These conditional move instructions are known to not be predicted on any x86; processors, making them immune to misprediction that could reintroduce the; vulnerability. When we insert the conditional moves, the code ends up looking; like the following:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.2: # %then1; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.3: # %then2; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_4; .LBB0_1:; cmoveq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; ```. Here we create the ""empty"" or ""correct execution"" predicate state by zeroing; `%rax`, and we create a constant ""incorrect execution"" predicate value by; putting `-1` into `%r8`. Then, along each edge coming out of a conditional; branch we do a conditional move that in a correct execution will be a no-op,; but if misspeculated, will replace the `%rax` with the value of `%r8`.; Misspeculating any one of the three predicates will cause `%rax` to hold the; ""incorrect execution"" value from `%r8` as we preserve incoming values when; execution is corr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:16561,mask,mask,16561,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['mask'],['mask']

In the future, it will probably be outright disallowed. What effect do address spaces have on GEPs?; -------------------------------------------. None, except that the address space qualifier on the second operand pointer type; always matches the address space qualifier on the result type. How is GEP different from ``ptrtoint``, arithmetic, and ``inttoptr``?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------. It's very similar; there are only subtle differences. With ptrtoint, you have to pick an integer type. One approach is to pick i64;; this is safe on everything LLVM supports (LLVM internally assumes pointers are; never wider than 64 bits in many places), and the optimizer will actually narrow; the i64 arithmetic down to the actual pointer size on targets which don't; support 64-bit arithmetic in most cases. However, there are some cases where it; doesn't do this. With GEP you can avoid this problem. Also, GEP carries additional pointer aliasing rules. It's invalid to take a GEP; from one object, address into a different separately allocated object, and; dereference it. IR producers (front-ends) must follow this rule, and consumers; (optimizers, specifically alias analysis) benefit from being able to rely on; it. See the `Rules`_ section for more information. And, GEP is more concise in common cases. However, for the underlying integer computation implied, there is no; difference. I'm writing a backend for a target which needs custom lowering for GEP. How do I do this?; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. You don't.

If the formal result type of such a method is ``id`` or protocol-qualified; ``id``, or a type equal to the declaring class or a superclass, then it is said; to have a related result type. In this case, when invoked in an explicit; message send, it is assumed to return a type related to the type of the; receiver:. * if it is a class method, and the receiver is a class name ``T``, the message; send expression has type ``T*``; otherwise; * if it is an instance method, and the receiver has type ``T``, the message; send expression has type ``T``; otherwise; * the message send expression has the normal result type of the method. This is a new rule of the Objective-C language and applies outside of ARC. .. admonition:: Rationale. ARC's automatic code emission is more prone than most code to signature; errors, i.e. errors where a call was emitted against one method signature,; but the implementing method has an incompatible signature.

Availability," a ''physical'' function must be; positive-definite at the minimum, although it may not be so for all; points far away from the minimum, even for a well-determined physical; problem. Therefore, if `MIGRAD` reports that it has found a; non-positive-definite covariance matrix, this may be a sign of one or; more of the following:. #### A Non-physical Region. On its way to the minimum, `MIGRAD` may have traversed a region that; has unphysical behavior, which is of course not a serious problem as; long as it recovers and leaves such a region. #### An Underdetermined Problem. If the matrix is not positive-definite even at the minimum, this may; mean that the solution is not well defined, for example that there are; more unknowns than there are data points, or that the parameterization; of the fit contains a linear dependence. If this is the case, then; `Minuit` (or any other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely.; The error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user; must remove the under determinedness by reformulating the; parameterization. `Minuit` cannot do this itself. #### Numerical Inaccuracies. It is possible that the apparent lack of positive-definiteness is due; to excessive round off errors in numerical calculations (in the user; function), or not enough precision. This is unlikely in general, but; becomes more likely if the number of free parameters is very large, or; if the parameters are badly scaled (not all of the same order of; magnitude), and correlations are large. In any case, whether the; non-positive-definiteness is real or only numerical is largely; irrelevant, since in both cases the error matrix will be unreliable; and the minimum suspicious. #### An Ill-posed Problem.

On most lecagy platforms these newer compilers are available via a special install.; See the [build prerequisites](https://root.cern/install/dependencies/) page.

Availability," a bias and weighted links in; between - let's call those links synapses. The input neurons receive; the inputs, normalize them and forward them to the first hidden layer.; Each neuron in any subsequent layer first computes a linear; combination of the outputs of the previous layer. The output of the; neuron is then function of that combination with f being linear for; output neurons or a sigmoid for hidden layers. Such a structure is very useful because of two theorems:. 1- A linear combination of `sigmoids` can approximate any continuous; function. 2- Trained with `output=1` for the signal and 0 for the background,; the approximated function of inputs `X` is the probability of signal,; knowing `X`. ### Learning Methods. The aim of all learning methods is to minimize the total error on a; set of weighted examples. The error is defined as the sum in quadrate,; divided by two, of the error on each individual output neuron. In all; methods implemented in this library, one needs to compute the first; derivative of that error with respect to the weights. Exploiting the; well-known properties of the derivative, one can express this; derivative as the product of the local partial derivative by the; weighted sum of the outputs derivatives (for a neuron) or as the; product of the input value with the local partial derivative of the; output neuron (for a synapse). This computation is called; ""back-propagation of the errors"". Six learning methods are; implemented. #### Stochastic Minimization. This is the most trivial learning method. The Robbins-Monro stochastic; approximation is applied to multilayer perceptrons. The weights are; updated after each example according to the formula:. $$; w_{ij}(t+1) = w_{ij}(t) + \Delta w_{ij}(t); $$. with:. $$; \Delta w_{ij}(t) = - \eta \left(; \frac{\partial e_p}{\partial w_{ij}} + \delta \right) +; \epsilon \Delta w_{ij}(t-1); $$.

The input parameters can be simply defined via an; std::vector$<$double$>$, which means that all parameters are variables.; If the user wants fix a parameter or put limits on it before; minimization, they have to instantiate a MnUserParameters object and then; add parameters one by one, giving them a name, value, uncertainty.

Optionally the user can supply their own gradient calculator by; implementing the FCNGradientBase interface or supply a full covariance; matrix for input if one is available. The covariance matrix can be; supplied in form of a std::vector$<$double$>$ in packed storage format; (upper triangular), or in a more user-friendly way by using the; interface provided by the MnUserCovariance. ## Running a M minimization ##.

Private Module Map Files; ------------------------; Module map files are typically named ``module.modulemap`` and live; either alongside the headers they describe or in a parent directory of; the headers they describe. These module maps typically describe all of; the API for the library. However, in some cases, the presence or absence of particular headers; is used to distinguish between the ""public"" and ""private"" APIs of a; particular library. For example, a library may contain the headers; ``Foo.h`` and ``Foo_Private.h``, providing public and private APIs,; respectively. Additionally, ``Foo_Private.h`` may only be available on; some versions of library, and absent in others. One cannot easily; express this with a single module map file in the library:. .. parsed-literal::. module Foo {; header ""Foo.h""; ...; }. module Foo_Private {; header ""Foo_Private.h""; ...; }. because the header ``Foo_Private.h`` won't always be available. The; module map file could be customized based on whether; ``Foo_Private.h`` is available or not, but doing so requires custom; build machinery. Private module map files, which are named ``module.private.modulemap``; (or, for backward compatibility, ``module_private.map``), allow one to; augment the primary module map file with an additional modules. For; example, we would split the module map file above into two module map; files:. .. code-block:: c. /* module.modulemap */; module Foo {; header ""Foo.h""; }. /* module.private.modulemap */; module Foo_Private {; header ""Foo_Private.h""; }.

In subsequent analysis, the statistical nature of the errors must; be handled properly. As the last step, measurements are compared to models, and free model; parameters need to be determined in this process. See Figure [1.1](#f11) for an; example of a function (model) fit to data points.

Availability," a process has a set of; properties. In multi-threaded systems, these properties are divided; between processes and threads. ### Process Properties. A process in a multi-threaded system is the changeable entity. It must; be considered as an execution frame. It has all traditional process; attributes, such as:. - Process ID, process group ID, user ID, and group ID. - Environment. - Working directory. A process also provides a common address space and common system; resources:. - File descriptors. - Signal actions. - Shared libraries. - Inter-process communication tools (such as message queues, pipes,; semaphores, or shared memory). ### Thread Properties. A thread is the schedulable entity. It has only those properties that; are required to ensure its independent flow of control. These include; the following properties:. - Stack. - Scheduling properties (such as policy or priority). - Set of pending and blocked signals. - Some thread-specific data (TSD). An example of thread-specific data is the error indicator, `errno`. In; multi-threaded systems, `errno` is no longer a global variable, but; usually a subroutine returning a thread-specific `errno` value. Some; other systems may provide other implementations of `errno`. With respect; to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the ***`gPad`*** pointer,; which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any; thread or the main thread. Threads within a process must not be considered as a group of processes; (even though in Linux each thread receives an own process id, so that it; can be scheduled by the kernel scheduler). All threads share the same; address space. This means that two pointers having the same value in two; threads refer to the same data. Also, if any thread changes one of the; shared system resources, all threads within the process are affected.; For example, if a thread closes a file, the file is closed for all; threads. ### The Initial Thread.

When fitting an histogram ( a **`TH1`** object) or a graph (a `TGraph` object) it is possible to return a `TFitResult` via the `TFitResultPtr` object,; which behaves as a smart pointer to a `TFitResult`.; `TFitResultPtr` is the return object by `TH1::Fit` or `TGraph::Fit`.; By default the TFitResultPtr contains only the status of the fit and can be obtained by an automatic conversion of the TFitResultPtr to an integer. If the fit option *`S`* is instead used, `TFitResultPtr` contains the `TFitResult` and behaves as a smart; pointer to it. This is an example:. ``` {.cpp}; int fitStatus = hist->Fit(myFunction); // TFitResultPtr contains only the fit status.

Vector Predication Intrinsics; -----------------------------; VP intrinsics are intended for predicated SIMD/vector code. A typical VP; operation takes a vector mask and an explicit vector length parameter as in:. ::. <W x T> llvm.vp.<opcode>.*(<W x T> %x, <W x T> %y, <W x i1> %mask, i32 %evl). The vector mask parameter (%mask) always has a vector of `i1` type, for example; `<32 x i1>`. The explicit vector length parameter always has the type `i32` and; is an unsigned integer value. The explicit vector length parameter (%evl) is in; the range:. ::. 0 <= %evl <= W, where W is the number of vector elements. Note that for :ref:`scalable vector types <t_vector>` ``W`` is the runtime; length of the vector. The VP intrinsic has undefined behavior if ``%evl > W``. The explicit vector; length (%evl) creates a mask, %EVLmask, with all elements ``0 <= i < %evl`` set; to True, and all other lanes ``%evl <= i < W`` to False. A new mask %M is; calculated with an element-wise AND from %mask and %EVLmask:. ::. M = %mask AND %EVLmask. A vector operation ``<opcode>`` on vectors ``A`` and ``B`` calculates:. ::. A <opcode> B = { A[i] <opcode> B[i] M[i] = True, and; { undef otherwise. Optimization Hint; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Some targets, such as AVX512, do not support the %evl parameter in hardware.; The use of an effective %evl is discouraged for those targets.

The most sophisticated analysis a; flow-sensitive, context-sensitive interprocedural analysis that can take a; significant amount of time to execute (and obviously, there is a lot of room; between these two extremes for other implementations). To cleanly support; situations like this, the LLVM Pass Infrastructure supports the notion of; Analysis Groups. Analysis Group Concepts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An Analysis Group is a single simple interface that may be implemented by; multiple different passes. Analysis Groups can be given human readable names; just like passes, but unlike passes, they need not derive from the ``Pass``; class. An analysis group may have one or more implementations, one of which is; the ""default"" implementation. Analysis groups are used by client passes just like other passes are: the; ``AnalysisUsage::addRequired()`` and ``Pass::getAnalysis()`` methods. In order; to resolve this requirement, the :ref:`PassManager; <writing-an-llvm-pass-passmanager>` scans the available passes to see if any; implementations of the analysis group are available. If none is available, the; default implementation is created for the pass to use. All standard rules for; :ref:`interaction between passes <writing-an-llvm-pass-interaction>` still; apply. Although :ref:`Pass Registration <writing-an-llvm-pass-registration>` is; optional for normal passes, all analysis group implementations must be; registered, and must use the :ref:`INITIALIZE_AG_PASS; <writing-an-llvm-pass-RegisterAnalysisGroup>` template to join the; implementation pool. Also, a default implementation of the interface **must**; be registered with :ref:`RegisterAnalysisGroup; <writing-an-llvm-pass-RegisterAnalysisGroup>`.

Diagnostics are created by adding an entry to one of the; ``clang/Basic/Diagnostic*Kinds.td`` files, depending on what library will be; using it. From this file, :program:`tblgen` generates the unique ID of the; diagnostic, the severity of the diagnostic and the English translation + format; string. There is little sanity with the naming of the unique ID's right now. Some; start with ``err_``, ``warn_``, ``ext_`` to encode the severity into the name.; Since the enum is referenced in the C++ code that produces the diagnostic, it; is somewhat useful for it to be reasonably short. The severity of the diagnostic comes from the set {``NOTE``, ``REMARK``,; ``WARNING``,; ``EXTENSION``, ``EXTWARN``, ``ERROR``}. The ``ERROR`` severity is used for; diagnostics indicating the program is never acceptable under any circumstances.; When an error is emitted, the AST for the input code may not be fully built.; The ``EXTENSION`` and ``EXTWARN`` severities are used for extensions to the; language that Clang accepts. This means that Clang fully understands and can; represent them in the AST, but we produce diagnostics to tell the user their; code is non-portable. The difference is that the former are ignored by; default, and the later warn by default. The ``WARNING`` severity is used for; constructs that are valid in the currently selected source language but that; are dubious in some way. The ``REMARK`` severity provides generic information; about the compilation that is not necessarily related to any dubious code. The; ``NOTE`` level is used to staple more information onto previous diagnostics.

Due to the uncertain nature of inclusion, it's advisable that new components; are not added too close to a release branch.

The LLVM code base has a number of files that aren't being actively maintained.; But not all of those files are obstructing the development of the project and; so it remains in the repository with the assumption that it could still be; useful for downstream users.

In this example, we expect to get:. .. code-block:: text. test.c:6:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); *X; // error; ^~; test.c:7:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Y; // error; ^~~; test.c:8:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Z; // error; ^~~. While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"". Doing this; requires properly keeping typedef information (for example, the type of ``X``; is ""``foo``"", not ""``int``""), and requires properly propagating it through the; various operators (for example, the type of ``*Y`` is ""``foo``"", not; ""``int``""). In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"".

Availability," as unknown pragmas. It should be noted that while Clang; supports the GCC pragma, Clang and GCC do not support the exact same set; of warnings, so even when using GCC compatible #pragmas there is no; guarantee that they will have identical behaviour on both compilers. In addition to controlling warnings and errors generated by the compiler, it is; possible to generate custom warning and error messages through the following; pragmas:. .. code-block:: c. // The following will produce warning messages; #pragma message ""some diagnostic message""; #pragma GCC warning ""TODO: replace deprecated feature"". // The following will produce an error message; #pragma GCC error ""Not supported"". These pragmas operate similarly to the ``#warning`` and ``#error`` preprocessor; directives, except that they may also be embedded into preprocessor macros via; the C99 ``_Pragma`` operator, for example:. .. code-block:: c. #define STR(X) #X; #define DEFER(M,...)

Controlling Diagnostics in System Headers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Warnings are suppressed when they occur in system headers. By default,; an included file is treated as a system header if it is found in an; include path specified by ``-isystem``, but this can be overridden in; several ways. The ``system_header`` pragma can be used to mark the current file as; being a system header. No warnings will be produced from the location of; the pragma onwards within the same file. .. code-block:: c. #if foo; #endif foo // warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive. #pragma clang system_header. #if foo; #endif foo // no warning.

Success values are considered checked once they have been tested (by invoking; the boolean conversion operator):. .. code-block:: c++. if (auto Err = mayFail(...)); return Err; // Failure value - move error to caller. // Safe to continue: Err was checked.

If an; ``alloca`` value is passed directly to a stack map intrinsic, then; LLVM may fold the frame index into the stack map as an optimization to; avoid allocating a register or stack slot.

Availability," be assumed, which sets the defaults for the specified architecture.; The system name is generally the OS (linux, darwin), but could be special; like the bare-metal ""none"". When a parameter is not important, it can be omitted, or you can; choose ``unknown`` and the defaults will be used. If you choose a parameter; that Clang doesn't know, like ``blerg``, it'll ignore and assume; ``unknown``, which is not always desired, so be careful. Finally, the env (environment) option is something that will pick default; CPU/FPU, define the specific behaviour of your code (PCS, extensions),; and also choose the correct library calls, etc. CPU, FPU, ABI; -------------. Once your target is specified, it's time to pick the hardware you'll; be compiling to. For every architecture, a default set of CPU/FPU/ABI; will be chosen, so you'll almost always have to change it via flags. Typical flags include:; * ``-mcpu=<cpu-name>``, like x86-64, swift, cortex-a15; * ``-mfpu=<fpu-name>``, like SSE3, NEON, controlling the FP unit available; * ``-mfloat-abi=<fabi>``, like soft, hard, controlling which registers; to use for floating-point. The default is normally the common denominator, so that Clang doesn't; generate code that breaks. But that also means you won't get the best; code for your specific hardware, which may mean orders of magnitude; slower than you expect. For example, if your target is ``arm-none-eabi``, the default CPU will; be ``arm7tdmi`` using soft float, which is extremely slow on modern cores,; whereas if your triple is ``armv7a-none-eabi``, it'll be Cortex-A8 with; NEON, but still using soft-float, which is much better, but still not; great. Toolchain Options; -----------------. There are three main options to control access to your cross-compiler:; ``--sysroot``, ``-I``, and ``-L``.

The trees for llvm and lld should correctly represent commits; ``Lllvm1`` and ``Llld1``, respectively. Commit ``UM3`` changed files not related to submodules and we need; somewhere to put them. It is not safe in general to put them in the; monorepo root directory because they may conflict with files in the; monorepo.

This is followed by; the auxiliary constants that followed the respective section name in the; ``MD_pcsections`` metadata. To avoid relocations in the final binary, each PC address stored at ``entry``; is a relative relocation, computed as ``pc - entry``. To decode, a user has to; compute ``entry + *entry``. The size of each entry depends on the code model. With large and medium sized; code models, the entry size matches pointer size. For any smaller code model; the entry size is just 32 bits.

Metadata Propagation; --------------------. In general, LLVM *does not make any guarantees* about preserving IR metadata; (attached to an ``Instruction``) through IR transformations.

Availability," be; the definition of the class, and the others are treated as non-defining; declarations that happen to also contain member declarations. Corresponding; members in each definition of such multiply-defined classes are identified; either by redeclaration chains (if the members are ``Redeclarable``); or by simply a pointer to the canonical declaration (if the declarations; are not ``Redeclarable`` -- in that case, a ``Mergeable`` base class is used; instead). Error Handling; --------------. Clang produces an AST even when the code contains errors. Clang won't generate; and optimize code for it, but it's used as parsing continues to detect further; errors in the input. Clang-based tools also depend on such ASTs, and IDEs in; particular benefit from a high-quality AST for broken code. In presence of errors, clang uses a few error-recovery strategies to present the; broken code in the AST:. - correcting errors: in cases where clang is confident about the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics. Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery. Prior to Recovery AST, a mismatched-argument function call; expression was dropped though a CallExpr was created for semantic analysis. With these strategies, clang surfaces better diagnostics, and provides AST; consumers a rich AST reflecting the written source code as much as possible even; for broken code. Recovery AST; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The idea of Recovery AST is to use recovery nodes which act as a placeholder to; maintain the rough structure of the parsing tree, preserve locations",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:84749,error,errors,84749,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,2,['error'],"['error', 'errors']"

When making residual or pull distributions with `RooPlot::residHist` or `RooPlot::pullHist`, the histogram is now compared with the curve's average values within a given bin by default, ensuring that residual and pull distributions are valid for strongly curved distributions.; The old default behaviour was to interpolate the curve at the bin centres, which can still be enabled by setting the `useAverage` parameter of `RooPlot::residHist` or `RooPlot::pullHist` to `false`. ### Improved recovery from invalid parameters. When a function in RooFit is undefined (Poisson with negative mean, PDF with negative values, etc), RooFit can now pass information about the; ""badness"" of the violation to the minimiser. The minimiser can use this to compute a gradient to find its way out of the undefined region.; This can drastically improve its ability to recover when unstable fit models are used, for example RooPolynomial. For details, see the RooFit tutorial [rf612_recoverFromInvalidParameters.C](https://root.cern/doc/v624/rf612__recoverFromInvalidParameters_8C.html); and [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### Modernised RooDataHist. RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated. This holds especially for direct accesses to `_curWeight`,; `_curWeightErrLo`, etc, which have been removed. (It doesn't make sense to write to these members from const functions when the same information; can be retrieved using an index access operator of an array.)

As this is an experimental work in progress so there are some items we still need; to tackle:. * As mentioned in test llvm/test/DebugInfo/assignment-tracking/X86/diamond-3.ll,; the analysis should treat escaping calls like untagged stores. * The system expects locals to be backed by a local alloca. This isn't always; the case - sometimes a pointer to storage is passed into a function; (e.g. sret, byval). We need to be able to handle those cases. See; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for examples. * `trackAssignments` doesn't yet work for variables that have their; `llvm.dbg.declare` location modified by a `DIExpression`, e.g. when the; address of the variable is itself stored in an `alloca` with the; `llvm.dbg.declare` using `DIExpression(DW_OP_deref)`. See `indirectReturn` in; llvm/test/DebugInfo/Generic/assignment-tracking/track-assignments.ll and in; clang/test/CodeGen/assignment-tracking/assignment-tracking.cpp for an; example. * In order to solve the first bullet-point we need to be able to specify that a; memory location is available without using a `DIAssignID`. This is because; the storage address is not computed by an instruction (it's an argument; value) and therefore we have nowhere to put the metadata attachment. To solve; this we probably need another marker intrinsic to denote ""the variable's; stack home is X address"" - similar to `llvm.dbg.declare` except that it needs; to compose with `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics such that the stack home address; is only selected as a location for the variable when the `llvm.dbg.assign`; intrinsics agree it should be. * Given the above (a special ""the stack home is X"" intrinsic), and the fact; that we can only track assignments with fixed offsets and sizes, I think we; can probably get rid of the address and address-expression part, since it; will always be computable with the info we have.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md:10536,avail,available,10536,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,1,['avail'],['available']

A comment starting with substring `LLVM-MCA-<INSTRUMENT_TYPE>`; brings data into scope for llvm-mca to use in its analysis for; all following instructions. If a comment with the same `INSTRUMENT_TYPE` is found later in the; instruction list, then the original InstrumentRegion will be; automatically ended, and a new InstrumentRegion will begin. If there are comments containing the different `INSTRUMENT_TYPE`,; then both data sets remain available. In contrast with an AnalysisRegion,; an InstrumentRegion does not need a comment to end the region. Comments that are prefixed with `LLVM-MCA-` but do not correspond to; a valid `INSTRUMENT_TYPE` for the target cause an error, except for; `BEGIN` and `END`, since those correspond to AnalysisRegions. Comments; that do not start with `LLVM-MCA-` are ignored by :program `llvm-mca`. An instruction (a MCInst) is added to an InstrumentRegion R only; if its location is in range [R.RangeStart, R.RangeEnd].

But even such rebinding becomes annoying for (brief) interactive sessions. For CPython only (and not with tools such as IPython or in IDEs that replace; the interactive prompt), there is a fix, using; ``from cppyy.interactive import *``.; This makes lookups in the global dictionary of the current frame also; consider everything under ``cppyy.gbl``.; This feature comes with a performance `penalty` and is not meant for; production code.; Example usage:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.interactive import *; >>> v = std.vector[int](range(10)); >>> print(list(v)); [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; >>>; >>> cppdef(""struct SomeStruct {};""); True; >>> s = SomeStruct() # <- dynamically made available; >>> s; <cppyy.gbl.SomeStruct object at 0x7fa9b8624320>; >>>.

The; default declarations of non-native compiler types and functions can be disabled; by using flag :option:`-cl-no-stdinc`. The following example demonstrates that OpenCL kernel sources with various; standard builtin functions can be compiled without the need for an explicit; includes or compiler flags. .. code-block:: console. $ echo ""bool is_wg_uniform(int i){return get_enqueued_local_size(i)==get_local_size(i);}"" > test.cl; $ clang -cl-std=CL2.0 test.cl.

Most of the ``cl_khr_*`` extensions to OpenCL C from `the official OpenCL; registry <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/>`_ are available and; configured per target depending on the support available in the specific; architecture. It is possible to alter the default extensions setting per target using; ``-cl-ext`` flag. (See :ref:`flags description <opencl_cl_ext>` for more details).

All ``Error`` instances, whether success or failure, must be either checked or; moved from (via ``std::move`` or a return) before they are destructed.; Accidentally discarding an unchecked error will cause a program abort at the; point where the unchecked value's destructor is run, making it easy to identify; and fix violations of this rule. Success values are considered checked once they have been tested (by invoking; the boolean conversion operator):. .. code-block:: c++. if (auto Err = mayFail(...)); return Err; // Failure value - move error to caller. // Safe to continue: Err was checked. In contrast, the following code will always cause an abort, even if ``mayFail``; returns a success value:. .. code-block:: c++. mayFail();; // Program will always abort here, even if mayFail() returns Success, since; // the value is not checked. Failure values are considered checked once a handler for the error type has; been activated:. .. code-block:: c++. handleErrors(; processFormattedFile(...),; [](const BadFileFormat &BFF) {; report(""Unable to process "" + BFF.Path + "": bad format"");; },; [](const FileNotFound &FNF) {; report(""File not found "" + FNF.Path);; });.

We have already described how to change the line colors for volumes. In; fact, volume objects inherit from TAttLine class so the line style or; width can also be changed:. ``` {.cpp}; myVolume->SetLineColor(kRed);; myVolume->SetLineWith(2);; myVolume->SetLineStyle(kDotted);; ```. When drawing in solid mode, the color of the drawn volume corresponds to; the line color. #### Visibility Settings. The way geometry is build forces the definition of several volumes that; does not represent real objects, but just virtual containers used for; grouping and positioning volumes together. One would not want to see; them in the picture. Since every volume is by default visible, one has; to do this sort of tuning by its own:. ``` {.cpp}; myVolumeContainer->SetVisibility(kFALSE);; ```. As described before, the drawing package supports two main global; options: 1 (default) - only final volume leaves; 0 - all volumes down; the drawn one appear on the screen. The global visible level put a; limitation on the maximum applied depth. Combined with visibility; settings per volume, these can tune quite well what should appear on the; screen. However, there are situations when users want to see a volume; branch displayed down to the maximum depth, keeping at the same time a; limitation or even suppressing others. In order to accomplish that, one; should use the volume attribute: `Visible daughters`. By default, all; daughters of all volumes are displayed if there is no limitation related; with their level depth with respect to the top drawn volume. ### Ray Tracing.

Otherwise, the compiler inserts a run-time; check to ensure pointer arithmetic doesn't make the pointer smaller than the; original ``__indexable`` pointer (Note that ``__indexable`` doesn't have a; lower bound so the pointer value is effectively the lower bound). As pointer; arithmetic overflow will make the pointer smaller than the original pointer,; it will cause a trap at runtime. Similar to ``__bidi_indexable``, an; ``__indexable`` pointer is allowed to have a pointer value above the upper; bound and creating such a pointer is well-defined behavior. Dereferencing such; a pointer, however, will cause a run-time trap. * ``__bidi_indexable`` offers the best flexibility out of all the pointer; annotations in this model, as ``__bidi_indexable`` pointers can be used for; any pointer operation. However, this comes with the largest code size and; memory cost out of the available pointer annotations in this model. In some; cases, use of the ``__bidi_indexable`` annotation may be duplicating bounds; information that exists elsewhere in the program. In such cases, using; external bounds annotations may be a better choice. ``__bidi_indexable`` is the default annotation for non-ABI visible pointers,; such as local pointer variables — that is, if the programmer does not specify; another bounds annotation, a local pointer variable is implicitly; ``__bidi_indexable``. Since ``__bidi_indexable`` pointers automatically carry; bounds information and have no restrictions on kinds of pointer operations that; can be used with these pointers, most code inside a function works as is without; modification. In the example below, ``int *buf`` doesn't require manual; annotation as it's implicitly ``int *__bidi_indexable buf``, carrying the bounds; information passed from the return value of malloc, which is necessary to insert; bounds checking for ``buf[",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:16562,avail,available,16562,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability," change its own logic to do the right thing on; the untranslated original arguments. Unused Argument Warnings; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The driver operates by parsing all arguments but giving Tools the; opportunity to choose which arguments to pass on. One downside of this; infrastructure is that if the user misspells some option, or is confused; about which options to use, some command line arguments the user really; cared about may go unused. This problem is particularly important when; using clang as a compiler, since the clang compiler does not support; anywhere near all the options that gcc does, and we want to make sure; users know which ones are being used. To support this, the driver maintains a bit associated with each; argument of whether it has been used (at all) during the compilation.; This bit usually doesn't need to be set by hand, as the key ArgList; accessors will set it automatically. When a compilation is successful (there are no errors), the driver; checks the bit and emits an ""unused argument"" warning for any arguments; which were never accessed. This is conservative (the argument may not; have been used to do what the user wanted) but still catches the most; obvious cases. Relation to GCC Driver Concepts; -------------------------------. For those familiar with the gcc driver, this section provides a brief; overview of how things from the gcc driver map to the clang driver. - **Driver Driver**. The driver driver is fully integrated into the clang driver. The; driver simply constructs additional Actions to bind the architecture; during the *Pipeline* phase. The tool chain specific argument; translation is responsible for handling ``-Xarch_``. The one caveat is that this approach requires ``-Xarch_`` not be used; to alter the compilation itself (for example, one cannot provide; ``-S`` as an ``-Xarch_`` argument). The driver attempts to reject; such invocations, and overall there isn't a good reason to abuse; ``-Xarch_`` to that end in practice.

Unless otherwise documented, LLVM subprojects are written using standard C++17; code and avoid unnecessary vendor-specific extensions. Nevertheless, we restrict ourselves to features which are available in the; major toolchains supported as host compilers (see :doc:`GettingStarted` page,; section `Software`). Each toolchain provides a good reference for what it accepts:. * Clang: https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html. * libc++: https://libcxx.llvm.org/Status/Cxx17.html. * GCC: https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17. * libstdc++: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/status.html#status.iso.2017. * MSVC: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368.aspx. C++ Standard Library; --------------------. Instead of implementing custom data structures, we encourage the use of C++; standard library facilities or LLVM support libraries whenever they are; available for a particular task. LLVM and related projects emphasize and rely; on the standard library facilities and the LLVM support libraries as much as; possible. LLVM support libraries (for example, `ADT; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT>`_); implement specialized data structures or functionality missing in the standard; library. Such libraries are usually implemented in the ``llvm`` namespace and; follow the expected standard interface, when there is one. When both C++ and the LLVM support libraries provide similar functionality, and; there isn't a specific reason to favor the C++ implementation, it is generally; preferable to use the LLVM library. For example, ``llvm::DenseMap`` should; almost always be used instead of ``std::map`` or ``std::unordered_map``, and; ``llvm::SmallVector`` should usually be used instead of ``std::vector``.

Before we can build the code, we must configure exactly how to build it; by running CMake. CMake combines information from three sources:. - explicit choices you make (is this a debug build?). - settings detected from your system (where are libraries installed?). - project structure (which files are part of 'clang'?). First, create a directory to build in. Usually, this is; llvm-project/build. .. code:: console. $ mkdir llvm-project/build; $ cd llvm-project/build. Now, run CMake:. .. code:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja ../llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang. If all goes well, you'll see a lot of ""performing test"" lines, and; finally:. .. code:: console. Configuring done; Generating done; Build files have been written to: /path/llvm-project/build. And you should see a build.ninja file. Let's break down that last command a little:. - **-G Ninja**: we're going to use ninja to build; please create; build.ninja. - **../llvm**: this is the path to the source of the ""main"" LLVM; project. - The two **-D** flags set CMake variables, which override; CMake/project defaults:. - **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release**: build in optimized mode, which is; (surprisingly) the fastest option. If you want to run under a debugger, you should use the default Debug; (which is totally unoptimized, and will lead to >10x slower test; runs) or RelWithDebInfo which is a halfway point.; **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE** affects code generation only, assertions are; on by default regardless! **LLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=Off** disables; them. - **LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang**: this lists the LLVM subprojects; you are interested in building, in addition to LLVM itself.

Note that the merge from ``U2`` to ``Lclang1`` appears redundant, but; if, say, ``U3`` changed some files in upstream clang, the ``Lclang1``; commit appearing after the ``Llld1`` commit would actually represent a; clang tree *earlier* in the upstream clang history. We want the; ``local/zip`` branch to accurately represent the state of our umbrella; history and so the edge ``U2 -> Lclang1`` is a visual reminder of what; clang's tree actually looks like in ``Lclang1``. Even so, the edge ``U3 -> Llld1`` could be problematic for future; merges from upstream. git will think that we've already merged from; ``U3``, and we have, except for the state of the clang tree. One; possible mitigation strategy is to manually diff clang between ``U2``; and ``U3`` and apply those updates to ``local/zip``. Another,; possibly simpler strategy is to freeze local work on downstream; branches and merge all submodules from the latest upstream before; running ``zip-downstream-fork.py``. If downstream merged each project; from upstream in lockstep without any intervening local commits, then; things should be fine without any special action. We anticipate this; to be the common case. The tree for ``Lclang1`` outside of clang will represent the state of; things at ``U3`` since all of the upstream projects not participating; in the umbrella history should be in a state respecting the commit; ``U3``. The trees for llvm and lld should correctly represent commits; ``Lllvm1`` and ``Llld1``, respectively. Commit ``UM3`` changed files not related to submodules and we need; somewhere to put them.

""round.dynamic""; ""round.tonearest""; ""round.downward""; ""round.upward""; ""round.towardzero""; ""round.tonearestaway"".

No transformations that; depend on rounding mode may be performed in this case. The other possible values for the rounding mode argument correspond to the; similarly named IEEE rounding modes. If the argument is any of these values; optimization passes may perform transformations as long as they are consistent; with the specified rounding mode.

Unless you are certain that your errors will not need; interoperability you should look for an existing ``std::error_code`` that you; can convert to, and even (as painful as it is) consider introducing a new one as; a stopgap measure. ``createStringError`` can take ``printf`` style format specifiers to provide a; formatted message:. .. code-block:: c++. createStringError(errc::executable_format_error,; ""Bad executable: %s"", FileName);. Interoperability with std::error_code and ErrorOr; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Many existing LLVM APIs use ``std::error_code`` and its partner ``ErrorOr<T>``; (which plays the same role as ``Expected<T>``, but wraps a ``std::error_code``; rather than an ``Error``). The infectious nature of error types means that an; attempt to change one of these functions to return ``Error`` or ``Expected<T>``; instead often results in an avalanche of changes to callers, callers of callers,; and so on. (The first such attempt, returning an ``Error`` from; MachOObjectFile's constructor, was abandoned after the diff reached 3000 lines,; impacted half a dozen libraries, and was still growing). To solve this problem, the ``Error``/``std::error_code`` interoperability requirement was; introduced. Two pairs of functions allow any ``Error`` value to be converted to a; ``std::error_code``, any ``Expected<T>`` to be converted to an ``ErrorOr<T>``, and vice; versa:. .. code-block:: c++. std::error_code errorToErrorCode(Error Err);; Error errorCodeToError(std::error_code EC);. template <typename T> ErrorOr<T> expectedToErrorOr(Expected<T> TOrErr);; template <typename T> Expected<T> errorOrToExpected(ErrorOr<T> TOrEC);.

The; choice of constraint is made independently for each constraint in the; constraint list. 2) Use ""``|``"" between constraint code sets, creating alternatives. Every; constraint in the constraint list must have the same number of alternative; sets. With this syntax, the same alternative in *all* of the items in the; constraint list will be chosen together. Putting those together, you might have a two operand constraint string like; ``""rm|r,ri|rm""``. This indicates that if operand 0 is ``r`` or ``m``, then; operand 1 may be one of ``r`` or ``i``. If operand 0 is ``r``, then operand 1; may be one of ``r`` or ``m``. But, operand 0 and 1 cannot both be of type m. However, the use of either of the alternatives features is *NOT* recommended, as; LLVM is not able to make an intelligent choice about which one to use. (At the; point it currently needs to choose, not enough information is available to do so; in a smart way.) Thus, it simply tries to make a choice that's most likely to; compile, not one that will be optimal performance. (e.g., given ""``rm``"", it'll; always choose to use memory, not registers). And, if given multiple registers,; or multiple register classes, it will simply choose the first one. (In fact, it; doesn't currently even ensure explicitly specified physical registers are; unique, so specifying multiple physical registers as alternatives, like; ``{r11}{r12},{r11}{r12}``, will assign r11 to both operands, not at all what was; intended.).

The old change; rate is the same as for pro. ## Installing Precompiled Binaries. The binaries are available for downloading from; <https://root.cern/install/>. Once downloaded; you need to unzip and de-tar the file. For example, if you have; downloaded ROOT v5.30 for Linux-SLC5:. ``` {.cpp}; % gunzip root_v5.30.00.Linux-slc5-gcc4.3.tar.gz; % tar xvf root_v5.30.00.Linux-slc5-gcc4.3.tar; ```. This will create the directory root. Before getting started read the; file README/README. Also, read the Introduction chapter for an; explanation of the directory structure. ## Installing from the Source. The ROOT's source code sits in the GitHub repository <https://github.com/root-project/root>; all the details and options to buld ROOT from sources are given in; <https://root.cern/building-root>. In short, the steps to build ROOT from the sources are the following:. 1. Clone the repository:; ``` {.cpp}; $ git clone https://github.com/root-project/root.git; ```. 2. Make a directory for building; ``` {.cpp}; $ mkdir build; $ cd build; ```. 3. Run cmake and make; ``` {.cpp}; $ cmake ../root; $ make -j8; ```. 4.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InstallandBuild.md:1596,avail,available,1596,documentation/users-guide/InstallandBuild.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InstallandBuild.md,2,"['avail', 'down']","['available', 'downloading']"
Availability," editor tab is a resource shared among all the; class-editors. Tabs must be created from the constructor of your; editor-class by using the method:. ``` {.cpp}; TGVerticalFrame* TGedFrame::CreateEditorTabSubFrame(const Text_t *name),; ```. It returns a pointer to a new tab container frame ready for use in your; class. If you need to hide/show this frame depending on the object's; status, you should store it in a data member. See for examples:; **`TH1Editor`**, **`TH2Editor`**. #### Base-Class Editors Control. Full control over base-class editors can be achieved by re-implementing; virtual method void `TGedFrame::ActivateBaseClassEditors(TClass` `*cl)`.; It is called during each compound editor rebuild and the default; implementation simply offers all base-classes to the publishing; mechanism. To prevent inclusion of a base-class into the compound editor, call:. ``` {.cpp}; void TGedEditor::ExcludeClassEditor(TClass* class, Bool_t recurse); ```. Pointer to the compound GED-editor is available in **`TGedFrame`**‘s; data-member:. ``` {.cpp}; TGedEditor *fGedEditor; ```. Ordering of base-class editor frames follows the order of the classes in; the class hierarchy. This order can be changed by modifying the value of; **`TGedFrame`**'s data member `Int_t fPriority`. The default value is; 50; smaller values move the frame towards to the top. This priority; should be set in the editor constructor. ## Drag and Drop. Drag and Drop support is introduced for Linux (via Xdnd - the drag and; drop protocol for X window system) and for Windows (via Clipboard).; Users can selects something in ROOT with a mouse press, drags it (moves; the mouse while keeping the mouse button pressed) and releases the mouse; button someplace else.

Multilib via configuration file shall be considered an experimental feature; until LLVM 18, at which point ``-print-multi-flags-experimental``; should be renamed to ``-print-multi-flags``.; A toolchain can opt in to using this feature by including a ``multilib.yaml``; file in its distribution, once support for it is added in relevant ToolChain; subclasses.; Once stability is reached, flags emitted by ``-print-multi-flags``; should not be removed or changed, although new flags may be added. Restrictions; ============. Despite the name, multilib is used to locate both ``include`` and ``lib``; directories. Therefore it is important that consistent options are passed to; the Clang driver when both compiling and linking. Otherwise inconsistent; ``include`` and ``lib`` directories may be used, and the results will be; undefined. EXPERIMENTAL multilib.yaml; ==========================.

Availability," ensure that individual tests are not affected; by variables set in preceding tests. FileCheck Numeric Substitution Blocks; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. :program:`FileCheck` also supports numeric substitution blocks that allow; defining numeric variables and checking for numeric values that satisfy a; numeric expression constraint based on those variables via a numeric; substitution. This allows ``CHECK:`` directives to verify a numeric relation; between two numbers, such as the need for consecutive registers to be used. The syntax to capture a numeric value is; ``[[#%<fmtspec>,<NUMVAR>:]]`` where:. * ``%<fmtspec>,`` is an optional format specifier to indicate what number; format to match and the minimum number of digits to expect. * ``<NUMVAR>:`` is an optional definition of variable ``<NUMVAR>`` from the; captured value. The syntax of ``<fmtspec>`` is: ``#.<precision><conversion specifier>`` where:. * ``#`` is an optional flag available for hex values (see; ``<conversion specifier>`` below) which requires the value matched to be; prefixed by ``0x``.; * ``.<precision>`` is an optional printf-style precision specifier in which; ``<precision>`` indicates the minimum number of digits that the value matched; must have, expecting leading zeros if needed. * ``<conversion specifier>`` is an optional scanf-style conversion specifier; to indicate what number format to match (e.g. hex number). Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

Availability," ensures they do not; leak secret data. There are two primary techniques for this: we can either; harden the loaded value to prevent observation, or we can harden the address; itself to prevent the load from occurring. These have significantly different; performance tradeoffs. ##### Hardening loaded values. The most appealing way to harden loads is to mask out all of the bits loaded.; The key requirement is that for each bit loaded, along the misspeculated path; that bit is always fixed at either 0 or 1 regardless of the value of the bit; loaded. The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or` with an all-ones mask,; making the x86 instruction sequence look like the following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; movl (%rsi), %edi # Load potentially secret data from %rsi.; orl %eax, %edi; ```. Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:23439,mask,mask,23439,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['mask'],['mask']

This works well for internal; linkage functions but has a caveat for C++ vague linkage functions. C++ vague linkage functions (e.g. inline functions, template instantiations) are; deduplicated at link time. A function (in an included file) ignored by a; specific ``mainfile`` pattern may not be the prevailing copy picked by the; linker. Therefore, using ``mainfile`` requires caution. It may still be useful,; e.g. when patterns are picked in a way to ensure the prevailing one is ignored.; (There is action-at-a-distance risk.). ``mainfile`` can be useful enabling a ubsan check for a large code base when; finding the direct stack frame triggering the failure for every failure is; difficult.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/SanitizerSpecialCaseList.rst:4716,failure,failure,4716,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/SanitizerSpecialCaseList.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/SanitizerSpecialCaseList.rst,2,['failure'],['failure']

Recoverable Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types.

For example,; when walking an archive, some clients may be happy to skip over badly formatted; object files rather than terminating the walk immediately. Skipping badly; formatted objects could be achieved using an elaborate handler method, but the; Error.h header provides two utilities that make this idiom much cleaner: the; type inspection method, ``isA``, and the ``consumeError`` function:. .. code-block:: c++. Error walkArchive(Archive A) {; for (unsigned I = 0; I != A.numMembers(); ++I) {; auto ChildOrErr = A.getMember(I);; if (auto Err = ChildOrErr.takeError()) {; if (Err.isA<BadFileFormat>()); consumeError(std::move(Err)); else; return Err;; }; auto &Child = *ChildOrErr;; // Use Child; ...; }; return Error::success();; }.

Availability," even when using ``REDEFINE:``. The relationship between the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:`` directive is; analogous to the relationship between a variable declaration and variable; assignment in many programming languages:. - ``DEFINE: %{name} = value``. This directive assigns the specified value to a new substitution whose; pattern is ``%{name}``, or it reports an error if there is already a; substitution whose pattern contains ``%{name}`` because that could produce; confusing expansions (e.g., a lit configuration file might define a; substitution with the pattern ``%{name}\[0\]``). The new substitution is; inserted at the start of the substitution list so that it will expand first.; Thus, its value can contain any substitution previously defined, whether in; the same test file or in a lit configuration file, and both will expand. - ``REDEFINE: %{name} = value``. This directive assigns the specified value to an existing substitution whose; pattern is ``%{name}``, or it reports an error if there are no substitutions; with that pattern or if there are multiple substitutions whose patterns; contain ``%{name}``. The substitution's current position in the substitution; list does not change so that expansion order relative to other existing; substitutions is preserved. The following properties apply to both the ``DEFINE:`` and ``REDEFINE:``; directives:. - **Substitution name**: In the directive, whitespace immediately before or; after ``%{name}`` is optional and discarded. ``%{name}`` must start with; ``%{``, it must end with ``}``, and the rest must start with a letter or; underscore and contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and; colons. This syntax has a few advantages:. - It is impossible for ``%{name}`` to contain sequences that are special in; python's ``re.sub`` patterns.

A transformation should drop debug locations if the rules for; :ref:`preserving<WhenToPreserveLocation>` and; :ref:`merging<WhenToMergeLocation>` debug locations do not apply.

The purpose of this rule is to prevent erratic or misleading single-stepping; behavior in situations in which an instruction has no clear, unambiguous; relationship to a source location. To handle an instruction without a location, the DWARF generator; defaults to allowing the last-set location after a label to cascade forward, or; to setting a line 0 location with viable scope information if no previous; location is available.

Availability," final nodes are pushed back; onto the work list, so that evaluation of the caller can continue. Retry Without Inlining; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In some cases, we would like to retry analysis without inlining a particular; call. Currently, we use this technique to recover coverage in case we stop; analyzing a path due to exceeding the maximum block count inside an inlined; function. When this situation is detected, we walk up the path to find the first node; before inlining was started and enqueue it on the WorkList with a special; ReplayWithoutInlining bit added to it (ExprEngine::replayWithoutInlining). The; path is then re-analyzed from that point without inlining that particular call. Deciding When to Inline; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In general, the analyzer attempts to inline as much as possible, since it; provides a better summary of what actually happens in the program. There are; some cases, however, where the analyzer chooses not to inline:. - If there is no definition available for the called function or method. In; this case, there is no opportunity to inline. - If the CFG cannot be constructed for a called function, or the liveness; cannot be computed. These are prerequisites for analyzing a function body,; with or without inlining. - If the LocationContext chain for a given ExplodedNode reaches a maximum cutoff; depth. This prevents unbounded analysis due to infinite recursion, but also; serves as a useful cutoff for performance reasons. - If the function is variadic. This is not a hard limitation, but an engineering; limitation. Tracked by: <rdar://problem/12147064> Support inlining of variadic functions. - In C++, constructors are not inlined unless the destructor call will be; processed by the ExprEngine. Thus, if the CFG was built without nodes for; implicit destructors, or if the destructors for the given object are not; represented in the CFG, the constructor will not be inlined.

Availability," first, then inputs, then; clobbers. They cannot be intermingled. There are also three different categories of constraint codes:. - Register constraint. This is either a register class, or a fixed physical; register. This kind of constraint will allocate a register, and if necessary,; bitcast the argument or result to the appropriate type.; - Memory constraint. This kind of constraint is for use with an instruction; taking a memory operand. Different constraints allow for different addressing; modes used by the target.; - Immediate value constraint. This kind of constraint is for an integer or other; immediate value which can be rendered directly into an instruction. The; various target-specific constraints allow the selection of a value in the; proper range for the instruction you wish to use it with. Output constraints; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Output constraints are specified by an ""``=``"" prefix (e.g. ""``=r``""). This; indicates that the assembly will write to this operand, and the operand will; then be made available as a return value of the ``asm`` expression. Output; constraints do not consume an argument from the call instruction. (Except, see; below about indirect outputs). Normally, it is expected that no output locations are written to by the assembly; expression until *all* of the inputs have been read. As such, LLVM may assign; the same register to an output and an input. If this is not safe (e.g. if the; assembly contains two instructions, where the first writes to one output, and; the second reads an input and writes to a second output), then the ""``&``""; modifier must be used (e.g. ""``=&r``"") to specify that the output is an; ""early-clobber"" output. Marking an output as ""early-clobber"" ensures that LLVM; will not use the same register for any inputs (other than an input tied to this; output).

If your program makes use of atomic operations and the compiler is not able; to lower them all directly to machine instructions (because there either is; no known suitable machine instruction or the operand is not known to be; suitably aligned), a call to a runtime library ``__atomic_*`` function; will be generated. A runtime library containing these atomics functions is; necessary for such programs. compiler-rt (LLVM); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. compiler-rt contains an implementation of an atomics library. libatomic (GNU); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. libgcc_s does not provide an implementation of an atomics library. Instead,; `GCC's libatomic library <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic/GCCMM>`_ can be; used to supply these when using libgcc_s. .. note::. Clang does not currently automatically link against libatomic when using; libgcc_s. You may need to manually add ``-latomic`` to support this; configuration when using non-native atomic operations (if you see link errors; referring to ``__atomic_*`` functions). Unwind library; --------------. The unwind library provides a family of ``_Unwind_*`` functions implementing; the language-neutral stack unwinding portion of the Itanium C++ ABI; (`Level I <https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html#base-abi>`_).; It is a dependency of the C++ ABI library, and sometimes is a dependency; of other runtimes. libunwind (LLVM); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

LLVM provides intrinsics for vector gather and scatter operations. They are similar to :ref:`Masked Vector Load and Store <int_mload_mstore>`, except they are designed for arbitrary memory accesses, rather than sequential memory accesses. Gather and scatter also employ a mask operand, which holds one bit per vector element, switching the associated vector lane on or off. The memory addresses corresponding to the ""off"" lanes are not accessed. When all bits are off, no memory is accessed. .. _int_mgather:.

Availability," generates a skeleton class designed to loop over the entries of the; tree. This is the `TTree::MakeClass` method. We will now go through the steps; of using `MakeClass` with a simplified example. The methods used here; obviously work for complex event loop calculations. These are our assumptions: we would like to do selective plotting and; loop through each entry of the tree and tracks. We chose a simple; example: we want to plot `fPx` of the first 100 tracks of each entry. We; have a ROOT tree with a branch for each data member in the ""`Event`""; object. To build this file and tree follow the instructions on how to; build the examples in `$ROOTSYS/test`. Execute `Event` and instruct it; to split the object with this command (from the UNIX command line). ``` {.cpp}; > $ROOTSYS/test/Event 400 1 2 1; ```. This creates an `Event.root` file with 400 events, compressed, split,; and filled. See `$ROOTSYS/test/MainEvent.cxx` for more info. The person who designed the tree makes a shared library available to; you, which defines the classes needed. In this case, the classes are; Event, `EventHeader`, and Track and they are defined in the shared; library `libEvent.so`. The designer also gives you the `Event.h` file to; see the definition of the classes. You can locate `Event.h` in; `$ROOTSYS/test`, and if you have not yet built `libEvent.so`, please see; the instructions of how to build it (typing make in \$ROOTSYS/test is; enough). If you have already built it, you can now use it again. ### Creating a Class with MakeClass. First, we load the shared library and open `Event.root`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L libEvent.so; root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""Event.root"");; root[] f->ls();; TFile** Event.root TTree benchmark ROOT file; TFile* Event.root TTree benchmark ROOT file; KEY: TH1F htime;1 Real-Time to write versus time; KEY: TTree T;1 An example of a ROOT tree; ```.

Availability," gradients, etc.) and more or less successfully implemented; into programs for analysis of complex spectra. They are based on matrix; inversion that can impose appreciable convergence difficulties mainly; for large number of fitted parameters. Peaks can be fitted separately,; each peak (or multiplets) in a region or together all peaks in a; spectrum. To fit separately each peak one needs to determine the fitted; region. However it can happen that the regions of neighboring peaks are; overlapping (mainly in 2-dimensional spectra). Then the results of; fitting are very poor. On the other hand, when fitting together all the; peaks found in a spectrum, one needs to have a method that is stable; (i.e., converges) and fast enough to carry out the fitting in a reasonable time. The; gradient methods based on the inversion of large matrices are not; applicable because of two reasons:. a. calculation of inverse matrix is extremely time consuming;. b. due to accumulation of truncation and rounding-off errors, the; result can become worthless. We have implemented two kinds of fitting functions. The first approach; is based on the algorithm without matrix inversion [9] - awmi algorithm.; It allows to fit large blocks of data and large number of parameters. The other one is based on a calculation of the system of linear equations; using Stiefel-Hestens method [10]. It converges faster than the awmi; algorithm, however, it is not suitable to fit large number of parameters. ## 1-DIMENSIONAL SPECTRA. The quantity to be minimized in the fitting procedure for one-dimensional spectrum is defined as. $$ \chi^2 = \frac{1}{N-M}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{[y_i-f(i,a)]^2}{y_i} $$. where `i` is the channel in the fitted spectrum, `N` is the number of; channels in the fitting subregion, `M` is the number of free parameters,; `y_i` is the content of the `i`-th channel, `a` is a vector of the; parameters being fitted and `f(i,a)` is a fitting or peak shape function.

Availability," grammar rule; has the usual ambiguity with ""dangling else"" clauses, and it is resolved in; the usual way: in a case like ``if v1 then if v2 then {...} else {...}``, the; ``else`` associates with the inner ``if`` rather than the outer one. The :token:`IfBody` of the then and else arms of the ``if`` establish an; inner scope. Any ``defvar`` variables defined in the bodies go out of scope; when the bodies are finished (see `Defvar in a Record Body`_ for more details). The ``if`` statement can also be used in a record :token:`Body`. ``assert`` --- check that a condition is true; ---------------------------------------------. The ``assert`` statement checks a boolean condition to be sure that it is true; and prints an error message if it is not. .. productionlist::; Assert: ""assert"" `condition` "","" `message` "";"". If the boolean condition is true, the statement does nothing. If the; condition is false, it prints a nonfatal error message. The **message**, which; can be an arbitrary string expression, is included in the error message as a; note. The exact behavior of the ``assert`` statement depends on its; placement. * At top level, the assertion is checked immediately. * In a record definition, the statement is saved and all assertions are; checked after the record is completely built. * In a class definition, the assertions are saved and inherited by all; the subclasses and records that inherit from the class. The assertions are; then checked when the records are completely built. * In a multiclass definition, the assertions are saved with the other; components of the multiclass and then checked each time the multiclass; is instantiated with ``defm``. Using assertions in TableGen files can simplify record checking in TableGen; backends. Here is an example of an ``assert`` in two class definitions. .. code-block:: text. class PersonName<string name> {; assert !le(!size(name), 32), ""person name is too long: "" # name;; string Name = name;; }. class Person<string name, int ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst:49335,error,error,49335,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,1,['error'],['error']

Writing the script can take 10-20 minutes, but it's almost; always worth it -- you can do something else while the bisect runs (such; as writing this document). Here's an example run script. It assumes that you're in ``llvm-project`` and; that you have a sibling ``llvm-build-project`` build directory where you; configured CMake to use Ninja. You have a file ``repro.c`` in the current; directory that makes clang crash at trunk, but it worked fine at revision; ``f00ba``. .. code-block:: bash. # Build clang. If the build fails, `exit 125` causes this; # revision to be skipped; ninja -C ../llvm-build-project clang || exit 125. ../llvm-build-project/bin/clang repro.c. To make sure your run script works, it's a good idea to run ``./run.sh`` by; hand and tweak the script until it works, then run ``git bisect good`` or; ``git bisect bad`` manually once based on the result of the script; (check ``echo $?`` after your script ran), and only then run ``git bisect run; ./run.sh``. Don't forget to mark your run script as executable -- ``git bisect; run`` doesn't check for that, it just assumes the run script failed each time. Once your run script works, run ``git bisect run ./run.sh`` and a few hours; later you'll know which commit caused the regression. (This is a very simple run script. Often, you want to use just-built clang; to build a different project and then run a built executable of that project; in the run script.).

However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors ###. The M processor $\mbox{MINOS}$ (MnMinos, see [api:minos]) was; probably the first, and may still be the only, generally available; program to calculate parameter errors taking into account both parameter; correlations and non-linearities. The $\mbox{MINOS}$ error intervals; are in general asymmetric, and may be expensive to calculate,; especially if there are a lot of free parameters and the problem is very; non-linear. $\mbox{MINOS}$ can only operate after a good minimum has already; been found, and the error matrix has been calculated, so the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ error analysis will normally follow a; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ minimization. The $\mbox{MINOS}$ error for a; given parameter is defined as the change in the value of that parameter; which causes ${\displaystyle F'}$ to increase by the amount; FCNBase::up(), where ${\displaystyle F'}$ is the minimum of; $\mbox{FCN}$ with respect to all *other* free parameters, and; FCNBase::up() is the return value of the error definition specified by; the user (default = 1.). The algorithm for finding the positive and negative $\mbox{MINOS}$; errors for parameter $\mbox{n}$ consists of varying parameter; $\mbox{n}$, each time minimizing $\mbox{FCN}$ with respect to; all the other $\mbox{npar - 1}$ variable parameters, to find; numerically the two values of parameter $\mbox{n}$ for which the; minimum of $\mbox{FCN}$ takes on the values; $\displaystyle F_{\mathrm{min}} + \mbox{up}$, where; $\displaystyle F_{\mathrm{min}}$ is the minimum of $\mbox{FCN}$ with; respect to all $",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:18005,error,error,18005,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,2,['error'],['error']

See DWARF Version 5; section 2.5 which is updated by *DWARF Extensions For Heterogeneous Debugging*; section :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`. For AMDGPU, the lane identifier corresponds to the hardware lane ID of a; wavefront. It is numbered from 0 to the wavefront size minus 1. Operation Expressions; ---------------------. DWARF expressions are used to compute program values and the locations of; program objects. See DWARF Version 5 section 2.5 and; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`. DWARF location descriptions describe how to access storage which includes memory; and registers. When accessing storage on AMDGPU, bytes are ordered with least; significant bytes first, and bits are ordered within bytes with least; significant bits first. For AMDGPU CFI expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used to describe; unwinding vector registers that are spilled under the execution mask to memory:; the zero-single location description is the vector register, and the one-single; location description is the spilled memory location description. The; ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` is used to specify the address space of the; memory location description. In AMDGPU expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used by the; ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute expression where divergent control flow is; controlled by the execution mask. An undefined location description together; with ``DW_OP_LLVM_extend`` is used to indicate the lane was not active on entry; to the subprogram. See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-dw-at-llvm-lane-pc` for an example. Debugger Information Entry Attributes; -------------------------------------. This section describes how certain debugger information entry attributes are; used by AMDGPU.

Availability," in C-style casts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A pointer type used in a C-style cast (e.g., ``(int *)src``) inherits the same; pointer attribute in the type of src. For instance, if the type of src is ``T; *__single`` (with ``T`` being an arbitrary C type), ``(int *)src`` will be ``int; *__single``. The reasoning behind this behavior is so that a C-style cast; doesn't introduce any unexpected side effects caused by an implicit cast of; bounds attribute. Pointer casts can have explicit bounds annotations. For instance, ``(int; *__bidi_indexable)src`` casts to ``int *__bidi_indexable`` as long as src has a; bounds annotation that can implicitly convert to ``__bidi_indexable``. If; ``src`` has type ``int *__single``, it can implicitly convert to ``int; *__bidi_indexable`` which then will have the upper bound pointing to one past; the first element. However, if src has type ``int *__unsafe_indexable``, the; explicit cast ``(int *__bidi_indexable)src`` will cause an error because; ``__unsafe_indexable`` cannot cast to ``__bidi_indexable`` as; ``__unsafe_indexable`` doesn't have bounds information. `Cast rules`_ describes; in more detail what kinds of casts are allowed between pointers with different; bounds annotations. Default pointer types in typedef; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Pointer types in ``typedef``\s do not have implicit default bounds annotations.; Instead, the bounds annotation is determined when the ``typedef`` is used. The; following example shows that no pointer annotation is specified in the ``typedef; pint_t`` while each instance of ``typedef``'ed pointer gets its bounds; annotation based on the context in which the type is used. .. code-block:: c. typedef int * pint_t; // int *. pint_t glob; // int *__single glob;. void foo(void) {; pint_t local; // int *__bidi_indexable local;; }.

On the other hand, LLVM specifies that the `fcmp; instruction <../../LangRef.html#fcmp-instruction>`_ always returns an 'i1' value (a; one bit integer). The problem with this is that Kaleidoscope wants the; value to be a 0.0 or 1.0 value. In order to get these semantics, we; combine the fcmp instruction with a `uitofp; instruction <../../LangRef.html#uitofp-to-instruction>`_. This instruction converts its; input integer into a floating point value by treating the input as an; unsigned value.

A new option SumW2Error() has been added to RooAbsPdf::fitTo() that will; perform an improved error calculation for weighted unbinned likelihood fits. In their unmodified; form, an ML fit to a weighted dataset will correctly estimate the parameters, but the errors will; scale with the sum of the weights, rather than the number of the events in the dataset (i.e.; if you double all event weights, all parameter errors will go down with sqrt(2)). In chi-squared; fits event weights can processed correctly by using both the sum of the weights and the; sum of the weights-squared for each bin.

The document is; subject to be actively updated with a more detailed specification. The; implementation plan can be found in :doc:`BoundsSafetyImplPlans`. Programming Model; =================. Overview; --------. ``-fbounds-safety`` ensures that pointers are not used to access memory beyond; their bounds by performing bounds checking. If a bounds check fails, the program; will deterministically trap before out-of-bounds memory is accessed. In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking. Consider the; example below where the ``__counted_by(count)`` annotation indicates that; parameter ``p`` points to a buffer of integers containing ``count`` elements. An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration. The compiler inserts a; bounds check before ``p`` is dereferenced to ensure that the access remains; within the specified bounds. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, unsigned count) {; // off-by-one error (i < count); for (unsigned i = 0; i <= count; ++i) {; // bounds check inserted:; // if (i >= count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. A bounds annotation defines an invariant for the pointer type, and the model; ensures that this invariant remains true. In the example below, pointer ``p``; annotated with ``__counted_by(count)`` must always point to a memory buffer; containing at least ``count`` elements of the pointee type. Changing the value; of ``count``, like in the example below, may violate this invariant and permit; out-of-bounds access to the pointer. To avoid this, the compiler employs; compile-time restrictions and emits run-time checks as necessary to ensure the; new count v",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:3481,error,error,3481,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['error'],['error']
Availability," individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result. The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed. (In the limit that a; given parameter is uncorrelated with parameter $\mbox{n}$, its error; will not change when parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed.) However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors ###. The M processor $\mbox{MINOS}$ (MnMinos, see [api:minos]) was; probably the first, and may still be the only, generally available; program to calculate parameter errors taking into account both parameter; correlations and non-linearities.

See; the :doc:`TableGen Programmer's Reference <./ProgRef>` for an in-depth; description of TableGen. See :doc:`tblgen - Description to C++ Code; <../CommandGuide/tblgen>` for details on the ``*-tblgen`` commands; that run the various flavors of TableGen. The current major users of TableGen are :doc:`The LLVM Target-Independent; Code Generator <../CodeGenerator>` and the `Clang diagnostics and attributes; <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#controlling-errors-and-warnings>`_. Note that if you work with TableGen frequently and use emacs or vim,; you can find an emacs ""TableGen mode"" and a vim language file in the; ``llvm/utils/emacs`` and ``llvm/utils/vim`` directories of your LLVM; distribution, respectively. .. _intro:. The TableGen program; ====================. TableGen files are interpreted by the TableGen program: `llvm-tblgen` available; on your build directory under `bin`. It is not installed in the system (or where; your sysroot is set to), since it has no use beyond LLVM's build process. Running TableGen; ----------------. TableGen runs just like any other LLVM tool. The first (optional) argument; specifies the file to read. If a filename is not specified, ``llvm-tblgen``; reads from standard input. To be useful, one of the `backends`_ must be used. These backends are; selectable on the command line (type '``llvm-tblgen -help``' for a list). For; example, to get a list of all of the definitions that subclass a particular type; (which can be useful for building up an enum list of these records), use the; ``-print-enums`` option:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-tblgen X86.td -print-enums -class=Register; AH, AL, AX, BH, BL, BP, BPL, BX, CH, CL, CX, DH, DI, DIL, DL, DX, EAX, EBP, EBX,; ECX, EDI, EDX, EFLAGS, EIP, ESI, ESP, FP0, FP1, FP2, FP3, FP4, FP5, FP6, IP,; MM0, MM1, MM2, MM3, MM4, MM5, MM6, M",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/index.rst:1597,avail,available,1597,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/index.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/index.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

We added command line utilities to streamline very common operations performed on root files, like listing their content or creating directories.; The command line utilities are:; - `rootbrowse`: to open the file in a TBrowser; - `rootcp`: to copy content from one file to another; - `rooteventselector`: to select a subset of the events in a tree contained in a file; - `rootls`: to list the content of a rootfile; - `rootmkdir`: to create a directory in a rootfile; - `rootmv`: to move content across files; - `rootprint`: to plot content (histograms, graphs) of files; - `rootrm`: to remove content from files; These utilities took inspiration from the well known *nix commands and all offer the `-h` switch which provides documentation for all options available and example invocation lines. ### TBufferFile.

Detailed information on what and how to install is provided below,; but the recommended (and much easier) way is to use the following command which; performs the required checks automatically and displays useful suggestions too; specific to your platform.; ```sh; cd tools/packaging/; ./cpt.py --check-requirements; ```; or; ```sh; cd tools/packaging/; ./cpt.py -c; ```; Regardless of the platform and operating system, make sure to call the cpt script; with Python 3.; CPT uses some features and modules which are not a part of older versions of Python.; The same holds true for the versions of GCC/Clang you have on your machine. Older; compilers do not support c++11 features and thus you can expect a build error if you; choose not to update them. All pre-compiled binaries of Python ship with built-in support for SSL. However if; the Python on your system was compiled by you manually, chances are that it doesn't; have SSL support. This is very likely if you had performed a minimal installation; of Scientific Linux CERN which doesn't include OpenSSL development package. In such; a case, you should install ```openssl-devel```, re-compile Python and ```configure```; will automatically link against the required libraries and produce a binary with SSL; support. #### Ubuntu/Debian; On Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, CrunchBang, or any other distro based on Debian; which supports APT package manager, you can install all the required packages by:; ```sh; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install git g++ debhelper devscripts gnupg python; ```; You are not required to do this manually since CPT can do this for you automatically. ###### Setting up:; Make sure GnuPG is properly set up",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/tools/packaging/README.md:1818,error,error,1818,interpreter/cling/tools/packaging/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/tools/packaging/README.md,1,['error'],['error']

Often, computing these flags; just means combining the results from the various types and; subexpressions.; * Add ``TransformXXX`` and ``RebuildXXX`` functions to the ``TreeTransform``; class template in ``Sema``. ``TransformXXX`` should (recursively); transform all of the subexpressions and types within your expression,; using ``getDerived().TransformYYY``. If all of the subexpressions and; types transform without error, it will then call the ``RebuildXXX``; function, which will in turn call ``getSema().BuildXXX`` to perform; semantic analysis and build your expression.; * To test template instantiation, take those tests you wrote to make sure; that you were type checking with type-dependent expressions and dependent; types (from step #2) and instantiate those templates with various types,; some of which type-check and some that don't, and test the error messages; in each case. #. There are some ""extras"" that make other features work better. It's worth; handling these extras to give your expression complete integration into; Clang:. * Add code completion support for your expression in; ``SemaCodeComplete.cpp``.; * If your expression has types in it, or has any ""interesting"" features; other than subexpressions, extend libclang's ``CursorVisitor`` to provide; proper visitation for your expression, enabling various IDE features such; as syntax highlighting, cross-referencing, and so on.

Some visible signs that M may have; been fooled are:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of $\mbox{EDM}$ too big. For a ""normal"" minimization,; after $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, the value of $\mbox{EDM}$ is usually; more than three orders of magnitude smaller than $\mbox{up}$,; unless a looser tolerance has been specified. - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).\; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parametrized so that individual errors are not; very meaningful because they are so highly c",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:69045,error,errors,69045,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['error'],['errors']

If everything is OK, the; distribution of the pull values is a standard normal distribution, i.e.; a Gaussian distribution centred around zero with a standard deviation of one. The macro performs a rather big number of toy experiments, where a; histogram is repeatedly filled with Gaussian distributed numbers,; representing the pseudo-data in this example. Each time, a fit is; performed according to the selected method, and the pull is calculated; and filled into a histogram.

However, if; `xmin = xmax`, then they are drawn orthogonal, and if `ymin=ymax` they; are drawn parallel. #### Labels for Exponents. By default, an exponent of the form 10\^N is used when the label values; are either all very small or very large. One can disable the exponent by; calling:. ``` {.cpp}; TAxis::SetNoExponent(kTRUE); ```. Note that this option is implicitly selected if the number of digits to; draw a label is less than the `fgMaxDigits` global member. If the; property `SetNoExponent` was set in **`TAxis`** (via; `TAxis::SetNoExponent)`, the **`TGaxis`** will inherit this property.; **`TGaxis`** is the class responsible for drawing the axis. The method; `SetNoExponent` is also available from the axis context menu. ![Y-axis with and without exponent labels](pictures/030000C7.png). #### Number of Digits in Labels. `TGaxis::fgMaxDigits` is the maximum number of digits permitted for the; axis labels above which the notation with 10\^N is used. It must be; greater than 0. By default `fgMaxDigits` is 5 and to change it use the; `TGaxis::SetMaxDigits` method.

Therefore, the time; spent by the main thread waiting for the data before processing considerably; decreases. Besides the prefetching mechanisms there is also a local; caching option which can be enabled by the user. Both capabilities are; disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by the user. In order to enable the prefetching the user must set the rootrc environment; variable TFile.AsyncPrefetching as follows:; gEnv->SetValue(""TFile.AsyncPrefetching"", 1). Only when the; prefetching is enabled can the user set the local cache directory in; which the file transferred will be saved. For subsequent reads of the; same file the system will use the local copy of the file from cache.; To set up a local cache directory, the client can use the following commands:.

This is equivalent to $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, except that if; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ fails, it reverts to $\mbox{SIMPLEX}$ and then; calls $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ again. ### $\mbox{SCAN}$ ###. This is not intended to minimize, and just scans the function, one; parameter at a time. It does however retain the best value after each; scan, so it does some sort of highly primitive minimization. ### $\mbox{SIMPLEX}$ ###. This genuine multidimensional minimization routine is usually much; slower than $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, but it does not use first derivatives,; so it should not be so sensitive to the precision of the; $\mbox{FCN}$ calculations, and is even rather robust with respect to; gross fluctuations in the function value.

Miscellaneous Problems; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Once you have the basics down, there are a couple of problems that GDB has,; some with solutions, some without. * Inline functions have bogus stack information. In general, GDB does a pretty; good job getting stack traces and stepping through inline functions. When a; pass is dynamically loaded however, it somehow completely loses this; capability. The only solution I know of is to de-inline a function (move it; from the body of a class to a ``.cpp`` file). * Restarting the program breaks breakpoints. After following the information; above, you have succeeded in getting some breakpoints planted in your pass.; Next thing you know, you restart the program (i.e., you type ""``run``"" again),; and you start getting errors about breakpoints being unsettable. The only; way I have found to ""fix"" this problem is to delete the breakpoints that are; already set in your pass, run the program, and re-set the breakpoints once; execution stops in ``PassManager::run``.

This gives an O(10%) performance improvement for some typical RDataFrame scenarios with 256 threads due to reduced lock contention. ## I/O Libraries. - Exclusive use of the global lock is reduced or migrated to finer grained read and write locks in a few hotspots that occur during file opening/closing or task initialization in RDataFrame.

Availability," key adaptation. Notably, we only choose a very small percentage of allocations; to sample, and apply guard pages to these sampled allocations only. The sampling; is small enough to allow us to have very low performance overhead. There is a small, tunable memory overhead that is fixed for the lifetime of the; process. This is approximately ~40KiB per process using the default settings,; depending on the average size of your allocations. GWP-ASan vs. ASan; =================. Unlike `AddressSanitizer <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html>`_,; GWP-ASan does not induce a significant performance overhead. ASan often requires; the use of dedicated canaries to be viable in production environments, and as; such is often impractical. GWP-ASan is only capable of finding a subset of the memory issues detected by; ASan. Furthermore, GWP-ASan's bug detection capabilities are only probabilistic.; As such, we recommend using ASan over GWP-ASan in testing, as well as anywhere; else that guaranteed error detection is more valuable than the 2x execution; slowdown/binary size bloat. For the majority of production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful. Design; ======. **Please note:** The implementation of GWP-ASan is largely in-flux, and these; details are subject to change. There are currently other implementations of; GWP-ASan, such as the implementation featured in; `Chromium <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/gwp_asan/>`_. The; long-term support goal is to ensure feature-parity where reasonable, and to; support compiler-rt as the reference implementation. Allocator Support; -----------------. GWP-ASan is not a replacement for a traditional allocator. Instead, it works by; inserting stubs into a supporting allocator to redirect allocations to GWP-ASan; when they're chosen to be sampled. These stubs are generally implemented in the; implementation of ``malloc()``, ``free()`` and ``realloc()``.

In order to implement your own importer or exporter, you can inherit; from the corresponding base classes `RooFit::JSONIO::Importer`; or `RooFit::JSONIO::Exporter`, respectively. You can find; [simple examples](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/hs3/src/JSONFactories_RooFitCore.cxx); as well as; [more complicated ones](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/hs3/src/JSONFactories_HistFactory.cxx); in `ROOT`. Any importer should take the following form:. ``` {.cpp}; class MyClassFactory : public RooFit::JSONIO::Importer {; public:; bool importFunction(RooJSONFactoryWSTool *tool, const JSONNode &p) const override; {; std::string name(RooJSONFactoryWSTool::name(p));. // check if the required keys are available in the JSON; if (!p.has_child(""<class member key #1>"")) {; RooJSONFactoryWSTool::error(""missing key '<class member key #1>' of '"" + name + ""'"");; }; if (!p.has_child(""<class member key #2>"")) {; RooJSONFactoryWSTool::error(""missing key '<class member key #2>' of '"" + name + ""'"");; }. std::string member1(p[""<class member key #1>""].val());; int member2(p[""<class member key #2>""].val_int());. MyClass theobj(name.c_str(), member1, member2);; tool->wsImport(theobj);; return true;; }; };; ```. If the class you are trying to import inherits from `RooAbsPdf` rather; than from `RooAbsReal`, you should define `importPdf` instead of; `importFunction`, with the same signature. Once your importer implementation exists, you need to register it with the tool using a line like the following:. ``` {.cpp}; RooFit::JSONIO::registerImporter(""<json key>"", new MyClassFactory(), true);; ```. As there can be several importers for the same `json` key, the last; (boolean) argument determines whether your new importer should be; added at the top of the priority list (`true`) or at the bottom; (`fal",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md:5660,error,error,5660,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md,1,['error'],['error']
Availability," large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it. We wondered whether only the *first* load in a basic block could be checked. If; the check works as intended, it forms an invalid pointer that doesn't even; virtual-address translate in the hardware. It should fault very early on in its; processing. Maybe that would stop things in time for the misspeculated path to; fail to leak any secrets. This doesn't end up working because the processor is; fundamentally out-of-order, even in its speculative domain. As a consequence,; the attacker could cause the initial address computation itself to stall and; allow an arbitrary number of unrelated loads (including attacked loads of; secret data) to pass through. #### Interprocedural Checking. Modern x86 processors may speculate into called functions and out of functions; to their return address. As a consequence, we need a way to check loads that; occur after a misspeculated predicate but where the load and the misspeculated; predicate are in different functions.

Explicit method family control; ------------------------------. A method may be annotated with the ``objc_method_family`` attribute to; precisely control which method family it belongs to. If a method in an; ``@implementation`` does not have this attribute, but there is a method; declared in the corresponding ``@interface`` that does, then the attribute is; copied to the declaration in the ``@implementation``. The attribute is; available outside of ARC, and may be tested for with the preprocessor query; ``__has_attribute(objc_method_family)``. The attribute is spelled; ``__attribute__((objc_method_family(`` *family* ``)))``. If *family* is; ``none``, the method has no family, even if it would otherwise be considered to; have one based on its selector and type. Otherwise, *family* must be one of; ``alloc``, ``copy``, ``init``, ``mutableCopy``, or ``new``, in which case the; method is considered to belong to the corresponding family regardless of its; selector.

Although this allows the clang driver to; match gcc easily, it also makes the driver operation much harder to; understand (since the Tools stop seeing some arguments the user; provided, and see new ones instead). For example, on Darwin ``-gfull`` gets translated into two separate; arguments, ``-g`` and ``-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-symbols``. Trying to; write Tool logic to do something with ``-gfull`` will not work, because; Tool argument translation is done after the arguments have been; translated. A long term goal is to remove this tool chain specific translation, and; instead force each tool to change its own logic to do the right thing on; the untranslated original arguments. Unused Argument Warnings; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The driver operates by parsing all arguments but giving Tools the; opportunity to choose which arguments to pass on. One downside of this; infrastructure is that if the user misspells some option, or is confused; about which options to use, some command line arguments the user really; cared about may go unused. This problem is particularly important when; using clang as a compiler, since the clang compiler does not support; anywhere near all the options that gcc does, and we want to make sure; users know which ones are being used. To support this, the driver maintains a bit associated with each; argument of whether it has been used (at all) during the compilation.; This bit usually doesn't need to be set by hand, as the key ArgList; accessors will set it automatically. When a compilation is successful (there are no errors), the driver; checks the bit and emits an ""unused argument"" warning for any arguments; which were never accessed. This is conservative (the argument may not; have been used to do what the user wanted) but still catches the most; obvious cases. Relation to GCC Driver Concepts; -------------------------------.

A DWARF procedure is defined for each well nested structured control flow region; which provides the conceptual lane program location for a lane if it is not; active (namely it is divergent). The DWARF operation expression for each region; conceptually inherits the value of the immediately enclosing region and modifies; it according to the semantics of the region. For an ``IF/THEN/ELSE`` region the divergent program location is at the start of; the region for the ``THEN`` region since it is executed first. For the ``ELSE``; region the divergent program location is at the end of the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``; region since the ``THEN`` region has completed. The lane PC artificial variable is assigned at each region transition.

The Call Frame Information (CFI) already encodes such register saving, so it is; more efficient to provide an operation to return the location of a saved; register than have to generate a loclist to describe the same information. This; is now possible since; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-allow-location-description-on-the-dwarf-evaluation-stack`; allows location descriptions on the stack.

Availability," memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead for the dual mapping). Error Handling; --------------. JITLink makes extensive use of the ``llvm::Error`` type (see the error handling; section of :doc:`ProgrammersManual` for details). The link process itself, all; passes, the memory manager interface, and operations on the ``JITLinkContext``; are all permitted to fail. Link graph construction utilities (especially parsers; for object formats) are encouraged to validate input, and validate fixups; (e.g. with range checks) before application.

If the argument is any of these values; optimization passes may perform transformations as long as they are consistent; with the specified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward.

Availability," motivated by; simplicity and extensibility. Compactness of the representation is; secondary because the runtime is expected to parse the data; immediately after compiling a module and encode the information in its; own format. Since the runtime controls the allocation of sections, it; can reuse the same stack map space for multiple modules. Stackmap support is currently only implemented for 64-bit; platforms. However, a 32-bit implementation should be able to use the; same format with an insignificant amount of wasted space. .. _stackmap-section:. Stack Map Section; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A JIT compiler can easily access this section by providing its own; memory manager via the LLVM C API; ``LLVMCreateSimpleMCJITMemoryManager()``. When creating the memory; manager, the JIT provides a callback:; ``LLVMMemoryManagerAllocateDataSectionCallback()``. When LLVM creates; this section, it invokes the callback and passes the section name. The; JIT can record the in-memory address of the section at this time and; later parse it to recover the stack map data. For MachO (e.g. on Darwin), the stack map section name is; ""__llvm_stackmaps"". The segment name is ""__LLVM_STACKMAPS"". For ELF (e.g. on Linux), the stack map section name is; "".llvm_stackmaps"". The segment name is ""__LLVM_STACKMAPS"". Stack Map Usage; ===============. The stack map support described in this document can be used to; precisely determine the location of values at a specific position in; the code. LLVM does not maintain any mapping between those values and; any higher-level entity. The runtime must be able to interpret the; stack map record given only the ID, offset, and the order of the; locations, records, and functions, which LLVM preserves. Note that this is quite different from the goal of debug information,; which is a best-effort attempt to track the location of named; variables at every instruction. An important motivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution re",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst:16612,recover,recover,16612,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,1,['recover'],['recover']

Availability," new ideas are discovered. Before we get going on ""how"" we add this extension, let's talk about; ""what"" we want. The basic idea is that we want to be able to write this; sort of thing:. ::. def fib(x); if x < 3 then; 1; else; fib(x-1)+fib(x-2);. In Kaleidoscope, every construct is an expression: there are no; statements. As such, the if/then/else expression needs to return a value; like any other. Since we're using a mostly functional form, we'll have; it evaluate its conditional, then return the 'then' or 'else' value; based on how the condition was resolved. This is very similar to the C; ""?:"" expression. The semantics of the if/then/else expression is that it evaluates the; condition to a boolean equality value: 0.0 is considered to be false and; everything else is considered to be true. If the condition is true, the; first subexpression is evaluated and returned, if the condition is; false, the second subexpression is evaluated and returned. Since; Kaleidoscope allows side-effects, this behavior is important to nail; down. Now that we know what we ""want"", let's break this down into its; constituent pieces. Lexer Extensions for If/Then/Else; ---------------------------------. The lexer extensions are straightforward. First we add new enum values; for the relevant tokens:. .. code-block:: c++. // control; tok_if = -6,; tok_then = -7,; tok_else = -8,. Once we have that, we recognize the new keywords in the lexer.

With no special treatment, when the takesNullable is inlined the analyzer will not warn when the obj symbol is dereferenced. One solution for this is to reanalyze takesNullable as a top level function to get possible violations. The alternative method, deducing nullability information from the arguments after inlining is not robust enough (for example there might be more parameters with different nullability, but in the given path the two parameters might end up being the same symbol or there can be nested functions that take different view of the nullability of the same symbol). So the symbol will remain nonnull to avoid false positives but the functions that takes nullable parameters will be analyzed separately as well without inlining. Annotations on multi level pointers; -----------------------------------. Tracking multiple levels of annotations for pointers pointing to pointers would make the checker more complicated, because this way a vector of nullability qualifiers would be needed to be tracked for each symbol. This is not a big caveat, since once the top level pointer is dereferenced, the symvol for the inner pointer will have the nullability information. The lack of multi level annotation tracking only observable, when multiple levels of pointers are passed to a function which has a parameter with multiple levels of annotations. So for now the checker support the top level",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/nullability.rst:4041,robust,robust,4041,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/nullability.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/analyzer/developer-docs/nullability.rst,1,['robust'],['robust']

This allows it to delete recursive chunks of the; program which are unreachable. ``globalopt``: Global Variable Optimizer; ----------------------------------------.

If the trip count of a loop is computable, this pass also makes the following; changes:. * The exit condition for the loop is canonicalized to compare the induction; value against the exit value.

Availability," not want to be bothered by the following considerations, like; in most other linear algebra packages, just set the tolerance with; `SetTol` to an arbitrary small number. The tolerance number is used by; each decomposition method to decide whether the matrix is near singular,; except of course SVD that can handle singular matrices. This will be; checked in a different way for any decomposition. For instance in LU, a; matrix is considered singular in the solving stage when a diagonal; element of the decomposed matrix is smaller than `fTol`. Here an; important point is raised. The `Decompose()` method is successful as; long no zero diagonal element is encountered. Therefore, the user could; perform decomposition and only after this step worry about the tolerance; number. If the matrix is flagged as being singular, operations with the; decomposition will fail and will return matrices or vectors that are; invalid. If one would like to monitor the tolerance parameter but not; have the code stop in case of a number smaller than `fTol`, one could; proceed as follows:. ``` {.cpp}; TVectorD b = ..;; TMatrixD a = ..;; .; TDecompLU lu(a);; Bool_t ok;; TVectorD x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; Int_t nr = 0;; while (!ok) {; lu.SetMatrix(a);; lu.SetTol(0.1*lu.GetTol());; if (nr++ > 10) break;; x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; }; if (x.IsValid()); cout << ""solved with tol ="" << lu.GetTol() << endl;; else; cout << ""solving failed "" << endl;; ```. The observant reader will notice that by scaling the complete matrix by; some small number the decomposition will detect a singular matrix. In; this case, the user will have to reduce the tolerance number by this; factor. (For CPU time saving we decided not to make this an automatic procedure). ### Condition number. The numerical accuracy of the solution `x` in `Ax = b` can be accurately; estimated by calculating the condition number `k` of matrix $A$, which is defined as:. $k = ||A||_{1}||A^{-1}||_{1}$ where $||A||_{1} = \underset{j}{max}(\sum_{i}|A_{ij}|)$.

Several other important APIs are used explicitly. JIT clients need not be aware; of them, but Layer authors will use them:. - *MaterializationUnit* - When XXXLayer::add is invoked it wraps the given; program representation (in this example, C++ source) in a MaterializationUnit,; which is then stored in the JITDylib.

As a consequence, if your C++ classes should only be used through their; interfaces, then no bindings should be provided to the concrete classes; (e.g. by excluding them using a :ref:`selection file <selection-files>`).; Otherwise, more functionality will be available in Python than in C++. Sometimes, however, full control over a cast is needed.; For example, if the instance is bound by another tool or even a 3rd party,; hand-written, extension library.; Assuming the object supports the ``PyCapsule`` or ``CObject`` abstraction,; then a C++-style reinterpret_cast (i.e. without implicitly taking offsets; into account), can be done by taking and rebinding the address of an; object:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy import addressof, bind_object; >>> e = bind_object(addressof(d), Abstract); >>> type(e); <class '__main__.Abstract'>; >>>. `Operators`; -----------.

Availability," object; identifier is unique for one I/O operation. If there is another pointer; to the object in the same I/O operation, the first object is referenced; i.e. it is not saved again. When reading the file, the object is rebuilt; and the references recalculated. ![Streaming object pointers](pictures/020000EC.jpg). In this way, the network of pointers and their objects is rebuilt and; ready to use the same way it was used before it was persistent. If the; pointer hold the address of an object which in embedded in another; object (as opposed to being pointed to by a pointer), the object will be; duplicate at read time. To avoid this, make the pointer a transient data; member. ### Motivation for the TRef Class. If the object is split into several files or into several branches of; one or more `TTrees`, standard C++ pointers cannot be used because each; I/O operation will write the referenced objects, and multiple copies; will exist. In addition, if the pointer is read before the referenced; object, it is null and may cause a run time system error. To address; these limitations, ROOT offers the **`TRef`** class. **`TRef`** allows referencing an object in a different branch and/or in; a different file. **`TRef`** also supports the complex situation where a; **`TFile`** is updated multiple times on the same machine or a different; machine. When a **`TRef`** is read before its referenced object, it is; null. As soon as the referenced object is read, the **`TRef`** points to; it. In addition, one can specify an action to be taken by **`TRef`** in; the case it is read before its reference object (see""Action on Demand""; below). ### Using TRef. A **`TRef`** is a lightweight object pointing to any **`TObject`**. This; object can be used instead of normal C++ pointers in case:. - The referenced object R and the pointer P are not written to the; same file. - P is read before R. - R and P are written to different Tree branches.

VecGeom is a high performance geometry package (link) providing ; SIMD vectorization for the CPU-intensive geometry algorithms used for geometry; navigation. The module creates a new library libConverterVG.so depending on the; VecGeom main library and loaded using the ROOT plug-in mechanism. The main functionality provided by the new vecgeom module is to make a conversion ; in memory of all the shapes in a loaded TGeo geometry into a special adapter; shape TGeoVGShape, redirecting all navigation calls to the corresponding VecGeom ; solid. The library loading and geometry conversion can be done with a single call ; `TVirtualGeoConverter::Instance()->ConvertGeometry()`; . After the conversion is done, all existing TGeo functionality is available as for; a native geometry, only that most of the converted solids provide better navigation ; performance, despite the overhead introduced by the new adapter shape. Prerequisites: installation of VecGeom. ; The installation instructions are available at <http://geant.web.cern.ch/content/installation>; Due to the fact that VecGeom provides for the moment static libraries ; and depends on ROOT, is is advised to compile first ROOT without VecGeom support, ; then compile VecGeom against this ROOT version, then re-configure ROOT to enable ; VecGeom and Vc support, using the flags -Dvc=ON -Dvecgeom=on; ; This has been implemented by Mihaela Gheata <Mihaela.Gheata@cern.ch>. ## Database Libraries. * Fix `TPgSQLStatement::SetBinary` to actually handle binary data (previous limited to ascii). ## Networking Libraries. * When seeing too many requested ranges, Apache 2.4 now simply sends the whole file; (MaxRanges configuration parameter).

The C++ ABI library provides an implementation of the library portion of; the Itanium C++ ABI, covering both the; `support functionality in the main Itanium C++ ABI document; <https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html>`_ and; `Level II of the exception handling support; <https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html#cxx-abi>`_.; References to the functions and objects in this library are implicitly; generated by Clang when compiling C++ code. While it is possible to link C++ code using libstdc++ and code using libc++; together into the same program (so long as you do not attempt to pass C++; standard library objects across the boundary), it is not generally possible; to have more than one C++ ABI library in a program. The version of the C++ ABI library used by Clang will be the one that the; chosen C++ standard library was linked against. Several implementations are; available:. libc++abi (LLVM); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. `libc++abi <https://libcxxabi.llvm.org/>`_ is LLVM's implementation of this; specification. libsupc++ (GNU); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. libsupc++ is GCC's implementation of this specification. However, this; library is only used when libstdc++ is linked statically. The dynamic; library version of libstdc++ contains a copy of libsupc++. .. note::. Clang does not currently automatically link against libsupc++ when statically; linking libstdc++. You may need to manually add ``-lsupc++`` to support this; configuration when using ``-static`` or ``-static-libstdc++``. libcxxrt (PathScale); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

HLSL does not support referring to values by address. Semantically all variables; are value-types and behave as such. HLSL disallows the pointer dereference; operators (unary ``*``, and ``->``), as well as the address of operator (unary; &). While HLSL disallows pointers and references in the syntax, HLSL does use; reference types in the AST, and we intend to use pointer decay in the AST in; the Clang implementation. HLSL ``this`` Keyword; ---------------------. HLSL does support member functions, and (in HLSL 2021) limited operator; overloading. With member function support, HLSL also has a ``this`` keyword. The; ``this`` keyword is an example of one of the places where HLSL relies on; references in the AST, because ``this`` is a reference. Bitshifts; ---------. In deviation from C, HLSL bitshifts are defined to mask the shift count by the; size of the type. In DXC, the semantics of LLVM IR were altered to accommodate; this, in Clang we intend to generate the mask explicitly in the IR. In cases; where the shift value is constant, this will be constant folded appropriately,; in other cases we can clean it up in the DXIL target. Non-short Circuiting Logical Operators; --------------------------------------. In HLSL 2018 and earlier, HLSL supported logical operators (and the ternary; operator) on vector types. This behavior required that operators not short; circuit. The non-short circuiting behavior applies to all data types until HLSL; 2021. In HLSL 2021, logical and ternary operators do not support vector types; instead builtin functions ``and``, ``or`` and ``select`` are available, and; operators short circuit matching C behavior.

Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in the other output.

For example, the ``nightly`` test; explicitly outputs TEST-PASS or TEST-FAIL for every test after each; program. Though these lines are still drowned in the output, it's easy; to grep the output logs in the Output directories. Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``). The; exact contents of the report are dependent on which ``TEST`` you are; running, but the text results are always shown at the end of the run and; the results are always stored in the ``report.<type>.format`` file (when; running with ``TEST=<type>``).

In many cases, this would simply result in creating; unnecessary string copies. Instead, Arg instances are always embedded; inside an ArgList structure, which contains the original vector of; argument strings. Each Arg itself only needs to contain an index into; this vector instead of storing its values directly. The clang driver can dump the results of this stage using the; ``-###`` flag (which must precede any actual command; line arguments).

A slider is a scale with an indicator (slider) that you can drag to; choose a value from a predefined range. It may be oriented horizontally; or vertically. In both cases it provides an excellent indication of; where a value exists within a range of values. ![](pictures/0200021B.jpg). The class **`TGHSlider`** represents the horizontal slider;; **`TGVSlider`** - the vertical one. Both inherit from the base class; **`TGSlider`** that creates the main slider parameters: the range of; values within a value can be selected; the indicator type; the tick mark; scale. Using its methods `SetRange`, `SetPosition` and `SetScale` you; can set these parameters. To retrieve the set slider value you can call; `GetPosition` method. Next sample code creates a horizontal slider `hslider` with a tick mark; of type `kSlider1`. Its width is 150 pixels, and its scale is placed; down (`kScaleDownRight`). The last parameter in the **`TGHSlider`**; constructor is the slider ID. It will be used for event processing. The; methods `SetRange` and `SetPosition` set the range and the current tick; mark position of the slider. ``` {.cpp}; hslider = new TGHSlider(parent,150,kSlider1|kScaleDownRight,sID);; hslider->SetRange(0,50);; hslider->SetPosition(39);; ```. Slider values can be set by using the mouse to drag the slider across; the scale until the desired value is reached. Another way is to click in; the slider trough instead of dragging. #### Double Slider. Double slider widgets allow easy selection of a min and a max value out; of a range. They can be either horizontal or vertical oriented. There is; a choice of different types of tick marks: `kDoubleScaleNo`,; `kScaleDownRight`, `kDoubleScaleBoth`.

Instead, Clang now uses a strict; order that still attempts to push more relevant functions to the top by comparing their; corresponding conversions. In some cases, this results in better order. E.g., for the; following code. .. code-block:: cpp. struct Foo {; operator int();; operator const char*();; };. void test() { Foo() - Foo(); }. Clang now produces a list with two most relevant builtin operators at the top,; i.e. ``operator-(int, int)`` and ``operator-(const char*, const char*)``.; Previously ``operator-(const char*, const char*)`` was the first element,; but ``operator-(int, int)`` was only the 13th element in the output.; However, new implementation does not take into account some aspects of; C++ semantics, e.g. which function template is more specialized.

This attribute; works similar to ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""address"")))``, but it also; prevents instrumentation performed by other sanitizers. Suppressing Errors in Recompiled Code (Ignorelist); --------------------------------------------------. AddressSanitizer supports ``src`` and ``fun`` entity types in; :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`, that can be used to suppress error reports; in the specified source files or functions. Additionally, AddressSanitizer; introduces ``global`` and ``type`` entity types that can be used to; suppress error reports for out-of-bound access to globals with certain; names and types (you may only specify class or struct types). You may use an ``init`` category to suppress reports about initialization-order; problems happening in certain source files or with certain global variables. .. code-block:: bash. # Suppress error reports for code in a file or in a function:; src:bad_file.cpp; # Ignore all functions with names containing MyFooBar:; fun:*MyFooBar*; # Disable out-of-bound checks for global:; global:bad_array; # Disable out-of-bound checks for global instances of a given class ...; type:Namespace::BadClassName; # ... or a given struct.

Availability," out of; scope. ``` {.cpp}; void foo() {; TFile f(""AFile.root"",""RECREATE"");; }; ```. As soon as the function `foo `has finished executing, the variable `f`; is deleted. When a **`TFile`** object is deleted an implicit call to; `TFile::Close` is made. This will save only the file descriptor to disk.; It contains the file header, the `StreamerInfo `list, the key list, the; free segment list, and the end address. See ""The Physical Layout of ROOT; Files"". The `TFile::Close` does not make a call to `Write()`, which; means that the objects in memory will not be saved in the file. You need; to explicitly call `TFile::Write()` to save the object in memory to file; before the exit of the function. ``` {.cpp}; void foo() {; TFile f(""AFile.root"",""RECREATE"");; ... stuff ...; f.Write();; }; ```. To prevent an object in a function from being deleted when it goes out; of scope, you can create it on the heap instead of on the stack. This; will create a **`TFile`** object `f`, that is available on a global; scope, and it will still be available when exiting the function. ``` {.cpp}; void foo() {; TFile *f = new TFile(""AFile.root"",""RECREATE"");; }; ```. ### Retrieving Objects from Disk. If you have a ROOT session running, please quit and start fresh. We saw that multiple versions of an object with the same name could be; in a ROOT file. In our example, we saved a modified histogram `hpx` to; the file, which resulted in two `hpx's` uniquely identified by the cycle; number: `hpx;1` and `hpx;2`. The question is how we can retrieve the; right version of `hpx`. When opening the file and using `hpx`, Cling; retrieves the one with the highest cycle number. To read the `hpx;1`; into memory, rather than the `hpx:2` we would get by default, we have to; explicitly get it and assign it to a variable. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile *f1 = new TFile(""hsimple.root""); root[] TH1F *hpx1; f1->GetObject(""hpx;1"",hpx); root[] hpx1->Draw(); ```. ### Subdirectories and Navigation.

When RooFit performs binned fits, it takes the probability density at the bin centre as a proxy for the probability in the bin. This can lead to a bias.; To alleviate this, the new class [RooBinSamplingPdf](https://root.cern/doc/v624/classRooBinSamplingPdf.html) has been added to RooFit.; Also see [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### More accurate residual and pull distributions. When making residual or pull distributions with `RooPlot::residHist` or `RooPlot::pullHist`, the histogram is now compared with the curve's average values within a given bin by default, ensuring that residual and pull distributions are valid for strongly curved distributions.; The old default behaviour was to interpolate the curve at the bin centres, which can still be enabled by setting the `useAverage` parameter of `RooPlot::residHist` or `RooPlot::pullHist` to `false`. ### Improved recovery from invalid parameters. When a function in RooFit is undefined (Poisson with negative mean, PDF with negative values, etc), RooFit can now pass information about the; ""badness"" of the violation to the minimiser. The minimiser can use this to compute a gradient to find its way out of the undefined region.; This can drastically improve its ability to recover when unstable fit models are used, for example RooPolynomial. For details, see the RooFit tutorial [rf612_recoverFromInvalidParameters.C](https://root.cern/doc/v624/rf612__recoverFromInvalidParameters_8C.html); and [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### Modernised RooDataHist. RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated.

That is, from the error matrix alone,; two-standard-deviation errors are always exactly twice as big as; one-standard-deviation errors. When the error matrix has been calculated (for example by the successful; execution of $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (MnMigrad::operator(), see; [api:migradop]) or HESSE (MnHesse::operator())) then the parameter; errors printed by M are the square roots of the diagonal elements of; this matrix. The covariance or the correlations can be printed and shown; via std::cout as the ostream operator operator$<<$ is overloaded. The; eigenvalues of the error matrix can be calculated using MnEigen, which; should all be positive if the matrix is positive-definite (see below on; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ and positive-definiteness). The effect of correlations on the individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result. The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed. (In the limit that a; given parameter is uncorrelated with parameter $\mbox{n}$, its error; will not change when parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed.) However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors ###.

Availability," parser know what object type to pass in to the parse method. (Here we declare; that we parse into '``unsigned``' variables.). For most purposes, the only method that must be implemented in a custom parser; is the ``parse`` method. The ``parse`` method is called whenever the option is; invoked, passing in the option itself, the option name, the string to parse, and; a reference to a return value. If the string to parse is not well-formed, the; parser should output an error message and return true. Otherwise it should; return false and set '``Val``' to the parsed value. In our example, we; implement ``parse`` as:. .. code-block:: c++. bool FileSizeParser::parse(cl::Option &O, StringRef ArgName,; const std::string &Arg, unsigned &Val) {; const char *ArgStart = Arg.c_str();; char *End;. // Parse integer part, leaving 'End' pointing to the first non-integer char; Val = (unsigned)strtol(ArgStart, &End, 0);. while (1) {; switch (*End++) {; case 0: return false; // No error; case 'i': // Ignore the 'i' in KiB if people use that; case 'b': case 'B': // Ignore B suffix; break;. case 'g': case 'G': Val *= 1024*1024*1024; break;; case 'm': case 'M': Val *= 1024*1024; break;; case 'k': case 'K': Val *= 1024; break;. default:; // Print an error message if unrecognized character!; return O.error(""'"" + Arg + ""' value invalid for file size argument!"");; }; }; }. This function implements a very simple parser for the kinds of strings we are; interested in. Although it has some holes (it allows ""``123KKK``"" for example),; it is good enough for this example. Note that we use the option itself to print; out the error message (the ``error`` method always returns true) in order to get; a nice error message (shown below). Now that we have our parser class, we can; use it like this:. .. code-block:: c++. static cl::opt<unsigned, false, FileSizeParser>; MFS(""max-file-size"", cl::desc(""Maximum file size to accept""),; cl::value_desc(""size""));.

When the object goes; out of scope on the C++ side, the Python object will change type; into an object that largely behaves like None. The strict policy differs in that it will never relinquish ownership; when passing an object as a parameter to a function. It is then up to; the developer to prevent double deletes. Choosing one or the other; policy is done by:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT.SetMemoryPolicy( ROOT.kMemoryStrict ); ```. for the strict policy, or for the heuristic policy:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT.SetMemoryPolicy( ROOT.kMemoryHeuristics ); ```. Care must be taken in the case of graphic objects: when drawn on the; current pad, a reference to the graphics is kept that `PyROOT` isn't; currently aware of, and it is up to the developer to keep at lease one; Python reference alive.

Alternatively, one can; tell python to give up ownership for individual instances:. ``` {.cpp}; o = ROOT.TObject(); ROOT.SetOwnership( o, False ) # True to own, False to release; ```. #### Memory Management by Hand. If needed, you can explicitly destroy a ROOT object that you own through; its associated **`TClass`**:. ``` {.cpp}; myobject.IsA().Destructor(myobject); ```. which will send out the deletion notification to the system (thus you do; not need to care anymore at this point about Python reference counting,; the object will go, even if it's reference count it non-zero), and free; the memory. ### Performance.

Availability," paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or` with an all-ones mask,; making the x86 instruction sequence look like the following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; movl (%rsi), %edi # Load potentially secret data from %rsi.; orl %eax, %edi; ```. Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases. However, we generally; expect to fall back when unprofitable from hardening the loaded value to the; next approach of hardening the address itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:24211,mask,mask,24211,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['mask'],['mask']

We cache the errors associated with declarations in the ""from"" context in; ``ASTImporter::ImportDeclErrors`` and the ones which are associated with the; ""to"" context in ``ASTImporterSharedState::ImportErrors``. Note that, there may; be several ASTImporter objects which import into the same ""to"" context but from; different ""from"" contexts; in this case, they have to share the associated; errors of the ""to"" context. When an error happens, that propagates through the call stack, through all the; dependant nodes. However, in case of dependency cycles, this is not enough,; because we strive to mark the erroneous nodes so clients can act upon. In those; cases, we have to keep track of the errors for those nodes which are; intermediate nodes of a cycle. An **import path** is the list of the AST nodes which we visit during an Import; call. If node ``A`` depends on node ``B`` then the path contains an ``A->B``; edge. From the call stack of the import functions, we can read the very same; path. Now imagine the following AST, where the ``->`` represents dependency in terms; of the import (all nodes are declarations). .. code-block:: text. A->B->C->D; `->E. We would like to import A.; The import behaves like a DFS, so we will visit the nodes in this order: ABCDE.; During the visitation we will have the following import paths:. .. code-block:: text. A; AB; ABC; ABCD; ABC; AB; ABE; AB; A. If during the visit of E there is an error then we set an error for E, then as; the call stack shrinks for B, then for A:. .. code-block:: text.

Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on.

Availability," reference in the object graph. **Ignoring** them would badly violate user expectations about their code.; While it *would* make it easier to develop code simultaneously for ARC and; non-ARC, there is very little reason to do so except for certain library; developers. ARC and non-ARC translation units share an execution model and; can seamlessly interoperate. Within a translation unit, a developer who; faithfully maintains their code in non-ARC mode is suffering all the; restrictions of ARC for zero benefit, while a developer who isn't testing the; non-ARC mode is likely to be unpleasantly surprised if they try to go back to; it. **Banning** them has the disadvantage of making it very awkward to migrate; existing code to ARC. The best answer to that, given a number of other; changes and restrictions in ARC, is to provide a specialized tool to assist; users in that migration. Implementing these methods was banned because they are too integral to the; semantics of ARC; many tricks which worked tolerably under manual reference; counting will misbehave if ARC performs an ephemeral extra retain or two.

Availability," refuse to refactor code that mixes borrowed pointer values; and unique ownership. In the following code, `GetPtr()` returns a borrowed; pointer, which is assigned to `pi`. Then, `pi` is used to hold a uniquely-owned; pointer. We don't distinguish between these two assignments, and we want each; assignment to be paired with a corresponding sink; otherwise, we transition the; pointer to a `Conflicting` state, like in this example. ```c++; void ConflictingOwnership() {; int *pi; // pi is Compatible; pi = GetPtr(); // pi is Defined; Borrow(pi); // pi is Defined. pi = new int; // pi is Conflicting; Borrow(pi);; delete pi;; // pi is Conflicting; }; ```. We could still handle this case by finding a maximal range in the code where; `pi` could be in the Compatible state, and only refactoring that part. ```c++; void ConflictingOwnership() {; int *pi;; pi = GetPtr();; Borrow(pi);. std::unique_ptr<int> pi_unique = std::make_unique<int>();; Borrow(pi_unique.get());; }; ```. ## Example: finding redundant branch conditions. In the code below `b1` should not be checked in both the outer and inner ""if""; statements. It is likely there is a bug in this code. ```c++; int F(bool b1, bool b2) {; if (b1) {; f();; if (b1 && b2) { // Check `b1` again -- unnecessary!; g();; }; }; }; ```. A checker that finds this pattern syntactically is already implemented in; ClangTidy using AST matchers (`bugprone-redundant-branch-condition`). To implement it using the data flow analysis framework, we can produce a warning; if any part of the branch condition is implied by the flow condition. ```c++; int F(bool b1, bool b2) {; // Flow condition: true.; if (b1) {; // Flow condition: b1.; f();; if (b1 && b2) { // `b1` is implied by the flow condition.; g();; }; }; }; ```. One way to check this implication is to use a SAT solver. Without a SAT solver,; we could keep the flow condition in the CNF form and then it would be easy to; check the implication. ## Example: finding unchecked `std::optional` unwraps.

Availability," several tools to analyze the parameter errors. ### $\mbox{FCN}$ normalization and the error definition ###. Whatever method is used to calculate the parameter errors, they will; depend on the overall (multiplicative) normalization of; $\mbox{FCN}$, in the sense that if the value of $\mbox{FCN}$ is; everywhere multiplied by a constant $\beta$, then the errors will be; decreased by a factor $\sqrt{\beta}$. Additive constants do not change; the parameter errors, but may imply a different goodness-of-fit; confidence level. Assuming that the user knows what the normalization of their; $\mbox{FCN}$ means, and also that they are interested in parameter; errors, the user can change the error definition which allows them to; define what they means by one ""error"", in terms of the change in the; $\mbox{FCN}$ value which should be caused by changing one parameter; by one ""error"". If the $\mbox{FCN}$ is the usual chisquare function; (defined below) and if the user wants the usual one-standard-deviation; errors, then the error definition (return value of the FCNBase::up(); method, see [howto:errordef]) should be $1.0$. If the $\mbox{FCN}$; is a negative-log-likelihood function, then the one-standard-deviation; value for FCNBase::up() to return is $0.5$. If the $\mbox{FCN}$ is a; chisquare, but the user wants two-standard-deviation errors, then; FCNBase::up() should return $= 4.0$, etc. Note that in the usual case where M is being used to perform a fit to; some experimental data, the parameter errors will be proportional to the; uncertainty in the data, and therefore meaningful parameter errors; cannot be obtained unless the measurement errors of the data are known.; In the common case of a least-squares fit, $\mbox{FCN}$ is usually; defined as a chisquare:. $$\chi^2 (\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\frac{f(x_i,\alpha) - m_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}$$. where $\alpha$ is the vector of free parameters being fitted, and the; $\sigma_i$ are the uncertainties in the individual measurements $m_i$.; If",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:13925,error,errors,13925,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,3,['error'],"['error', 'errordef', 'errors']"

Since it is an extension module, the usage of `PyROOT` probably comes; naturally if you're used to Python. In general, `PyROOT` attempts to; allow working in both Python and ROOT style, and although it is; succeeding, it isn't perfect: there are edges. The following sections; explain in some detail what you can expect, and what you need to watch; out for. #### Access to ROOT Classes. Before a ROOT class can be used from Python, its dictionary needs to be; loaded into the current process. Starting with ROOT version 4.00/06,; this happens automatically for all classes that are declared to the; auto-loading mechanism through so-called `rootmap` files. Effectively,; this means that all classes in the ROOT distributions are directly; available for import. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TCanvas # available at startup; c = TCanvas(). from ROOT import TLorentzVector # triggers auto-load of libPhysics; l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Although it is not recommended, a simple way of working with `PyROOT` is; doing a global import:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import *. c = TCanvas(); l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Keeping the ROOT namespace (""`import ROOT`""), or only importing from; ROOT those classes that you will actually use (see above), however, will; always be cleaner and clearer:. ``` {.cpp}; import ROOT. c = ROOT.TCanvas(); l = ROOT.TLorentzVector(); ```. Since it is foreseen that most people will use the simple approach; anyway, the request to copy all from module ROOT will not actually; result in copying all ROOT classes into the current namespace. Instead,; classes will still be bound (and possibly loaded) on an as-needed basis.; Note carefully how this is different from other Python (extension); modules, and what to expect if you use the normal inspection tools (such; as e.g. '`dir()`').

We prefer for this to be handled before submission but understand that it isn't; possible to test all of this for every submission. Our build bots and nightly; testing infrastructure normally finds these problems. A good rule of thumb is; to check the nightly testers for regressions the day after your change. Build; bots will directly email you if a group of commits that included yours caused a; failure.

(Only the; relative errors of different parameters with respect to each other may; be meaningful.). If the $\sigma_i$ are all overestimated by a factor $\beta$, then the; resulting parameter errors from the fit will be overestimated by the; same factor $\beta$. ### The error matrix ###.

Therefore, errors based on; the M error matrix take account of all the parameter correlations, but; not the non-linearities. That is, from the error matrix alone,; two-standard-deviation errors are always exactly twice as big as; one-standard-deviation errors. When the error matrix has been calculated (for example by the successful; execution of $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (MnMigrad::operator(), see; [api:migradop]) or HESSE (MnHesse::operator())) then the parameter; errors printed by M are the square roots of the diagonal elements of; this matrix.

For example, the picture buttons below can be used to provide; different styles of a histogram drawing. ![](pictures/0200020F.jpg). Here is the example how to create the first button:. ``` {.cpp}; TGPictureButton *fPicture = new TGPictureButton(parent,; gClient->GetPicture(""h1_s.xpm""), 11);; ```. The picture of file h1\_s.xpm is used in the button. All `.xpm` files; are located in the directory `$ROOTSYS/icons`. You can assign a command; directly as a parameter of the picture button constructor. The picture; of **`TGPictureButton`** can be changed by:. ``` {.cpp}; fPicture->SetPicture(""h2_s.xpm"");; ```. The advantage of command buttons is that they are always visible,; providing a reminder of their existence. They can be inscribed with a; meaningful description of what they do by; `TGToolTip(""Some describing text"").` Their activation is much easier and; faster than using a two-step menu bar/pull-down sequence. The only; disadvantage of the text and picture buttons is that they consume; considerable screen space if they are many.

We removed all hard dependencies of TFileMerger on TH1 and TTree.; (Soft dependencies still exist to be able to disable the; merging of TTrees and to be able to disable the AutoAdd; behavior of TH1).

This routine follows the same style as the other routines. (It expects; to be called if the current token is a ``tok_identifier`` token). It; also has recursion and error handling. One interesting aspect of this is; that it uses *look-ahead* to determine if the current identifier is a; stand alone variable reference or if it is a function call expression.; It handles this by checking to see if the token after the identifier is; a '(' token, constructing either a ``VariableExprAST`` or; ``CallExprAST`` node as appropriate. Now that we have all of our simple expression-parsing logic in place, we; can define a helper function to wrap it together into one entry point.; We call this class of expressions ""primary"" expressions, for reasons; that will become more clear `later in the; tutorial <LangImpl06.html#user-defined-unary-operators>`_.

Availability," sites of the candidate function must; satisfy, for example, that function arguments do not alias, that users are not; taking the address of the function, and so on. Let's consider verifying usage; site conditions to be a separate static analysis problem. ### Lattice design. To analyze the function body we can use a lattice which consists of normal; states and failure states. A normal state describes program points where we are; sure that no behaviors that block the refactoring have occurred. Normal states; keep track of all parameter's member fields that are known to be overwritten on; every path from function entry to the corresponding program point. Failure; states accumulate observed violations (unsafe reads and pointer escapes) that; block the refactoring. In the partial order of the lattice failure states compare greater than normal; states, which guarantees that they ""win"" when joined with normal states. Order; between failure states is determined by inclusion relation on the set of; accumulated violations (lattice's `⩽` is `⊆` on the set of violations). Order; between normal states is determined by reversed inclusion relation on the set of; overwritten parameter's member fields (lattice's `⩽` is `⊇` on the set of; overwritten fields). ![Lattice for data flow analysis that identifies output parameters](DataFlowAnalysisIntroImages/OutputParameterIdentificationLattice.svg). To determine whether a statement reads or writes a field we can implement; symbolic evaluation of `DeclRefExpr`s, `LValueToRValue` casts, pointer; dereference operator and `MemberExpr`s. ### Using data flow results to identify output parameters. Let's take a look at how we use data flow analysis to identify an output; parameter. The refactoring can be safely done when the data flow algorithm; computes a normal state with all of the fields proven to be overwritten in the; exit basic block of the function. ```c++; struct Customer {; int account_id;; std::string name;; };. void GetCustomer(Custo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:17552,failure,failure,17552,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['failure'],['failure']

The flag cross; can be used in case the step is made on a boundary and specifies if user; wants to cross or not the boundary. The returned node represents the new; current node after the step was made. - Making a geometrically contained step with boundary crossing; (`is_geom=kTRUE`, `cross=kTRUE`) - This is the default method; behavior. In this case, the step size is supposed to be already set; by a previous TGeoManager::FindNextBoundary() call. Due to; floating-point boundary uncertainties, making a step corresponding; ""exactly"" to the distance to next boundary does not insure boundary; crossing. If the method is called with this purpose, an extra small; step will be made in order to make the crossing the most probable; event (`epsil=10-6cm`). Even with this extra small step cannot; insure 100% boundary crossing for specific crossed shapes at big; incident angles. After such a step is made, additional cross-checks; become available:. ~~~{.cpp}; gGeoManager->FindNextBoundary(pstep);; Double_t snext = gGeoManager->GetStep();; // The geometrical step is taken; TGeoNode *newNode = gGeoManager->Step();; // The step=snext+epsil is made; Bool_t hasCrossed = gGeoManager->IsEntering();; // Is the boundary crossed or not?; Bool_t isOnBoundary = gGeoManager->IsOnBoundary(); // The proposed; // geometrically limited step to be made was smaller; // than epsil value.; Bool_t isOutside = gGeoManager->IsOutside();; //Did we exit geometry ?; ~~~. In case the desired end-point of the step should be in the same starting; volume, the input flag `cross` should be set to `kFALSE`. In this case,; the `epsil` value will be subtracted from the current step. - Making a step of arbitrary value (`is_geom=kFALSE`, `cross=`no; matter).

Availability," stores needs to be aware of it. From the optimizer's point of view, the rule is that if there are not any; instructions with atomic ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }. The following is equivalent in non-concurrent situations:. .. code-block:: c. int x;; void f(int* a) {; int xtemp = x;; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); xtemp += 1;; }; x = xtemp;; }. However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other; memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store.

Important performance indicators are; **IPC**, **uOps Per Cycle**, and **Block RThroughput** (Block Reciprocal; Throughput). Field *DispatchWidth* is the maximum number of micro opcodes that are dispatched; to the out-of-order backend every simulated cycle. For processors with an; in-order backend, *DispatchWidth* is the maximum number of micro opcodes issued; to the backend every simulated cycle. IPC is computed dividing the total number of simulated instructions by the total; number of cycles. Field *Block RThroughput* is the reciprocal of the block throughput. Block; throughput is a theoretical quantity computed as the maximum number of blocks; (i.e. iterations) that can be executed per simulated clock cycle in the absence; of loop carried dependencies. Block throughput is superiorly limited by the; dispatch rate, and the availability of hardware resources. In the absence of loop-carried data dependencies, the observed IPC tends to a; theoretical maximum which can be computed by dividing the number of instructions; of a single iteration by the `Block RThroughput`. Field 'uOps Per Cycle' is computed dividing the total number of simulated micro; opcodes by the total number of cycles. A delta between Dispatch Width and this; field is an indicator of a performance issue. In the absence of loop-carried; data dependencies, the observed 'uOps Per Cycle' should tend to a theoretical; maximum throughput which can be computed by dividing the number of uOps of a; single iteration by the `Block RThroughput`. Field *uOps Per Cycle* is bounded from above by the dispatch width. That is; because the dispatch width limits the maximum size of a dispatch group. Both IPC; and 'uOps Per Cycle' are limited by the amount of hardware parallelism.

Availability," talk about; ""what"" we want. The basic idea is that we want to be able to write this; sort of thing:. ::. def fib(x); if x < 3 then; 1; else; fib(x-1)+fib(x-2);. In Kaleidoscope, every construct is an expression: there are no; statements. As such, the if/then/else expression needs to return a value; like any other. Since we're using a mostly functional form, we'll have; it evaluate its conditional, then return the 'then' or 'else' value; based on how the condition was resolved. This is very similar to the C; ""?:"" expression. The semantics of the if/then/else expression is that it evaluates the; condition to a boolean equality value: 0.0 is considered to be false and; everything else is considered to be true. If the condition is true, the; first subexpression is evaluated and returned, if the condition is; false, the second subexpression is evaluated and returned. Since; Kaleidoscope allows side-effects, this behavior is important to nail; down. Now that we know what we ""want"", let's break this down into its; constituent pieces.

For example, consider the following code:. inline int add(int i, int j) { return i + j; }. int main() {; int i = add(4, 5);; return i;; }. In C99, inline means that a function's definition is; provided only for inlining, and that there is another definition; (without inline) somewhere else in the program.

Note that the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler does not support this option, and; if code in a DLL is compiled with ``/Zc:dllexportInlines-``, the code using the; DLL must be compiled in the same way so that it doesn't attempt to dllimport; the inline member functions. The reverse scenario should generally work though:; a DLL compiled without this flag (such as a system library compiled with Visual; C++) can be referenced from code compiled using the flag, meaning that the; referencing code will use the inline definitions instead of importing them from; the DLL. Also note that like when using ``-fvisibility-inlines-hidden``, the address of; `S::foo()` will be different inside and outside the DLL, breaking the C/C++; standard requirement that functions have a unique address. The flag does not apply to explicit class template instantiation definitions or; declarations, as those are typically used to explicitly provide a single; definition in a DLL, (dllexported instantiation definition) or to signal that; the definition is available elsewhere (dllimport instantiation declaration). It; also doesn't apply to inline members with static local variables, to ensure; that the same instance of the variable is used inside and outside the DLL. Using this flag can cause problems when inline functions that would otherwise; be dllexported refer to internal symbols of a DLL. For example:. .. code-block:: c. void internal();. struct __declspec(dllimport) S {; void foo() { internal(); }; }. Normally, references to `S::foo()` would use the definition in the DLL from; which it was exported, and which presumably also has the definition of; `internal()`. However, when using ``/Zc:dllexportInlines-``, the inline; definition of `S::foo()` is used directly, resulting in a link error since; `internal()` is not available.

Extract logic into a separate file** Implement what your class is; supposed to do as a free function in [MathFuncs].; This implementation must be compatible with the syntax supported by Clad. **2. Refactor evaluate():** Refactor the existing `RooAbsReal::evaluate()`; function to use the `MathFuncs.h` implementation. This is optional, but; can reduce code duplication and potential for bugs. This may require some; effort if an extensive caching infrastructure is used in your model. **3. Add translate():** RooFit classes are extended using a (typically) simple; `translate()` function that extracts the mathematically differentiable; properties out of the RooFit classes that make up the statistical model. The `translate()` function helps implement the Code Squashing logic that is; used to optimize numerical evaluations. It accomplishes this by using a small; subset of helper functions that are available in the; `RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext` and `RooFuncWrapper` classes; (see Appendix B). It converts a RooFit expression into a form that can be; efficiently evaluated by Clad. The `translate()` function returns an `std::string` representing the; underlying mathematical notation of the class as code, that can later be; concatenated into a single string representing the entire model. This string; of code is then just-in-time compiled by Cling (a C++ interpreter for Root). **4. analyticalIntegral() Use Case:** If your class includes (or should; include) the `analyticalIntegral()` function, then a simple; `buildCallToAnalyticIntegral()` function needs to be created to help call the; `analyticalIntegral()` function. # Example for adding Code Generation support to RooFit classes.

Availability," the effects of parameter limits may be found in; the last chapter. ## M strategy ##. At many places in the analysis of the $\mbox{FCN}$ (the user; provided function), M must decide whether to be ""safe"" and waste a few; function calls in order to know where it is, or to be ""fast"" and attempt; to get the requested results with the fewest possible calls at a certain; risk of not obtaining the precision desired by the user. In order to; allow the user to influence these decisions, there is a M class; MnStrategy (see [api:strategy]) which the user can use to put different; settings. In the current release, this MnStrategy can be instantiated; with three different minimization quality levels for low (0), medium (1); and high (2) quality. Default settings for iteration cycles and; tolerances are initialized then. The default setting is set for medium; quality. Value 0 (low) indicates to M that it should economize function; calls; it is intended for cases where there are many variable parameters; and/or the function takes a long time to calculate and/or the user is; not interested in very precise values for parameter errors. On the other; hand, value 2 (high) indicates that M is allowed to waste function calls; in order to be sure that all values are precise; it is intended for; cases where the function is evaluated in a relatively short time and/or; where the parameter errors must be calculated reliably. In addition all; constants set in MnStrategy can be changed individually by the user,; e.g. the number of iteration cycles in the numerical gradient. ## Parameter errors ##. M is usually used to find the ""best"" values of a set of parameters,; where ""best"" is defined as those values which minimize a given function,; $\mbox{FCN}$. The width of the function minimum, or more generally,; the shape of the function in some neighbourhood of the minimum, gives; information about the *uncertainty* in the best parameter values, often; called by physicists the *parameter errors*.

Availability," the errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that; `Minuit` has been fooled. Some visible signs that `Minuit` may have; been fooled:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error; analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of EDM too big (estimated Distance to Minimum). - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parameterized so that individual errors are; not very meaningful because they are so highly correlated. - Parameter at limit. This condition, signaled by a `Minuit` warning; message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors; unreliable. See the discussion above ‘Getting the right parameter; errors with limits'. The best way to be absolutely sure of the errors is to use; ''independent'' calculations and compare them, or compare the; calculated errors with a picture of the function. Theoretically, the; covariance matrix for a ''physical'' function must be; positive-definite at the minimum, although it may not be so for all; points far away from the minimum, even for a well-determined physical; problem. Therefore, if `MIGRAD` reports that it has found a; non-positive-definite covariance matrix, this may be a sign of one or; more of the following:. #### A Non-physical Region. On its way to the minimum, `MIGRAD` may have traversed a region that; has unphysical behavior, which is of course not a serious problem as; long as it recovers and leaves such a region. #### An Underdetermined Problem. If the matrix is not positive-definite even at the minimum, this may; mean that the solution is not well defined, for example that there are; more unknowns than there are data points, or that the parameterization; of the fit contains a linear dependence.

To; export this information, every DSO implements. .. code-block:: none. void __cfi_check(uint64 CallSiteTypeId, void *TargetAddr, void *DiagData).

For each known ``CallSiteTypeId``, this; function performs an ``llvm.type.test`` with the corresponding type; identifier. It reports an error if the type is unknown, or if the; check fails. Depending on the values of compiler flags; ``-fsanitize-trap`` and ``-fsanitize-recover``, this function may; print an error, abort and/or return to the caller. ``DiagData`` is an; opaque pointer to the diagnostic information about the error, or; ``null`` if the caller does not provide this information.

Availability," the most commonly used way to specify expected; diagnostics:. .. code-block:: c++. int A = B; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}. You can place as many diagnostics on one line as you wish. To make the code; more readable, you can use slash-newline to separate out the diagnostics. Alternatively, it is possible to specify the line on which the diagnostic; should appear by appending ``@<line>`` to ``expected-<type>``, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. #warning some text; // expected-warning@10 {{some text}}. The line number may be absolute (as above), or relative to the current line by; prefixing the number with either ``+`` or ``-``. If the diagnostic is generated in a separate file, for example in a shared; header file, it may be beneficial to be able to declare the file in which the; diagnostic will appear, rather than placing the ``expected-*`` directive in the; actual file itself. This can be done using the following syntax:. .. code-block:: c++. // expected-error@path/include.h:15 {{error message}}. The path can be absolute or relative and the same search paths will be used as; for ``#include`` directives. The line number in an external file may be; substituted with ``*`` meaning that any line number will match (useful where; the included file is, for example, a system header where the actual line number; may change and is not critical). As an alternative to specifying a fixed line number, the location of a; diagnostic can instead be indicated by a marker of the form ``#<marker>``.; Markers are specified by including them in a comment, and then referenced by; appending the marker to the diagnostic with ``@#<marker>``, as with:. .. code-block:: c++. #warning some text // #1; // ... other code ...; // expected-warning@#1 {{some text}}. The name of a marker used in a directive must be unique within the compilation. The simple syntax above allows each specification to match exactly one; diagnostic.

And the same could be true for the import of ``B``; (``A`` is requested to be imported before we could create the node for ``B``).; In case of the :ref:`templated-described swing <templated>` we take; extra attention to break the cyclical dependency: we import and set the; described template only after the ``CXXRecordDecl`` is created. As a best; practice, before creating the node in the ""to"" context, avoid importing of; other nodes which are not needed for the constructor of node ``A``. Error Handling; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every import function returns with either an ``llvm::Error`` or an; ``llvm::Expected<T>`` object. This enforces to check the return value of the; import functions. If there was an error during one import then we return with; that error. (Exception: when we import the members of a class, we collect the; individual errors with each member and we concatenate them in one Error; object.) We cache these errors in cases of declarations. During the next import; call if there is an existing error we just return with that. So, clients of the; library receive an Error object, which they must check. During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we recognize an error. In this case, we signal back; the error to the caller, but the ""to"" context remains polluted with those nodes; which had been created. Ideally, those nodes should not had been created, but; that time we did not know about the error, the error happened later. Since the; AST is immutable (most of the cases we can't remove existing nodes) we choose; to mark these nodes as erroneous. We cache the errors associated with declarations in the ""from"" context in; ``ASTImporter::ImportDeclErrors`` and the ones which are associated with the; ""to"" context in ``ASTImporterSharedState::ImportErrors``.

A similar problem was affecting `TClonesArray::operator=`, `TClonesArray::Expand` and `TClonesArray::ExpandCreate` and was also solved. `TClonesArray` reliance on global state during the destruction of the elements was decreased (removing use of `TObject::SetDtorOnly`). ### Global resources. Several tweaks to if and when, resources held by the global ROOT object (TROOT, TApplication) are deleted. When the default TApplication is replaced by a user provide TApplication, do not call EndOfProcessCleanups and co. and thus do not delete TFiles, TSockets or TColors that have already been created. In EndOfProcessCleanups, we now delete the objects held in TROOT's TDirectory part. If the libCling library is unloaded, this now induces an immediate tear down of the ROOT resources; consequently objects might be deleted sooner in the process tear down process on some platforms. TObject instances allocated as part of an array and made part of a collection, as for example the TCanvas instances into the global list of instances, are not longer deleted if the content of the collection is deleted. Technically the element of the array are now treated by collections as if they have been allocated on the stack. This fixes the issue described at [ROOT-7846]. ### Code Cleanups.

Availability," the user their; code is non-portable. The difference is that the former are ignored by; default, and the later warn by default. The ``WARNING`` severity is used for; constructs that are valid in the currently selected source language but that; are dubious in some way. The ``REMARK`` severity provides generic information; about the compilation that is not necessarily related to any dubious code. The; ``NOTE`` level is used to staple more information onto previous diagnostics. These *severities* are mapped into a smaller set (the ``Diagnostic::Level``; enum, {``Ignored``, ``Note``, ``Remark``, ``Warning``, ``Error``, ``Fatal``}) of; output; *levels* by the diagnostics subsystem based on various configuration options.; Clang internally supports a fully fine grained mapping mechanism that allows; you to map almost any diagnostic to the output level that you want. The only; diagnostics that cannot be mapped are ``NOTE``\ s, which always follow the; severity of the previously emitted diagnostic and ``ERROR``\ s, which can only; be mapped to ``Fatal`` (it is not possible to turn an error into a warning, for; example). Diagnostic mappings are used in many ways. For example, if the user specifies; ``-pedantic``, ``EXTENSION`` maps to ``Warning``, if they specify; ``-pedantic-errors``, it turns into ``Error``. This is used to implement; options like ``-Wunused_macros``, ``-Wundef`` etc. Mapping to ``Fatal`` should only be used for diagnostics that are considered so; severe that error recovery won't be able to recover sensibly from them (thus; spewing a ton of bogus errors). One example of this class of error are failure; to ``#include`` a file. The Format String; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The format string for the diagnostic is very simple, but it has some power.

Similarly, the `dependents()` method of RooFormulaVar and RooGenericPdf will only return the list of actual value servers. ### Removal of the RooGenFunction and RooMultiGenFunction classes. The `RooGenFunction` was only a lightweight adaptor that exports a RooAbsReal as a `ROOT::Math::IGenFunction`.; The same can be easily achieved with the generic `ROOT::Math::Functor1D`, so in the spirit of not duplicating interfaces, the `RooGenFunction` is removed in this release. Here is an example that shows how to replace it in the unlikely case you were using it:. ```C++; RooArgSet normSet{x}; // normalization set. // Old way 1: create a RooGenFunction:; RooGenFunction func1{pdf, x, {}, normSet};. // Old way 2: use `RooAbsReal::iGenFunction()`:; std::unique_ptr<ROOT::Math::IGenFunction> func2{; pdf.iGenFunction(x, normSet); };. // How to do it now:; RooFunctor functor{pdf, x, {}, normSet};; ROOT::Math::Functor1D func3{functor};; // Functor1D takes by reference, so the RooFunctor also needs to stay alive.; ```. For the same reason, the `RooMultiGenFunction` class that implements a multidimensional `ROOT::Math::IMultiGenFunction` is removed too.; It can easily be replaced by a `ROOT::Math::Functor`:. ```C++; RooFunctor functor{pdf, observables, {}, normSet};; ROOT::Math::Functor func4{functor, static_cast<unsigned int>(functor.nObs())};; // Functor takes by reference, so the RooFunctor also needs to stay alive.; ```. ### Define infinity as `std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity()`. RooFit has its internal representation of infinity in `RooNumber::infinity()`, which was `1e30` before. Now, it is defined as `std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity()`, to be consistent with the C++ standard library and other code. This change also affects the `RooNumber::isInfinite()` function. ### Remove `add(row, weight, weightError)` from RooAbsData interface.

Availability," their data members (like; `SetCoordinates` and `GetCoordinates`) passing either a generic iterator; or a pointer to a contiguous set of data, like a C array. This allows an; easy connection with the linear algebra package, which in turn, allows; creation of matrices using C arrays (like the ROOT **`TMatrix`**; classes) or iterators (`SMatrix` classes). Multiplication between linear; algebra matrices and `GenVector` vectors is possible by using the; template free functions `ROOT::Math::VectorUtil::Mult`. This function; works for any linear algebra matrix, which implements the operator; (`i,j`) and with first matrix element at `i=j=0`. ### Example: 3D Vector Classes. To avoid exposing template parameter to the users, typedef's are defined; for all types of vectors based on double's and float's. To use them, one; must include the header file `Math/Vector3D.h`. The following typedef's,; defined in the header file `Math/Vector3Dfwd.h`, are available for the; different instantiations of the template class; `ROOT::Math::`**`DisplacementVector3D`**:. - `ROOT::Math::`**`XYZVector`** vector based on `x,y,z` coordinates; (Cartesian) in double precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`XYZVectorF`** vector based on `x,y,z` coordinates; (Cartesian) in float precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`Polar3DVector`** vector based on `r,theta,phi`; coordinates (polar) in double precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`Polar3DVectorF`** vector based on `r,theta,phi`; coordinates (polar) in float precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`RhoZPhiVector`** vector based on `rho,z,phi`; coordinates (cylindrical) in double precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`RhoZPhiVectorF`** vector based on `rho,z,phi`; coordinates (cylindrical) in float precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`RhoEtaPhiVector`** vector based on `rho,eta,phi`; coordinates (cylindrical using `eta` instead of `z`) in double; precision. - `ROOT::Math::`**`RhoEtaPhiVectorF`** vector based on `rho,eta,phi`; coordinates (cylindrical using `eta` instead of `z`) in float; precision. #### Cons",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:77767,avail,available,77767,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability," they are not needed. As an example, suppose that the user has defined the following; parameters:. - Parameter 0, constant. - Parameter 1, freely variable. - Parameter 2, variable with limits. - Parameter 3, constant. - Parameter 4, freely variable. Then the internal parameter list would be as follows:. - Internal parameter 0 = external parameter 1. - Internal parameter 1 = external parameter 2, transformed; appropriately. - Internal parameter 2 = external parameter 4. In the above example, M considers that the number of external parameters; is 5, and the number of internal parameters is 3. This is the number; which determines, for example, the size of the error matrix of the; parameters, since only variable parameters have errors. An important feature of M is that parameters are allowed to change types; during the M minimization and analysis of a $\mbox{FCN}$ function.; Several applications in M have methods available to make variable; parameters fixed and vice-versa; to impose, change, or remove limits; from variable parameters; and even to define completely new parameters; at any time during a run. In addition, some M applications (notably the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ error analysis) cause one or more variable parameters; to be temporarily fixed during the calculation. Therefore, the; correspondence between external and internal parameter lists is in; general a dynamic one, and the number of internal parameters is not; necessarily constant. For more details about parameter interaction see [api:parameters]. ### The transformation for parameters with limits ###. [intro:limits]. For variable parameters with double sided limits $a$ (lower) and $b$; (upper), M uses the following transformation:. $$\begin{aligned}; P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \arcsin; \left( 2\: \frac{ P_{\mathrm{ext}}-a}{ b-a} - 1 \right) \\; P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& a + \frac{ b - a}{ 2}; \left( \sin P_{\mathrm{int}} + 1 \right) \end{aligned}$$. so that the internal value $P_{\mathrm{int}}$ can take on any value,; while",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:7486,avail,available,7486,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability," this seldom poses any; problem, but a method based on derivatives ($\mbox{MIGRAD}$) may; become blocked at such a value. If this happens, it may be necessary to; move the value of the parameter in question a significant distance from; the limit (e.g. with MnMigrad::setValue(...)) and restart the; minimization, perhaps with that parameter fixed temporarily. ### Getting the right parameter errors with limits ###. [answer:right-errors]. In the best case, where the minimum is far from any limits, M will; correctly transform the error matrix, and the parameter errors it; reports should be accurate and very close to those you would have got; without limits. In other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you wouldn't need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. On the; other hand, the $\mbox{MINOS}$ analysis is still meaningful, at; least in principle, as long as $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (which is called; internally by $\mbox{MINOS}$) does not get blocked at a limit.; Unfortunately, the user has no control over this aspect of the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ calculation, although it is possible to get enough; printout from the $\mbox{MINOS}$ result to be able to determine; whether the results are reliable or not. ## Fixing and releasing parameters ##. When M needs to be guided to the ""right"" minimum, often the best way to; do this is with the methods e.g. MnMigrad::fix(...) and; MnMigrad::release(...). That is, suppose you have a problem with ten; free parameters, and when you minimize with respect to all at once, M; goes to an unphysical solution characterized by an unphysical or; unwanted value of parameter number four. One way to avoid this is to fix; parameter four at a ""good"" value (not necessarily the best, si",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:65944,error,error,65944,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,2,['error'],"['error', 'errors']"

Note that, unlike; nvcc, clang always generates SASS code. * Invoke ``fatbin`` to combine all ``P_arch`` and ``S_arch`` files into a; single fat binary file, ``F``. * Compile ``H`` using clang. ``__device__`` code is parsed and must be; semantically correct, even though we're not generating code for the device; at this time. ``F`` is passed to this compilation, and clang includes it in a special ELF; section, where it can be found by tools like ``cuobjdump``. (You may ask at this point, why does clang need to parse the input file; multiple times? Why not parse it just once, and then use the AST to generate; code for the host and each device architecture?. Unfortunately this can't work because we have to define different macros during; host compilation and during device compilation for each GPU architecture.). clang's approach allows it to be highly robust to C++ edge cases, as it doesn't; need to decide at an early stage which declarations to keep and which to throw; away. But it has some consequences you should be aware of. Overloading Based on ``__host__`` and ``__device__`` Attributes; ---------------------------------------------------------------. Let ""H"", ""D"", and ""HD"" stand for ""``__host__`` functions"", ""``__device__``; functions"", and ""``__host__ __device__`` functions"", respectively.

However, nvcc allows you to ""overload"" H and D functions with different; signatures:. .. code-block:: c++. // nvcc: no error; __host__ void foo(int) {}; __device__ void foo() {}. In clang, the ``__host__`` and ``__device__`` attributes are part of a; function's signature, and so it's legal to have H and D functions with; (otherwi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.rst:11462,robust,robust,11462,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.rst,1,['robust'],['robust']

We'll also add a convenience; method, ``getFunction()``, to replace calls to ``TheModule->getFunction()``.; Our convenience method searches ``TheModule`` for an existing function; declaration, falling back to generating a new declaration from FunctionProtos if; it doesn't find one. In ``CallExprAST::codegen()`` we just need to replace the; call to ``TheModule->getFunction()``. In ``FunctionAST::codegen()`` we need to; update the FunctionProtos map first, then call ``getFunction()``. With this; done, we can always obtain a function declaration in the current module for any; previously declared function.

Plugins are defined by a base class (e.g.; **`TFile`**) that will be implemented in a plugin, a tag used to; identify the plugin (e.g. `^rfio:` as part of the protocol string),; the plugin class of which an object will be created; (e.g. **`TRFIOFile`**), the library to be loaded (in short; `libRFIO.so` to RFIO), and the constructor to be called (e.g.; ""`TRFIOFile()`""). This can be specified in the `.rootrc` which already; contains many plugin definitions, or by calls to; `gROOT->GetPluginManager()->AddHandler()`. #### Library AutoLoading. When using a class in Cling, e.g. in an interpreted source file, ROOT; will automatically load the library that defines this class. On; start-up, ROOT parses all files ending on `.rootmap` rootmap that are; in one of the `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for `MacOS`,; or `$PATH` for `Windows`). They contain class names and the library; names that the class depends on. After reading them, ROOT knows which; classes are available, and which libraries to load for them. When `TSystem::Load(""ALib"")` is called, ROOT uses this information to; determine which libraries `libALib.so` depends on. It will load these; libraries first. Otherwise, loading the requested library could cause; a system (dynamic loader) error due to unresolved symbols. ### \$ROOTSYS/tutorials. tutorials The tutorials directory contains many example example; scripts.

On the other; hand, value 2 (high) indicates that M is allowed to waste function calls; in order to be sure that all values are precise; it is intended for; cases where the function is evaluated in a relatively short time and/or; where the parameter errors must be calculated reliably. In addition all; constants set in MnStrategy can be changed individually by the user,; e.g. the number of iteration cycles in the numerical gradient. ## Parameter errors ##. M is usually used to find the ""best"" values of a set of parameters,; where ""best"" is defined as those values which minimize a given function,; $\mbox{FCN}$. The width of the function minimum, or more generally,; the shape of the function in some neighbourhood of the minimum, gives; information about the *uncertainty* in the best parameter values, often; called by physicists the *parameter errors*. An important feature of M; is that it offers several tools to analyze the parameter errors. ### $\mbox{FCN}$ normalization and the error definition ###. Whatever method is used to calculate the parameter errors, they will; depend on the overall (multiplicative) normalization of; $\mbox{FCN}$, in the sense that if the value of $\mbox{FCN}$ is; everywhere multiplied by a constant $\beta$, then the errors will be; decreased by a factor $\sqrt{\beta}$. Additive constants do not change; the parameter errors, but may imply a different goodness-of-fit; confidence level. Assuming that the user knows what the normalization of their; $\mbox{FCN}$ means, and also that they are interested in parameter; errors, the user can change the error definition which allows them to; define what they means by one ""error"", in terms of the change in the; $\mbox{FCN}$ value which should be caused by changing one parameter; by one ""error"".

Availability," to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them. This requirement makes sure that the; compiler does not insert additional exception handling code into the interface; functions. This is a performance consideration: ``lib/Support`` functions are; at the bottom of many call chains and as such can be frequently called. We; need them to be as efficient as possible. However, no routines in the system; library should actually throw exceptions. Code Organization; -----------------.

Alternatively, it is possible to specify the line on which the diagnostic; should appear by appending ``@<line>`` to ``expected-<type>``, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. #warning some text; // expected-warning@10 {{some text}}.

RooFitResult* fr = pdf->fitTo(*data,Save(),...) ;; pdf->plotOn(frame,VisualizeError(*fr),...) ;. Two techniques for error visualization are implemented. The default is; linear error propagation, and results in an error band that is by; construction symmetric. The linear error is calculated as. error(x) = Z* F_a(x) * Corr(a,a') F_a'(x). where F_a(x) = [ f(x,a+da) - f(x,a-da) ] / 2,. with f(x) = the plotted curve; 'da' = error taken from the fit result; Corr(a,a') = the correlation matrix from the fit result; Z = requested significance 'Z sigma band'. The linear method is fast (requires 2*N evaluations of the curve,; where N is the number of parameters), but may not be accurate in the; presence of strong correlations (~>0.9) and at Z>2 due to linear and; Gaussian approximations made. Alternatively, errors can be visualized using a sampling method. In; this method a number of curves is calculated with variations of the; parameter values, as sampled from a multi-variate Gaussian p.d.f. that; is constructed from the fit results covariance matrix. The error(x); is determined by calculating a central interval that capture N% of the; variations for each value of x, where N% is controlled by Z (i.e. Z=1; gives N=68%). The number of sampling curves is chosen to be such that; at least 100 curves are expected to be outside the N% interval. Intervals from; the sampling method can be asymmetric, and may perform better in the; presence of strong correlations, but may take (much) longer to; calculate. The sampling method also assumes that the uncertainty on the; parameters can modeled by a multi-variate Gaussian distribution.

The second section of the report is the `instruction info view`. It shows the; latency and reciprocal throughput of every instruction in the sequence. It also; reports extra information related to the number of micro opcodes, and opcode; properties (i.e., 'MayLoad', 'MayStore', and 'HasSideEffects'). Field *RThroughput* is the reciprocal of the instruction throughput. Throughput; is computed as the maximum number of instructions of a same type that can be; executed per clock cycle in the absence of operand dependencies. In this; example, the reciprocal throughput of a vector float multiply is 1; cycles/instruction. That is because the FP multiplier JFPM is only available; from pipeline JFPU1.

Availability," to; make code review easier. The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to increase the readability and; maintainability of our common source base. Languages, Libraries, and Standards; ===================================. Most source code in LLVM and other LLVM projects using these coding standards; is C++ code. There are some places where C code is used either due to; environment restrictions, historical restrictions, or due to third-party source; code imported into the tree. Generally, our preference is for standards; conforming, modern, and portable C++ code as the implementation language of; choice. For automation, build-systems and utility scripts Python is preferred and; is widely used in the LLVM repository already. C++ Standard Versions; ---------------------. Unless otherwise documented, LLVM subprojects are written using standard C++17; code and avoid unnecessary vendor-specific extensions. Nevertheless, we restrict ourselves to features which are available in the; major toolchains supported as host compilers (see :doc:`GettingStarted` page,; section `Software`). Each toolchain provides a good reference for what it accepts:. * Clang: https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html. * libc++: https://libcxx.llvm.org/Status/Cxx17.html. * GCC: https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17. * libstdc++: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/status.html#status.iso.2017. * MSVC: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368.aspx. C++ Standard Library; --------------------. Instead of implementing custom data structures, we encourage the use of C++; standard library facilities or LLVM support libraries whenever they are; available for a particular task. LLVM and related projects emphasize and rely; on the standard library facilities and the LLVM support libraries as much as; possible. LLVM support libraries (for example, `ADT; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT>`_); implement specialized data structures or functionality",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:2534,avail,available,2534,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

The most; significant difference is in reading a file without compression. The file size with compression, write times with and without compression; and the read times with and without compression all favor the; **`TClonesArray`**. ## Impact of Compression on I/O. This benchmark illustrates the pros and cons of the compression option.; We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small; compared to the total processing time. In this case, if the I/O; operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage; of the total time and it may very well save a factor of 10 on disk; space. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression; may slow down the program's performance.

There are two main ways of converting values of unsupported vector types to; value of supported types: splitting vector types, multiple times if necessary,; until a legal type is found, and extending vector types by adding elements to; the end to round them out to legal types (""widening""). If a vector gets split; all the way down to single-element parts with no supported vector type being; found, the elements are converted to scalars (""scalarizing"").

Availability," version information. Programmers must still rely on the existing versioning mechanisms of the underlying language (if any exist) to version software libraries. * **Namespaces**: Unlike in some languages, modules do not imply any notion of namespaces. Thus, a struct declared in one module will still conflict with a struct of the same name declared in a different module, just as they would if declared in two different headers. This aspect is important for backward compatibility, because (for example) the mangled names of entities in software libraries must not change when introducing modules. * **Binary distribution of modules**: Headers (particularly C++ headers) expose the full complexity of the language. Maintaining a stable binary module format across architectures, compiler versions, and compiler vendors is technically infeasible. Using Modules; =============; To enable modules, pass the command-line flag ``-fmodules``. This will make any modules-enabled software libraries available as modules as well as introducing any modules-specific syntax. Additional `command-line parameters`_ are described in a separate section later. Standard C++ Modules; --------------------; .. note::; Modules are adopted into C++20 Standard. And its semantic and command line interface are very different from the Clang C++ modules. See `StandardCPlusPlusModules <StandardCPlusPlusModules.html>`_ for details. Objective-C Import declaration; ------------------------------; Objective-C provides syntax for importing a module via an *@import declaration*, which imports the named module:. .. parsed-literal::. @import std;. The ``@import`` declaration above imports the entire contents of the ``std`` module (which would contain, e.g., the entire C or C++ standard library) and make its API available within the current translation unit.

Deleted special member functions. In C++11, the explicit declaration of a move constructor or a move; assignment operator within a class deletes the implicit declaration; of the copy constructor and copy assignment operator. This change came; fairly late in the C++11 standardization process, so early; implementations of C++11 (including Clang before 3.0, GCC before 4.7,; and Visual Studio 2010) do not implement this rule, leading them to; accept this ill-formed code:. struct X {; X(X&&); // deletes implicit copy constructor:; // X(const X&) = delete;; };. void f(X x);; void g(X x) {; f(x); // error: X has a deleted copy constructor; }. This affects some early C++11 code, including Boost's popular shared_ptr; up to version 1.47.0. The fix for Boost's shared_ptr is; available here. Objective-C++ compatibility. Implicit downcasts. Due to a bug in its implementation, GCC allows implicit downcasts; of Objective-C pointers (from a base class to a derived class) when; calling functions.

For historical reasons, there are two classes representing axis.; **`TAxis`** \* `axis` is the axis object, which will be returned when; calling the `TH1::GetAxis()` method. ``` {.cpp}; TAxis *axis = histo->GetXaxis(); ```. Of course, you may do the same for `Y` and `Z`-axis. The graphical; representation of an axis is done with the **`TGaxis`** class. The; histogram classes and **`TGraph`** generate instances of this class.; This is internal and the user should not have to see it. ### Axis Title. The axis title is set, as with all named objects, by. ``` {.cpp}; axis->SetTitle(""Whatever title you want"");; ```. When the axis is embedded into a histogram or a graph, one has to first; extract the axis object:. ``` {.cpp}; h->GetXaxis()->SetTitle(""Whatever title you want""); ```. ### Axis Options and Characteristics. The axis options are most simply set with the styles. The available; style options controlling specific axis options are the following:. ``` {.cpp}; TAxis *axis = histo->GetXaxis();; axis->SetAxisColor(Color_t color = 1);; axis->SetLabelColor(Color_t color = 1);; axis->SetLabelFont(Style_t font = 62);; axis->SetLabelOffset(Float_t offset = 0.005);; axis->SetLabelSize(Float_t size = 0.04);; axis->SetNdivisions(Int_t n = 510, Bool_t optim = kTRUE);; axis->SetNoExponent(Bool_t noExponent = kTRUE);; axis->SetTickLength(Float_t length = 0.03);; axis->SetTitleOffset(Float_t offset = 1);; axis->SetTitleSize(Float_t size = 0.02);; ```. The getters corresponding to the described setters are also available.; The general options, not specific to axis, as for instance; `SetTitleTextColor()` are valid and do have an effect on axis; characteristics. ### Setting the Number of Divisions. Use `TAxis::SetNdivisions(ndiv,optim)` to set the number of divisions; for an axis.

Line #4 forces cling to send ROOT a callback that TCanvas in unknown but; the GMI resolves it to module Gpad, loads it and returns the control to cling. ### Performance; This section compares ROOT PCH technology with C++ Modules which is important but; unfair comparison. As we noted earlier, PCH is very efficient, it cannot be; extended to the experiments’ software stacks because of its design constraints.; On the contrary, the C++ Modules can be used in third-party code where the PCH; is not available. The comparisons are to give a good metric when we are ready to switch ROOT to use; C++ Modules by default. However, since it is essentially the same technology,; optimizations of C++ Modules also affect the PCH. We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead.

Availability," we must execute the process,; and have it stop before it invokes our pass, but after it has loaded the shared; object. The most foolproof way of doing this is to set a breakpoint in; ``PassManager::run`` and then run the process with the arguments you want:. .. code-block:: console. $ (gdb) break llvm::PassManager::run; Breakpoint 1 at 0x2413bc: file Pass.cpp, line 70.; (gdb) run test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Starting program: opt test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Breakpoint 1, PassManager::run (this=0xffbef174, M=@0x70b298) at Pass.cpp:70; 70 bool PassManager::run(Module &M) { return PM->run(M); }; (gdb). Once the :program:`opt` stops in the ``PassManager::run`` method you are now; free to set breakpoints in your pass so that you can trace through execution or; do other standard debugging stuff. Miscellaneous Problems; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Once you have the basics down, there are a couple of problems that GDB has,; some with solutions, some without. * Inline functions have bogus stack information. In general, GDB does a pretty; good job getting stack traces and stepping through inline functions. When a; pass is dynamically loaded however, it somehow completely loses this; capability. The only solution I know of is to de-inline a function (move it; from the body of a class to a ``.cpp`` file). * Restarting the program breaks breakpoints. After following the information; above, you have succeeded in getting some breakpoints planted in your pass.; Next thing you know, you restart the program (i.e., you type ""``run``"" again),; and you start getting errors about breakpoints being unsettable. The only; way I have found to ""fix"" this problem is to delete the breakpoints that are; already set in your pass, run the program, and re-set the breakpoints once; execution stops in ``PassManager::run``. Hopefully these tips will help with common case debugging situations.

The *Scheduler's queue usage* table shows that the average and maximum number of; buffer entries (i.e., scheduler queue entries) used at runtime. Resource JFPU01; reached its maximum (18 of 18 queue entries). Note that AMD Jaguar implements; three schedulers:. * JALU01 - A scheduler for ALU instructions.; * JFPU01 - A scheduler floating point operations.; * JLSAGU - A scheduler for address generation. The dot-product is a kernel of three floating point instructions (a vector; multiply followed by two horizontal adds). That explains why only the floating; point scheduler appears to be used. A full scheduler queue is either caused by data dependency chains or by a; sub-optimal usage of hardware resources. Sometimes, resource pressure can be; mitigated by rewriting the kernel using different instructions that consume; different scheduler resources. Schedulers with a small queue are less resilient; to bottlenecks caused by the presence of long data dependencies. The scheduler; statistics are displayed by using the command option ``-all-stats`` or; ``-scheduler-stats``.

Ordered collections all derive; from the abstract base class **`TSeqCollection`**. Sorted collections; are ordered by an internal (automatic) sorting mechanism. The following; sorted collections are available (the stored items must be sortable):. - **`TSortedList`**. - **`TBtree`**. Unordered collections don't maintain the order in which the elements; were added, i.e. when you iterate over an unordered collection, you are; not likely to retrieve elements in the same order they were added to the; collection. The following unordered collections are available:. - **`THashTable`**. - **`TMap`**. ## Iterators: Processing a Collection. The concept of processing all the members of a collection is generic,; i.e. independent of any specific representation of a collection. To; process each object in a collection one needs some type of cursor that; is initialized and then steps over each member of the collection in; turn. Collection objects could provide this service but there is a snag:; as there is only one collection object per collection there would only; be one cursor. Instead, to permit the use of as many cursors as; required, they are made separate classes called iterator. For each; collection class there is an associated iterator class that knows how to; sequentially retrieve each member in turn. The relationship between a; collection and its iterator is very close and may require that the; iterator has full access to the collection (i.e. it is a friend class).; In general iterator will be used via the **`TIter`** w",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md:5171,avail,available,5171,documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/CollectionClasses.md,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability," when pitted head-to-head against GCC in batch; mode, clang is built with a library based; architecture that makes it relatively easy to adapt it and build new tools; with it. This means that it is often possible to apply out-of-the-box thinking; and novel techniques to improve compilation in various ways. Expressive Diagnostics. In addition to being fast and functional, we aim to make Clang extremely user; friendly. As far as a command-line compiler goes, this basically boils down to; making the diagnostics (error and warning messages) generated by the compiler; be as useful as possible. There are several ways that we do this, but the; most important are pinpointing exactly what is wrong in the program,; highlighting related information so that it is easy to understand at a glance,; and making the wording as clear as possible.; Here is one simple example that illustrates the quality of Clang diagnostic:. $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:7:39: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('int' and 'struct A'); return y + func(y ? ((SomeA.X + 40) + SomeA) / 42 + SomeA.X : SomeA.X);; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~. Here you can see that you don't even need to see the original source code to; understand what is wrong based on the Clang error: Because Clang prints a; caret, you know exactly which plus it is complaining about. The range; information highlights the left and right side of the plus which makes it; immediately obvious what the compiler is talking about, which is very useful for; cases involving precedence issues and many other situations.; Clang diagnostics are very polished and have many features.

Availability," with reduced privileges using the JIT Remote APIs. To provide input for our JIT we will use a lightly modified version of the; Kaleidoscope REPL from `Chapter 7 <LangImpl07.html>`_ of the ""Implementing a; language in LLVM tutorial"". Finally, a word on API generations: ORC is the 3rd generation of LLVM JIT API.; It was preceded by MCJIT, and before that by the (now deleted) legacy JIT.; These tutorials don't assume any experience with these earlier APIs, but; readers acquainted with them will see many familiar elements. Where appropriate; we will make this connection with the earlier APIs explicit to help people who; are transitioning from them to ORC. JIT API Basics; ==============. The purpose of a JIT compiler is to compile code ""on-the-fly"" as it is needed,; rather than compiling whole programs to disk ahead of time as a traditional; compiler does. To support that aim our initial, bare-bones JIT API will have; just two functions:. 1. ``Error addModule(std::unique_ptr<Module> M)``: Make the given IR module; available for execution.; 2. ``Expected<ExecutorSymbolDef> lookup()``: Search for pointers to; symbols (functions or variables) that have been added to the JIT. A basic use-case for this API, executing the 'main' function from a module,; will look like:. .. code-block:: c++. JIT J;; J.addModule(buildModule());; auto *Main = J.lookup(""main"").getAddress().toPtr<int(*)(int, char *[])>();; int Result = Main();. The APIs that we build in these tutorials will all be variations on this simple; theme. Behind this API we will refine the implementation of the JIT to add; support for concurrent compilation, optimization and lazy compilation.; Eventually we will extend the API itself to allow higher-level program; representations (e.g. ASTs) to be added to the JIT. KaleidoscopeJIT; ===============. In the previous section we described our API, now we examine a simple; implementation of it: The KaleidoscopeJIT class [1]_ that was used in the; `Implementing a language with L",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT1.rst:2936,avail,available,2936,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT1.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT1.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

The result value will be the; operand for the flag from the first module being linked, unless the; other module uses **Min** or **Max**, in which case the result will; be **Min** (with the min value) or **Max** (with the max value),; respectively. * - 3; - **Require**; Adds a requirement that another module flag be present and have a; specified value after linking is performed. The value must be a; metadata pair, where the first element of the pair is the ID of the; module flag to be restricted, and the second element of the pair is; the value the module flag should be restricted to. This behavior can; be used to restrict the allowable results (via triggering of an; error) of linking IDs with the **Override** behavior. * - 4; - **Override**; Uses the specified value, regardless of the behavior or value of the; other module. If both modules specify **Override**, but the values; differ, an error will be emitted. * - 5; - **Append**; Appends the two values, which are required to be metadata nodes. * - 6; - **AppendUnique**; Appends the two values, which are required to be metadata; nodes. However, duplicate entries in the second list are dropped; during the append operation. * - 7; - **Max**; Takes the max of the two values, which are required to be integers. * - 8; - **Min**; Takes the min of the two values, which are required to be non-negative integers.; An absent module flag is treated as having the value 0. It is an error for a particular unique flag ID to have multiple behaviors,; except in the case of **Require** (which adds restrictions on another metadata; value) or **Override**.

Error dec() { ... }; };. Instances of this kind of fallible iterator interface are then wrapped with the; fallible_iterator utility which provides ``operator++`` and ``operator--``,; returning any errors via a reference passed in to the wrapper at construction; time. The fallible_iterator wrapper takes care of (a) jumping to the end of the; range on error, and (b) marking the error as checked whenever an iterator is; compared to ``end`` and found to be inequal (in particular: this marks the; error as checked throughout the body of a range-based for loop), enabling early; exit from the loop without redundant error checking. Instances of the fallible iterator interface (e.g. FallibleChildIterator above); are wrapped using the ``make_fallible_itr`` and ``make_fallible_end``; functions.

Tips for JITLink backend developers; -----------------------------------. #. Make liberal use of assert and ``llvm::Error``. Do *not* assume that the input; object is well formed: Return any errors produced by libObject (or your own; object parsing code) and validate as you construct. Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures). In debug builds of LLVM, the ``-debug-only=jitlink`` option dumps logs from the; JITLink library during the link process. These can be useful for spotting some bugs at; a glance. The ``-debug-only=llvm_jitlink`` option dumps logs from the ``llvm-jitlink``; tool, which can be useful for debugging both testcases (it is often less verbose than; ``-debug-only=jitl",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:43271,error,errors,43271,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,1,['error'],['errors']

UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer is not expected to produce false positives.; If you see one, look again; most likely it is a true positive!. Disabling Instrumentation with ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""undefined"")))``; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------. You disable UBSan checks for particular functions with; ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""undefined"")))``. You can use all values of; ``-fsanitize=`` flag in this attribute, e.g. if your function deliberately; contains possible signed integer overflow, you can use; ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""signed-integer-overflow"")))``. This attribute may not be; supported by other compilers, so consider using it together with; ``#if defined(__clang__)``. Suppressing Errors in Recompiled Code (Ignorelist); --------------------------------------------------. UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer supports ``src`` and ``fun`` entity types in; :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`, that can be used to suppress error reports; in the specified source files or functions. Runtime suppressions; --------------------. Sometimes you can suppress UBSan error reports for specific files, functions,; or libraries without recompiling the code. You need to pass a path to; suppression file in a ``UBSAN_OPTIONS`` environment variable. .. code-block:: bash. UBSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=MyUBSan.supp. You need to specify a :ref:`check <ubsan-checks>` you are suppressing and the; bug location. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. signed-integer-overflow:file-with-known-overflow.cpp; alignment:function_doing_unaligned_access; vptr:shared_object_with_vptr_failures.so.

We do not remove the erroneous nodes because by the time when we recognize the error it is too late to remove the node, there may be additional references to that already in the AST.; This is aligned with the overall `design principle of the Clang AST <InternalsManual.html#immutability>`_: Clang AST nodes (types, declarations, statements, expressions, and so on) are generally designed to be **immutable once created**.; Thus, clients of the ASTImporter library should always check if there is any associated error for the node which they inspect in the destination context.; We recommend skipping the processing of those nodes which have an error associated with them.

The ``-ast-merge <pch-file>`` command-line switch can be used to merge from the given serialized AST file.; This file represents the source context.; When this switch is present then each top-level AST node of the source context is being merged into the destination context.; If the merge was successful then ``ASTConsumer::HandleTopLevelDecl`` is called for the Decl.; This results that we can execute the original front-end action on the extended AST.

Error handling; --------------. Proper error handling helps us identify bugs in our code, and helps end-users; understand errors in their tool usage. Errors fall into two broad categories:; *programmatic* and *recoverable*, with different strategies for handling and; reporting. Programmatic Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Programmatic errors are violations of program invariants or API contracts, and; represent bugs within the program itself. Our aim is to document invariants, and; to abort quickly at the point of failure (providing some basic diagnostic) when; invariants are broken at runtime. The fundamental tools for handling programmatic errors are assertions and the; llvm_unreachable function. Assertions are used to express invariant conditions,; and should include a message describing the invariant:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(isPhysReg(R) && ""All virt regs should have been allocated already."");. The llvm_unreachable function can be used to document areas of control flow; that should never be entered if the program invariants hold:. .. code-block:: c++. enum { Foo, Bar, Baz } X = foo();. switch (X) {; case Foo: /* Handle Foo */; break;; case Bar: /* Handle Bar */; break;; default:; llvm_unreachable(""X should be Foo or Bar here"");; }.

The ``joinErrors`` routine builds a special error type called ``ErrorList``,; which holds a list of user defined errors. The ``handleErrors`` routine; recognizes this type and will attempt to handle each of the contained errors in; order. If all contained errors can be handled, ``handleErrors`` will return; ``Error::success()``, otherwise ``handleErrors`` will concatenate the remaining; errors and return the resulting ``ErrorList``.

Thus, you can access it with standard vector; methods:. .. code-block:: c++. for (unsigned i = 0; i != OptimizationList.size(); ++i); switch (OptimizationList[i]); ... ... to iterate through the list of options specified. Note that the ""``cl::list``"" template is completely general and may be used with; any data types or other arguments that you can use with the ""``cl::opt``""; template. One especially useful way to use a list is to capture all of the; positional arguments together if there may be more than one specified. In the; case of a linker, for example, the linker takes several '``.o``' files, and; needs to capture them into a list. This is naturally specified as:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; cl::list<std::string> InputFilenames(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<Input files>""), cl::OneOrMore);; ...

In this example, we used the; `cl::OneOrMore`_ modifier to inform the CommandLine library that it is an error; if the user does not specify any ``.o`` files on our command line. Again, this; just reduces the amount of checking we have to do. Collecting options as a set of flags; ------------------------------------. Instead of collecting sets of options in a list, it is also possible to gather; information for enum values in a **bit vector**.

Availability,"# Adding a Class. ## The Role of TObject. The light-weight **`TObject`** class provides the default behavior and; protocol for the objects in the ROOT system. Specifically, it is the; primary interface to classes providing object I/O, error handling,; inspection, introspection, and drawing. The interface to this service is; via abstract classes. ### Introspection, Reflection and Run Time Type Identification. Introspection, which is also referred to as reflection, or run time type; identification (RTTI) is the ability of a class to reflect upon itself; or to ""look inside itself. ROOT implements reflection with the; **`TClass`** class. It provides all the information about a class, a; full description of data members and methods, including the comment; field and the method parameter types. A class with the `ClassDef` macro; has the ability to obtain a **`TClass`** with the `IsA` method. ``` {.cpp}; TClass *cl = obj->IsA();; ```. It returns a **`TClass`**. In addition, an object can directly get the; class name and the base classes by:. ``` {.cpp}; const char* name = obj->ClassName();; ```. If the class is a descendent of **`TObject`**, you can check if an; object inherits from a specific class, you can use the `InheritsFrom`; method. This method returns `kTrue` if the object inherits from the; specified class name or **`TClass`**. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t b = obj->InheritsFrom(""TLine"");; Bool_t b = obj->InheritsFrom(TLine::Class());; ```. ROOT and `Cling` rely on reflection and the class dictionary to identify; the type of a variable at run time. With **`TObject`** inheritance come; some methods that use Introspection to help you see the data in the; object or class. For instance:. ``` {.cpp}; obj->Dump(); // lists all data members and their current values; obj->Inspect(); // opens a window to browse data members; obj->DrawClass(); // Draws the class inheritance tree; ```.

Use this to get access to the latest and greatest, but it; may not be stable. By trying out the new version you can help us; converge quickly to a stable version that can then become the new; pro version. If you are a new user we would advice you to try the; new version. - The *pro* (production) version is a version we feel comfortable with; to exposing to a large audience for serious work. The change rate of; this version is much lower than for the new version, it is about 3; to 6 months. - The *old* version is the previous pro version that people might need; for some time before switching the new pro version. The old change; rate is the same as for pro. ## Installing Precompiled Binaries. The binaries are available for downloading from; <https://root.cern/install/>.

Availability,"# C++ Modules in ROOT. Technology Overview. *Vassil Vassilev, Oksana Shadura, Yuka Takahashi and Raphael Isemann*. ## Overview. ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit; header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,; or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable and reparsing is; redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same; header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of C++ Code. The ROOT v6.16 release came with a preview of the module technology;; dedicated binaries have been built and can be reproduced by passing; `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` as configure flag. The goals of this technology are:; * Gain feedback from early adoption -- the technology is being long anticipated; by some of the users of ROOT. It improves correctness of ROOT and improves; performance when carefully adopted.; * Study performance bottlenecks -- the feature is designed with performance; considerations in mind. In this document we describe the current performance; bottlenecks and trade-offs.; * Understand if the gradual migration policy is sufficient -- C++ Modules in; ROOT support gradual migration. In particular, ROOT can enable C++ Modules for; itself and still run in legacy mode for the third-party code (generating; rootmap files and other scaffolding). C++ Modules are here and we would like to give a brief introduction of how the; feature works, what are its pros and cons, what's the current state of the; implementation and how third-party code can use it. Read more [[1]]. C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX). ## Design Goals. * Coherence with standard C++ -- C++ Modules TS is advancing and will be; likely part the upcoming C++20 standard;; * Performance -- provide performance that is competitive to ROOT with PCH and; advance further the implementation of the C++ Modules in clang to optimize; memory footprint and execution time;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md:365,redundant,redundant,365,README/README.CXXMODULES.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/README.CXXMODULES.md,1,['redundant'],['redundant']

Availability,"# Graphs #. In this Chapter we will learn how to exploit some of the functionalities; ROOT provides to display data exploiting the class `TGraphErrors`,; which you already got to know previously. ## Read Graph Points from File ##. The fastest way in which you can fill a graph with experimental data is; to use the constructor which reads data points and their errors from an; ASCII file (i.e. standard text) format:. ``` {.cpp}; TGraphErrors(const char *filename,; const char *format=""%lg %lg %lg %lg"", Option_t *option="""");; ```. The format string can be:. - `""%lg %lg""` read only 2 first columns into X,Y. - `""%lg %lg %lg""` read only 3 first columns into X,Y and EY. - `""%lg %lg %lg %lg""` read only 4 first columns into X,Y,EX,EY. This approach has the nice feature of allowing the user to reuse the; macro for many different data sets. Here is an example of an input file.; The nice graphic result shown is produced by the macro below, which; reads two such input files and uses different options to display the; data points. ```; # Measurement of Friday 26 March; # Experiment 2 Physics Lab. 1 6 5; 2 12 5; 3 14 4.7; 4 20 4.5; 5 22 4.2; 6 24 5.1; 7 35 2.9; 8 45 4.1; 9 44 4.8; 10 53 5.43; ```; \newpage; ![](figures/graph_with_expectation.png). ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro2.C; ```. In addition to the inspection of the plot, you can check the actual; contents of the graph with the `TGraph::Print()` method at any time,; obtaining a printout of the coordinates of data points on screen. The; macro also shows us how to print a coloured band around a graph instead; of error bars, quite useful for example to represent the errors of a; theoretical prediction. ## Polar Graphs ##. With ROOT you can profit from rather advanced plotting routines, like; the ones implemented in the `TPolarGraph`, a class to draw graphs in; polar coordinates. You can see the example macro in the following and the; resulting Figure is [4.2](#f42):. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/graphs.md:361,error,errors,361,documentation/primer/graphs.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/graphs.md,1,['error'],['errors']

It includes a discussion on compression, and file recovery. Then; we explain the logical file, the class **`TFile`** and its methods. We; show how to navigate in a file, how to save objects and read them back.; We also include a discussion on `Streamers`. `Streamers` are the methods; responsible to capture an objects current state to save it to disk or; send it over the network. At the end of the chapter is a discussion on; the two specialized ROOT files: **`TNetFile`** and **`TWebFile`**. ## The Physical Layout of ROOT Files. A ROOT file is like a UNIX file directory. It can contain directories; and objects organized in unlimited number of levels. It also is stored; in machine independent format (ASCII, IEEE floating point, Big Endian; byte ordering). To look at the physical layout of a ROOT file, we first; create one. This example creates a ROOT file and 15 histograms, fills; each histogram with 1000 entries from a Gaussian distribution, and; writes them to the file. ``` {.cpp}; {; char name[10], title[20];; TObjArray Hlist(0); // create an array of Histograms; TH1F* h; // create a pointer to a histogram; // make and fill 15 histograms and add them to the object array; for (Int_t i = 0; i < 15; i++) {; sprintf(name,""h%d"",i);; sprintf(title,""histo nr:%d"",i);; h = new TH1F(name,title,100,-4,4);; Hlist.Add(h);; h->FillRandom(""gaus"",1000);; }; // open a file and write the array to the file; TFile f(""demo.root"",""recreate"");; Hlist.Write();; f.Close();; }; ```. The example begins with a call to the **`TFile`** constructor. This; class is describing the ROOT file (that has the extension ""`.root`""). In; the next section, we will cover **`TFile`** in details. The last line of; the example closes the file. To view its contents we need to open it; again, and to create a **`TBrowser`** object by:. ``` ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:228,recover,recovery,228,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['recover'],['recovery']

Availability,"# Python Interface; \index{Python}. Python is a popular, open-source, dynamic programming language with an; interactive interpreter. Its interoperability with other programming; languages, both for extending Python as well as embedding it, is; excellent and many existing third-party applications and libraries have; therefore so-called ""Python bindings."" PyROOT provides Python bindings; for ROOT: it enables cross-calls from ROOT/Cling into Python and vice; versa, the intermingling of the two interpreters, and the transport of; user-level objects from one interpreter to the other. PyROOT enables; access from ROOT to any application or library that itself has Python; bindings, and it makes all ROOT functionality directly available from; the python interpreter. ## PyROOT Overview. The Python scripting language is widely used for scientific programming,; including high performance and distributed parallel code (see; <http://www.scipy.org>). It is the second most popular scripting; language (after Perl) and enjoys a wide-spread use as a ""glue language"":; practically every library and application these days comes with Python; bindings (and if not, they can be easily written or generated). `PyROOT`, a Python extension module, provides the bindings for the ROOT; class library in a generic way using the Cling dictionary. This way, it; allows the use of any ROOT classes from the Python interpreter, and thus; the ""glue-ing"" of ROOT libraries with any non-ROOT library or; applications that provide Python bindings. Further, `PyROOT` can be; loaded into the Cling interpreter to allow (as of now still rudimentary); access to Python classes. The best way to understand the benefits of; `PyROOT` is through a few examples. ### Glue-ing Applications. The `PyQt` library, see <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt>,; provides Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI framework (; <http://www.trolltech.com>).

Availability,"# ROOT in Python #. ROOT offers the possibility to interface to Python via a set of bindings called; PyROOT.; Python is used in a wide variety of application areas and one of the most used; scripting languages today.; With the help of PyROOT it becomes possible to combine the power of a scripting; language with ROOT tools. Introductory material to Python is available from many; sources on the web, see e. g. http://docs.python.org. ## PyROOT ##. The access to ROOT classes and their methods in PyROOT is almost identical to C++; macros, except for the special language features of Python, most importantly dynamic; type declaration at the time of assignment. Coming back to our first example, simply; plotting a function in ROOT, the following C++ code:. ``` {.cpp}; TF1 *f1 = new TF1(""f2"",""[0]*sin([1]*x)/x"",0.,10.);; f1->SetParameter(0,1);; f1->SetParameter(1,1);; f1->Draw();; ```. in Python becomes:. ``` {.python}; import ROOT; f1 = ROOT.TF1(""f2"",""[0]*sin([1]*x)/x"",0.,10.); f1.SetParameter(0,1);; f1.SetParameter(1,1);; f1.Draw();; ```. A slightly more advanced example hands over data defined in the macro to the ROOT; class `TGraphErrors`. Note that a Python array can be used to pass data between; Python and ROOT. The first line in the Python script allows it to be executed; directly from the operating system, without the need to start the script from; python or the highly recommended powerful interactive shell ipython. The last line; in the python script is there to allow you to have a look at the graphical output; in the ROOT canvas before it disappears upon termination of the script. Here is the C++ version:. ``` {.cpp}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/TGraphFit.C; ```. In Python it looks like this:. ``` {.python}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/TGraphFit.py; ```. Comparing the C++ and Python versions in these two examples, it now should be; clear how easy it is to convert any ROOT Macro in C++ to a Python version.

Recently, Google Project Zero and other researchers have found information leak; vulnerabilities by exploiting speculative execution in modern CPUs. These; exploits are currently broken down into three variants:; * GPZ Variant #1 (a.k.a. Spectre Variant #1): Bounds check (or predicate) bypass; * GPZ Variant #2 (a.k.a. Spectre Variant #2): Branch target injection; * GPZ Variant #3 (a.k.a. Meltdown): Rogue data cache load. For more details, see the Google Project Zero blog post and the Spectre research; paper:; * https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html; * https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf. The core problem of GPZ Variant #1 is that speculative execution uses branch; prediction to select the path of instructions speculatively executed. This path; is speculatively executed with the available data, and may load from memory and; leak the loaded values through various side channels that survive even when the; speculative execution is unwound due to being incorrect. Mispredicted paths can; cause code to be executed with data inputs that never occur in correct; executions, making checks against malicious inputs ineffective and allowing; attackers to use malicious data inputs to leak secret data.

The SOFIE inference is now integrated with RDataFrame, where a model can be evaluated on the columns of an input `TTree` with `RDataFrame` using the adapter functor class `SofieFunctor`.; Examples of using SOFIE with `RDataFrame` are the new tutorials (in the `tutorials/tmva` directory) `TMVA_SOFIE_RDataFrame.C` or `TMVA_SOFIE_RDataFrame.py`. `TMVA_SOFIE_RDataFrame_JIT.C` is an example where the SOFIE model is generated and compiled at runtime using ROOT Cling and evaluated using RDataFrame. #### RSofieReader. `RSofieReader` is a new class, which takes as input a model file (in ONNX, Keras, PyTorch or ROOT format) and generates and compiles the C++ code for the inference at run time using the ROOT JITing capabilities of CLING. An example of using this class is the tutorial `TMVA_SOFIE_RSofieReader.C`. ### TMVA Pythonizations. New Pythonizations are available for TMVA allowing to replace the option string passed to several `TMVA` functions such as the `TMVA::Factory` constructor, the `DataLoader::PrepareTrainingAndTestTree` and `Factory::BookMethod` using Python function arguments.; For example instead of writing an option string `""NTrees=500:BoostType=AdaBoost""` one can use in Python `NTrees=500,BoostType='AdaBoost'`.; The new tmva tutorials `TMVA_Higgs_Classification.py`, `TMVA_CNN_Classificaion.py` and `TMVA_RNN_Classificaton.py` provide examples of using these new pythonizations. ## 2D Graphics Libraries. - Implement the option ""File"": The current file name is painted on the bottom right of each plot; if the option `File` is set on via `gStyle->SetOptFile()`. - In matplolib one can use the ""Default X-Points"" feature to plot X/Y graphs: If one doesn't; specify the points in the x-axis, they will get the default values 0, 1, 2, 3, (etc. depending; on the length of the y-points).

The effects; of non-linearity and numerical roundoff both become more important as; the external value gets closer to one of the limits (expressed as the; distance to nearest limit divided by distance between limits). The user; must therefore be aware of the fact that, for example, if they put limits; of $(0,10^{10})$ on a parameter, then the values $0.0$ and $1.0$ will be; indistinguishable to the accuracy of most machines. For this purpose single sided limits on parameters are provided by M ,; with their transformation being:. Lower bound $a$:. $$\begin{aligned}; P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \pm\sqrt{(P_{\mathrm{ext}} - a + 1)^2 - 1} \\; P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& a - 1 + \sqrt{P_{\mathrm{int}}^2 + 1} \end{aligned}$$. Upper bound $b$:. $$\begin{aligned}; P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \pm\sqrt{(b - P_{\mathrm{ext}} + 1)^2 - 1} \\; P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& b + 1 - \sqrt{P_{\mathrm{int}}^2 + 1} \end{aligned}$$. The transformation of course also affects the parameter error matrix, so; M does a transformation of the error matrix (and the ""parabolic""; parameter errors) when there are parameter limits. Users should however; realize that the transformation is only a linear approximation, and that; it cannot give a meaningful result if one or more parameters is very; close to a limit, where; $\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}} / \partial P_{\mathrm{int}} \approx 0$.; Therefore, it is recommended that:. - Limits on variable parameters should be used only when needed in; order to prevent the parameter from taking on unphysical values. - When a satisfactory minimum has been found using limits, the limits; should then be removed if possible, in order to perform or; re-perform the error analysis without limits. Further discussion of the effects of parameter limits may be found in; the last chapter. ## M strategy ##.

In the best case, where the minimum is far from any limits, `Minuit`; will correctly transform the error matrix, and the parameter errors it; reports should be accurate and very close to those you would have got; without limits. In other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you would not need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. #### Interpretation of Parameter Errors. There are two kinds of problems that can arise: the reliability of; `Minuit`'s error estimates, and their statistical interpretation,; assuming they are accurate. #### Statistical Interpretation. For discussion of basic concepts, such as the meaning of the elements; of the error matrix, or setting of exact confidence levels see the; articles:. - F.James.

North-Holland, 1971*. ### Reliability of Minuit Error Estimates. `Minuit` always carries around its own current estimates of the; parameter errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how; accurate they are at any given point in the execution. For example, at; initialization, these estimates are just the starting step sizes as; specified by the user. After a `HESSE` step, the errors are usually; quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. `Minuit`, when it; prints out err",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:59908,reliab,reliability,59908,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,2,"['error', 'reliab']","['error', 'reliability']"

[api:strategy] Sets the strategy to be used in calculating first and; second derivatives and in certain minimization methods.

Availability,"'s programs make extensive use of ``#include``, and it is unrealistic to assume that all of this code will change overnight. Instead, modules automatically translate ``#include`` directives into the corresponding module import. For example, the include directive. .. code-block:: c. #include <stdio.h>. will be automatically mapped to an import of the module ``std.io``. Even with specific ``import`` syntax in the language, this particular feature is important for both adoption and backward compatibility: automatic translation of ``#include`` to ``import`` allows an application to get the benefits of modules (for all modules-enabled libraries) without any changes to the application itself. Thus, users can easily use modules with one compiler while falling back to the preprocessor-inclusion mechanism with other compilers. .. note::. The automatic mapping of ``#include`` to ``import`` also solves an implementation problem: importing a module with a definition of some entity (say, a ``struct Point``) and then parsing a header containing another definition of ``struct Point`` would cause a redefinition error, even if it is the same ``struct Point``. By mapping ``#include`` to ``import``, the compiler can guarantee that it always sees just the already-parsed definition from the module. While building a module, ``#include_next`` is also supported, with one caveat.; The usual behavior of ``#include_next`` is to search for the specified filename; in the list of include paths, starting from the path *after* the one; in which the current file was found.; Because files listed in module maps are not found through include paths, a; different strategy is used for ``#include_next`` directives in such files: the; list of include paths is searched for the specified header name, to find the; first include path that would refer to the current file. ``#include_next`` is; interpreted as if the current file had been found in that path.; If this search finds a file named by a module map, the",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:10435,error,error,10435,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['error'],['error']

The first command, `TProof::Open(const char*)` starts a local PROOF; server (if no arguments are specified, all cores will be used), and the; command `ch->SetProof();` enables processing of the chain using PROOF.; Now, when issuing the command `ch->Process(""MySelector.C+);`, the code; in `MySelector.C` is compiled and executed on each slave node. The; methods `Begin()` and `Terminate()` are executed on the master only. The; list of n-tuple files is analysed, and portions of the data are assigned; to the available slave processes. Histograms booked in `SlaveBegin()`; exist in the processes on the slave nodes, and are filled accordingly.; Upon termination, the PROOF master collects the histograms from the; slaves and merges them. In `Terminate()` all merged histograms are; available and can be inspected, analysed or stored.

Precision in Wording; A detail is that we have tried really hard to make the diagnostics that come; out of clang contain exactly the pertinent information about what is wrong and; why. In the example above, we tell you what the inferred types are for; the left and right hand sides, and we don't repeat what is obvious from the; point (e.g., that this is a ""binary +"").; Many other examples abound. In the following example, not only do we tell you; that there is a problem with the *; and point to it, we say exactly why and tell you what the type is (in case it is; a complicated subexpression, such as a call to an overloaded function). This; sort of attention to detail makes it much easier to understand and fix problems; quickly. $ gcc-4.9 -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:5:11: error: invalid type argument of unary '*' (have 'int'); return *SomeA.X;; ^; $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:5:11: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('int' invalid); int y = *SomeA.X;; ^~~~~~~~. Typedef Preservation and Selective Unwrapping; Many programmers use high-level user defined types, typedefs, and other; syntactic sugar to refer to types in their program. This is useful because they; can abbreviate otherwise very long types and it is useful to preserve the; typename in diagnostics. However, sometimes very simple typedefs can wrap; trivial types and it is important to strip off the typedef to understand what; is going on. Clang aims to handle both cases well.; The following example shows where it is important to preserve; a typedef in C. $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:15:11: error: can't convert between vector values of different size ('__m128' and 'int const *'); myvec[1]/P;; ~~~~~~~~^~.

A **`TGraphQQ`** allows drawing quantile-quantile plots. Such plots; can be drawn for two datasets, or for one dataset and a theoretical; distribution function. ### Two Datasets. ![Examples of qq-plots of 2 datasets](pictures/03000056.png). Quantile-quantile plots are used to determine whether two samples come; from the same distribution. A qq-plot draws the quantiles of one; dataset against the quantile of the other. The quantiles of the; dataset with fewer entries are on Y-axis, with more entries - on; X-axis. A straight line, going through 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles is also; plotted for reference. It represents a robust linear fit, not; sensitive to the extremes of the datasets. If the datasets come from; the same distribution, points of the plot should fall approximately on; the 45 degrees line. If they have the same distribution function, but; different parameters of location or scale, they should still fall on; the straight line, but not the 45 degrees one. The greater their departure from the straight line, the more evidence; there is that the datasets come from different distributions. The; advantage of qq-plot is that it not only shows that the underlying; distributions are different, but, unlike the analytical methods, it; also gives information on the nature of this difference: heavier; tails, different location/scale, different shape, etc. ### One Dataset. ![Examples of qq-plots of 1 dataset](pictures/03000057.png).

On a practical note, it's often said that an automatic binder can provide; bindings to 95% of your code out-of-the-box, with only the remaining part; needing manual intervention.; This is broadly true, but realize that that 5% contains the most difficult; cases and is where 20-30% of the effort would have gone in case the bindings; were done fully manually.; It is therefore important to consider what manual tools an automatic binder; offers and to make sure they fit your work style and needs, because you are; going to spend a significant amount of time with them. `LLVM dependency`; -----------------. cppyy depends on `LLVM`_, through Cling.; LLVM is properly internalized, so that it doesn't conflict with other uses;; and in particular it is fine to mix `Numba`_ and cppyy code.; It does mean a download cost of about 20MB for the binary wheel (exact size; differs per platform) on installation, and additional `primarily initial`; memory overheads at run-time.; Whether this is onerous depends strongly not only on the application, but; also on the rest of the software stack. The initial cost of loading cppyy, and thus starting the Cling interpreter,; is about 45MB (platform dependent).; Initial uses of standard (e.g. STL) C++ results in deserialization of the; precompiled header at another eventual total cost of about 25MB (again,; platform dependent).; The actual bindings of course also carry overheads.; As a rule of thumb, you should budget for ~100MB all-in for the overhead; caused by the bindings. Other binders do not have this initial memory overhead, but do of course; occur an overhead per module, class, function, etc.; At scale, however, cppyy has some advantages: all binding is lazy (including; the option of automatic loading), standard classes are never duplicated, and; there is no additional ""per-module"" overhead.; Thus, eventually (depending",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:8068,down,download,8068,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['down'],['download']

Error values can be implicitly converted to bool: true for error, false for; success, enabling the following idiom:. .. code-block:: c++. Error mayFail();. Error foo() {; if (auto Err = mayFail()); return Err;; // Success! We can proceed.; ... For functions that can fail but need to return a value the ``Expected<T>``; utility can be used. Values of this type can be constructed with either a; ``T``, or an ``Error``. Expected<T> values are also implicitly convertible to; boolean, but with the opposite convention to ``Error``: true for success, false; for error. If success, the ``T`` value can be accessed via the dereference; operator. If failure, the ``Error`` value can be extracted using the; ``takeError()`` method. Idiomatic usage looks like:. .. code-block:: c++.

To avoid exposing templated parameter to the users, typedefs are; defined for all types of vectors based on doubles. See in the examples; for all the possible types of vector classes, which can be constructed; by users with the available coordinate system types. #### Coordinate System Tag. The 2D and 3D points and vector classes can be associated to a tag; defining the coordinate system. This can be used to distinguish between; vectors of different coordinate systems like global or local vectors.; The coordinate system tag is a template parameter of the; **`ROOT::Math::`**`DisplacementVector3D` and; `ROOT::Math::PositionVector3D` (and also for 2D classes). A default tag; exists for users who do not need this functionality,; `ROOT::Math::DefaultCoordinateSystemTag`. #### Transformations. The transformations are modeled using simple (non-template) classes,; using double as the scalar type to avoid too large numerical errors. The; transformations are grouped in rotations (in 3 dimensions), Lorentz; transformations and Poincare transformations, which are; translation`/`rotation combinations. Each group has several members; which may model physically equivalent transformations but with different; internal representations. Transformation classes can operate on all type; of vectors by using the operator `() `or the operator `*` and the; transformations can be combined via the operator `*`. The available; transformations are:. - 3D rotation classes. - rotation described by a 3x3 matrix (**`ROOT::Math::Rotation3D`**). - rotation described by Euler angles (**`ROOT::Math::EulerAngles`**). - rotation described by a direction axis and an angle; (**`ROOT::Math::AxisAngle`**). - rotation described by a quaternion (**`ROOT::Math::Quaternion`**). - optimized rotation around `x` (**`ROOT::Math::RotationX`**), `y`; (**`ROOT::Math::RotationY`**) and `z` (",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:72622,error,errors,72622,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['error'],['errors']

Any exceptions that; were made to move into experimental mode must have been fixed **before**; becoming official. * The test coverage needs to be broad and well written (small tests,; well documented).

This mode requires writing AST matchers; that explicitly traverse or ignore implicit nodes, such as parentheses; surrounding an expression or expressions with cleanups. These implicit; nodes are not always obvious from the syntax of the source code, and so this; mode requires careful consideration and testing to get the desired behavior; from an AST matcher. In addition, because template instantiations are matched in the default mode,; transformations can be accidentally made to template declarations. Finally,; because implicit nodes are matched by default, transformations can be made on; entirely incorrect places in the code.; For these reasons, it is possible to ignore AST nodes which are not spelled; in the source using the IgnoreUnlessSpelledInSource; mode. This is likely to be far less error-prone for users who are not already; very familiar with where implicit nodes appear in the AST. It is also likely; to be less error-prone for experienced AST users, as difficult cases do not; need to be encountered and matcher expressions adjusted for these cases.; In clang-query, the mode can be changed with. set traversal IgnoreUnlessSpelledInSource. This affects both matchers and AST dump output in results. When using the C++ API such as in clang-tidy checks, the; traverse() matcher is used to set the mode:.

Examples matching error: ""variable has incomplete type 'struct s'"". .. code-block:: c++. // expected-error {{variable has incomplete type 'struct s'}}; // expected-error {{variable has incomplete type}}; // expected-error {{{variable has incomplete type}}}; // expected-error {{{{variable has incomplete type}}}}. // expected-error-re {{variable has type 'struct {{.}}'}}; // expected-error-re {{variable has type 'struct {{.*}}'}}; // expected-error-re {{variable has type 'struct {{(.*)}}'}}; // expected-error-re {{variable has type 'struct{{[[:space:]](.*)}}'}}. Feature Test Macros; ===================; Clang implements several ways to test whether a feature is supported or not.; Some of these feature tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid co",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:162458,error,error-re,162458,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['error'],['error-re']

Reads a vector from memory according to the provided mask. The mask holds a bit for each vector lane, and is used to prevent memory accesses to the masked-off lanes.

The return type, underlying type of the base pointer and the type of the '``passthru``' operand are the same vector types. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.load``' intrinsic is designed for conditional reading of selected vector elements in a single IR operation. It is useful for targets that support vector masked loads and allows vectorizing predicated basic blocks on these targets. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of branches that guard scalar load operations.; The result of this operation is equivalent to a regular vector load instruction followed by a 'select' between the loaded and the passthru values, predicated on the same mask.

Note that here we benefit from another new feature: the implicit call to [RooFit::RooConst()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/group__CmdArgs.html#gaabf71812817894196e743cf2ef1d1e7b) when passing raw numbers to the RooFit collection constructors. #### Allow for use of Python collections instead of C++ STL containers. Some RooFit functions take STL map-like types such as `std::map` as parameters, for example the [RooCategory constructor](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooCategory.html#ae63ae78231765d184b7a839c74746a49). In the past, you had to create the correct C++ class in Python, but now you can usually pass a Python dictionary instead. For example, a RooCategory can be created like this:; ```Python; sample = ROOT.RooCategory(""sample"", ""sample"", {""Sample1"": 1, ""Sample2"": 2, ""Sample3"": 3}); ```. #### RooWorkspace accessors. In Python, you can now get objects stored in a [RooWorkspace](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooWorkspace.html) with the item retrieval operator, and the return value is also always downcasted to the correct type. That means in Python you don't have to use [RooWorkspace::var()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooWorkspace.html#acf5f9126ee264c234721a4ed1f9bf837) to access variables or [RooWorkspace::pdf()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooWorkspace.html#afa7384cece424a1a94a644bb05549eee) to access pdfs, but you can always get any object using square brackets. For example:; ```Python; # w is a RooWorkspace instance that contains the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` for which we want to generate toy data:; model.generate({w[""x""], w[""y""], w[""z""]}, 1000); ```. ### New PyROOT functions for interoperability with NumPy and Pandas. New member functions of RooFit classes were introduced exclusively to PyROOT for better interoperability between RooFit and Numpy and Pandas:. - `RooDataSet.from_numpy`: Import a RooDataSet from a dictionary of numpy arrays (static method); - `RooDataSet.to_numpy`: Export a RooDataSet to a dictionary of numpy arrays; - `RooDat",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md:22027,down,downcasted,22027,README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,1,['down'],['downcasted']

In the archive walking example above ``BadFileFormat`` errors are simply; consumed and ignored. If the client had wanted report these errors after; completing the walk over the archive they could use the ``joinErrors`` utility:. .. code-block:: c++. Error walkArchive(Archive A) {; Error DeferredErrs = Error::success();; for (unsigned I = 0; I != A.numMembers(); ++I) {; auto ChildOrErr = A.getMember(I);; if (auto Err = ChildOrErr.takeError()); if (Err.isA<BadFileFormat>()); DeferredErrs = joinErrors(std::move(DeferredErrs), std::move(Err));; else; return Err;; auto &Child = *ChildOrErr;; // Use Child; ...; }; return DeferredErrs;; }. The ``joinErrors`` routine builds a special error type called ``ErrorList``,; which holds a list of user defined errors. The ``handleErrors`` routine; recognizes this type and will attempt to handle each of the contained errors in; order.

The rules for objects are covered in the next section. A :arc-term:`retainable object pointer` (or ""retainable pointer"") is a value of; a :arc-term:`retainable object pointer type` (""retainable type""). There are; three kinds of retainable object pointer types:. * block pointers (formed by applying the caret (``^``) declarator sigil to a; function type); * Objective-C object pointers (``id``, ``Class``, ``NSFoo*``, etc.); * typedefs marked with ``__attribute__((NSObject))``.

We are not at liberty to require all code to be recompiled with ARC;; therefore, ARC must interoperate with Objective-C code which manages retains; and releases manually. In general, there are three requirements in order for; a compiler-supported reference-count system to provide reliable; interoperation:. * The type system must reliably identify which objects are to be managed. An; ``int*`` might be a pointer to a ``malloc``'ed array, or it might be an; interior pointer to such an array, or it might point to some field or local; variable. In contrast, values of the retainable object pointer types are; never interior. * The type system must reliably indicate how to manage objects of a type.; This usually means that the type must imply a procedure for incrementing; and decrementing retain counts. Supporting single-ownership objects; requires a lot more explicit mediation in the language. * There must be reliable conventions for whether and when ""ownership"" is; passed between caller and callee, for both arguments and return values.; Objective-C methods follow such a convention very reliably, at least for; system libraries on macOS, and functions always pass objects at +0.

Target Triple; -------------. The basic option is to define the target architecture. For that, use; ``-target <triple>``. If you don't specify the target, CPU names won't; match (since Clang assumes the host triple), and the compilation will; go ahead, creating code for the host platform, which will break later; on when assembling or linking. The triple has the general format ``<arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<env>``, where:; * ``arch`` = ``x86_64``, ``i386``, ``arm``, ``thumb``, ``mips``, etc.; * ``sub`` = for ex. on ARM: ``v5``, ``v6m``, ``v7a``, ``v7m``, etc.; * ``vendor`` = ``pc``, ``apple``, ``nvidia``, ``ibm``, etc.; * ``sys`` = ``none``, ``linux``, ``win32``, ``darwin``, ``cuda``, etc.; * ``env`` = ``eabi``, ``gnu``, ``android``, ``macho``, ``elf``, etc. The sub-architecture options are available for their own architectures,; of course, so ""x86v7a"" doesn't make sense. The vendor needs to be; specified only if there's a relevant change, for instance between PC; and Apple. Most of the time it can be omitted (and Unknown); will be assumed, which sets the defaults for the specified architecture.; The system name is generally the OS (linux, darwin), but could be special; like the bare-metal ""none"". When a parameter is not important, it can be omitted, or you can; choose ``unknown`` and the defaults will be used. If you choose a parameter; that Clang doesn't know, like ``blerg``, it'll ignore and assume; ``unknown``, which is not always desired, so be careful. Finally, the env (environment) option is something that will pick default; CPU/FPU, define the specific behaviour of your code (PCS, extensions),; and also choose the correct library calls, etc. CPU, FPU, ABI; -------------.

To implement this rule, the compiler requires a linear representation of; statements to understand the ordering and the adjacency between the two or more; assignments. The Clang CFG is used to implement this analysis as Clang CFG; provides a linear view of statements within each ``CFGBlock`` (Clang; ``CFGBlock`` represents a single basic block in a source-level CFG). Bounds check optimizations; ==========================. In ``-fbounds-safety``, the Clang frontend emits run-time checks for every; memory dereference if the type system or analyses in the frontend couldn’t; verify its bounds safety. The implementation relies on LLVM optimizations to; remove redundant run-time checks. Using this optimization strategy, if the; original source code already has bounds checks, the fewer additional checks; ``-fbounds-safety`` will introduce. The LLVM ``ConstraintElimination`` pass is; design to remove provable redundant checks (please check Florian Hahn’s; presentation in 2021 LLVM Dev Meeting and the implementation to learn more). In; the following example, ``-fbounds-safety`` implicitly adds the redundant bounds; checks that the optimizer can remove:. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; for (size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; // implicit bounds checks:; // if (p + i < p || p + i + 1 > p + count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. ``ConstraintElimination`` collects the following facts and determines if the; bounds checks can be safely removed:. * Inside the for-loop, ``0 <= i < count``, hence ``1 <= i + 1 <= count``.; * Pointer arithmetic ``p + count`` in the if-condition doesn’t wrap.; * ``-fbounds-safety`` treats pointer arithmetic overflow as deterministically; two’s complement computation, not an undefined behavior. Therefore,; getelementptr does not typically have inbounds keyword.

The tool would simplify the code to:. ```c++; void Example() {; f();; g();; }; ```. We can solve this problem with a classic constant propagation lattice combined; with symbolic evaluation. ## Example: finding inefficient usages of associative containers. Real-world code often accidentally performs repeated lookups in associative; containers:. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; xs[42]->name = ""..."";; xs[42]->title = ""..."";; ```. To find the above inefficiency we can use the available expressions analysis to; understand that `m[42]` is evaluated twice. ```c++; map<int, Employee> xs;; Employee &e = xs[42];; e->name = ""..."";; e->title = ""..."";; ```. We can also track the `m.contains()` check in the flow condition to find; redundant checks, like in the example below. ```c++; std::map<int, Employee> xs;; if (!xs.contains(42)) {; xs.insert({42, someEmployee});; }; ```. ## Example: refactoring types that implicitly convert to each other. Refactoring one strong type to another is difficult, but the compiler can help:; once you refactor one reference to the type, the compiler will flag other places; where this information flows with type mismatch errors. Unfortunately this; strategy does not work when you are refactoring types that implicitly convert to; each other, for example, replacing `int32_t` with `int64_t`. Imagine that we want to change user IDs from 32 to 64-bit integers. In other; words, we need to find all integers tainted with user IDs. We can use data flow; analysis to implement taint analysis. ```c++; void UseUser(int32_t user_id) {; int32_t id = user_id;; // Variable `id` is tainted with a user ID.; ...; }; ```. Taint analysis is very well suited to this problem because the program rarely; branches on user IDs, and almost certainly does not perform any computation; (like arithmetic).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:29720,error,errors,29720,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,", <2 x i1> <mask>, <2 x i64> <passthru>). Overview:; """""""""""""""""". Reads a number of scalar values sequentially from memory location provided in '``ptr``' and spreads them in a vector. The '``mask``' holds a bit for each vector lane. The number of elements read from memory is equal to the number of '1' bits in the mask. The loaded elements are positioned in the destination vector according to the sequence of '1' and '0' bits in the mask. E.g., if the mask vector is '10010001', ""expandload"" reads 3 values from memory addresses ptr, ptr+1, ptr+2 and places them in lanes 0, 3 and 7 accordingly. The masked-off lanes are filled by elements from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the base pointer for the load. It has the same underlying type as the element of the returned vector. The second operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values with the same number of elements as the return type. The third is a pass-through value that is used to fill the masked-off lanes of the result. The return type and the type of the '``passthru``' operand have the same vector type. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.expandload``' intrinsic is designed for reading multiple scalar values from adjacent memory addresses into possibly non-adjacent vector lanes.

Availability,", ARC is not exception-safe for normal releases:. * It does not end the lifetime of ``__strong`` variables when their scopes are; abnormally terminated by an exception.; * It does not perform releases which would occur at the end of a; full-expression if that full-expression throws an exception. A program may be compiled with the option ``-fobjc-arc-exceptions`` in order to; enable these, or with the option ``-fno-objc-arc-exceptions`` to explicitly; disable them, with the last such argument ""winning"". .. admonition:: Rationale. The standard Cocoa convention is that exceptions signal programmer error and; are not intended to be recovered from. Making code exceptions-safe by; default would impose severe runtime and code size penalties on code that; typically does not actually care about exceptions safety. Therefore,; ARC-generated code leaks by default on exceptions, which is just fine if the; process is going to be immediately terminated anyway. Programs which do care; about recovering from exceptions should enable the option. In Objective-C++, ``-fobjc-arc-exceptions`` is enabled by default. .. admonition:: Rationale. C++ already introduces pervasive exceptions-cleanup code of the sort that ARC; introduces. C++ programmers who have not already disabled exceptions are; much more likely to actual require exception-safety. ARC does end the lifetimes of ``__weak`` objects when an exception terminates; their scope unless exceptions are disabled in the compiler. .. admonition:: Rationale. The consequence of a local ``__weak`` object not being destroyed is very; likely to be corruption of the Objective-C runtime, so we want to be safer; here. Of course, potentially massive leaks are about as likely to take down; the process as this corruption is if the program does try to recover from; exceptions. .. _arc.misc.interior:.

Availability,", but that is target specific. .. _dso_local_equivalent:. DSO Local Equivalent; --------------------. ``dso_local_equivalent @func``. A '``dso_local_equivalent``' constant represents a function which is; functionally equivalent to a given function, but is always defined in the; current linkage unit. The resulting pointer has the same type as the underlying; function. The resulting pointer is permitted, but not required, to be different; from a pointer to the function, and it may have different values in different; translation units. The target function may not have ``extern_weak`` linkage. ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as such:. - If the function has local linkage, hidden visibility, or is; ``dso_local``, ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as simply a pointer; to the function.; - ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented with a stub that tail-calls the; function. Many targets support relocations that resolve at link time to either; a function or a stub for it, depending on if the function is defined within the; linkage unit; LLVM will use this when available. (This is commonly called a; ""PLT stub"".) On other targets, the stub may need to be emitted explicitly. This can be used wherever a ``dso_local`` instance of a function is needed without; needing to explicitly make the original function ``dso_local``. An instance where; this can be used is for static offset calculations between a function and some other; ``dso_local`` symbol. This is especially useful for the Relative VTables C++ ABI,; where dynamic relocations for function pointers in VTables can be replaced with; static relocations for offsets between the VTable and virtual functions which; may not be ``dso_local``.

Availability,", it is; scanned and rebuilt according to the information in the record header.; The recovery algorithm reads the file and creates the saved objects in; memory according to the header information. It then rebuilds the; directory and file structure. If the file is opened in write mode, the; recovery makes the correction on disk when the file is closed; however; if the file is opened in read mode, the correction can not be written to; disk. You can also explicitly invoke the recovery procedure by calling; the `TFile::Recover()` method. You can recover the directory structure,; but you cannot save what you recovered to the file on disk. In the; following example, we interrupted and aborted the previous ROOT session,; causing the file not to be closed. When we start a new session and; attempt to open the file, it gives us an explanation and status on the; recovery attempt. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f(""demo.root""); Warning in <TFile::TFile>: file demo.root probably not closed, trying to recover successfully recovered 15 keys; ```. ## The Logical ROOT File: TFile and TKey. We saw that the `TFile::Map()` method reads the file sequentially and; prints information about each record while scanning the file. It is not; feasible to support only sequential access and hence ROOT provides; random or direct access, i.e. reading a specified object at a time. To; do so, `TFile` keeps a list of **`TKeys`**, which is; essentially an index to the objects in the file. The **`TKey`** class; describes the record headers of objects in the file. For example, we can; get the list of keys and print them. To find a specific object on the; file we can use the **`TFile::Get()` method.**. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f(""demo.root""); root[] f.GetListOfKeys()->Print(); TKey Name = h0, Title = histo nr:0, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = h1, Title = histo nr:1, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = h2, Title = histo nr:2, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = h3, Title = histo nr:3, Cycle = 1; TKey Name = h4, Title = histo nr:4, Cycle = 1; TKey",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:16236,recover,recover,16236,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,2,['recover'],"['recover', 'recovered']"

The conversion itself is expressed by a; conversion operator in that closure type that produces a block pointer with the; same signature as the lambda itself, e.g.,. .. code-block:: objc. operator NSComparisonResult (^)(id, id)() const;. This conversion function returns a new block that simply forwards the two; parameters to the lambda object (which it captures by copy), then returns the; result. The returned block is first copied (with ``Block_copy``) and then; autoreleased. As an optimization, if a lambda expression is immediately; converted to a block pointer (as in the first example, above), then the block; is not copied and autoreleased: rather, it is given the same lifetime as a; block literal written at that point in the program, which avoids the overhead; of copying a block to the heap in the common case. The conversion from a lambda to a block pointer is only available in; Objective-C++, and not in C++ with blocks, due to its use of Objective-C memory; management (autorelease).

When the register allocator runs, debugging instructions do not directly refer; to any virtual registers, and thus there is no need for expensive location; maintenance during regalloc (i.e. `LiveDebugVariables`). Debug instructions are; unlinked from the function, then linked back in after register allocation; completes. The exception is `PHI` instructions: these become implicit definitions at; control flow merges once regalloc finishes, and any debug numbers attached to; `PHI` instructions are lost. To circumvent this, debug numbers of `PHI`s are; recorded at the start of register allocation (`phi-node-elimination`), then; `DBG_PHI` instructions are inserted after regalloc finishes. This requires some; maintenance of which register a variable is located in during regalloc, but at; single positions (block entry points) rather than ranges of instructions. An example, before regalloc:. ```text; bb.2:; %2 = PHI %1, %bb.0, %2, %bb.1, debug-instr-number 1; ```. After:. ```text; bb.2:; DBG_PHI $rax, 1; ```. # `LiveDebugValues`. After optimisations and code layout complete, information about variable; values must be translated into variable locations, i.e. registers and stack; slots. This is performed in the [`LiveDebugValues` pass][LiveDebugValues], where; the debug instructions and machine code are separated out into two independent; functions:; * One that assigns values to variable names,; * One that assigns values to machine registers and stack slots. LLVM's existing SSA tools are used to place `PHI`s for each function, between; variable values and the values contained in machine locations, with value; propagation eliminating any unnecessary `PHI`s.

The `'prof'` and `'profs'` draw a; profile histogram (**`TProfile`**) rather than a regular 2D histogram; (**`TH2D`**) from an expression with two variables. If the expression; has three variables, a **`TProfile2D`** is generated. The '`profs`' generates a **`TProfile`** with error on the spread.

This affects some early C++11 code, including Boost's popular shared_ptr; up to version 1.47.0. The fix for Boost's shared_ptr is; available here. Objective-C++ compatibility. Implicit downcasts. Due to a bug in its implementation, GCC allows implicit downcasts; of Objective-C pointers (from a base class to a derived class) when; calling functions. Such code is inherently unsafe, since the object; might not actually be an instance of the derived class, and is; rejected by Clang. For example, given this code:. @interface Base @end; @interface Derived : Base @end. void f(Derived *p);; void g(Base *p) {; f(p);; }. Clang produces the following error:. downcast.mm:6:3: error: no matching function for call to 'f'; f(p);; ^; downcast.mm:4:6: note: candidate function not viable: cannot convert from; superclass 'Base *' to subclass 'Derived *' for 1st argument; void f(Derived *p);; ^. If the downcast is actually correct (e.g., because the code has; already checked that the object has the appropriate type), add an; explicit cast:. f((Derived *)base);. Using class as a property name. In C and Objective-C, class is a normal identifier and; can be used to name fields, ivars, methods, and so on. In; C++, class is a keyword. For compatibility with existing; code, Clang permits class to be used as part of a method; selector in Objective-C++, but this does not extend to any other part; of the language. In particular, it is impossible to use property dot; syntax in Objective-C++ with the property name class, so; the following code will fail to parse:. @interface I {; int cls;; }; + (int)class;; @end. @implementation I; - (int) Meth { return I.class; }; @end.

Availability,",; but %entry is not contained in the loop).; Note that a loop has to be in Loop Simplify Form beforehand; too for LoopRotate to be applied successfully. The main advantage of this form is that it allows hoisting; invariant instructions, especially loads, into the preheader.; That could be done in non-rotated loops as well but with; some disadvantages. Let's illustrate them with an example:. .. code-block:: C. for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; auto v = *p;; use(v);; }. We assume that loading from p is invariant and use(v) is some; statement that uses v.; If we wanted to execute the load only once we could move it; ""out"" of the loop body, resulting in this:. .. code-block:: C. auto v = *p;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; use(v);; }. However, now, in the case that n <= 0, in the initial form,; the loop body would never execute, and so, the load would; never execute. This is a problem mainly for semantic reasons.; Consider the case in which n <= 0 and loading from p is invalid.; In the initial program there would be no error. However, with this; transformation we would introduce one, effectively breaking; the initial semantics. To avoid both of these problems, we can insert a guard:. .. code-block:: C. if (n > 0) { // loop guard; auto v = *p;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; use(v);; }; }. This is certainly better but it could be improved slightly. Notice; that the check for whether n is bigger than 0 is executed twice (and; n does not change in between). Once when we check the guard condition; and once in the first execution of the loop. To avoid that, we could; do an unconditional first execution and insert the loop condition; in the end. This effectively means transforming the loop into a do-while loop:. .. code-block:: C. if (0 < n) {; auto v = *p;; do {; use(v);; ++i;; } while (i < n);; }. Note that LoopRotate does not generally do such; hoisting. Rather, it is an enabling transformation for other; passes like Loop-Invariant Code Motion (:ref:`-licm <passes-licm>`).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LoopTerminology.rst:23037,error,error,23037,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LoopTerminology.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LoopTerminology.rst,1,['error'],['error']

It now; means the ARC-style qualifier in all non-GC modes and is no longer; allowed if not enabled by either ``-fobjc-arc`` or ``-fobjc-weak``.; It is expected that ``-fobjc-weak`` will eventually be enabled by default; in all non-GC Objective-C modes. .. _objc-fixed-enum:. Enumerations with a fixed underlying type; -----------------------------------------. Clang provides support for C++11 enumerations with a fixed underlying type; within Objective-C. For example, one can write an enumeration type as:. .. code-block:: c++. typedef enum : unsigned char { Red, Green, Blue } Color;. This specifies that the underlying type, which is used to store the enumeration; value, is ``unsigned char``. Use ``__has_feature(objc_fixed_enum)`` to determine whether support for fixed; underlying types is available in Objective-C. Interoperability with C++11 lambdas; -----------------------------------. Clang provides interoperability between C++11 lambdas and blocks-based APIs, by; permitting a lambda to be implicitly converted to a block pointer with the; corresponding signature. For example, consider an API such as ``NSArray``'s; array-sorting method:. .. code-block:: objc. - (NSArray *)sortedArrayUsingComparator:(NSComparator)cmptr;. ``NSComparator`` is simply a typedef for the block pointer ``NSComparisonResult; (^)(id, id)``, and parameters of this type are generally provided with block; literals as arguments. However, one can also use a C++11 lambda so long as it; provides the same signature (in this case, accepting two parameters of type; ``id`` and returning an ``NSComparisonResult``):. .. code-block:: objc.

If you add the following preprocessor statements:. ``` {.cpp}; #if !defined(__CLING__); int gArray[] = { 2, 3, 4};; #elif defined(__ROOTCLING__); int gArray[];; #endif; ```. `gArray` will be visible to `rootcling` but still not visible to Cling.; If you use ACLiC, `gArray` will be available at the command line and; be initialized properly by the compiled code. We recommend you always write scripts with the needed include; statements. In most cases, the script will still run with the; interpreter. However, a few header files are not handled very well by; Cling. These types of headers can be included in interpreted and compiled; mode:. - The subset of standard C/C++ headers defined in; `$ROOTSYS/Cling/include.`. - Headers of classes defined in a previously loaded library; (including ROOT own). The defined class must have a name known to; ROOT (i.e. a class with a `ClassDef`). Hiding header files from `rootcling` that are necessary for the; compiler but optional for the interpreter can lead to a subtle but; fatal error. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; #ifndef __CLING__; #include ""TTree.h""; #else; class TTree;; #endif. class subTree : public TTree {; };; ```.

The factory has two goals:; the first is to provide a back-end for higher level factories and tools to process; the creation of objects. The second is to provide a simple end-user language to; populate a RooWorkspace with function and p.d.f. objects.

If only the matrix shape is defined in the constructor, matrix data has; to be supplied and possibly the sparse structure. In ""Setting; Properties"" was discussed how to set the sparse structure. Several methods exist to fill a matrix with data:. `SetMatrixArray(const Double_t*data,Option_t*option="""")`, copies the; array data. If option`=""F""`, the array fills the matrix column-wise else; row-wise. This option is only implemented for **`TMatrixD`** and; **`TMatrixDSym`**. It is expected that the array data contains at least; `fNelems` entries. `SetMatrixArray(Int_t nr,Int_t *irow,Int_t *icol,Double_t *data)`, is; only available for sparse matrices. The three arrays should each contain; `nr` entries with row index, column index and data entry. Only the; entries with non-zero data value are inserted!. `operator() `or `operator[]`, these operators provide the easiest way to; fill a matrix but are in particular for a sparse matrix expensive. If no; entry for slot (`i,j`) is found in the sparse index table it will be; entered, which involves some memory management! Therefore, before; invoking this method in a loop it is wise to set the index table first; through a call to the `SetSparseIndex` method. `SetSub(Int_t row_lwb,Int_t col_lwb,const TMatrixDBase &source)`, the; matrix to be inserted at position `(row_lwb,col_lwb)` can be both, dense; or sparse. `Use(...)` allows inserting another matrix or data array without; actually copying the data.

Here is a list of the current error messages and their potential cause:. - ``""corrupted chunk header""``: the checksum verification of the chunk header; has failed. This is likely due to one of two things: the header was; overwritten (partially or totally), or the pointer passed to the function is; not a chunk at all;. - ``""race on chunk header""``: two different threads are attempting to manipulate; the same header at the same time. This is usually symptomatic of a; race-condition or general lack of locking when performing operations on that; chunk;. - ``""invalid chunk state""``: the chunk is not in the expected state for a given; operation, eg: it is not allocated when trying to free it, or it's not; quarantined when trying to recycle it, etc. A double-free is the typical; reason this error would occur;. - ``""misaligned pointer""``: we strongly enforce basic alignment requirements, 8; bytes on 32-bit platforms, 16 bytes on 64-bit platforms.

Availability,"-----------------------------------------------------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for expanding load and compressing store operations. Data selected from a vector according to a mask is stored in consecutive memory addresses (compressed store), and vice-versa (expanding load). These operations effective map to ""if (cond.i) a[j++] = v.i"" and ""if (cond.i) v.i = a[j++]"" patterns, respectively. Note that when the mask starts with '1' bits followed by '0' bits, these operations are identical to :ref:`llvm.masked.store <int_mstore>` and :ref:`llvm.masked.load <int_mload>`. .. _int_expandload:. '``llvm.masked.expandload.*``' Intrinsics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Syntax:; """"""""""""""; This is an overloaded intrinsic. Several values of integer, floating point or pointer data type are loaded from consecutive memory addresses and stored into the elements of a vector according to the mask. ::. declare <16 x float> @llvm.masked.expandload.v16f32 (ptr <ptr>, <16 x i1> <mask>, <16 x float> <passthru>); declare <2 x i64> @llvm.masked.expandload.v2i64 (ptr <ptr>, <2 x i1> <mask>, <2 x i64> <passthru>). Overview:; """""""""""""""""". Reads a number of scalar values sequentially from memory location provided in '``ptr``' and spreads them in a vector. The '``mask``' holds a bit for each vector lane. The number of elements read from memory is equal to the number of '1' bits in the mask. The loaded elements are positioned in the destination vector according to the sequence of '1' and '0' bits in the mask. E.g., if the mask vector is '10010001', ""expandload"" reads 3 values from memory addresses ptr, ptr+1, ptr+2 and places them in lanes 0, 3 and 7 accordingly. The masked-off lanes are filled by elements from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the base pointer for the load. It has the same underlying type as the element of the returned vector.

Clang is designed to be built as part of an LLVM build. Assuming that the LLVM; source code is located at $LLVM_SRC_ROOT, then the clang source code should be; installed as:. $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/tools/clang. The directory is not required to be called clang, but doing so will allow the; LLVM build system to automatically recognize it and build it along with LLVM. //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; // Step 2: Configure and Build LLVM; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//. Configure and build your copy of LLVM (see $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/GettingStarted.html; for more information). Assuming you installed clang at $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/tools/clang then Clang will; automatically be built with LLVM. Otherwise, run 'make' in the Clang source; directory to build Clang. //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; // Step 3: (Optional) Verify Your Build; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//. It is a good idea to run the Clang tests to make sure your build works; correctly. From inside the Clang build directory, run 'make test' to run the; tests. //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; // Step 4: Install Clang; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//. From inside the Clang build directory, run 'make install' to install the Clang; compiler and header files into the prefix directory selected when LLVM was; configured.

Support is added to define language specific memory spaces so they can; be used in a consistent way by consumers. See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-memory-spaces`.

The vendor extension encoding space for DWARF expression operations; accommodates only 32 unique operations. In practice, the lack of a central; registry and a desire for backwards compatibility means vendor extensions are; never retired, even when standard versions are accepted into DWARF proper. This; has produced a situation where the effective encoding space available for new; vendor extensions is miniscule today. To expand this encoding space a new DWARF operation ``DW_OP_LLVM_user`` is; added which acts as a ""prefix"" for vendor extensions. It is followed by a; ULEB128 encoded vendor extension opcode, which is then followed by the operands; of the corresponding vendor extension operation. This approach allows all remaining operations defined in these extensions to be; encoded without conflicting with existing vendor extensions.

Availability,"----------------------. One thing about LLVM that turns off many people is that it does not; solve all the world's problems in one system. One specific; complaint is that people perceive LLVM as being incapable of performing; high-level language-specific optimization: LLVM ""loses too much; information"". Here are a few observations about this:. First, you're right that LLVM does lose information. For example, as of; this writing, there is no way to distinguish in the LLVM IR whether an; SSA-value came from a C ""int"" or a C ""long"" on an ILP32 machine (other; than debug info). Both get compiled down to an 'i32' value and the; information about what it came from is lost. The more general issue; here, is that the LLVM type system uses ""structural equivalence"" instead; of ""name equivalence"". Another place this surprises people is if you; have two types in a high-level language that have the same structure; (e.g. two different structs that have a single int field): these types; will compile down into a single LLVM type and it will be impossible to; tell what it came from. Second, while LLVM does lose information, LLVM is not a fixed target: we; continue to enhance and improve it in many different ways. In addition; to adding new features (LLVM did not always support exceptions or debug; info), we also extend the IR to capture important information for; optimization (e.g. whether an argument is sign or zero extended,; information about pointers aliasing, etc). Many of the enhancements are; user-driven: people want LLVM to include some specific feature, so they; go ahead and extend it. Third, it is *possible and easy* to add language-specific optimizations,; and you have a number of choices in how to do it. As one trivial; example, it is easy to add language-specific optimization passes that; ""know"" things about code compiled for a language. In the case of the C; family, there is an optimization pass that ""knows"" about the standard C; library functions. If you call ""exit(0)""",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst:9687,down,down,9687,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl10.rst,1,['down'],['down']

One may use; the attribute ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""address"")))`` (which has; deprecated synonyms `no_sanitize_address` and; `no_address_safety_analysis`) to disable instrumentation of a; particular function. This attribute may not be supported by other; compilers, so we suggest to use it together with; ``__has_feature(address_sanitizer)``. The same attribute used on a global variable prevents AddressSanitizer; from adding redzones around it and detecting out of bounds accesses.

A variable named ``V`` in an inner scope shadows (hides) any variables ``V``; in outer scopes. In particular, there are several cases:. * ``V`` in a record body shadows a global ``V``. * ``V`` in a record body shadows template argument ``V``. * ``V`` in template arguments shadows a global ``V``. * ``V`` in a ``foreach`` statement list shadows any ``V`` in surrounding record or; global scopes.

Availability,"------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for expanding load and compressing store operations. Data selected from a vector according to a mask is stored in consecutive memory addresses (compressed store), and vice-versa (expanding load). These operations effective map to ""if (cond.i) a[j++] = v.i"" and ""if (cond.i) v.i = a[j++]"" patterns, respectively. Note that when the mask starts with '1' bits followed by '0' bits, these operations are identical to :ref:`llvm.masked.store <int_mstore>` and :ref:`llvm.masked.load <int_mload>`. .. _int_expandload:. '``llvm.masked.expandload.*``' Intrinsics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Syntax:; """"""""""""""; This is an overloaded intrinsic. Several values of integer, floating point or pointer data type are loaded from consecutive memory addresses and stored into the elements of a vector according to the mask. ::. declare <16 x float> @llvm.masked.expandload.v16f32 (ptr <ptr>, <16 x i1> <mask>, <16 x float> <passthru>); declare <2 x i64> @llvm.masked.expandload.v2i64 (ptr <ptr>, <2 x i1> <mask>, <2 x i64> <passthru>). Overview:; """""""""""""""""". Reads a number of scalar values sequentially from memory location provided in '``ptr``' and spreads them in a vector. The '``mask``' holds a bit for each vector lane. The number of elements read from memory is equal to the number of '1' bits in the mask. The loaded elements are positioned in the destination vector according to the sequence of '1' and '0' bits in the mask. E.g., if the mask vector is '10010001', ""expandload"" reads 3 values from memory addresses ptr, ptr+1, ptr+2 and places them in lanes 0, 3 and 7 accordingly. The masked-off lanes are filled by elements from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the base pointer for the load.

This means that to `def` a `C` we must now provide 2 arguments that have type `int` (type checking applies here as it does elsewhere). This is going to look familiar if you have written C++. In C++ it might look like:; ```; template<int a, int b>; class C {; int c = a;; int d = b;; };; C<0, 1> X;; ```. If templates aren't your thing, another way to think of them is as parameters to the constructor of a class. . For instance Python code might look like this:; ```; class C(object):; def __init__(self, a, b):; self.c = a; self.d = b. print(C(0, 1).c); # prints ""0""; ```. ```tablegen; class C <int a, int b> {; int c = a;; int d = b;; }; def X: C<0> {}; ```. <stdin>:5:8: error: value not specified for template argument 'C:b'; def X: C<0> {}; ^; <stdin>:1:21: note: declared in 'C'; class C <int a, int b> {; ^. When not enough arguments are provided, you get an error. Below is what happens when one of those arguments is of the wrong type. ```tablegen; class C <int a, int b> {; int c = a;; int d = b;; }; def X: C<0, ""hello""> {}; ```. <stdin>:5:8: error: Value specified for template argument 'C:b' is of type string; expected type int: ""hello""; def X: C<0, ""hello""> {}; ^.

Availability,"->SetLineWith(2);; myVolume->SetLineStyle(kDotted);; ```. When drawing in solid mode, the color of the drawn volume corresponds to; the line color. #### Visibility Settings. The way geometry is build forces the definition of several volumes that; does not represent real objects, but just virtual containers used for; grouping and positioning volumes together. One would not want to see; them in the picture. Since every volume is by default visible, one has; to do this sort of tuning by its own:. ``` {.cpp}; myVolumeContainer->SetVisibility(kFALSE);; ```. As described before, the drawing package supports two main global; options: 1 (default) - only final volume leaves; 0 - all volumes down; the drawn one appear on the screen. The global visible level put a; limitation on the maximum applied depth. Combined with visibility; settings per volume, these can tune quite well what should appear on the; screen. However, there are situations when users want to see a volume; branch displayed down to the maximum depth, keeping at the same time a; limitation or even suppressing others. In order to accomplish that, one; should use the volume attribute: `Visible daughters`. By default, all; daughters of all volumes are displayed if there is no limitation related; with their level depth with respect to the top drawn volume. ### Ray Tracing. Ray tracing is a quite known drawing technique based on tracking rays; from the eye position through all pixels of a view port device.

In the methods of our RecursiveASTVisitor we can now use the full power; of the Clang AST to drill through to the parts that are interesting for; us.

Accessing the SourceManager and ASTContext; ==========================================. Some of the information about the AST, like source locations and global; identifier information, are not stored in the AST nodes themselves, but; in the ASTContext and its associated source manager.

Now that the ASTContext is available in the RecursiveASTVisitor, we can; do more interesting things with AST nodes, like looking up their source; locations:. ::. bool VisitCXXRecordDecl(CXXRecordDecl *Declaration) {; if (Declaration->getQualifiedNameAsString() == ""n::m::C"") {; // getFullLoc uses the ASTContext's SourceManager to resolve the source; // location and break it up into its line and column parts.; FullSourceLoc FullLocation = Context->getFullLoc(Declaration->getBeginLoc());; if (FullLocation.isValid()); llvm::outs() << ""Found declaration at ""; << FullLocation.getSpellingLineNumber() << "":""; << FullLocation.getSpellingColumnNumber() ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/RAVFrontendAction.rst:3645,avail,available,3645,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/RAVFrontendAction.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/RAVFrontendAction.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

After this, the lit runner can be used on the host; machine. It will prefix the benchmark and verification command lines with an; `ssh` command. Example:. ```bash; % cmake -G Ninja -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=path/to/clang \; -C ../test-suite/cmake/caches/target-arm64-iphoneos-internal.cmake \; -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \; -D TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST=mydevice \; ../test-suite; % ninja; % ninja rsync; % llvm-lit -j1 -o result.json .; ```. - You can specify a simulator for the target machine with the; `TEST_SUITE_RUN_UNDER` setting. The lit runner will prefix all benchmark; invocations with it. Running the test-suite via LNT; ------------------------------. The LNT tool can run the test-suite. Use this when submitting test results to; an LNT instance. See; [https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#llvm-cmake-test-suite](https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#llvm-cmake-test-suite); for details. Running the test-suite via Makefiles (deprecated); -------------------------------------------------. **Note**: The test-suite comes with a set of Makefiles that are considered; deprecated. They do not support newer testing modes like `Bitcode` or; `Microbenchmarks` and are harder to use.

This mode matches the emitted diagnostic when the; text appears as a substring at any position of the emitted message. To enable matching against desired strings that contain `}}` or `{{`, the; string-mode parser accepts opening delimiters of more than two curly braces,; like `{{{`.

The intent is to allow the delimeter to be wider than the longest `{` or `}`; brace sequence in the content, so that if your expected text contains `{{{`; (three braces) it may be delimited with `{{{{` (four braces), and so on. Regex matching mode may be selected by appending ``-re`` to the diagnostic type; and including regexes wrapped in double curly braces (`{{` and `}}`) in the; directive, such as:. .. code-block:: text. expected-error-re {{format specifies type 'wchar_t **' (aka '{{.+}}')}}.

Making null checks implicit is an aggressive optimization, and it can; be a net performance pessimization if too many memory operations end; up faulting because of it. A language runtime typically needs to; ensure that only a negligible number of implicit null checks actually; fault once the application has reached a steady state. A standard way; of doing this is by healing failed implicit null checks into explicit; null checks via code patching or recompilation. It follows that there; are two requirements an explicit null check needs to satisfy for it to; be profitable to convert it to an implicit null check:. 1. The case where the pointer is actually null (i.e. the ""failing""; case) is extremely rare. 2. The failing path heals the implicit null check into an explicit; null check so that the application does not repeatedly page; fault. The frontend is expected to mark branches that satisfy (1) and (2); using a ``!make.implicit`` metadata node (the actual content of the; metadata node is ignored). Only branches that are marked with; ``!make.implicit`` metadata are considered as candidates for; conversion into implicit null checks.

Supported Platforms; ===================. UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer is supported on the following operating systems:. * Android; * Linux; * NetBSD; * FreeBSD; * OpenBSD; * macOS; * Windows. The runtime library is relatively portable and platform independent. If the OS; you need is not listed above, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer may already work for; it, or could be made to work with a minor porting effort. Current Status; ==============. UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer is available on selected platforms starting from LLVM; 3.3. The test suite is integrated into the CMake build and can be run with; ``check-ubsan`` command. Additional Configuration; ========================. UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer adds static check data for each check unless it is; in trap mode. This check data includes the full file name. The option; ``-fsanitize-undefined-strip-path-components=N`` can be used to trim this; information. If ``N`` is positive, file information emitted by; UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer will drop the first ``N`` components from the file; path. If ``N`` is negative, the last ``N`` components will be kept.

For a file called ``/code/library/file.cpp``, here is what would be emitted:. * Default (No flag, or ``-fsanitize-undefined-strip-path-components=0``): ``/code/library/file.cpp``; * ``-fsanitize-undefined-strip-path-components=1``: ``code/library/file.cpp``; * ``-fsanitize-undefined-strip-path-components=2``: ``library/file.cpp``; * ``-fsanitize-undef",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.rst:15903,avail,available,15903,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.rst,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,". **Conflicting definitions**; Different system headers may provide conflicting definitions for various macros, functions, or types. These conflicting definitions don't tend to cause problems in a pre-modules world unless someone happens to include both headers in one translation unit. Since the fix is often simply ""don't do that"", such problems persist. Modules requires that the conflicting definitions be eliminated or that they be placed in separate modules (the former is generally the better answer). **Missing includes**; Headers are often missing ``#include`` directives for headers that they actually depend on. As with the problem of conflicting definitions, this only affects unlucky users who don't happen to include headers in the right order. With modules, the headers of a particular module will be parsed in isolation, so the module may fail to build if there are missing includes. **Headers that vend multiple APIs at different times**; Some systems have headers that contain a number of different kinds of API definitions, only some of which are made available with a given include. For example, the header may vend ``size_t`` only when the macro ``__need_size_t`` is defined before that header is included, and also vend ``wchar_t`` only when the macro ``__need_wchar_t`` is defined. Such headers are often included many times in a single translation unit, and will have no include guards. There is no sane way to map this header to a submodule. One can either eliminate the header (e.g., by splitting it into separate headers, one per actual API) or simply ``exclude`` it in the module map. To detect and help address some of these problems, the ``clang-tools-extra`` repository contains a ``modularize`` tool that parses a set of given headers and attempts to detect these problems and produce a report. See the tool's in-source documentation for information on how to check your system or library headers.

At initialization time, a table of basic colors is generated when the; first Canvas constructor is called. This table is a linked list, which; can be accessed from the ***`gROOT`*** object (see; `TROOT::GetListOfColors()`). Each color has an index and when a basic; color is defined, two ""companion"" colors are defined: the dark version and the bright version.; Two static functions are available that return the bright or dark color number corresponding; to a given color index. If these variants don't already exist, they are created as needed:; ```; Int_t dark = TColor::GetColorDark(color_index);; Int_t bright = TColor::GetColorBright(color_index);; ```. The dark and bright colors are used to give 3-D effects when drawing; various boxes (see **`TWbox`**, **`TPave`**, **`TPaveText`**,; **`TPaveLabel`**, etc).

But all dependencies that are; normally checked against (like ``libxml`` or ``libz`` etc) will match; against the host platform, not the target. So, if the build system is not aware that you want to cross-compile; your code, it will get every dependency wrong, and your compilation; will fail during build time, not configure time. Also, finding the libraries for your target are not as easy; as for your host machine. There aren't many cross-libraries available; as packages to most OS's, so you'll have to either cross-compile them; from source, or download the package for your target platform,; extract the libraries and headers, put them in specific directories; and add ``-I`` and ``-L`` pointing to them.

As far as a command-line compiler goes, this basically boils down to; making the diagnostics (error and warning messages) generated by the compiler; be as useful as possible. There are several ways that we do this. This section; talks about the experience provided by the command line compiler, contrasting; Clang output to GCC 4.9's output in some cases. Column Numbers and Caret Diagnostics; First, all diagnostics produced by clang include full column number; information. The clang command-line compiler driver uses this information; to print ""point diagnostics"".; (IDEs can use the information to display in-line error markup.); This is nice because it makes it very easy to understand exactly; what is wrong in a particular piece of code.; The point (the green ""^"" character) exactly shows where the problem is, even; inside of a string. This makes it really easy to jump to the problem and; helps when multiple instances of the same character occur on a line.

Note that modern versions of GCC have followed Clang's lead, and are; now able to give a column for a diagnostic, and include a snippet of source; text in the result. However, Clang's column number is much more accurate,; pointing at the problematic format specifier, rather than the ); character the parser had reached when the problem was detected.; Also, Clang's diagnostic is colored by default, making it easier to; distinguish from nearby text.; Range Highlighting for Related Text; Clang captures and accurately tracks range information for expressions,; statements, and other constructs in your program and uses this to make; diagnostics highlight related informatio",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/diagnostics.html:208,down,down,208,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/diagnostics.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/diagnostics.html,6,"['down', 'error']","['down', 'error']"

We call them language extensions.; ; For instance, language extensions are:; Execution of statements and expressions on the fly - From user's point of view it would make much sense if functions could be called by typing the function name at the prompt. This is true for other handy operations like creation of objects. However, the operations that do it are classified as statements and expressions, entered on the global scope. Statements and expressions on the global scope are not allowed by the C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++ grammar. Cling's prompt allows entering statements and expression on the global scope as transforming them into proper language constructs. ; Easy print out of the execution results - The way of signaling that the user wants to see the result of the entered and executed code is done by omitting the semicolon in the end. The standard doesn't allow statements (except those that change the control flow - such as if, for, while) without semicolon (;) in the end. However, this appears to be really simple and useful language extension that improves the user-cling interplay. Imagine if you had to write printf every time that you want to see the result of a function call. .

Here are tasks that are on our todo lists since a while, but we still cannot manage to get them done. They are not difficult to implement and excellent for getting to know cling. If you find something interesting, please go ahead and get your hands dirty!; The list is prioritized in descending order:; Extending and improving the multiline input mode - The multiline mode has to figure out automatically whether the user's input is still incomplete. For example ""if (a < 0) {"" is not fully completed input. Cling should'n try to process the line but to be smart enough to understand that it should wait for continuation. Currently cling switches multiline mode only when there is trailing ""{"". It has to be extended to detect trailing +, unbalanced ',"" and so on.; Implementing auto completion - Clang has good interface for autocompletion which proposes possible completion options considering the current input.; Implementing error recovery verifier - One of the most important parts in cling is the error recovery. The error recovery takes care of reverting clang's internal structures on error in the user input. For instance, user types int i; error_here;. int i should be reverted and the entire input sho",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/www/old/contact.html:85,Down,Download,85,interpreter/cling/www/old/contact.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/www/old/contact.html,3,"['Down', 'Error', 'Recover']","['Download', 'Error', 'Recovery']"

Welcome to our interactive C++ interpreter, built on the top of LLVM and Clang libraries. Its advantages over the standard interpreters are that it has command line prompt and uses just-in-time (JIT) compiler for compilation. An interactive prompt is usually referred to as a read eval print loop or repl. Many of the developers (e.g. Mono in their project called CSharpRepl) of such kind of software applications name them interactive compilers.; . One of Cling's main goals is to provide contemporary, high-performance alternative of the current C++ interpreter in the ROOT project - CINT. The backward-compatibility with CINT is major priority during the development.; ; How to use it; You can start typing not only C++ top level declaratons but statements, too. ; **** Welcome to the cling prototype! ****; * Type C code and press enter to run it *; * Type .q, exit or ctrl+D to quit *; *****************************************; [cling]$.

TGListTree. TGListTreeItem is now a base class and TGListTreeItemStd is the standard implementation (modification required by EVE).; Switched the icon and checkbox position in TGListTreeItem.; Added custom user control flags, with their getters and setters and three new signal methods (required by EVE).

The implementation remains however the same.; A new method TF1::operator()(double x, double y=0, double z) which is equivalent to TF1::Eval has been added for using TF1 as a callable object.; New templated methods TF1::SetFunction for generic C++ callable objects or for class member functions. TH1. Fixed a bug in the TH1::KolmogorovTest function in the case of scaled or weighted histograms. The routine has been improved and; now could also be used for comparing an histogram with a function if it is represented as an histogram with zero errors (equivalent to the case of options ""F1"" or ""F2"" in the original HDIFF routine of HBOOK). The bug has been fixed also for the TH2 and TH3 corresponding method. In addition in the case of TH3 use now all 6 axis combinations for estimating the maximum deviation. This is consistent with what is done in the 2D case.; Improved the TH1::Chi2Test for the treatment of empty bins in the histograms. If both histograms have one empty bin, the number of degree of freedom is decreased by one but the test is performed without reporting an error. If only one histogram is having an empty bin it is considered in the comparison. Fixed a bug in preserving the global statistic information after scaling, adding or rebinning the histogram. TH2.

ROOT I/O now support the LZMA compression algorithm to compress data in; addition to the ZLIB compression algorithm.; LZMA compression typically results in smaller files, but takes more; CPU time to compress data. To use the new feature, the external XZ; package must be installed when ROOT is configured and built:. Download 5.0.3 from here tukaani.org; and make sure to configure with fPIC:; ./configure CFLAGS='-fPIC'. Then the client C++ code must call routines to explicitly request LZMA; compression. ZLIB compression is still the default. Setting the Compression Level and Algorithm. There are three equivalent ways to set the compression level and; algorithm. For example, to set the compression to the LZMA algorithm; and compression level 5. TFile f(filename, option, title);; f.SetCompressionSettings(ROOT::CompressionSettings(ROOT::kLZMA, 5));.

These methods work for TFile, TBranch, TMessage, TSocket, and TBufferXML.; The compression algorithm and level settings only affect compression of; data after they have been set. TFile passes its settings to a TTree's branches; only at the time the branches are created. This can be overidden by; explicitly setting the level and algorithm for the branch.

This page documents common compatibility and; portability issues with Clang to help you understand and fix the; problem in your code when Clang emits an error message. C compatibility.

These semantics are different; from those in GNU C89 mode, which is the default mode in versions of GCC; prior to 5.0. For example, consider the following code:. inline int add(int i, int j) { return i + j; }. int main() {; int i = add(4, 5);; return i;; }. In C99, inline means that a function's definition is; provided only for inlining, and that there is another definition; (without inline) somewhere else in the program.

Availability,". New Assignment Operator; =======================. With our current framework, adding a new assignment operator is really; simple. We will parse it just like any other binary operator, but handle; it internally (instead of allowing the user to define it). The first; step is to set a precedence:. .. code-block:: c++. int main() {; // Install standard binary operators.; // 1 is lowest precedence.; BinopPrecedence['='] = 2;; BinopPrecedence['<'] = 10;; BinopPrecedence['+'] = 20;; BinopPrecedence['-'] = 20;. Now that the parser knows the precedence of the binary operator, it; takes care of all the parsing and AST generation. We just need to; implement codegen for the assignment operator. This looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. Value *BinaryExprAST::codegen() {; // Special case '=' because we don't want to emit the LHS as an expression.; if (Op == '=') {; // This assume we're building without RTTI because LLVM builds that way by; // default. If you build LLVM with RTTI this can be changed to a; // dynamic_cast for automatic error checking.; VariableExprAST *LHSE = static_cast<VariableExprAST*>(LHS.get());; if (!LHSE); return LogErrorV(""destination of '=' must be a variable"");. Unlike the rest of the binary operators, our assignment operator doesn't; follow the ""emit LHS, emit RHS, do computation"" model. As such, it is; handled as a special case before the other binary operators are handled.; The other strange thing is that it requires the LHS to be a variable. It; is invalid to have ""(x+1) = expr"" - only things like ""x = expr"" are; allowed. .. code-block:: c++. // Codegen the RHS.; Value *Val = RHS->codegen();; if (!Val); return nullptr;. // Look up the name.; Value *Variable = NamedValues[LHSE->getName()];; if (!Variable); return LogErrorV(""Unknown variable name"");.

Optionally the user can select a different way; of dynamically allocating memory in the class StackAllacator for M , in; which case (and after an entire recompilation of the whole library) the; thread safety is lost. ## Floating-point precision ##. [install:epsmac]. M is entirely based on double precision. The actual floating point; precision of double precision (32–bit or 64–bit) is platform dependent; and can even vary on the same platform, depending on whether a floating; point number is read from memory a CPU register. The argument of the user's implementation of FCNBase::operator() is; therefore a std:vector$<$double$>$. M expects that the calculations; inside $\mbox{FCN}$ will be performed approximately to the same; accuracy. The accuracy M expects is called *machine precision*; (MnMachinePrecision, see [api:epsmac]) and can be printed on demand; using std::cout. If the user fools M by making internal $\mbox{FCN}$; computations in single precision, M will interpret roundoff noise as; significant and will usually either fail to find a minimum, or give; incorrect values for the parameter errors. It is therefore recommended to make sure that all computations in; $\mbox{FCN}$, as well as all methods and functions called by; $\mbox{FCN}$, are done in double precision. If for some reason the; computations cannot be done to a precision comparable with that expected; by M , the user **must** inform M of this situation with setting a; different machine precision via the; MnMachinePrecision::setPrecision(double) method. With reduced precision, the user may find that certain features; sensitive to first and second differences ($\mbox{HESSE}$,; $\mbox{MINOS}$, $\mbox{CONTOURS}$) do not work properly, in; which case the calculations must be performed in higher precision. # How to use M #.

Availability,". Reads a vector from memory according to the provided mask. The mask holds a bit for each vector lane, and is used to prevent memory accesses to the masked-off lanes. The masked-off lanes in the result vector are taken from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the base pointer for the load. The second operand is the alignment of the source location. It must be a power of two constant integer value. The third operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values with the same number of elements as the return type. The fourth is a pass-through value that is used to fill the masked-off lanes of the result. The return type, underlying type of the base pointer and the type of the '``passthru``' operand are the same vector types. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.load``' intrinsic is designed for conditional reading of selected vector elements in a single IR operation. It is useful for targets that support vector masked loads and allows vectorizing predicated basic blocks on these targets. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of branches that guard scalar load operations.; The result of this operation is equivalent to a regular vector load instruction followed by a 'select' between the loaded and the passthru values, predicated on the same mask. However, using this intrinsic prevents exceptions on memory access to masked-off lanes. ::. %res = call <16 x float> @llvm.masked.load.v16f32.p0(ptr %ptr, i32 4, <16 x i1>%mask, <16 x float> %passthru). ;; The result of the two following instructions is identical aside from potential memory access exception; %loadlal = load <16 x float>, ptr %ptr, align 4; %res = select <16 x i1> %mask, <16 x float> %loadlal, <16 x float> %passthru. .. _int_mstore:.

To do so use the new VisualizeError() argument; in a plotOn call. RooFitResult* fr = pdf->fitTo(*data,Save(),...) ;; pdf->plotOn(frame,VisualizeError(*fr),...) ;. Two techniques for error visualization are implemented. The default is; linear error propagation, and results in an error band that is by; construction symmetric. The linear error is calculated as. error(x) = Z* F_a(x) * Corr(a,a') F_a'(x). where F_a(x) = [ f(x,a+da) - f(x,a-da) ] / 2,. with f(x) = the plotted curve; 'da' = error taken from the fit result; Corr(a,a') = the correlation matrix from the fit result; Z = requested significance 'Z sigma band'. The linear method is fast (requires 2*N evaluations of the curve,; where N is the number of parameters), but may not be accurate in the; presence of strong correlations (~>0.9) and at Z>2 due to linear and; Gaussian approximations made. Alternatively, errors can be visualized using a sampling method. In; this method a number of curves is calculated with variations of the; parameter values, as sampled from a multi-variate Gaussian p.d.f. that; is constructed from the fit results covariance matrix. The error(x); is determined by calculating a central interval that capture N% of the; variations for each value of x, where N% is controlled by Z (i.e. Z=1; gives N=68%). The number of sampling curves is chosen to be such that; at least 100 curves are expected to be outside the N% interval.

The following; tools are used commonly to run the analyzer from the command line. Both tools; are wrapper scripts to drive the analysis and the underlying invocations of the; Clang compiler:. Scan-Build; is an old and simple command-line tool that emits static analyzer warnings as HTML files while compiling your project. You can view the analysis results in your web browser.; . Useful for individual developers who simply want to view static analysis results at their desk, or in a very simple collaborative environment.; . Works on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and is available as a package in many Linux distributions.; . Does not include support for cross-translation-unit analysis.; . CodeChecker; is a web server that runs the Static Analyzer on your projects on demand and maintains a database of issues.; . Perfect for managing large amounts of Static Analyzer warnings in a collaborative environment.; . Generally much more feature-rich than scan-build.; ; Supports incremental analysis: Results can be stored in a database, subsequent analysis runs can be compared to list the newly added defects.; Cross Translation Unit (CTU) analysis is supported fully on Linux via CodeChecker.; Can run clang-tidy checkers too.; Open source, but out-of-tree, i.e. not part of the LLVM project.

Availability,". Running the analyzer within Xcode. Running the analyzer within Xcode. What is it?; Since Xcode 3.2, users have been able to run the Clang Static Analyzer; directly; within Xcode.; It integrates directly with the Xcode build system and; presents analysis results directly within Xcode's editor.; Can I use the open source analyzer builds with Xcode?; Yes. Instructions are included below. Viewing static analyzer results in Xcode. Key features:. Integrated workflow: Results are integrated within Xcode. There is; no experience of using a separate tool, and activating the analyzer requires a; single keystroke or mouse click.; Transparency: Works effortlessly with Xcode projects (including iPhone projects).; Cons: Doesn't work well with non-Xcode projects. For those,; consider using scan-build. Getting Started; Xcode is available as a free download from Apple on the Mac; App Store, with instructions; available for using the analyzer.; Using open source analyzer builds with Xcode; By default, Xcode uses the version of clang that came bundled with; it to analyze your code. It is possible to change Xcode's behavior to use an; alternate version of clang for this purpose while continuing to use; the clang that came with Xcode for compiling projects.; Why try open source builds?; The advantage of using open source analyzer builds (provided on this website); is that they are often newer than the analyzer provided with Xcode, and thus can; contain bug fixes, new checks, or simply better analysis.; On the other hand, new checks can be experimental, with results of variable; quality. Users are encouraged to file bug reports; (for any version of the analyzer) where they encounter false positives or other; issues.; set-xcode-analyzer; Starting with analyzer build checker-234, analyzer builds contain a command; line utility called set-xcode-analyzer that allows users to change what; copy of clang that Xcode uses for analysis:. $ set-xcode-analyzer -h; Usage: set-xcode-analyzer [options",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/xcode.html:826,avail,available,826,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/xcode.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/xcode.html,6,"['avail', 'down']","['available', 'download']"

Availability,". The covariance or the correlations can be printed and shown; via std::cout as the ostream operator operator$<<$ is overloaded. The; eigenvalues of the error matrix can be calculated using MnEigen, which; should all be positive if the matrix is positive-definite (see below on; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ and positive-definiteness). The effect of correlations on the individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result. The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed. (In the limit that a; given parameter is uncorrelated with parameter $\mbox{n}$, its error; will not change when parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed.) However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors ###. The M processor $\mbox{MINOS}$ (MnMinos, see [api:minos]) was; probably the first, and may still be the only, generally available; program to calculate parameter errors taking into account both parameter; correlations and non-linearities. The $\mbox{MINOS}$ error intervals; are in general asymmetric, and may be expensive to calculate,; especially if there are a lot of free parameters and the problem is very; non-linear. $\mbox{MINOS}$ can only operate after a good minimum has already; been found, and the error matrix has been calculated, so the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ error analysis will normally follow a; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ minimization.

In; this case, of the 610 simulated cycles, two instructions were retired during the; same cycle 399 times (65.4%) and there were 109 cycles where no instructions; were retired. The retire statistics are displayed by using the command option; ``-all-stats`` or ``-retire-stats``. The last table presented is *Register File statistics*. Each physical register; file (PRF) used by the pipeline is presented in this table. In the case of AMD; Jaguar, there are two register files, one for floating-point registers (JFpuPRF); and one for integer registers (JIntegerPRF). The table shows that of the 900; instructions processed, there were 900 mappings created. Since this dot-product; example utilized only floating point registers, the JFPuPRF was responsible for; creating the 900 mappings. However, we see that the pipeline only used a; maximum of 35 of 72 available register slots at any given time.

Availability,". The time will depend on the size; and complexity of the component, so adding release and testing managers on the; RFC and review is strongly advisable. Deprecation Policy; ==================. The LLVM code base has a number of files that aren't being actively maintained.; But not all of those files are obstructing the development of the project and; so it remains in the repository with the assumption that it could still be; useful for downstream users. For code to remain in the repository, its presence must not impose an undue; burden on maintaining other components (core or peripheral). Warnings; --------. There are multiple types of issues that might trigger a request for deprecation,; including (but not limited to):. * Changes in a component consistently break other areas of the project.; * Components go broken for long periods of time (weeks or more).; * Clearly superior alternatives are in use and maintenance is painful.; * Builds and tests are harder / take longer, increasing the cost of; maintenance, overtaking the perceived benefits. If the maintenance cost is higher than it is acceptable by the majority of; developers, it means that either the sub-community is too small (and the extra; cost should be paid locally), or not active enough (and the problems won't be; fixed any time soon). In either case, removal of such problematic component is; justified. Steps for removal; -----------------. However clear the needs for removal are, we should take an incremental approach; to deprecating code, especially when there's still a sub-community that cares; about it. In that sense, code will never be removed outright without a series; of steps are taken. A minimum set of steps should be:; #. A proposal for removal / deactivation should be made to the Discourse forums ; (under the appropriate category), with a clear; statement of the maintenance costs imposed and the alternatives, if; applicable.; #.

Availability,". These builtin; functions are an internal implementation detail of GCC, and are not portable to; the Intel compiler, the Microsoft compiler, or Clang. If you get build errors; mentioning these, the fix is simple: switch to the *mmintrin.h functions.; The same issue occurs for NEON and Altivec for the ARM and PowerPC; architectures respectively. For these, make sure to use the <arm_neon.h>; and <altivec.h> headers.; For x86 architectures this script should help with; the manual migration process. It will rewrite your source files in place to; use the APIs instead of builtin function calls. Just call it like this:. builtins.py *.c *.h. and it will rewrite all of the .c and .h files in the current directory to; use the API calls instead of calls like __builtin_ia32_paddw128. Lvalue casts. Old versions of GCC permit casting the left-hand side of an assignment to a; different type. Clang produces an error on similar code, e.g.,. lvalue.c:2:3: error: assignment to cast is illegal, lvalue casts are not supported; (int*)addr = val;; ^~~~~~~~~~ ~. To fix this problem, move the cast to the right-hand side. In this; example, one could use:. addr = (float *)val;. Jumps to within __block variable scope. Clang disallows jumps into the scope of a __block; variable. Variables marked with __block require special; runtime initialization. A jump into the scope of a __block; variable bypasses this initialization, leaving the variable's metadata; in an invalid state. Consider the following code fragment:. int fetch_object_state(struct MyObject *c) {; if (!c->active) goto error;. __block int result;; run_specially_somehow(^{ result = c->state; });; return result;. error:; fprintf(stderr, ""error while fetching object state"");; return -1;; }. GCC accepts this code, but it produces code that will usually crash; when result goes out of scope if the jump is taken. (It's; possible for this bug to go undetected because it often won't crash if; the stack is fresh, i.e. still zeroed.)

Translation of Constants; ------------------------. Constant operands are translated as a use of a virtual register that is defined; by a ``G_CONSTANT`` or ``G_FCONSTANT`` instruction. These instructions are; placed in the entry block to allow them to be subject to the continuous CSE; implementation (``CSEMIRBuilder``). Their debug location information is removed; to prevent this from confusing debuggers. This is beneficial as it allows us to fold constants into immediate operands; during :ref:`instructionselect`, while still avoiding redundant materializations; for expensive non-foldable constants. However, this can lead to unnecessary; spills and reloads in an -O0 pipeline, as these virtual registers can have long; live ranges.

This is an **experimental** feature, available starting with release; 2.3.0.; It is still incomplete and has only been tested on Linux on x86_64. CUDA is supported by passing all JITed code through two pipelines: one for the; CPU and one for the GPU.; Use of the ``__CUDA__`` pre-processor macro enables more fine-grained control; over which pipeline sees what, which is used e.g. in the pre-compiled header:; the GPU pipeline has the CUDA headers included, the CPU pipeline does not.; Building the pre-compiled header will also pick up common CUDA libraries such; as cuBLAS, if installed. Each version of CUDA requires specific versions of Clang and the system; compiler (e.g. gcc) for proper functioning; it's therefore best to build the; backend (``cppyy-cling``) from source for the specific combination of; interest.; The 3.x series of cppyy uses Clang13, the 2.x series Clang9, and this may; limit the CUDA versions supported (especially since CUDA has changed the APIs; for launching kernels in v11). There are three environment variables to control Cling's handling of CUDA:. * ``CLING_ENABLE_CUDA`` (required): set to ``1`` to enable the CUDA; backend. * ``CLING_CUDA_PATH`` (optional): set to the local CUDA installation if not; in a standard location. * ``CLING_CUDA_ARCH`` (optional): set the architecture to target; default is; ``sm_35`` (Clang9 is limited to ``sm_75``).

By default, the ``clang`` JIT as used by cppyy does not generate debugging; information.; This is first of all because it has proven to be not reliable in all cases,; but also because in a production setting this information, being internal to; the wrapper generation, goes unused.; However, that does mean that a debugger that starts from python will not be; able to step through JITed code into the C++ function that needs debugging,; even when such information is available for that C++ function. To enable debugging information in JITed code, set the ``EXTRA_CLING_ARGS``; envar to ``-g`` (and any further compiler options you need, e.g. add ``-O2``; to debug optimized code). On a crash in C++, the backend will attempt to provide a stack trace.; This works quite well on Linux (through ``gdb``) and decently on MacOS; (through ``unwind``), but is currently unreliable on MS Windows.; To prevent printing of this trace, which can be slow to produce, set the; envar ``CPPYY_CRASH_QUIET`` to '1'. It is even more useful to obtain a traceback through the Python code that led; up to the problem in C++.; Many modern debuggers allow mixed-mode C++/Python debugging (for example; `gdb`_ and `MSVC`_), but cppyy can also turn abortive C++ signals (such as a; segmentation violation) into Python exceptions, yielding a normal traceback.; This is particularly useful when working with cross-inheritance and other; cross-language callbacks. To enable the signals to exceptions conversion, import the lowlevel module; ``cppyy.ll`` and use:. .. code-block:: python. import cppyy.ll; cppyy.ll.set_signals_as_exception(True). Call ``set_signals_as_exception(False)`` to disable the conversion again.; It is recommended to only have the conversion enabled around the problematic; code, as it comes with a performance penalty.; If the problem can be localized to a specific function, you can use its; ``__sig2exc__`` flag to only have the conversion active in that functi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/debugging.rst:183,reliab,reliable,183,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/debugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/debugging.rst,2,"['avail', 'reliab']","['available', 'reliable']"

Installation; ============. cppyy requires a (modern) C++ compiler.; When installing through `conda-forge`_, ``conda`` will install the compiler; for you, to match the other conda-forge packages.; When using ``pip`` and the wheels from `PyPI`_, you minimally need gcc5,; clang5, or MSVC'17. .. note::. On Windows, a command prompt from which to run Python (or Python run; directly) needs to be opened from within an environment with MSVC setup,; otherwise the compiler will not be accessible. When installing from source, the only requirement is a compiler that supports; C++14, this in order to build LLVM. With CPython on Linux or MacOS, probably by far the easiest way to install; cppyy, is through conda-forge on `Anaconda`_ (or `miniconda`_).; A Windows recipe for ``conda`` is not available yet, but is forthcoming, so; use ``pip`` for that platform for now (see below).; PyPI always has the authoritative releases (conda-forge pulls the sources; from there), so conda-forge may sometimes lag PyPI.; If you absolutely need the latest release, use PyPI or consider; :ref:`building from source <building_from_source>`. To install using ``conda``, create and/or activate your (new) work environment; and install from the conda-forge channel::. $ conda create -n WORK; $ conda activate WORK; (WORK) $ conda install -c conda-forge cppyy; (WORK) [current compiler] $. To install with ``pip`` through `PyPI`_, use `venv`.; The use of virtual environment (`venv`) prevents pollution of any system directories and allows; you to wipe out the full installation simply by removing the virtual environment (`venv`); created directory (""WORK"" in this example)::. $ python -m venv WORK ; $ WORK\Scripts\activate; (WORK) $ python -m pip install cppyy; (WORK) $. .. note:: ; If you are using python version less than 3.3, you should use `virtualenv` instead of `venv`.; First install virtualenv package that allows you to create virtual environment. $ python -m pip install virtualenv . $ vir",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/installation.rst:806,avail,available,806,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/installation.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/installation.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Numba `is a JIT compiler`_ for Python functions that can be statically typed; based on their input arguments.; Since C++ objects are always statically typed and already implemented at the; machine level, they can be dynamically integrated into the Numba type tracing; and lowering by exposing type details through C++ reflection at runtime. JIT-compiling traces of mixed Python/bound C++ code reduces, and in some; cases removes, the overhead of boxing/unboxing native data into their Python; proxies and vice versa.; It can also reduce or remove temporaries, especially for template; expressions.; Thus, there can be significant speedups for mixed code, beyond the Numba; compilation of Python code itself.; The current implementation integrates compiled C++ through function pointers,; object pointers, and pointer offsets, into the intermediate representation; (IR) as generated by Numba.; A future version may integrate Cling-generated IR directly into Numba IR (or; vice versa), e.g. if the C++ code is exposed from (precompiled) headers.; This would allow inlining of C++ code into Numba traces, for further; expected speedups. Why Numba?; ----------. The advertised premise of Numba is that it ""makes Python code fast.""; However, there is a much more compelling reason: Numba allows developers to; stay in their chosen ecosystem, be it Python or C++, in mixed environments,; without paying for their choice in lost performance.; For example, a Python developer using Numba does not need to rewrite a kernel; into C++ just to run performantly in a C++ framework.; Similarly, a C++ developer can use Numba to compile and create function; pointers to Python code for easy, performant, access.; This becomes even more compelling if the deployment target is a GPU, which; woul",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst:93,avail,available,93,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Run-time v.s. compile-time; --------------------------. What performs better, run-time or compile-time?; The obvious answer is compile-time: see the performance differences between; C++ and Python, for example.; Obvious, but completely wrong, however.; In fact, when it comes to Python, it is even the `wrong question.`. Everything in Python is run-time: modules, classes, functions, etc. are all; run-time constructs.; A Python module that defines a class is a set of instructions to the Python; interpreter that lead to the construction of the desired class object.; A C/C++ extension module that defines a class does the same thing by calling; a succession of Python interpreter Application Programming Interfaces (APIs;; the exact same that Python uses itself internally).; If you use a compile-time binder such as `SWIG`_ or `pybind11`_ to bind a C++; class, then what gets compiled is the series of API calls necessary to; construct a Python-side equivalent at `run-time` (when the module gets; loaded), not the Python class object.; In short, whether a binding is created at ""compile-time"" or at run-time has; no measurable bearing on performance. What does affect performance is the overhead to cross the language barrier.; This consists of unboxing Python objects to extract or convert the underlying; objects or data to something that matches what C++ expects; overload; resolution based on the unboxed argume",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:173,avail,available,173,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Positional arguments are those arguments that are not named, and are not; specified with a hyphen. Positional arguments should be used when an option is; specified by its position alone. For example, the standard Unix ``grep`` tool; takes a regular expression argument, and an optional filename to search through; (which defaults to standard input if a filename is not specified). Using the; CommandLine library, this would be specified as:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> Regex (cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<regular expression>""), cl::Required);; cl::opt<string> Filename(cl::Positional, cl::desc(""<input file>""), cl::init(""-""));. Given these two option declarations, the ``-help`` output for our grep; replacement would look like this:. ::. USAGE: spiffygrep [options] <regular expression> <input file>. OPTIONS:; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more). ... and the resultant program could be used just like the standard ``grep``; tool. Positional arguments are sorted by their order of construction. This means that; command line options will be ordered according to how they are listed in a .cpp; file, but will not have an ordering defined if the positional arguments are; defined in multiple .cpp files. The fix for this problem is simply to define; all of your positional arguments in one .cpp file. Specifying positional options with hyphens; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sometimes you may want to specify a value to your positional argument that; starts with a hyphen (for example, searching for '``-foo``' in a file).

Parts of the Standard Template Library (STL), in particular its container; types, are the de facto equivalent of Python's builtin types.; STL is written in C++ and Python bindings of it are fully functional as-is,; but are much more useful when pluggable into idiomatic expressions where; Python builtin containers are expected (e.g. in list contractions). There are two extremes to achieve such drop-in behavior: copy into Python; builtins, so that the Python-side always deals with true Python objects; or; adjust the C++ interfaces to be the same as their Python equivalents.; Neither is very satisfactory: the former is not because of the existence of; global/static variables and return-by-reference.; If only a copy is available, then expected modifications do not propagate.; Copying is also either slow (when copying every time) or memory intensive (if; the results are cached).; Filling out the interfaces may look more appealing, but all operations then; involve C++ function calls, which can be slower than the Python equivalents,; and C++-style error handling. Given that neither choice will satisfy all cases, ``cppyy`` aims to maximize; functionality and minimum surprises based on common use.; Thus, for example, ``std::vector`` grows a pythonistic ``__len__`` method,; but does not lose its C++ ``size`` method.; Passing a Python container through a const reference to a ``std::vector``; will trigger automatic conversion, but such an attempt through a non-const; reference will fail since a non-temporary C++ object is required [#f1]_ to; return any updates/changes. ``std::string`` is almost always converted to Python's ``str`` on function; returns (the exception is return-by-reference when assigning), but not when; its direct use is more likely such as in the case of (global) variables or; when iterating over a ``std::vector<std::string>``.

Clang has complete support of OpenCL C versions from 1.0 to 3.0.; Support for OpenCL 3.0 is in experimental phase (:ref:`OpenCL 3.0 <opencl_300>`). Clang also supports :ref:`the C++ for OpenCL kernel language <cxx_for_opencl_impl>`. There are also other :ref:`new and experimental features <opencl_experimenal>`; available. Details about usage of clang for OpenCL can be found in :doc:`UsersManual`.

It is primarily targeted; at the advanced users and the toolchain developers integrating frontend; functionality as a component. OpenCL Metadata; ---------------. Clang uses metadata to provide additional OpenCL semantics in IR needed for; backends and OpenCL runtime. Each kernel will have function metadata attached to it, specifying the arguments.; Kernel argument metadata is used to provide source level information for querying; at runtime, for example using the `clGetKernelArgInfo; <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/opencl-1.2.pdf#167>`_; call.

Libclang tutorial; =================; The C Interface to Clang provides a relatively small API that exposes facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating physical source locations with elements within the AST, and other facilities that support Clang-based development tools.; This C interface to Clang will never provide all of the information representation stored in Clang's C++ AST, nor should it: the intent is to maintain an API that is relatively stable from one release to the next, providing only the basic functionality needed to support development tools.; The entire C interface of libclang is available in the file `Index.h`_. Essential types overview; -------------------------. All types of libclang are prefixed with ``CX``. CXIndex; ~~~~~~~; An Index that consists of a set of translation units that would typically be linked together into an executable or library. CXTranslationUnit; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~; A single translation unit, which resides in an index. CXCursor; ~~~~~~~~; A cursor representing a pointer to some element in the abstract syntax tree of a translation unit. Code example; """""""""""""""""""""""". .. code-block:: cpp. // file.cpp; struct foo{; int bar;; int* bar_pointer;; };. .. code-block:: cpp. #include <clang-c/Index.h>; #include <iostream>. int main(){; CXIndex index = clang_createIndex(0, 0); //Create index; CXTranslationUnit unit = clang_parseTranslationUnit(; index,; ""file.cpp"", nullptr, 0,; nullptr, 0,; CXTranslationUnit_None); //Parse ""file.cpp"". if (unit == nullptr){; std::cerr << ""Unable to parse translation unit. Quitting.\n"";; return 0;; }; CXCursor cursor = clang_getTranslationUnitCursor(unit); //Obtain a cursor at the root of the translation unit; }.

It may not be self-similar :), but it can be; used to plot things that are!. With this, we conclude the ""adding user-defined operators"" chapter of; the tutorial. We have successfully augmented our language, adding the; ability to extend the language in the library, and we have shown how; this can be used to build a simple but interesting end-user application; in Kaleidoscope. At this point, Kaleidoscope can build a variety of; applications that are functional and can call functions with; side-effects, but it can't actually define and mutate a variable itself. Strikingly, variable mutation is an important feature of some languages,; and it is not at all obvious how to `add support for mutable; variables <LangImpl07.html>`_ without having to add an ""SSA construction""; phase to your front-end. In the next chapter, we will describe how you; can add variable mutation without building SSA in your front-end. Full Code Listing; =================. Here is the complete code listing for our running example, enhanced with; the support for user-defined operators. To build this example, use:. .. code-block:: bash. # Compile; clang++ -g toy.cpp `llvm-config --cxxflags --ldflags --system-libs --libs core orcjit native` -O3 -o toy; # Run; ./toy. On some platforms, you will need to specify -rdynamic or; -Wl,--export-dynamic when linking. This ensures that symbols defined in; the main executable are exported to the dynamic linker and so are; available for symbol resolution at run time. This is not needed if you; compile your support code into a shared library, although doing that; will cause problems on Windows.

Optionally, you can add; CLI-style arguments which are handed to the script through 'sys.argv' in; the normal way. `Exec(const char* cmd) `- the argument is a string of Python code that; is executed as a statement.

Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". ``tramp`` must point to a block of memory which already has trampoline; code filled in by a previous call to; :ref:`llvm.init.trampoline <int_it>`. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". On some architectures the address of the code to be executed needs to be; different than the address where the trampoline is actually stored. This; intrinsic returns the executable address corresponding to ``tramp``; after performing the required machine specific adjustments. The pointer; returned can then be :ref:`bitcast and executed <int_trampoline>`. .. _int_vp:. Vector Predication Intrinsics; -----------------------------; VP intrinsics are intended for predicated SIMD/vector code. A typical VP; operation takes a vector mask and an explicit vector length parameter as in:. ::. <W x T> llvm.vp.<opcode>.*(<W x T> %x, <W x T> %y, <W x i1> %mask, i32 %evl). The vector mask parameter (%mask) always has a vector of `i1` type, for example; `<32 x i1>`. The explicit vector length parameter always has the type `i32` and; is an unsigned integer value. The explicit vector length parameter (%evl) is in; the range:. ::. 0 <= %evl <= W, where W is the number of vector elements. Note that for :ref:`scalable vector types <t_vector>` ``W`` is the runtime; length of the vector. The VP intrinsic has undefined behavior if ``%evl > W``. The explicit vector; length (%evl) creates a mask, %EVLmask, with all elements ``0 <= i < %evl`` set; to True, and all other lanes ``%evl <= i < W`` to False.

Go to the CernVM Online Dashboard page where you have previously; customized the contexts for your master and your slaves. Click on the rightmost button on the line of the desired context and; select **Get rendered context** from the dropdown: save the output to a; text file (such as `my_vaf_context.txt`, the name we will use in the; examples that follow). This file will be subsequently passed as the so; called ""user-data"" file to the cloud API. > Repeat the operation for both the master context and the slave; > context. ### OpenStack API: nova.

Improved handling of chi-squared fits; Chi-squared fits can now be performed through the same style of interface as likelihood fits,; through the newly added method RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataHist&,...). Functions that can be fitted with chi-squared minimization are any RooAbsReal based function; as well as RooAbsPdf based p.d.f.s. In case of non-extended p.d.f.s the probability density; calculated by the p.d.f. is multiplied with the number of events in the histogram to adjust; the scale of the function. In case of extended p.d.f.s, the adjustment is made with the expected; number of events, rather than the observed number of events. Tutorial macro rf602_chi2fit.C has been updated to use this new interface. Chi-squared fits to X-Y datasets now possible; In addition to the ability to perform chi-squared fits to histograms it is now also possible; to perform chi-squared fits to unbinned datasets containing a series of X and Y values; with associated errors on Y and optionally on X. These 'X-Y' chi-squared fits are interfaced through newly added method; RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataSet&,...). By default the event weight is; interpreted as the 'Y' value, but an YVar() argument can designate any other; dataset column as Y value. If X errors are defined, one can choose to integrate the fitted; function over the range of the X errors, rather than taking the central value by adding; an Integrate(true) argument to chi2FitTo(); Two new arguments, StoreError(const RooArgSet&) and StoreAsymError(const RooArgSet&); have been added to the RooDataSet constructor to simplify the process of storing the errors; of X and Y variables along with their values in a dataset.

YAML I/O; will print out an error message and your Input object's error() method will; return true. For instance the following document:. .. code-block:: yaml. - name: Tom; shoe-size: 12; - name: Dan; hat-size: 7. Has a key (shoe-size) that is not defined in the schema. YAML I/O will; automatically generate this error:. .. code-block:: yaml. YAML:2:2: error: unknown key 'shoe-size'; shoe-size: 12; ^~~~~~~~~. Similar errors are produced for other input not conforming to the schema. Scalars; =======. YAML scalars are just strings (i.e. not a sequence or mapping). The YAML I/O; library provides support for translating between YAML scalars and specific; C++ types. Built-in types; --------------; The following types have built-in support in YAML I/O:. * bool; * float; * double; * StringRef; * std::string; * int64_t; * int32_t; * int16_t; * int8_t; * uint64_t; * uint32_t; * uint16_t; * uint8_t. That is, you can use those types in fields of MappingTraits or as element type; in sequence.

This operation performs fixed point division on the 2 arguments of a; specified scale. The result will also be returned in the same scale specified; in the third argument. If the result value cannot be precisely represented in the given scale, the; value is rounded up or down to the closest representable value. The rounding; direction is unspecified. The maximum value this operation can clamp to is the largest signed value; representable by the bit width of the first 2 arguments. The minimum value is the; smallest signed value representable by this bit width. It is undefined behavior if the second argument is zero.

Tags; ----. The YAML syntax supports tags as a way to specify the type of a node before; it is parsed. This allows dynamic types of nodes. But the YAML I/O model uses; static typing, so there are limits to how you can use tags with the YAML I/O; model. Recently, we added support to YAML I/O for checking/setting the optional; tag on a map. Using this functionality it is even possible to support different; mappings, as long as they are convertible. To check a tag, inside your mapping() method you can use io.mapTag() to specify; what the tag should be. This will also add that tag when writing yaml. Validation; ----------. Sometimes in a YAML map, each key/value pair is valid, but the combination is; not. This is similar to something having no syntax errors, but still having; semantic errors. To support semantic level checking, YAML I/O allows; an optional ``validate()`` method in a MappingTraits template specialization. When parsing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is call *after* all key/values in; the map have been processed. Any error message returned by the ``validate()``; method during input will be printed just a like a syntax error would be printed.; When writing YAML, the ``validate()`` method is called *before* the YAML; key/values are written. Any error during output will trigger an ``assert()``; because it is a programming error to have invalid struct values. .. code-block:: c++. using llvm::yaml::MappingTraits;; using llvm::yaml::IO;. struct Stuff {; ...; };. template <>; struct MappingTraits<Stuff> {; static void mapping(IO &io, Stuff &stuff) {; ...; }; static std::string validate(IO &io, Stuff &stuff) {; // Look at all fields in 'stuff' and if there; // are any bad values return a string describing; // the error.

ROOT looks for scripts in the path specified in the `.rootrc` file in; the `Root.Macro.Path` variable. You can expand this path to hold your; own directories. ### Logon and Logoff Scripts. The `rootlogon.C` and `rootlogoff.C` files are scripts loaded and; executed at start-up and shutdown. The `rootalias.C` file is loaded; but not executed. It typically contains small utility functions. For; example, the `rootalias.C` script that comes with the ROOT; distributions (located in `$ROOTSYS/tutorials)` defines the function; `edit(char *file)`. This allows the user to call the editor from the; command line. This particular function will start the VI editor if the; environment variable `EDITOR` is not set. ``` {.cpp}; root[0] edit(""c1.C""); ```. For more details, see `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/rootalias.C`. ### History File. You can use the up and down arrow at the command line, to access the; previous and next command. The commands are recorded in the history; file `$HOME/.root_hist`. It is a text file, and you can edit, cut, and; paste from it. You can specify the history file in the `system.rootrc`; file, by setting the `Rint.History `option. You can also turn off the; command logging in the `system.rootrc` file with the option:; `Rint.History: -`. The number of history lines to be kept can be set also in `.rootrc`; by:. ```; Rint.HistSize: 500; Rint.HistSave: 400; ```. The first value defines the maximum of lines kept; once it is reached; all, the last `HistSave` lines will be removed. One can set `HistSize`; to 0 to disable history line management. There is also implemented an; environment variable called `ROOT_HIST`. By setting; `ROOT_HIST=300:200` the above values can be overriden - the first; value corresponds to `HistSize`, the (optional) second one to; `HistSave`. You can set `ROOT_HIST=0` to disable the history. ### Tracking Memory Leaks.

Availability,"/ Representing sign/zero extension of function results; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//. Mar 25, 2009 - Initial Revision. Most ABIs specify that functions which return small integers do so in a; specific integer GPR. This is an efficient way to go, but raises the question:; if the returned value is smaller than the register, what do the high bits hold?. There are three (interesting) possible answers: undefined, zero extended, or; sign extended. The number of bits in question depends on the data-type that; the front-end is referencing (typically i1/i8/i16/i32). Knowing the answer to this is important for two reasons: 1) we want to be able; to implement the ABI correctly. If we need to sign extend the result according; to the ABI, we really really do need to do this to preserve correctness. 2); this information is often useful for optimization purposes, and we want the; mid-level optimizers to be able to process this (e.g. eliminate redundant; extensions). For example, lets pretend that X86 requires the caller to properly extend the; result of a return (I'm not sure this is the case, but the argument doesn't; depend on this). Given this, we should compile this:. int a();; short b() { return a(); }. into:. _b:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	L_a$stub; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	cwtl; 	ret. An optimization example is that we should be able to eliminate the explicit; sign extension in this example:. short y();; int z() {; return ((int)y() << 16) >> 16;; }. _z:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	_y; 	;; movswl %ax, %eax -> not needed because eax is already sext'd; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	ret. //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; // What we have right now.; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//. Currently, these sorts of things are modelled by compiling a function to return; the small type and a signext/zeroext marker is used.

Availability,"/06 and later, the **`TPython`** class will be loaded; automatically on use, for older editions, the `libPyROOT.so` needs to be; loaded first with `gSystem->Load()` before use. Refer back to the other; example of the use of **`TPython`** that was given in ""Access to Python; from ROOT"". To show in detail how Python access can be used, an example Python; module is needed, as follows:. ``` {.cpp}; print('creating class MyPyClass ... '); class MyPyClass:; def __init__(self):; print('in MyPyClass.__init__'); self._browser = None; def gime(self, what):; return what; ```. This module can now be loaded into a Cling session, the class used to; instantiate objects, and their member functions called for showing how; different types can cross:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TPython::LoadMacro(""MyPyClass.py"");; creating class MyPyClass ...; root[] MyPyClass m;; in MyPyClass.__init__; root[] char* s = m.gime(""aap"");; root[] s; (char* 0x41ee7754)""aap""; ```. Note that the `LoadMacro()` call makes the class automatically; available, such that it can be used directly. Otherwise, a; `gROOT->GetClass()` call is required first. #### Callbacks. The simplest way of setting a callback to Python from Cling, e.g. for a; button, is by providing the execution string. See for example; `tutorials/pyroot/demo.py` that comes with the ROOT installation:. ``` {.cpp}; # [..]; bar = ROOT.TControlBar('vertical','Demos'); bar.AddButton('Help on Demos',r'TPython::Exec(""execfile('demoshelp.py')"");','Click Here For Help on Running the Demos'); bar.AddButton('browser',r'TPython::Exec(""b = Tbrowser()"");','Start the ROOT browser'); # [..]; ```. Here, the callback is a string that will be interpreted by Cling to call; `TPython::Exec()`, which will, in turn, interpret and execute the string; given to it.

'``llvm.masked.expandload.*``' Intrinsics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Syntax:; """"""""""""""; This is an overloaded intrinsic. Several values of integer, floating point or pointer data type are loaded from consecutive memory addresses and stored into the elements of a vector according to the mask. ::. declare <16 x float> @llvm.masked.expandload.v16f32 (ptr <ptr>, <16 x i1> <mask>, <16 x float> <passthru>); declare <2 x i64> @llvm.masked.expandload.v2i64 (ptr <ptr>, <2 x i1> <mask>, <2 x i64> <passthru>). Overview:; """""""""""""""""". Reads a number of scalar values sequentially from memory location provided in '``ptr``' and spreads them in a vector. The '``mask``' holds a bit for each vector lane. The number of elements read from memory is equal to the number of '1' bits in the mask. The loaded elements are positioned in the destination vector according to the sequence of '1' and '0' bits in the mask. E.g., if the mask vector is '10010001', ""expandload"" reads 3 values from memory addresses ptr, ptr+1, ptr+2 and places them in lanes 0, 3 and 7 accordingly. The masked-off lanes are filled by elements from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the base pointer for the load. It has the same underlying type as the element of the returned vector. The second operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values with the same number of elements as the return type. The third is a pass-through value that is used to fill the masked-off lanes of the result. The return type and the type of the '``passthru``' operand have the same vector type. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.expandload``' intrinsic is designed for reading multiple scalar values from adjacent memory addresses into possibly non-adjacent vector lanes.

Availability,"2, ARM SVE, the RISC-V V; extension and NEC SX-Aurora. Only some predicated vector operations, such as; masked loads and stores, are available through intrinsics [MaskedIR]_. The Vector Predication (VP) extensions is a concrete RFC and prototype; implementation to achieve native vector predication in LLVM. The VP prototype; and all related discussions can be found in the VP patch on Phabricator; [VPRFC]_. Roadmap; =======. 1. IR-level VP intrinsics; -------------------------. - There is a consensus on the semantics/instruction set of VP.; - VP intrinsics and attributes are available on IR level.; - TTI has capability flags for VP (``supportsVP()``?,; ``haveActiveVectorLength()``?). Result: VP usable for IR-level vectorizers (LV, VPlan, RegionVectorizer),; potential integration in Clang with builtins. 2. CodeGen support; ------------------. - VP intrinsics translate to first-class SDNodes; (eg ``llvm.vp.fdiv.* -> vp_fdiv``).; - VP legalization (legalize explicit vector length to mask (AVX512), legalize VP; SDNodes to pre-existing ones (SSE, NEON)). Result: Backend development based on VP SDNodes. 3. Lift InstSimplify/InstCombine/DAGCombiner to VP; --------------------------------------------------. - Introduce PredicatedInstruction, PredicatedBinaryOperator, .. helper classes; that match standard vector IR and VP intrinsics.; - Add a matcher context to PatternMatch and context-aware IR Builder APIs.; - Incrementally lift DAGCombiner to work on VP SDNodes as well as on regular; vector instructions.; - Incrementally lift InstCombine/InstSimplify to operate on VP as well as; regular IR instructions. Result: Optimization of VP intrinsics on par with standard vector instructions. 4. Deprecate llvm.masked.* / llvm.experimental.reduce.*; -------------------------------------------------------. - Modernize llvm.masked.* / llvm.experimental.reduce* by translating to VP.; - DCE transitional APIs. Result: VP has superseded earlier vector intrinsics. 5.

Reads a number of scalar values sequentially from memory location provided in '``ptr``' and spreads them in a vector. The '``mask``' holds a bit for each vector lane. The number of elements read from memory is equal to the number of '1' bits in the mask. The loaded elements are positioned in the destination vector according to the sequence of '1' and '0' bits in the mask. E.g., if the mask vector is '10010001', ""expandload"" reads 3 values from memory addresses ptr, ptr+1, ptr+2 and places them in lanes 0, 3 and 7 accordingly. The masked-off lanes are filled by elements from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the base pointer for the load. It has the same underlying type as the element of the returned vector. The second operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values with the same number of elements as the return type.

Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.expandload``' intrinsic is designed for reading multiple scalar values from adjacent memory addresses into possibly non-adjacent vector lanes.
