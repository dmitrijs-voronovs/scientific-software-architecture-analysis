Modifiability,"> Distributed IO is not supported yet and will require a lot of work and refactor so for the time being we have to do with the rank in the output writers. Distributed IO is not necessary to solve this problem. We can introduce a convention for filenames whereby the rank number is automatically inserted into the filename for distributed simulations. Similarly the convention can be reversed for `FieldTimeSeries` to make the process seamless for users. There are probably plenty of other possible solutions. The first step is recognizing that a problem or deficiency exists, and having the desire to fix it. Then we can do the fun part, which is to design solutions to an important problem. Note that distributed IO is unlikely to ever be supported for JLD2. So to provide a seamless experience with JLD2, we really do require a filename convention to solve the problem. (For NetCDF, we could envision providing a choice between file splitting or distributed IO.). Filename conventions also seem preferred to me for many cases in a world of GPUs where each rank likely needs to hold a substantial portion of the computation for performance. Splitting files by rank will limit the filesize, which makes it easier to transfer data when the simulations are very large --- which will probably often be the case when doing distributed simulations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3429#issuecomment-1895891029:73,refactor,refactor,73,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3429#issuecomment-1895891029,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

Modifiability,"> Does anybody know what is the rationale for `similar(::Field)` to drop the boundary conditions?. I think it depends on how you view ""boundary conditions"". If we adopt a ""weak formulation philosophy"" then boundary conditions are part of the definition of an equation set and don't belong to fields at all. This is how `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` works; inhomogeneous boundary conditions can only be enforced by adding boundary fluxes to a tendency. There's no such thing as a ""boundary condition"" outside the context of time stepping. Unfortunately, `Oceananigans` is not consistent in how this philosophy is applied and when we are on ""non-immersed"" grids we have more of a ""strong formulation"" philosophy. I believe the rationale for not transferring boundary conditions is the expectation that we will eventually adopt a ""weak formulation philosophy"" consistently throughout the code. In that case, non-default boundary conditions are meaningless on anything but prognostic fields that are evolved during time-stepping.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2882#issuecomment-1411317487:989,evolve,evolved,989,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2882#issuecomment-1411317487,1,['evolve'],['evolved']

Modifiability,"> Does the magnitude of the velocity error scale with the time-step, or resolution?. I think the expected behavior is that the velocity error in the object scales with the non-hydrostatic pressure gradient times the timestep of the Runge-Kutta substep. Presumably the non-hydrostatic pressure gradient in the object scales as the non-hydrostatic pressure over the length scale of the object. If the strength of the non-hydrostatic pressure field on the object of the boundary is a function of the outer-flow and object configuration, then I don't think grid refinement will help much. We should do a more rigorous validation of this at some point, but at least the dependence on the timestep gives a way to control the velocity error. I also suspect the pattern of the normal velocities in the plot shown may be spurious, as we know the velocity gets very small in all 'solid' nodes fully inside the object. The apparent error on the boundary as a function of angle may have to do with the how the current first-pass implementation sets the solid boundary location on the c-grid. . @christophernhill thanks very much for the offer!

Okay, this makes sense. Solving the problem for `calculate_Gu` just bumps the error down to `calculate_tracer_tendency`, and the issue isn't tractable in that case, since it's clearly important to support tracer forcing functions that depend on other tracers (eg for biogeochemical models). Can you provide a minimum script that reproduces the error? I do think many tracers is an important use case so solving this could warrant reducing the kinds of forcing functions we support --- if that's necessary. I think there also may be solutions that don't change what we support while still solving this problem; eg we provide some features that extend model capabilities specifically for the case of large numbers of tracers. For example, we could avoid passing the tracers explicitly into the kernels. Instead, we can attach references _only_ to the relevant / used fields directly in `Forcing` (we'd have to change the user API to `DiscreteForcing` to support this, but the changes need not be major). This way one might be able to support systems of reacting tracers, as well as many ""additional"" passive tracers that are not involved in a forcing function.

Modifiability,"> Greg, Doesn't Ali have a version of immersed boundary layers going?. @johncmarshall54, Ali experimented with a simple immersed boundary implemented via Oceananigans's user-defined forcing functions. The code is these 9 lines:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/a921fc3edbf795bf4a2193cca84cad41ebdd5625/verification/flow_around_cylinder/flow_around_cylinder.jl#L18-L27. This implementation damps the velocity field to zero on a very fast time-scale (specified by the parameter `K`) within the immersed boundary. This is certainly a nice, simple immersed boundary implementation for Dirichlet / Value boundary conditions and could be a good starting point. However, I also think there's some good reasons to pursue an alternate immersed boundary implementation to what @ali-ramadhan has done:. 1. @ali-ramadhan's implementation doesn't obviously extend to other boundary conditions, like prescribed gradients or fluxes (the latter being crucial for the geophysical problems we're interested in). So, even if we use a continuous forcing method similar to @ali-ramadhan's implementation, we need to figure out how to enforce boundary conditions other than Dirichlet boundary conditions.; 2. @ali-ramadhan's implementation conforms exactly to the grid; however we would like to be able to model smoothly-varying boundaries.; 3. As noted by @whitleyv, @ali-ramadhan's ""continuous forcing method"" implementation introduces a time-step restriction due to the need to explicitly resolve the damping time-scale in the forcing function. It seems that a discrete forcing method overcomes this restriction and could prove crucial for geophysical problems that involve otherwise long time-steps.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1036#issuecomment-707412244:56,layers,layers,56,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1036#issuecomment-707412244,2,"['extend', 'layers']","['extend', 'layers']"

Modifiability,"> Here's a question: wouldn't it be better if this were a `KernelComputedField`? (Or maybe even a `KernelFunctionOperation`?). I think reusing more features that have been developed for user applications internally is a great idea in general. More code reuse, more understandable internals. I have thought about this a bit for diffusivities and pressure fields, which are both auxiliary fields to a model and some flavor of ""ComputedField"". I think we would need to expand on the user interface to `KernelComputedField` for this purpose. There are a few reasons. First, the user interface to ComputedField does not supply a way to combine kernel computations for more than one field. Second, we need to develop a user interface for propagating arguments from `compute!` into the kernel. The reason is that we have to pass in both `closure` and `buoyancy` into this kernel. `KernelComputedField` supports parameters right now. However, I think its important that these arguments are explicitly passed from the model (rather than being bound to the diffusivities at model construction time) --- because models are mutable, which means that users can change the closure or buoyancy model on the fly (provided the new object has the same type as the old one). Expanding the computed field infrastructure to support simultaneous computation and propagated arguments would be really cool I think and a great addition to the code.

Modifiability,"> I am not sure that I am following everything there. Is it for flux-form of vector-invariant ? otherwise, I don't recognize the energy-conserving discretization (thought it would have been nice to have). I didn't realize the the Coriolis implementation is different for the ""flux-form"" momentum equations than for vector-invariant momentum equations --- thanks for pointing that out @jm-c. I don't quite understand why this is the case. However, it is not that difficult to extend our Coriolis implementation to dispatch on the `advection` ""scheme"" / form if we need to. After looking into the details (see below), it would appear that the implementation we are using is correct if. 1. The horizontal grid is regular; 2. The horizontal grid is curvilinear and we are using `momentum_advection=VectorInvariant()`. Because these are the only two possible cases, I believe the current Coriolis implementation is sufficient. However when/if we support curvilinear horizontal grids with flux form advection terms, we will (if we follow the MITgcm implementation) need to dispatch the evaluation of the Coriolis term on `momentum_advection` scheme. Another question is whether it even makes sense / is physically consistent to support `FPlane` and `BetaPlane` on grids that are sectors of the sphere.

Then when `U_b` is negative we either set the value or do nudging like in ROMS to prevent shocks (but I think this is a question for further down the line).

It makes sense to me that inflow is prescribed, whereas outflow is a little tricker, requiring us to smoothly advect information out of the domain. Having the boundary condition depend on the previous time-step does seem to break assumptions we have made about how information flows. For example, we call `update_state!` during model construction. How does the first time-step / initialization work with this kind of outflow model? It might help to consider that. Practically speaking it would not be hard to pass the time-step to update state.

Of course I agree with this. I think our basic principle should be that there is no difference in workflow, either for running or analysis, between scripts for checkpointing or not. Also, I think that `overwrite_existing` should not delete your files if you are picking up from a checkpoint (regardless of what it is set to).

If we have a system that does not overwrite files when picking up from a checkpoint, do you think that it will be necessary to have `overwrite_existing=false` by default? In this case, the only time we risk overwriting files is when we _re-run_ a simulation from the beginning. Assume for the following discussion that the ""overwriting issue"" is solved for checkpointing:. In my experience, I typically set up a script with `overwrite_existing=true` from the very beginning. This is because when we first write a script, we are prototyping. I have never then gone back and changed `overwrite_existing=false` because of some concern about overwriting data. It's inconvenient, in fact, to set `overwrite_existing=false`. My thought is that it makes more sense to ask people to intentionally request `overwrite_existing=false` in the _rare_ case that this is desired. The key insight is that we spend the vast majority of time prototyping. I would even argue from an economic standpoint that the productivity saved from this setting outweights any rare instances of lost data, if they actually would ever occur due to changing the default.

Modifiability,"> I see your point _but_ I don't think an example in a GitHub repo is the place to introduce notation. I dispute that I'm introducing new notation! Both `=` and approx have unambiguous meaning. Let me elaborate on ""why approx"":. Oceananigans solves the full N-S with nonlinear terms. The script's power method algorithm will fail if the eigenmode to grow too much --- this is a real pitfall of the power method. The purpose of the approx symbol is to concisely illustrate why this can happen. This is crucial to explain for users who want to experiment with the script, change parameters, and adapt it for new problems. We can explain this all in words, but I thought the approx is _visual_ which is helpful. Even just scanning the document you see, this equation involves an _approximation_. The approx is, in fact, a more precise and correct representation of the problem. We can in fact regard the power method algorithm as predicated on a hypothesis (not an exact theory), which we provide empirical evidence for. This is one of the advantages of the power method that uses the full original system, I think, over more brute force approaches that forcefully remove nonlinear terms.

Modifiability,"> I think we can achieve this by splitting a kernel like calculate_interior_source_terms! into two kernels, one that computes source terms ""near"" the boundary (1-2? grid points from any boundary as needed), then halo communication can happen while a second more compute-intensive kernel computes the source terms in the rest of the interior. Don't you want the opposite? You want a kernel that computes source terms in the ""deep interior"", which can be performed without knowledge of halos and thus can be performed simultaneous to performing communication. After communication + deep interior calculations are complete, you then perform calculations on near-boundary elements. Are communications restricted to `fill_halo_regions!` and the pressure solve?

My intuition from seeing results from papers (and from previous LES+IBM at my previous group) is that partial step cells would be almost as accurate as shaved cells (at least for oceanic cases with mild bathymetry slopes) but significantly simpler to implement. Since we already have the full-cell grid-fitted IBM it might be better to just focus on that for now and later modify it to make it partial-step when everything is working well (I think we'd just need to modify the calculation of vertical areas and volumes, no?).

I often find myself spending way longer on PRs than I initially anticipate so I'm generally not very good at assessing these things lol. ok ok! Here's a rule of thumb: a bugfix or refactor is the least committment, because you can get away with no new tests or docs. A new _feature_ takes more time because of documentation. One should expect to spend most of their time on docs and tests. If you're spending a lot of time implementing a feature, then either the feature is very complicated / hard, or your workflow can use some improvement. Among new features, different types of features require different amount of effort. This case is one of the easier cases --- it's extending functionality without changing existing functionality, also its fairly niche (at this point) so simple documentation will suffice. The work required to test the feature also has already been partially completed (the script you posted). Other features, like adding new _physics_ will take much longer, because often you'll have to run a full validation case + analysis to assess whether things work as expected. So even if the source code change is small to implement new physics, the validation will take a while and dominate the development effort.

One-line flexible output writing would be especially great for examples, new user friendliness, and quick iteration. Some thoughts:; 1. I think the name `output!` is a bit vague in what it does. Does it just output the current state of the simulation? Would `add_output_writers!` be clearer and align more closely with existing Oceananigans nomenclature? For the same reason, I'd suggest keeping `add_callback!` over renaming to `callback!`.; 2. I frequently output both JLD2 and NetCDF versions of the exact same data.

Modifiability,"> I'm assuming this is a relatively simple issue to resolve?. Unfortunately not due to our current algorithm that we inherited from MITgcm, but which we hope to change pretty soon. Right now Oceananigans splits up the pressure into the hydrostatic pressure anomaly and the non-hydrostatic pressure (see https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/numerical_implementation/pressure_decomposition/). MITgcm did this to facilitate easy switching between a hydrostatic mode and a non-hydrostatic mode: to turn a non-hydrostatic model into a hydrostatic one, just don't compute the non-hydrostatic pressure and recompute w from the continuity equation. But we feel we can use multiple dispatch to implement a hydrostatic model in Julia. This algorithm also requires extra memory (2 pressure fields instead of just 1). So we're hoping to change the algorithm to only use 1 pressure field and get rid of this pressure decomposition. The algorithm also makes it difficult to implement tilted gravity because the hydrostatic pressure anomaly is computed as. ```; pHY′ = ∫ buoyancy_perturbation dz from z=0 down to z=-Lz; ```. where `buoyancy_perturbation = g * (αT - βS)` if you're using a linear equation of state. So now if gravity is tilted it's not just a vertical integral. I'm actually not sure how to modify the vertical integral if gravity is tilted... Seemed easier to move away from this vertical integral by not decomposing pressure then we should be able to easily add in support for tilted gravity via a `bg⃗` term in the momentum equation where `g⃗ = g⃗(x, y, z)` can be whatever the user wants.

Right now, this PR makes some significant source code changes for what I think is a rather narrow application, which is disproportional compared to most of the other features we have I think. > If for some reason we cannot use a forcing function approach, we'll have to think carefully about how to design a flexible user API for ""particle-induced tracer forcing"". I think if we are going to add this then it should be more general than just a source/sink calculation --- ie, we should attempt to have a small source code addition that makes a wide range of new behavior possible, if we can. I've reconsidered this now and think we may not even need any source code change to properly implement this behaviour and integrate some particle induced tracer forcing. If we have a model with some tracers `(:A, :B)` which we want to force with some particles, we can define an auxiliary field `G\_p=TracerFields((:A, :B), grid)`. We can then have a particle dynamics function that modifies `model.auxiliary_fields.G\_p`, for example sets the points surrounding the particles to `-A[i, j, k]` for `A`, and `+A[i, j, k]` for `B` like in my example above. You can then define a discrete forcing function for each of the tracers like `a_forcing(i, j, k, grid, clock, model_fields) = model_fields.G\_p.A[i, j, k]` etc. (this would only work with my other PR #2733 added so that the `auxiliary_fields` are available). > It seems the memory requirement of the forcing function approach is proportional to the number of tracers, not the number of particles --- right?

Modifiability,"> Implement a multi GPU pressure solver. This can be achieved in a couple of different ways. (1) transpose local memory and perform one direction FFT at the time (at we do now in the Distributed module through PencilArrays). (2) exploit the multi GPU capabilities of cuda through the cufftxt library that can perform single node distributed FFT to up to 16 GPUs. (3) Allocate storage and plan in Unified memory and perform the FFT in only one GPU. Ideally we would implement (3) only if we are desperate. The best solution would be to go with method (2), as (1) incurs in hefty memory transfer costs (I am not sure as to how the cufftxt implements multi GPU FFT though). I think (but am not 100% sure) that PencilArrays is tied to MPI. So I guess for 1 we are either ""borrowing"" (but not using directly) the transpose algorithm from PencilArrays, or we are extending the code so that it works ""without MPI"" -- and also with GPUs, which is work in progress: https://github.com/jipolanco/PencilFFTs.jl/pull/37. Another reason to focus on 2 is that we can use PencilFFTs for _distributed_ (but _not_ `MultiRegion`) nonhydrostatic model. So even if PencilFFTs had support for CuArray now (and if `Distributed` were performant for multi GPU --- both of which may not be too close), using cufftxt could still _potentially_ be motivated by performance reasons. In other words, if we develop a capability with cufftxt, then in the future we can also support multi GPU via PencilFFT and `Distributed`, and we have two options (one perhaps performant on single node, multi GPU, and another to use when you need GPUs spread across multiple nodes).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2523#issuecomment-1118680852:857,extend,extending,857,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2523#issuecomment-1118680852,1,['extend'],['extending']

Modifiability,"> Its ok for there to be a divergence in the slip velocity. In the case of the ocean surface or seafloor that's exactly what you want since the particles will then accumulate at those surfaces depending on whether they are light or dense. Tracer is conserved in an integrated sense since the flux through the boundary vanishes. In some cases the user might want a flux across the boundary, e.g. for dense particles sinking through an open boundary at the bottom of the domain, so we probably want the profile of the slip velocity in the user's control. Also, note that for very buoyant tracers there will be numerical issues if the tracer all accumulates at the surface. Finer grid spacing can help a bit, but I think this is a drawback to using buoyant tracers and particles work better in those cases (Jenny discusses this in her draft paper on microplastics which is under review). That makes physical sense!. I believe supporting divergent slip velocities means we cannot use the ""flux form"" of the advection term, ie we cannot rewrite. ```; u_slip ⋅ ∇c = ∇ ⋅ (u_slip c); ```. correct? This means that we cannot use native Oceananigans operators for this advection term, since the operators we've implemented all assume that the advecting velocity field is non-divergent. This is not much of an issue since we can easily write a second-order discretization of `u_slip ⋅ ∇c`. In addition, we can support a flag in which users might optionally declare the velocity field as non-divergent, in which case we can use higher-order discretizations of `∇ ⋅ (u_slip c)`. Perhaps `SlipVelocity` is a better name than `AdvectiveForcing` since it parallels the literature?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2389#issuecomment-1082424860:1032,rewrite,rewrite,1032,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2389#issuecomment-1082424860,1,['rewrite'],['rewrite']

If anything it would have to be `GentMcWilliamsRedi` since we include the symmetric component as well as the skew component.

We could probably extend that to ~10⁸ grid points if we implement #98 but even then it would take 50-100 GPUs to reach 10¹⁰ grid points. We've mostly been running oceanic mixed layer simulations with a focus on vertical mixing so no need for a ton of horizontal resolution, but we do have horizontal mixing problems in mind at which point we'll need to start running on multiple GPUs with MPI. This is something we're starting to get serious about as we do need it ourselves. Not sure how coarse you can go but if you can go down to ~10⁸ grid points then maybe Oceananigans can be useful. If the factor of ~2 reduction in memory usage from #98 would be useful for you, let us know and we can look into implementing it.

Modifiability,"> OK, perhaps I'm a bit oblivious to physics of tilted gravity etc. Are is the tilted gravity crucially important for this to occur?. Apparently yes. This doesn't happen when the buoyancy acceleration is aligned with the model's z-coordinate. > Also, is there an energy integral associated with these dynamics when there is a fixed imposed buoyancy? Even in the continuous case, before we go to discrete world, is there guarantee that E should decrease?. That's a good point and as far as I can tell this system should have a a finite, non-increasing total energy since the background buoyancy is stable. So the background buoyancy shouldn't be introducing any extra energy reservoirs (unlike, for example, an Eady set-up, which constantly injects energy into the system by imposing a horizontal buoyancy gradient).

Its even pedagogical because it teaches you that we solve the Poisson equation for pressure. I love that and that is exactly why we chose this design. Please bear with me to understand the reason I am proposing this change. In practical usage / when coding new experiments it is easy to mix up ""pressure"" with ""poisson"". I've been working testing lots of different solvers these past few days, and keep accidentally typing `pressure_solver = ConjugateGradientPressureSolver(grid)` which is wrong. If it becomes more common to configure the pressure / poisson solver in the future (because we have better support for different solvers for irregular geometries) then I would like to also help others that may run into this issue. It's nice to have syntax that ""rolls of the tongue"", ie, is what you would type if you were typing without concentrating very hard. It's not big deal either.

Modifiability,"> Point taken, but I think there are still Oceananigans-relevant applications where Value / Gradient boundary conditions on non-immersed boundaries are useful enough to be a ""core"" feature (e.g. imposing observed SST patterns rather than observed air-sea heat fluxes), but there is always the workaround of strongly restoring boundary-adjacent sponge regions. I think this is what many ocean modelers do to implement such boundary conditions anyway. True! I'm not aware that has ever been done, but since it's not difficult to support (notwithstanding @simone-silvestri's concerns about parallel performance) it's interesting to allow it --- agree. For future readers I want to point out that SST restoring (and similar models) are typically be implemented as a `FluxBoundaryCondition` using a piston velocity model, rather than using `ValueBoundaryCondition` (which implies a flux mediated by some diffusivity / viscosity, possibly derived from a parameterization). (`FluxBoundaryCondition` is mathematically identical to restoring in the surface grid point, though it would be a slightly different model to distribute the restoring over some depth). It could be an interesting project to explore using some parameterization-derived diffusivity together with `ValueBoundaryCondition` to predict surface fluxes, though, I'm not sure what the implications would be.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3224#issuecomment-1690278452:948,parameteriz,parameterization,948,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3224#issuecomment-1690278452,2,['parameteriz'],"['parameterization', 'parameterization-derived']"

Modifiability,"> So what do you guys think if this tilting is implement at the AbstractBuoyancy level? If I understand correctly all buoyancy types inherit that, right? That way we'd have a keyword for the tilt (maybe tilt, gravitational_direction or gravity_projection) that would default to (0, 0, 1) and a similar option could be given to FPlane, avoiding confusion. Ah, the issue is that abstract types cannot have properties --- they can only be used to organize type parameters and dispatch.; The logic and motivation of your suggestion is sound though (avoiding code duplication through good design); we just have to come up with a different solution. A similar solution could perhaps design a more hierarchical interface to `IncompressibleModel.buoyancy`. For example, we might write. ```julia; struct Buoyancy{G, B}; gravitational_direction :: G; model :: B; end; ```. The existing subtypes of `AbstractBuoyancy` are used for `Buoyancy.model`. The user API could be. ```julia; buoyancy = Buoyancy(gravitational_direction=(0.1, 0, 0.9), model=BuoyancyTracer()); ```. or. ```julia; buoyancy = Buoyancy(gravitational_direction=(0.1, 0, 0.9),; model=SeawaterBuoyancy(gravitational_acceleration=9.81, equation_of_state=LinearEquationOfState(α=2e-4, β=8e-5))); ```. This is more verbose but could avoid some of the issues that @tomchor sees. As for `Plane` and `BetaPlane`, I agree that those models are really predicated on a thin aspect ratio assumption that has to do with gravitational accelerations, and therefore ""know"" about the direction of gravity. We could either add a property `gravitational_direction` or, perhaps, add some wrapper / helper functions for constructing coriolis forces in tilted domains (eg `coriolis = TiltedCoriolisForces(FPlane(f=1e-4), vertical_direction=(0.1, 0.0, 0.9))` which returns `GeneralCoriolis` with 3D Coriolis forces --- or something).

Edit: note that this is required for correct checkpointing, because the checkpointer passes a `ModelBoundaryConditions` to the model constructor, while we expect users to pass a `SolutionBoundaryConditions`. . The downside to this pattern is that the type of `model.boundary_conditions` will often be different than the keyword argument `boundary_conditions`. Hopefully this is not confusing or surprising... :-/ An alternative is perhaps to specifically delineate between them; ie change the keyword argument in the `Model` constructor to `solution_boundary_conditions`. However, something to consider is that the `tendency` and `pressure` fields of `ModelBoundaryConditions` should be uniquely determined by `SolutionBoundaryConditions`. Another factor to consider is that the pattern that keyword arguments correspond to fields is not a guaranteed julia pattern, it is simply an organizational principle that we feel is helpful.

Not quite. `TimeInterval` keeps a count of _how many times it has been actuated_. This is stored in the variable `TimeInterval.actuations`. It's use is illustrated in the computation of the `next_actuation_time`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/dc5dc28c6cf433dcb8a6668cef99e98309e6ead9/src/Utils/schedules.jl#L58-L63.

This means that the next actuation time --- the _third_ actuation_ -- will occur at the time. ```; t = 3 * 1.1 = 3.3; ```. Thus rather than storing the ""previous actuation time"" (a floating point number), we instead store the _number_ of actuations (an integer, and exact), and compute the next actuation time with the formula above.

When evolving the total fields, the condition of geostrophic balance is computed during the prognostic evolution of the total variables.

There is no need to worry about the tiny difference between discrete and continuous balance in the case that you only evolve perturbations.

Modifiability,"> We could procede in a couple of ways from here:. Let me provide a few other options:. * Compute the 2D boolean masks for reduced operations in `x`, `y`, and `z` when forming `ImmersedBoundaryGrid`. Then, use those masks for conditional differencing of reduced fields, rather than calling `immersed_inactive_node`. * For `GridFittedBottom` and `PartialCellBottom`, as a stop gap, define these methods:. ```julia; @inline conditional_δx_f(ℓy, ℓz, i, j, k, ibg::GFBIBG, δx, r::ZIRF, args...) = ifelse(immersed_inactive_node(i, j, ibg.Nz, ibg, c, ℓy, ℓz) |; immersed_inactive_node(i-1, j, ibg.Nz, ibg, c, ℓy, ℓz),; zero(ibg),; δx(i, j, k, ibg.underlying_grid, r, args...)). ```. That use a condition based on whether `k == Nz` is immersed. This will fix fields that are reduced in `z` without increasing memory storage or doing a computation in the immersed boundary grid constructor. And that's the most common case anyways. * When building a `ReducedField`, compute the mask that has to be applied to abstract operations. Then, extend the `_derivative` constructor for the combination of a `ReducedField` argument + `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` using conditional operation. This has the advantage of avoiding the mask computation in `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` (since its only needed to do operations on reduced fields). The disadvantage is that different reduced fields have to redo the computation. Also, this only fixes abstract operations and does not fix the internal operators. We also have to update the conditional operators to throw away the immersed boundary grid for reduced fields, or throw away the immersed boundary grid inside the abstract operation. * A variant on the above approach is to compute the mask when forming `Derivative`. But then a new mask is computed for every operation. There's probably a lot of other options.

Modifiability,"> When I started this issue, I wasn't really expecting to have Pacanowski-Philander parameterization implemented in a few hours. Kudos to you!!. Thanks for asking the question! Also is it ok if I convert to discussion? If it remains an issue we might lose track of it when the issue is closed. But this might be useful to people if its more visible. > Why you need to define f², wouldn't work simply using ∂zᶠᶜᶠ and squaring the operation?. Because we need to interpolate `∂zᶠᶜᶠ` using `ℑxzᶜᵃᶜ`. Note that Oceananigans operators (derivatives, interpolation, differences) are _composable_. The function `f²` is used in this composition --- it squares a _function_, rather than a _field_. So `ℑxzᶜᵃᶜ(i, j, k, grid, f², ∂zᶠᶜᶠ, U.u)` represents a stencil that interpolates `∂zᶠᶜᶠ(i, j, k, grid, u)^2` from `Face` to `Center` in both x and z. > For instance, you could first create the model, define Ri and closure and then set! the model with this new closure and auxiliary field. Yes, your question makes a lot of sense! The reason we can't do that is because _type_ of any of the properties of `model` cannot change. This means we need to know the type of `model.closure` _before_ we build it. Another way to say this is that `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is _concretely typed_, which means that functions of `model` can be optimized based on the types of _every_ property of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. This gives us performance advantages / reduces overhead, but also creates some limitations like: we have to define a `closure` before building model.

Talked briefly about this with @zhenwu0728 earlier and was suggesting something along those lines for the physics too. I could imagine additional applications for configs like these and am willing to help with e.g. exploring the parameter space a bit if needed. Maybe the simplest, yet rather tunable, approach I could think of would be something like:. - at the top: warming (e.g. via relaxation to SST0) + wind stress to mechanically generate turbulence; - below a certain depth z1: cooling (e.g. via relaxation to T1<SST0) to restore to positive stratification.

Modifiability,"> then we'd have to rewrite loads of stuff to make it so the user can specify whatever they want for the external state. I think see your point (I'm not sure I grasp the totality of it). Is your point that we are able to _re-use_ more existing code if we allow `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` and `DiscreteBoundaryFunction` as `condition`? I didn't understand this previously so thank you for clarifying. To re-use that code with a new `condition`, we can use a nesting technique:. ```julia; function getbc(open_bc::OpenBoundaryCondition, ...); state_value = getbc(open_bc.condition.external_state, ...); # other stuff related to matching; end; ```. This means that we don't have to rewrite anything, we just add new functionality for open boundary conditions on top. You could make the point that we have less _new_ code to write though, if we implement a design that allows conditions to be the same. And for users, this could be clearer, so I see the advantage of that. On the flip side, the advantage of making a new `OpenCondition` is that `getbc` retains its meaning as ""the function that returns the boundary condition value"". When we have an external state + matching scheme, the boundary condition values are not exactly the external state and are modified by the matching scheme.

I am not sure they use unified memory but they for sure use transposes https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2014/presentations/S4788-rapid-multi-gpu-programming-cuda-libraries.pdf. Mmm ok. Is this proposal a way to avoid cuffxt basically? I think what you outlined is somehow roughly how PencilFTTs work:. 1. FFT along local direction (dim=1); 2. Simultaneously communicate and permute data to (2, 1, 3) (or is it (2, 3, 1)?); 3. FFT along local direction (dim=2); 4. Simultaneously communicate and permute data to (3, 2, 1); 5. FFT along dim=3. At the end, the data has permutation (3, 2, 1). The backwards transform then reverses this process. `solver.storage` is actually a tuple of 3 preallocated arrays to support this algorithm. For the tridiagonal solver I think we want to use the same algorithm, except that we skip step 1 (ie the first step is to communicate and permute data with no transform). Once the two other transforms are complete we have data in the configuration (x, y, z) where z is local, and we can do a tridiagonal solve in eigenfunction space. Then we transform back and obtain data back in the (z, y, x) permutation, with z local, and copy into the pressure. We have to extend the tridiagonal solver to accomodate this kind of permutation for distributed CPU, so if we have an algorithm like the one above we can then also use it for MultiRegionGrid solves on the GPU.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2523#issuecomment-1119916674:1258,config,configuration,1258,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2523#issuecomment-1119916674,2,"['config', 'extend']","['configuration', 'extend']"

Modifiability,"@ali-ramadhan a few more comments:. - I don't understand why the temperature profiles you've plotted have spikes in them, especially since they are horizontal averages. What's going on? The sub grid scale diffusivities also seem to have far too much variance. - Can you plot multiple equilibrated horizontally averaged solutions for differing model constant `C`? I think we may need to determine the correct value of this constant for our numerical method in order for our results to match. It looks like the SGS diffusivity values are too small, so this might help... - We can't be sure what resolution an `Oceananigans.jl` model needs to be to match Diablo results, since Diablo uses a spectral discretization in the horizontal. That's something to keep in mind.

Modifiability,"@ali-ramadhan and I have discussed a potential redesign of `Simulation` and `run!` that has several key features:. 1. Coalesce all of the ""callbacks"" (arbitrary functions that are executed during a time-stepping loop) other than `OutputWriter`s into a single list. Current objects that we can classify / redesign as callbacks are: stop criteria, `TimeStepWizard`, and diagnostics. All callbacks are required to possess `callback.schedule`, and we can provide convenience objects for coupling simple callback functions to `AbstractSchedule`. 2. Within the time-stepping loop, execute `simulation.callbacks` prior to writing output. This ensures that data calculated in a callback can be output during the same time-step, such as `WindowedTimeAverage` and other non-local-in-time output. 3. Wrap the time-stepping loop inside a `try / catch` block and throw exceptions to stop a simulation. This generalizes the concept of stopping a simulation and also means that a simulation can be stopped inside any callback. Further, when an `AbstractStopException` is called we will loop over the `OutputWriter` callbacks a final time, passing the exception into the `OutputWriter` callback functions. This allows output behavior specialized on the type of exception. For example: . * If `NaNsDetected` is thrown, no output will be written.; * If `WallTimeExceeded` is thrown, the checkpointer may write output. 4. `simulation.Δt` becomes a number corresponding to the next time-step, always (rather than sometimes being a `TimeStepWizard`). The `TimeStepWizard` callback changes this number on its `schedule`. Otherwise, the time-step is held constant. This changes the API, since the initial time-step must now be provided to `Simulation`. 5. (Somewhat unrelated, but enabled by the new pattern) Use a new function `align!(simulation.Δt, writer.schedule, simulation.model)` to adjust a subsequent time-step if output writing is scheduled. This ensures output writing on `TimeInterval`s will always be on `schedu",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1138:483,coupling,coupling,483,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1138,1,['coupling'],['coupling']

Modifiability,"@francispoulin @glwagner @ali-ramadhan @christophernhill ; I took a look at all the benchmarking scripts in our benchmarks folder and realized that many of them are very similar and can be unified. For example, the single script for shallow water model's strong and weak scaling differ only by one substring. ; The latest commit I pushed to this branch unifies all of the launcher and single scripts for shallow water model into three scripts. Now, at the top of the launcher script `distributed_shallow_water_model.jl`, there are two boolean variables that the user can toggle for strong vs weak scaling and mpi vs threaded parallel execution. Everything including output graphs, HTML tables, and info messages also change accordingly based on the two booleans. There are some other features that Francis and I have discussed but would like your approval first before adding them in.; Other possible additions to the script can include a for loop which wraps around the whole launcher script which loops through the strong/weak scaling and mpi/threaded parallelism options to allow for running 4 benchmarks at once.

Granted, I could just copy and paste the shallow water model scripts and replace all instances of `shallow water` with `nonhydrostatic` or `hydrostatic` and tune some options a little bit, but then this would again cause avoidable clutter.

Modifiability,"@francispoulin explained the situation well for `Gradient` and `Value` boundary conditions. I'd like to restate what he said in the context of the finite volume method and clarify the situation for `Flux` boundary conditions because I said something wrong above... Oceananigans uses a weak formulation of PDEs via the finite volume method. We evolve the average value of fields, integrated over a cell volume. In this integral formulation there are two contributions to the tendency of a field: fluxes across cell interfaces (advective and diffusive usually, but also possibly others via user-defined forcing), and interior ""sources"" (such as pressure gradients, Coriolis forces, gravitational forces). When users invoke `Gradient` or `Value` boundary conditions, then the same model is used for fluxes across interior cell interfaces as for ""exterior"" interfaces (domain boundaries). Thus if users set `closure=nothing` and zero out diffusive fluxes, boundary fluxes are _always_ zero regardless of what `Gradient` or `Value` are specified. More specifically, we enforce `Gradient` or `Value` boundary conditions by filling halo regions and then calculating exterior fluxes using the same kernel that's evaluated in the interior. As @francispoulin points out this is not some quirk of our algorithm or numerics; this follows from the properties of the underlying PDE. Something different happens when `Flux` boundary conditions are specified and this is where I was wrong above. With `Flux` boundary conditions, users are really specifying two _different_ models for fluxes: one across ""interior"" cell interfaces, and another for fluxes across domain boundaries. Setting `closure=nothing` in this case only nullifies _interior_ diffusive fluxes. But since boundary fluxes are explicitly specified in this case, they still do have an impact on interior tendency values. . A further subtlety is that `Value` and `Gradient` boundary conditions do actually have an impact if there is non-zero `NormalFlow",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1630#issuecomment-832093191:343,evolve,evolve,343,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1630#issuecomment-832093191,1,['evolve'],['evolve']
Modifiability,"@francispoulin thanks for starting this discussion!. Broadly speaking I think we would like to implement an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian vertical coordinate in the long run. As far as I understand, implementing an ALE scheme would require more changes than just a new `AbstractGrid`. We need to modify the time-stepping to include a regridding / interpolation stage, and I believe we also need to change the equations being solved (the tendency kernels). . My preliminary thought on software design is that this might be a new model property, something like `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel.vertical_coordinate`. Then one needs to interpret the z-coordinate in the chosen `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel.grid` in light of the choice of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel.vertical_coordinate`. Other design ideas are certainly welcome!. Something less clear is what happens if we design a terrain following coordinate. Perhaps you are write @francispoulin that terrain following coordinates can be implemented purely by introducing a new type of grid (because the grid is not moving... ?) I think terrain-following, curvilinear grid would require three-dimensionally curvilinear operators, correct? So we would have to update the implementation of the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` operators as well. As for a horizontal grid for `ShallowWaterModel`, since we have horizontally-curvilinear operators I think you might be able to do `boundary_following` in the horizontal once you refactor `ShallowWaterModel` to use horizontally-curvilinear operators.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1549#issuecomment-814206629:1467,refactor,refactor,1467,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1549#issuecomment-814206629,1,['refactor'],['refactor']
Modifiability,"@francispoulin, sure, I'd like to discuss the implementation of advection in the `ShallowWaterModel`. We can also zoom if you want, send me an email and we can see when we both have time. @christophernhill I'll take a look at that! It will be nice when implementing the cubed sphere. @pvthinker thanks for the comment! In this case vorticity is still the quantity being upwinded. I agree that upwinding the velocity would lead to errors since you have to ensure consistency in `div(U)` which you break by using an upwinding stencil for U (at least on a C-grid). ; Here I just relied on U to assess the ""smoothness"" of the vorticity stencils for upwinding. (if we look it in an ENO fashion, the choice of wether to upwind strongly or use a (less dissipative) centered stencil for vorticity relies on the velocity field rather than the vorticity field). . This might also be consistent with how you choose the stencils in the advection of tracers, where the choice is based on the evolved quantity (I have no mathematical proof in this case). I agree though, that maybe some more quantitative study is required to ensure that this method plays nicely.

Modifiability,"@glwagner ; I am really impressed with your effort to explain to me all details of the implementation. Thanks you!; In the past few days I am learning a lot reading the code/documentation and examples of Oceananigans. When I started this issue, I wasn't really expecting to have Pacanowski-Philander parameterization implemented in a few hours. Kudos to you!!; I know this parameterization is very simple, but implementing it on a FORTRAN-based GCM from scratch would take waaaay more time, at least for me. Can you help me to see if I understood everything correctly? Please, sorry if I am asking too-trivial questions. Why you need to define `f²`, wouldn't work simply using `∂zᶠᶜᶠ` and squaring the operation?. I understand that you create a fake model and don't run it, simply use it to update the auxiliary field. I don't understand why you could not do the same for the main model. For instance, you could first create the model, define Ri and closure and then `set!` the model with this new closure and auxiliary field. Does that makes sense? I understand the in the background this might not work the way it is now. Something like this:. ```; model = HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel(; grid, tracers=:b, buoyancy=BuoyancyTracer()). Ri = Field(KernelFunctionOperation{Center, Center, Center}(Riᶜᶜᶜ, grid, computed_dependencies=(model.velocities, model.tracers.b))). ν = ν₀ + ν₁ / (1 + c * Ri^n); κᵇ = κ₀ + κ₁ / (1 + c * Ri^(n+1)). closure = ScalarDiffusivity(VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization(); ν, κ=(; b=κᵇ)). set!(model, closure = closure, auxiliary_fields = (; Ri)); ```. Thinking on a more general way, it would be awesome to give a general function that could depend on any field in the model, including auxiliary. I am thinking that this way it would be easier for users to create and implement their own parameterizations. Including using any model in general that could come in a form of a function. For instance, a ML model could be simply used as a turbulence closure.

Modifiability,"@glwagner Sorry for a late response. The current implementation I have going projects the velocity into tangential and normal directions (with respect to the immersed surface) before interpolating over the boundary. Since the boundary can be pretty variable in made more sense for us to take this approach. So the user would specify what they want the two tangential and 1 normal direction to be instead of (u,v,w) specifically. Obviously with tracers there is no projection because it's not a vector like that. I know this is a little different than the fitted version, because it's a little harder to specify a normal direction in that case, and also different from what you do for the usual boundary condition. My interpolation can handle Neumann and Dirichlet ie. `Value` and `Gradient` and the original idea was to infer `Flux` from `Gradient`, but right now everything is hard coded in. The normal and tangential though, would not hold with the current boundary condition set up with `North` or `East` or `Top` etc, but I don't think it would be hard to have whatever implementation is decided and just have 'Tang' and 'Normal' or whatever as well?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-850539557:249,variab,variable,249,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-850539557,1,['variab'],['variable']

The reasons he states are as follows:. - h ∇ 𝐯 is a parameterization of the turbulent flux and therefore should be proportional to the depth.; - This ensures that the diffusion of momentum is in the form of the divergence of a stress tensor (Schar and Smith 1993); - It has a negative definite effect on the KE budget if the viscous boundary condition is either no slip or free slip. Of course a problem occurs where h=0 but I guess we just don't apply viscosity where there is no fluid.

Modifiability,"@glwagner the idea is that the flow of the script for a user would be something like this:. (1) define a grid; (2) choose an architecture; .; .; code does not change from here on; .; . for this reason I was thinking you cannot have a `DistributedNonhydrostaticModel` vs a `NonhydrostaticModel` as much as you don't have a `CPUNonhydrostaticModel` vs a `GPUNonhydrostaticModel`. About the future direction: I was thinking that `Distributed` could be as much of an architecture as `CPU` and `GPU` are. As an example, there is no GPU.jl module which individually extends all the other modules for gpu execution like the extending the Fields.jl module with a `gpu_fields.jl` in GPU.jl. But I see what you mean when you say boundary conditions and fields have to take the precedence over distributed because it is maybe more linear to extend them in a separate module. Maybe integrating fields and boundary conditions in the respective modules (how is done for CPU and GPU which are not separated) for Distributed might make the code a little too complex and keeping it separate is the way to go. I am all up for that. . Now, discussing the `architecture` vs `grid` problem, step (1) and (2) are interlocked, and choosing which goes first (i.e. grid depend on architecture or other way around?) will make a big difference. At the moment they are kind of independent one another (i.e. some `grids` have an `architecture` field, distributed architecture depends on a grid). . In the future I believe we don't want to have the users fiddling with local_ and parent_ grids. I believe you want them to specify the parent grid, an architecture, and the code takes care of the rest. To achieve that, either a copy of the local or parent grid has to be stored in the architecture type when running `MultiArch`. For the constructor you where talking about `RectilinearGrid(arch=MultiArch; kwargs...)` which returns the local grid, we can do that, but the problem is that the connectivity of the architecture depends",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2073#issuecomment-974677724:560,extend,extends,560,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2073#issuecomment-974677724,3,['extend'],"['extend', 'extending', 'extends']"

Modifiability,"@iuryt speaks truth... it's hard to say something _isn't_ ""feasible"". However, I do think that polishing off an n-layer extension of the existing ShallowWaterModel would require some time. I think you want to write not only the continuous equations, but also the finite volume discretization (and there's some issues around discretization of the advection operator now see #1866). There are some design questions regarding the user interface and the use of existing grids. One possibility is to use the existing grids (which all have a z-coordinate) to specify the _number_ of layers (via the vertical size), but to ignore the vertical grid. Then users would also have to input the buoyancy of each layer (I think I'd prefer buoyancy to density, if that's possible...) But another design might be possible that ""re-uses"" whatever users provide for the vertical grid. I just took a look at the code and was surprised to notice that all of the kernels and fields are already three-dimensional. That means that once the user interface is figured out and appropriate model modifications are made, the ""only"" thing left might be to generalize the kernels...

Modifiability,"@jakebolewski I'm wondering what you think about the strategy of running a few key integration tests via GitHub actions, in addition perhaps to unit tests that have low compilation costs. For example, we have a couple ""regression tests"" that ensure the output of a simulation is identical to one run previously. These regression tests are imprecise (we only know that something has changed, but can't identify exactly what it is), but nevertheless catch both obvious API bugs and subtle numerics bugs incurred by refactoring. Another nice feature is that regression tests invoke (or are supposed to invoke) configurations that are most common / most valuable to users. They are also relatively cheap since we load states from a file and run for 10-100 time-steps at modest resolutions, and there are a small number of them which mitigates compilation cost. When I undertake a major refactor I often find myself running regression tests first.

Modifiability,"@jmbeckers thanks for the delucidation! Indeed, a conservative discretization might be more ""natural"" (have better discrete properties) in terms of momentum conservation. Especially because vector invariant formulations do not conserve momentum but angular momentum. @francispoulin, indeed, I think that, for a one layer model explicit dissipation might not be necessary because the noise associated with a horizontal velocity divergence is encoded in the mass equation which is discretized with a WENO formulation also (another way of repeating what @glwagner said). This is the difference with the hydrostatic model where we do not explicitly evolve a prognostic equation for the vertical velocity and we have to explicitly damp the noise contained in the vertical velocity `w` through a divergence damping closure. So you can think at that ""divergence damping"" closure as a ""WENO"" for an hypothetical `w` equation (which we have in the shallow water equations explicitly trough `h`). I agree also that we should introduce a diffusion term anyways. It is always good to be able to quickly quantify the dissipation you have in your model and with implicit dissipation that is very difficult (implicit LES is frowned upon by many purist of turbulence). for the documentation problem I think it's just because I changed the example.

Modifiability,"@johncmarshall54 that would be nice I agree! But not super easy. I've concentrated on tools in `OceanTurb` that allow us to quickly develop new models (abstractions for time-stepping, PDEs, macros for declaring the prognostic variables in a PDE, etc). . These tools *could* be implemented in `Oceananigans` (I'd love to, in fact) but it's not copy and paste. Not only would they require substantial changes to Oceananigans (more abstraction, decoupling of the time stepper from equation specification, etc), there there will likely be some challenges adapting `OceanTurb` ideas to the GPU. . We will need to start using `Oceananigans.jl` eventually to develop parameterizations for the mesoscale problem. For that, we will probably want to use `Oceananigans` as both our 'data' (high-res model) and as 'model' (low-res model with parameterization). For this effort we *will* need some of the abstractions developed for `OceanTurb` to easily change the underlying PDE implemented in `Oceananigans.jl` and develop/implement new and radical paramterization ideas.. So this process may begin soon, but it will be gradual. . That said, hopefully it *can* begin in a few months after I have wrapped up the column modeling work and (with everyone's blessing) turned my attention to the mesoscale problem. It's been nice to keep them separate so far --- I've made a lot of drastic and breaking changes to `OceanTurb` in my quest to prototype and refine abstraction techniques. I think the current PR #210 is an example of what we should do with increasing frequency in the next few months --- take ideas that have been developed in `OceanTurb` (in 1D) and reimplement them in 3D in `Oceananigans`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/174#issuecomment-486742843:226,variab,variables,226,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/174#issuecomment-486742843,4,"['adapt', 'parameteriz', 'variab']","['adapting', 'parameterization', 'parameterizations', 'variables']"
Modifiability,"@m3azevedo and me are doing a simulation of an unstable baroclinic jet in the context of the Nonhydrostatic model and having some success but some difficulties as well. We have tried two different approaches: . Method 1: define the jet and stratification to be part of the background field and evolve the perturbations. Method 2: define the jet and stratification as part of the initial conditons and evolve the total field. These are mathematically equivalent and should both yield the same results, but we are finding a difference and believe there is a problem with method 2 (evolving the total fields). . When pick there to be zero perturbations, the jet is an exact solution to the governing equations (even though it is an unstable one) and it should persist, until perturbations arise because of numerical errors. The good news is that when we use method 1, evolve the perturbations, when we pick zero perturbations, no pertrubations develop for a long time. . The not so good news, is that when we use method 2, evolve the total field, a distrubance develops right away,in the center of the jet that spans the entire depth, and this seems to radiate gravity waves to the left and right. The amplitude of the distrubance is small and it does decrease with increasing resolution but it seems problematic. I am going to include an animation that shows the problem that develops in the first 6 hours and the two codes, which are almost identical. Is there something that we are doing wrong here? @glwagner ?.

Modifiability,"@masonrogers14 Thanks for looking into this and writing up some notes! That's pretty cool that there's an explicit formula for inverting a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. While it is explicit, it seems that you have to solve an implicit equation for λ but that only has to be done once. Yeah I guess this wouldn't generalize to a vertically stretched grid with variable Δz as each row is different now, but the same derivation in the notes can be used to reach the tridiagonal system required. Indeed, the batched tridiagonal solver in `Oceananigans.Solvers` used a slightly modified TDMA algorithm. ---. @masonrogers14 On another note, @rafferrari, @glwagner, and I were talking about your simulation yesterday. Implicit time-stepping for diffusion may not be the most useful feature as it sounds like you want ""realistic"" values for the viscosity ν and diffusivity κ (@rafferrari was thinking 10⁻⁴ m²/s), whereas implicit diffusion helps when your diffusion is very high. High diffusion may be eroding away your isopycnals when you're hoping for them to slope (although I think you just had high ν). But I think you reported that the model tends to blow up when ν and κ are too small. I think this could be related to the second-order advection scheme which is known to introduce numerical oscillations/artifacts which require a high enough diffusivity to smooth out and keep the model stable. To get around this issue you should probably increase the resolution of your model (add more grid points) so you can keep using a small ν and κ (and hopefully a much larger time step than 20 seconds). I think you're using the `TimeStepWizard` so you can just set the maximum time step to be something like 0.1Δz²/2κ. For small κ like 10⁻⁴ m²/s and Δz ~ 10 m the maximum time step to keep diffusion stable should still be multiple hours and the `TimeStepWizard` will probably just limit the time step according to the CFL condition to keep advection stable. Hopefully the increased time step should help a lo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/587#issuecomment-573038475:359,variab,variable,359,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/587#issuecomment-573038475,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"@navidcy it shouldn't impact developer workflow too much. When going over the test structure with @glwagner on Tues. I suggested the following restructuring:. * Break-out ""quick"" unit-tests to be run by github actions under a single configuration (ex: linux, julia 1.6) and be able to run them in parallel. We have a ""Team"" account donated by Github so we can have tons of concurrent GitHub actions so this is beneficial if you can take advantage (might be limited by compilation costs). These tests will be run for every PR push and fast fail on error.; * `bors try` trigger a more expensive CI job to be submitted to the cluster, allowing for GPU / MPI tests. The logic here is that if the cpu tests are not working then the GPU tests almost certainly won't so you can get away with executing them less often. We have a daemon running on the cluster that synchronizes the jobs from buildkite with the local slurm controller, so every step in the buildkite config is submitted as a separate slurm job and canceling buildkite jobs kills them with slum. What is nice about that setup is you can tailor the resources used for each buildkite step just as you would slurm (ex. ""gres:1"" for 1 gpu). You can run jobs on multiple ranks, multiple GPU's, different resource limits, timeouts, etc. basically anything you can pass through to as a cli argument to a slurm batch job is supported. Also it's running on a cluster so obviously your job parallelism is very good.; * `bors r+` trigger merging the PR into `main` branch. This serializes the commits to `main` (and roll-up concurrent PR's to be submitted) so that all merge commits will pass the tests. This is an opportunity to also maybe run more expensive tests (it's easy in buildkite to conditionally run steps if running on `staging` branch) because you'll probably only run the staging CI step one or at most a few times at the very end,. the general strategy is to tier the tests so that they get progressively more expensive and to maximize ci-p",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778:233,config,configuration,233,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778,2,['config'],"['config', 'configuration']"

Modifiability,"@simone-silvestri and I have discussed a number of improvements to solvers (mostly refactoring and cleanup); I'm opening this issue to record our discussion. Here are some items in no particular order:. 1. `HeptadiagonalIterativeSolver` should use our internal `PreconditionedConjugateGradientSolver`. This is important because we need to use `PreconditionedConjugateGradientSolver` elsewhere, and we want to a) ensure that it's optimized and b) ensure we can reason about _why_ one solver is faster than another. 2. Related to 1., we can refactor `PreconditionedConjugateGradientSolver` to have a similar interface as `cg` from `IterativeSolvers`. Then we can swap in and out. 3. `HeptadiagonalIterativeSolver` should solve linear systems only, and have nothing to do with time-stepping. Right now `solve!` for the `HeptadiagonalIterativeSolver` is entangled with time-stepping:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/90f7de4cb3ed2fa9e22231177fd56b0f33c39df9/src/Solvers/heptadiagonal_iterative_solver.jl#L286-L308. since it ""knows"" about ""`previous_Δt`"". This logic should be moved to `MatrixIterativeFreeSurfaceSolver`. 4. We should disentangle / modularize the implementation of matrix-based preconditioners in `HeptadiagonalIterativeSolver`. In particular we should be able to use matrix-based preconditioners with any iterative solver that uses `PreconditionedConjugateGradientSolver`. Right now, the fastest way to compute left-hand-sides is with `PCGImplicitFreeSurfaceSolver`, but the best preconditioners can only be used with `MatrixIterativeSolver`. If our code were more modular, we could use the matrix-based preconditioners with `PCGImplicitFreeSurfaceSolver` to achieve the fastest possible combination of methods. Note that some of the changes in #2412 will help (in particular, an improvement to the interface into `PreconditionedConjugateGradientSolver` for defining preconditioners).

Modifiability,"@simone-silvestri brainstormed today about ways to clean up `TurbulenceClosures`. One idea that came up is to combine `IsotropicDiffusivity` and `HorizontallyCurvilinearAnisotropicDiffusivity` into a single `ScalarDiffusivity` (where isotropy in various directions is _implied_). We'll also simplify the ""anisotropic"" diffusivity in this process. The user interface could look something like. ```julia; three_dimensional_diffusivity = ScalarDiffusivity(ThreeDimensional(), ν=1); horizontal_diffusivity = ScalarDiffusivity(Horizontal(), ν=1); vertical_diffusivity = ScalarDiffusivity(Vertical(), ν=1); ```. so, no more `νh` and `νz`. The advantage is that we eliminate / share much more code. Arguably the API is a bit cleaner as well. (We can discuss aliases and defaults like `HorizontalScalarDiffusivity`, etc.). Under the hood we'll add the `Directionality` type to the type parameters of `ScalarDiffusivity`:. ```julia; struct ScalarDiffusivity{TimeDisc, Nu, Kappa, Directionality} <: AbstractScalarDiffusivity{TimeDisc, Dir}; ν :: Nu; κ :: Kappa. function IsotropicDiffusivity{TimeDisc}(dir::Dir, ν::Nu, κ::Ka) where {TimeDisc, Dir, Nu, Ka}; return new{TimeDisc, Nu, Ka, Dir}(ν, κ); end; end; ```. Then `abstract_isotropic_diffusivity.jl` becomes `abstract_scalar_diffusivity.jl`, and will implement the necessary abstractions for 3D isotropic scalar diffusivities, horizontally-isotropic diffusivities (a la MITgcm), and vertical diffusivities. . Consolidating code is an important precursor to a larger refactor that might. 1) support `AbstractOperation` viscosities and diffusivities at all locations on the grid; 2) eliminate `diffusivity_fields` and; 3) perhaps also involve fixing `TwoDimLeith` and implementing a biharmonic Leith.",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2239:1510,refactor,refactor,1510,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2239,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

Modifiability,"@simone-silvestri discussed the pros and cons of implementing this ""single process version"" of `MultiRegion`. ### Cons. The main con is the difficulty in maintaining code for `MultiRegionGrid` and `MultiRegionObject`, plus `apply_regionally!`. The difficulties we face here are identical to the issues that have plagued our maintenance of `CubedSphereGrid`: the need to redispatch and `apply_regionally!` a huge number of methods on `MultiRegionGrid` creates extensive cross dependencies between ""local"" implementations and their multi-region versions. This is unbelievably annoying to maintain when refactoring or adding features to existing local implementations. We can mitigate the above issue with (i) clever and careful code design and (ii) potentially a bit of metaprogramming, similar to how `@kernel` and `adapt(to, obj)` achieve CPU/GPU polymorphism. ### Pros. We identified 3 main pros:. 1. We can run problems distributed across many GPUs, or cubed sphere problems on GPU or CPU, on a single process without an MPI dependency. This is a huge win for user experience, interactivity, and ease-of-use (users don't need to invoke `mpiexec`). 2. Related to 1, we can debug complex multiregion applications (like the cubed sphere) without MPI. This is important, given the complexity of the cubed sphere (and extensions / generalizations of the quasi-unstructured cubed sphere algorithm). 3. CUDA provides functionality that works on multi-GPU nodes: CUDA FFT, matrix algebra, etc. Being able to launch these utilities from a single Julia process may greatly simplify the implementation of GPU-distributed elliptic solvers.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2253#issuecomment-1050206426:600,refactor,refactoring,600,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2253#issuecomment-1050206426,3,"['adapt', 'polymorphi', 'refactor']","['adapt', 'polymorphism', 'refactoring']"
Modifiability,"@simone-silvestri here's some description of the GVC problem. There's additional discussion on #1549. Today, we discussed whether the prognostic variable in a model formulated with a generalized vertical coordinate is thickness weighted velocity `hu`, or velocity `u` (which has also come up on #2522). Based on some discussion and consultation with papers it seems that we want both, because we evolve `hu` when we use ""flux form"" or ""conservative form"" momentum advection, but we evolve `u` when we use ""vector invariant"" advection. This choice has consequences beyond momentum advection though (I think). Also, whichever momentum variable we prognose, we always prognose the thickness weighted tracer concentration `hc`.

Modifiability,"@simone-silvestri were discussing implementing some new closures such as K-epsilon / ""Generic Length Scale"", and the OSMOSIS scheme used by the NEMO ocean model. Both these closures, and `CATKEVerticalDiffusivity`, introduce new prognostic variables (such as turbulent kinetic energy, dissipation, or mixed layer depth) that must be evolved alongside the model state. For CATKE we have hacked in a turbulent kinetic energy equation that gets used when i) the tracer is named `:e` and ii) one of the closures is `CATKEVerticalDiffusivity`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9e620637670cdd4defa32c07c51fd5574520de73/src/Models/HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModels/calculate_hydrostatic_free_surface_tendencies.jl#L99-L105. this works but the design is not sustainable. There are a few issues: first, we can't continue to abuse `model.tracers` to add new prognostic variables. Some prognostic variables shouldn't be called ""tracers"" --- like mixed layer depth. Also, we probably want a design in which `model.tracers` is unaffected by the closure being used. This will make it easier to switch between different closures in, for example, a large-scale ocean simulation. The second issue is that we need to design an interface so that the ""prognostic dynamics"" of a closure's auxiliary prognostic variable can be implemented and confined to the file where the closure is defined (ie, `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` shouldn't know anything about `CATKE` in particular). One solution is to add a new model property called `auxiliary_prognostic_fields`. This might behave similarly to `model.diffusivity_fields`; eg every `closure` can populate this object in the model constructor. Then we'll add tendency fields for those terms, and time-step them forward. The ""tendency kernel function"" that get's called will also have be provided by the closure. Just to make things more logical, we could also rename `diffusivity_fields` to `auxiliary_diagnostic_fields` when we do this.

Modifiability,"@simone-silvestri's recent work on scalable performance for the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` used the concept of ""inner"" and ""boundary"" regions to overlap communication and computation. The basic components are:. 1) Reduce communication as much as possible (for example, compute diagnostic variables wherever needed rather than communicating results); 2) Compute the ""interior"" of the tendencies first, which do not require halo regions, while communication is occurring; 3) Once communication is finished, compute the ""boundary regions"" of the tendency. Point (1) requires us to compute diagnostic variables inside halo regions. This requires both expanded sizes and offsets for each diagnostic variable. Different diagnostic variables have different sizes --- the width of the diagnostics kernels depends on how many points are accessed. Points (2) and (3) require computations over parts of the grid (reduced size + offset). These considerations demand a nice abstraction so that the code for launching kernels is readable and understandable (and also concise).",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3067:291,variab,variables,291,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3067,4,['variab'],"['variable', 'variables']"

Modifiability,"@thabbott and I have been thinking about potential ways we can reuse LES/turbulence closures between incompressible and compressible models. One approach we came up is for all turbulence closures to define functions for the SGS stress tensor like ∂ⱼτᵢⱼ where τᵢⱼ = νˢᵍˢSᵢⱼ and where νˢᵍˢ will dispatch on the type of closure while the strain-rate tensor Sᵢⱼ will dispatch on whether the model is compressible or incompressible. For compressible models, Sᵢⱼ will instead compute and return the _traceless_ strain-rate tensor Sᵢⱼ - ⅓Sₖₖδᵢⱼ. A turbulence closure can define ∂ⱼτᵢⱼ directly to elide or short circuit computations or in case the SGS stress tensor is not of the form ∂ⱼτᵢⱼ = νˢᵍˢSᵢⱼ. Still learning more about this topic but it seems that as a start, just using the traceless strain-rate tensor for compressible models allows us to reuse a closure from an incompressible model. @thabbott suggested that νˢᵍˢ might have to dispatch on the thermodynamic variable as well. Is this true for the viscosity or only the diffusivities κˢᵍˢ? I.e. do we have to treat SGS fluxes of moisture and energy in a special way?.

Modifiability,"@tomchor . In terms of ""smoothness indicators"" yes, not in terms of polynomial reconstruction. The WENO we had before is `WENO5()`. This will be formally wrong on a stretched grid because the reconstruction at the face is not done accounting for variable spacing. . `WENO5(grid = grid, stretched_smoothness=false) ` accounts for variable spacing in the reconstruction polynomial (i.e., the <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c_{rj}""> coefficients are calculated based on grid spacing). This makes the scheme formally correct as, independently on how you weight the polynomials, the different stencils will have mathematically correct reconstructions at the face. This should _always_ be done in case of a stretched grid (and it does not decrease execution speed). Now, the `stretched_smoothness=true` calculates the <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_{r}""> accounting for a stretched mesh. This means that the three reconstruction polynomials (<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_{0}, p_{1}, p_{2}"">) are weighted accounting for their actual smoothness and not a ""uniform smoothness"" that `WENO5(grid = grid, stretched_smoothness=false) ` calculates.

Modifiability,"@tomchor and @whitleyv this PR adds a script that we can use to _estimate_ the relative effect of bottom drag vs form drag in buoyancy-stratified simulations over hilly bathymetry. This script only produces an estimate, because the bottom drag is implemented in a flat bottom setup, while form drag requires bathymetry. I'd hypothesis that we get more drag when there are both hills and bottom drag, because 1) greater shear at the bottom and 2) stronger downwards mixing of momentum due to strong turbulence. We could use #2275 to extend the results obtained here to cases with both drag and hills. I think it'll also be interesting if more accurate bathymetry representations like the one in #2306 lead to a reduction in form drag (cc @francispoulin). Possibly the spurious form drag is a nice metric to use to judge developments in our representation of bathymetry...

Modifiability,"@tomchor do you mind if I generalize this issue to talk about refactoring the examples in general?. Here are my thoughts:. 1. I agree we should combine Langmuir turbulence and Ocean wind mixing and convection. I think we should implement one LES example with all bells and whistles: surface waves, wind forcing and buoyancy forcing, temperature/salinity, and potentially also a nonlinear equation of state. 2. I think we should keep convecting plankton and continue to develop that as a pedagogical example for both time-dependent boundary conditions and to illustrate Oceananigans' potential for chemistry / biology modeling via nonlinear forcing functions. 3. I think we should convert the Eady turbulence example to something that uses the hydrostatic model with bathymetry (perhaps some baroclinic instability example with bathymetry). 4. We should get rid of the geostrophic adjustment example. 5. We need an example on `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`.

Modifiability,"@tomchor unfortunately we don't have an issue for this problem. @sandreza is it possible to open an issue to document the problem that we are seeing? In the case that this PR does not resolve the issue, we'd like to have an issue open... I don't have much hard evidence to provide but I can describe the problem as I've seen it. Basically, very rare, subtle irregularities have been observed on the GPU when using `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` in a `Periodic, Bounded, Bounded` configuration. I think that it is possible the main issue is an interaction (a read-write race condition) associated with both impenetrable boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions that affects the 8 corner points. The race condition affects model trajectories via the Coriolis force (which is the only term as far as I know that touches the 8 ""corner"" points affected by this race condition). Because the race condition only manifests when a `Coriolis` or `VectorInvariant` stencil touches corner points, it may not affect _most_ `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` models, which could explain why we haven't caught it. The reason it doesn't affect those models is because this race condition would only affect the corner points of `w`, which are not touched when using an `FPlane` Coriolis model. However, it's possible (I'm not sure) that the race condition could affect models using `NonTraditionalFPlane` in `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` configurations. More generally, it will also affect models that are bounded in the `y`-direction, because in those models the corner points of the `y`-velocity are affected and also invoked when using `FPlane` or `BetaPlane` coriolis. That's as much as I know. It's very hard to gather information about this bug because it's so rare are subtle. In other words, only one grid point among 10,000 iterations might be affected, and the errors induced are very small. To find this issue, we have to run tens of thousands of iterations of identical models on the GPU, and then co",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1985#issuecomment-921143865:478,config,configuration,478,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1985#issuecomment-921143865,1,['config'],['configuration']
Modifiability,"@tomchor, I haven't implemented `MultiRegion` for `NonhydrostaticModel` yet. It would be quite easy to extent it if it weren't for the pressure solver which is done in two different ways and both of them are global (`FFT` and `TridiagonalFFT`). A quick and dirty solution would be to do as I have done with the `ImplicitFreeSurface` and reserve the calculation on 1 GPU only. The problem is that the pressure solve is 3D and not 2D so we would probably like to use the `cuFFT` multi-gpu functionality (in particular the cuFFTxt library, which I hope is implemented in `CUDA.jl` although I haven't checked yet) I ll open a PR to start implementing it. Regarding the `OutputWriters`, they are implemented in jld2 trivially with `reconstruct_global_field`. ; You can specify a `JLDOutputWriter` as you do for a single region grid, provided you don't want to slice the direction across the regions ; for example you cannot do; ```; indices = (1:10, :, :) ; ```; for an `XPartition` or ; ```; indices = (:, 1:10, :); ```; for a `YPartition`; (`MultiRegion` does not play well with `indices` at the moment). . It runs, but there is a weird bug for which the fields are not updated as the model timesteps (i.e., all the outputs are the initial condition). I think it is easily solvable but I have to take a deeper look. So basically, it is not working at the moment... On the other hand, to anticipate the `CubedSphere` refactor, we probably want to have `OutputWriters` which output all regions separately (as `reconstruct_global_field` does not mean much in a cubed sphere context).

What you want sponge layers to do is to allow flow propagation into the sponge region but where drag would dissipate any fluid motion there. The ""tricky"" part is to make the sponge layer transition smooth enough so that the fluid does not experience it as a ""wall"". If the transition region is very short then the fluid ""sees"" the sponge as a wall and waves are reflected back into the fluid. But how ""short"" is short-enough depends on the scales of the fluid motion...

Modifiability,"A ""dynamic function invocation"" means that the compiler thinks a function is being called whose scope can change ""dynamically"" (I think).

It seems that when the tree is too large, this traversal cannot be entirely compiled. Perhaps there are tricks we might use to help the compiler parse this kind of operation, like putting some type annotations / hints into `getindex(b::BinaryOperation, ...)`. Not sure.

Modifiability,"A ""schedule"" is a function or callable object with a method. ```julia; schedule(model); ```. that returns true or false based on a criterion. `true` means ""do something"". The cleanest way to get this feature is to refactor the output writers to have a more generic interface for splitting. If we have a property called `file_splitting` that _is_ a schedule, then we can write. ```julia; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, outputs; file_splitting = TimeInterval(30days), ...); ```. Then the decision about whether to start a new file will change from. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9f3f8e6d1469e570b0778f328ab864e879785ffd/src/OutputWriters/jld2_output_writer.jl#L275. to. ```julia; writer.file_splitting(model) && start_next_file(model, writer) ; ```. Next, you will have to add a new schedule in `Utils/schedules.jl` that can split based on filesize:. ```julia; mutable struct FileSizeLargerThan <: AbstractSchedule; max_filesize :: Float64; path :: String; end. (fslt::FileSizeLargerThan)(model) = filesize(fslt.path) >= fslt.max_filesize; ```. Finally, you need to add a user interface for initializing and modifying the schedules to smooth out the user experience (for example, we don't want users to have to specify the file path more than once, and the file path that is checked by the schedule has to be updated). This will have to take two parts. In `Utils/schedules.jl`, a constructor:. ```julia; FileSizeLargerThan(max_filesize) = FileSizeLargerThan(max_filesize, """"); ```. Then in output writers, an interface to be used in both the model constructor and `write_output!`:. ```julia; update_schedule!(schedule, path) = nothing; update_schedule!(schedule::FileSizeLargerThan, path) = schedule.path = path; ```.

Modifiability,"A consideration when picking up from a checkpoint and using `NetCDFOutputWriter` is that `mode=""a""` (append) needs to be used instead of `mode=""c""` (create or clobber) when creating the `NetCDFOutputWriter`.

I can think of three solutions:; 1. Not specifying a `mode` causes `mode=""c""` if the file does not exist and `mode=""a""` if the file does exist. I like this solution the most as it works well with and without a checkpointer (and users don't have to do anything to get reasonable default behavior).; 2. Add a `force` kwarg to `NetCDFOutputWriter` that is `false` by default. The `NetCDFOutputWriter` will error if you try to overwrite an existing file, allowing the user to go back and set `mode=""a""` without any data loss. A `pickup` kwarg could perform a similar function if it's `false` by default.; 3. Setting the `PICKUP` environment variable causes `mode=""a""` to be the default if the file already exists.

In the regression tests, we manually restore the model state to a configuration (essentially manual checkpointing). However, the halos are not correct (after this PR is merged they will be correct in saved data. However we still could have incorrect halos if models are ""hack checkpointed"" with NetCDFOutputWriter or JLD2OutputWriter that don't include halos). For these cases, we need to call `update_state!` before running a simulation. It seems we probably want to call `update_state` as part of the initialization of `run!` whether or not `iteration == 0` to avoid this gotcha... * Calling `update_state!(model)` every time that `run!` is called can lead to excess computation.

Modifiability,"A number of issues are accumulating with `TurbulenceClosures` that we need to address:. 1. #1277 (inconsistency between docs and storage of molecular diffusivity in eddy viscosity scratch array); 2. #1278 (unfortunate default diffusivities for IsotropicDiffusivity and some of the LES closure diffusivities); 3. #1279 (incorrect usage of the term ""biharmonic"", and also the fact that there is no true biharmonic diffusivity). A second annoying issue is the use of `model.diffusivities` as auxiliary space for the eddy diffusivities. Now that we know a bit more about using `adapt_structure`, we can readily put references to eddy diffusivities inside the LES closure objects themselves. Doing this will require refactoring the constructor for `IncompressibleModel`, unfortunately, because we'll need to define a function `regularize_turbulence_closure` so that we can build scratch space once we know what the `grid` is.

Modifiability,"Adapting Smagorinsky seems an easy avenue. . In terms of Implicit LES, you could try using just WENO without any closure, but if you are in a true LES regime it would probably be too dissipative. A Smagorinsky viscosity combined with an energy-conserving advection scheme has been found to be less dissipative although noisier (here is an example applied to Burgers equation https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0377042717303035?token=83A413B5659B8B16B96E1D0CBDAD5865D8552AE5B2FF2FDFE78FFDEF064F2820B38D1BBFF646D3F7B75D58FE010DF7DB&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20230125193548). You can always try with higher order (maybe 7th?) but the higher the order the lower the stability (i.e. at a certain order your implicit dissipation will be so low that you will start to generate grid-scale noise). . The KE dissipation is there with `closure=nothing` and a WENO scheme, it is just not strictly physical: it's (roughly) akin to a 4th to a 6th-order hyperviscosity. You can compare this to using `UpwindBiased(order = 5)` which would give you everywhere a dissipation that converges to a 6th-order hyperviscosity. In general:. $$\partial_x {uu}^{Upwind_N} \sim \partial_x {uu}^{Centered_{N+1}} + \partial_x {K_{numerical}} \partial_x^{N} u$$. where $K_{numerical} \sim \Delta x u$ and $N$ is the order. The nice thing about using WENO instead of a simple Upwind discretization is that the order of the hyperviscosity adapts to the smoothness of the field. Therefore, where the field is noisier (like in regions of higher gradients) the dissipation is more aggressive. . This procedure not only ensures a smooth field but can be thought of as mimicking the subgrid-scale dissipation (which also increases with the gradient of resolved scale variables. As such people have referred to using particularly diffusive advective schemes (such as WENO) as _Implicit_ LES. I like the idea of implicit LES because it allows you to ""fill in"" for the subgrid-scale dissipation without committing to any s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2869#issuecomment-1404144433:0,Adapt,Adapting,0,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2869#issuecomment-1404144433,1,['Adapt'],['Adapting']

Modifiability,"Adaptive time-stepping is useful for a wide class of problems. The general strategy is to use the CFL number to compute a stable time-step. This is especially useful in problems with lots of time variability --- for example, LES of a seasonal cycle. In addition, the CFL computation can be used to stabilize the spin-up of a model, during which a transition to turbulence occurs. Some complexity is introduced by the fact that we use Adams-Bashforth time stepping (as opposed to a RK-method, which is more common and more stable), since it means we need to re-initialize the ""previous source terms"" with a forward Euler step when the time step is changed. I have been using adaptive time-stepping in my work, which along with a strategy for handling model spinup / transition to turbulence, has proven to be an important practical feature that makes running experimental simulations under different conditions much easier, since all I need to do is set my boundary conditions, and let the model run.

Modifiability,"Ah neat result @navidcy, thanks for posting your solution! Indeed I doubt I set it up correctly. I went back and tried to play around with the setup a bit but no luck. Perhaps I misunderstood how to reduce down to Burgers equation but might try again a bit later with fresh eyes... Out of curiosity what numerical method did you use? That's a super clean shock!. > Also, @ali-ramadhan in your solution above I see noise forming for negative parts of the solution first. This might hint some biased in the scheme towards certain-sign velocities?. Yeah that weirded me out as well. Wasn't sure what to make of it but I decided to ignore it since I wasn't solving the right equation (or the setup was just wrong). I didn't notice any discrepency between periodic advection of a square waveform with positive and negative velocities, but I only checked using my unreliable eyeball norm. It's using the same advection schemes as Oceananigans.jl (which we've tested for convergence using positive and negative velocities). But because the prognostic variable is ρu there's an extra division by ρ since it computes fluxes of ρuu as (ρu)*(ρu)/ρ. So maybe I should be doing something like `WENO(ρ)*WENO(ρ)/WENO(ρ)` instead of just `WENO(ρ)*WENO(ρ)/ρ`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1079#issuecomment-716459705:1044,variab,variable,1044,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1079#issuecomment-716459705,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"Ah ok I see why your original script didn't work now. When executing. ```julia; model = IncompressibleModel(grid=grid,; closure = closure,; boundary_conditions = (v=v_bcs); ); ```. this assigned `v_bcs` to the new variable `v` and passes it to the `IncompressibleModel` function. `v_bc` itself is a `NamedTuple` containing `x, y, z` properties so the `IncompressibleModel` constructor does not complain. Since the named tuple that is passed does not not have a `v` property, the velocities get the default boundary conditions (free slip and no normal flow). Then when you call `set!(model, v=-0.5)` it fills v to be -0.5 everywhere but then `update_state!(model)` is called to ensure that the velocity field is incompressible (divergence-free) by performing a pressure projection step. Since the default boundary condition enforces no-normal flow, the velocity cannot be -0.5 everywhere so the pressure field updates it to be zero to enforce incompressibility. This is a pretty subtle bug (related to #1204)... Since the proper named tuple can't be checked for in the constructor function signature, I wonder if it's worth adding a manual check to make sure a `NamedTuple{(:x,:y,:z)}` was not passed to the model constructor.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1294#issuecomment-756979930:214,variab,variable,214,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1294#issuecomment-756979930,1,['variab'],['variable']

A lot of people might benefit from having the kind of advection scheme that you are using! It may not be very much work, since we have an interface for adding new advection schemes. Do you evolve the tracer fully outside of the `Oceananigans` infrastructure? Or is the tracer ""included"" in the list of tracers for your `IncompressibleModel`, but you somehow negate tracer advection and add it outside of `time_step!`, somehow?

Modifiability,Alright I think this PR is ready to be merged. Extra change since yesterday: I think we can have a cleaner design by getting rid of `DistributedIncompressibleModel` and just reusing `IncompressibleModel` but with `architecture = MultiCPU`. So now instead of dispatching on `::CPU` and `::GPU` we would dispatch on `::AbstractCPUArchitecture` and `::AbstractGPUArchitecture` and things should work out whether the model is distributed or not. > I see that one changed grid to my_grid.

At least i don't think so. Wetting and drying usually requires a positive preserving advection scheme. We have first-order upwinding (which I don't think anyone has every used), that is positive preserving and could do this. But it's not a great scheme. A limiter would be better. There are a lot of methods out thatk, but not the first thing to worry about. This if much longer term, I would say. In addition to positive-preserving advection schemes, it seems one other way to deal with this is adding to the pressure gradients an extra term that prevents the thicknesses of outcropped/incropped layers from reaching zero following [Salmon (2002)](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jmr/jmr/2002/00000060/00000004/art00004?token=005b148389c57630504c2a726e2d58464340592f713b672c57582a67232d45234a46246c6a4d2c3167732355e72).

Modifiability,"As discussed with @jm-c, the organization of physical constants and parameters is somewhat confusing.

I see a few problems:. * `f` is not a property of a planet.; * 'Model configuration' is an obscure name for turbulent or molecular transport coefficients.; * A reference density is not a parameter in an equation of state. I propose that we consolidate these three types into two, removing the reference density from `EquationOfState` and define a new type containing f, g, ρ0, ν, and κ.

Modifiability,"Based on some previous benchmarks I think so; https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/3cd4ae32cb4d716bc6470a6e7ba484ed98d60de7/benchmark/gpu.jl#L164-L198; Basically I wrote an _x_-difference operator that used `@. @views` which allowed it to act on Arrays and CuArrays, and when acting on a CuArray it was only ~10x faster compared to single-core CPU performance. While the entire time-stepping loop we have using GPUifyLoops.jl is ~90x faster. **However** I don't think I did the benchmarking there properly (have to use `@benchmark CuArrays.@sync` I believe) and maybe I didn't use `@. @views` properly. I think using broadcasts would make the code much more readable, but I can think of a few drawbacks (mainly related to performance):. 1. I don't know how to fuse kernels when doing broadcasts. E.g. we might be able to do something like; ```julia; @. Gu = calc_RHS_u(u, v, w, ...); @. Gv = calc_RHS_v(u, v, w, ...); ...; ```; which would look cleaner but then `update_source_terms!` would end essentially end up in several kernels. From talking with you I believe this shouldn't matter as kernel launches are cheap and the broadcast operator should essentially do exactly what `update_source_terms!` does, but I'm not 100% sure of this and we may lose out on performance. 2. We may want to fine tune our kernel launches, e.g. by using the thread-block layout we want which is probably possible, I'm just not very familiar with the CuArrays.jl package. 3. Some kernels, e.g. ones that do permutations like `calculate_source_term_divergence_gpu!` and `idct_permute!` can't be broadcasted over I think, but these are the exception rather than the rule. To really find out whether we take a performance hit we might have to refactor the time-stepping to use broadcasting then benchmark the two approaches on CPU, GPU, and multi-GPU architectures (not sure if CuArrays.jl will do multi-GPU arrays yet).

It's not exactly that obv because the AB2 time stepper works a bit differently but it's probably good enough!

Modifiability,"Can we just compare 1) the topology and 2) all of the nodes? I think that would be sufficient to determine equality. I'm worried if we don't explicitly check the topology that we might run into some edge cases where the nodes / spacings are the same but the topologies are different (these would possibly be pathological with 0 halo in a periodic / flat direction, but still good to explicitly check I think...). When comparing numeric equality for nodes, we should add `@allowscalar` as needed there. I think we should add a test that equality works as expected, as well. We should also add a test for checkpointing on stretched grids. I think its ok if we don't support a numeric equality for other grids --- we can build them up one at a time. They are specific to each grid. The main downside here is that we need to refactor our grid implementation to have a single `RectilinearGrid` (there's no reason to have different rectilinear grid types, since we can dispatch on the case that certain directions have constant spacing easily). So this code will go away when we make that change. But I think it's a useful incremental improvement for now while we still have two rectilinear grids, so I'm fine to have it go in once it's cleaned up. Because of this:. ```julia; julia> using CUDA. julia> a = rand(2); 2-element Vector{Float64}:; 0.8207604162394306; 0.3815099688071648. julia> b = CuArray(a); 2-element CuArray{Float64, 1}:; 0.8207604162394306; 0.3815099688071648. julia> CUDA.@allowscalar a == b; true; ```.

Modifiability,"Consider:. * The Adams-Bashforth time stepper is not well-suited for adaptive time-stepping, because it requires a initialization step. Thus it behooves scientists to update their time-step only infrequently. * However, during model spinup / transition to turbulence, a sharp change in flow regime may occur. This sharp change necessitates updating the time-step frequently to avoid blow up (an alternative strategy is to take uniform small time-steps during this time, which is safer but will take longer). * In addition to the need to update a time-step frequently near transition to turbulence, it is *also* wise to take conservatively small time-steps . Because of these considerations I am not sure it makes sense to add `spinup_cfl`, which only addresses the last, minor point. The main feature that is needed is a change in the frequency at which the time-step is updated (we currently do this manually by writing two loops). However, a change in update frequency is only really needed because Adams-Bashforth is ill-suited for adaptive time stepping (otherwise it'd be fine to update frequently even in the main loop).

However when splitting the file, e.g. `file_splitting = TimeInterval(30days)`, the first instantiation will result in the following files:; ```; vel_fields_0_60_part1.nc vel_fields_0_60_part2.nc vel_fields_0_60_part3.nc; ```; then the next pickup will result in files: ; ```; vel_fields_60_120_part1.nc vel_fields_60_120_part3.nc vel_fields_60_120_part5.nc; vel_fields_60_120_part2.nc vel_fields_60_120_part4.nc; ```; of this files, the first 2 parts (`vel_fields_60_120_part1.nc` and `vel_fields_60_120_part2.nc`) are empty, and the `vel_fields_60_120_part3.nc` contains data from the day 61 until 91. This makes the loading of the data for post-processing a bit tricky, since some of they are empty and the disk storage will make more difficult chunking data. . If I don't change the name each time I pickup, with the `overwrite_existing=false` it crashes, and with `overwrite_existing=true` it rewrites all the files. . Another workflow will be to create a new folder for each pickup keeping the same filename, but splitting the files will result in the same issue of file duplication. . I hope this description of the workflow is clearer.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3818#issuecomment-2391946301:50,variab,variable,50,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3818#issuecomment-2391946301,2,"['rewrite', 'variab']","['rewrites', 'variable']"
Modifiability,"Currently it is not generically possible to call. ```julia; fill_halo_regions!(field); ```. Part of this is trivial as noted in #969. But another part is that boundary conditions on fields can depend on other _other_ fields, to which `field` contains no reference. We allow field boundary conditions to depend on anything in `state(model)`, which includes the model velocity fields, tracer fields, pressure fields, and diffusivities. Because references to `state(model)` are required to fill halo regions in general, we are unable to fill halo regions prior to computing an `AveragedField` (for example). We may not _want_ to solve this problem because it require too-invasive changes. For example, we certainly want to support the concept of fields that are independent of other fields. General support for interdependent fields may be too difficult. Some possible solutions:. * an ""optional"" `state` property of `Field` which is set to `nothing` by default. We can ensure that `state` is properly determined in the constructor for `IncompressibleModel` for the model fields. * an ""optional"" `state` or `fields` property within each individual boundary condition (with a similar function as the optional property above). This property could be activated only for boundary conditions that need it (currently, only discrete form boundary conditions, though this could be extended to continuous form boundary conditions in the future via #897). Solving this will simplify time-stepping code a bit and permit simpler halo region filling via `fill_halo_regions!(field)` with no additional arguments.",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/971:1370,extend,extended,1370,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/971,1,['extend'],['extended']
Modifiability,"Currently open boundary conditions only work correctly for non-hydrostatic models. To work correctly with hydrostatic models with a free surface, the free surface needs to know about the open boundary conditions in order for the barotropic fluxes to be correct. Some refactoring needs to take place to support this as the split-explicit free surface has difference operators that need to be topologically-aware:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/b3be950ef6a1f2139c2f65e083f20f1f7958ea55/src/Models/HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModels/split_explicit_free_surface_kernels.jl#L35-L42. @simone-silvestri's suggestion in https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3628#issuecomment-2312725203 was to move the topologically-aware operators to the `Operators` module and have them depend on boundary conditions. See PR #3268. But having operators depend on boundary conditions seems messy and breaks the chain of dependence Oceananigans has (architectures -> grids -> operators -> boundary conditions -> fields, etc.). So maybe this isn't the approach we want to take. After looking through https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/main/src/Models/HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModels/split_explicit_free_surface_kernels.jl and some discussion with @tomchor we came to the conclusion that the need to impose boundary conditions in this way suggests that something needs to be a `Field`. I think that something is `η★` `U★`, and `V★`. If these became `Field`s and lived in `SplitExplicitState` then they could have their own boundary conditions and not we wouldn't need the topologically-aware operators?. And their boundary conditions could be inferred/computed from the boundary conditions on `u` and `v` using vertical integrals. For `η` I think it's prescribed. See https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3628#issuecomment-2353142608 and https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3628#issuecomment-2353455930. **Note**: This issue is only for the split-explicit free surface.

Modifiability,"Currently restoring a model from a checkpoint uses the function `restore_from_checkpoint`. However, this design can be difficult to use because, in general, restoring a model requires passing the forcing functions and boundary condition functions explicitly to `restore_from_checkpoint`. This means that part of the setup script needs to be replicated in the script that restores a model from the checkpoint. A different solution is possible that may require less work on the part of users to restore a model from a checkpoint: if we extend `run!` with the keyword argument `pickup`. . If `pickup=true` (and a checkpointer has been added to `simulation.output_writers`), then prior to executing the `run!` loop,. 1. The checkpointer file correpsonding to the most recent model iteration will be identified;; 2. Checkpointer data will be synced with `model.velocities`, `model.tracers`, `model.clock`, and, for `QuasiAdamsBashforth2` timesteppers, the tendency `model.timesteppers.Gⁿ`. For this to work seamlessly when a `JLD2OutputWriter` is involved we might need to modify the constructor for `JLD2OutputWriter`. Currently the constructor runs an arbitrary `init(file, model)` function, and saves certain properties identified in the constructor signature:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9cfb568ec3a8e6f7efe8c7c41300ea9673c6b103/src/OutputWriters/jld2_output_writer.jl#L157-L160. This will fail if the output file already exists; thus it's not possible to pickup from a checkpoint with the same script used to initialize the model (without destroying prior output). A simple change could just be to allow `init` and `save_properties!` to fail with `try/catch` (or to avoid running those functions if a file already exists). There are also some shenanigans that'd have to be done for output files split into multiple `part`s. (We could, potentially, require `pickup=true` in the `JLD2OutputWriter` constructor, rather than changing its default behavior to accommodate auto-checkpoint-",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1068:534,extend,extend,534,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1068,1,['extend'],['extend']
Modifiability,"Currently, user-defined forcing functions (say, `F`) have the signature. ```julia; F(grid, U, Φ, i, j, k) = ...; ```. per. https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/3ab93222717271de194ade9e9b073c1c09f571e8/src/time_steppers.jl#L135. However, I think that we should reorganize this so that the most ""important"" arguments are first. I think perhaps a better ordering would be . ```julia; F(i, j, k, grid, time, velocities, tracers) = ...; ```. The idea is that `grid` is unlikely to be used without indices; however indices can be used without `grid`. This pattern also resembles the pattern we have developed for kernels (and thus could be used in the future to develop ""differentiated"" and ""interpolated"" user-defined forcing functions, for example). This also adds time as an argument, which I think is a good idea as this is needed for lots of elementary things like, eg, the tidal forcing functions desired by #212. Adding time as an argument will require some minor modifications to `calculate_interior_source_terms!`. We should also change over all of our kernel functions to having `(i, j, k, grid)` first, but we don't have to address that refactoring immediately.

The recursive evaluation of an operator tree accepts and propagates a cache-key argument, which could be related to e.g. the simulation iteration and sub-stage. If caching is enabled, each operator checks it's own size-1 cache for the cache-key, and returns the result if present. Otherwise it evaluates itself, and stores the result under the cache-key. . This eliminates the repeated evaluation of individual operators, but at the cost of storing the result of every intermediate operation.

Modifiability,"Extended the type WENO5 to allow the execution of the WENO scheme on stretched and uniform grids alike. . In practice:. - `WENO5()` will default to the uniform 5th order coefficients (""uniform"" setting) in all directions with a JS-WENO formulation; - `WENO5(grid = grid)` will default to uniform interpolation coefficient if the direction is uniform (`typeof(Δc) <: Number`) and will precompute the ENO coefficients for reconstruction in the stretched directions (""stretched"" setting) (I have tested ""on the fly"" coefficient calculation for stretched directions and it is way too expensive! therefore, useless to keep as a possibility); - `WENO5(grid = grid, stretched_smoothness=true)` will compute coefficients for the smoothness indicators `β₀, β₁` and `β₂` to account for stretched grid; - `WENO5(zweno = true)` will implement a Z-WENO formulation for the weno weight calculation; - No support is given for `WENO5S(grid = grid)` for curvilinear grids for the moment (defaults to uniform setting). Comments:; Despite the fact that all methods have the same execution speed, `stretched_smoothness` requires more memory (and slightly more computation time) and is not much impactful. As such, most of the time it is better to use just the `WENO5(grid = grid)` keyword argument as it does not decrease accuracy but decreases memory utilization (and speed up slightly). (I haven't tried all types of grids, so maybe it is good to check before performing a large simulation on a weird stretched grid); On the other hand, a Z-WENO formulation is always beneficial (also in case of a uniform mesh) with no major decrease in performance. The same can be said for the stretched `WENO5(grid=grid)` formulation in case of stretched grids. `validation/advection/validate_weno_scheme.jl` compares all these methods in terms of time and accuracy on a simple 1D and 2D tracer advection simulations.

Modifiability,"For example for the tripolar grid it looks like this. ```julia; 2160×1080×60 OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid{Float64, Periodic, RightConnected, Bounded} on GPU with 7×7×7 halo and with precomputed metrics; ├── centered at (λ, φ) = (75.0, 1.8005); ├── longitude: Periodic extent 360.167 degrees variably spaced with min(Δλ)=0.000208433, max(Δλ)=0.175625; ├── latitude: RightConnected extent 170.157 degrees variably spaced with min(Δφ)=0.000312453, max(Δφ)=0.157553; └── z: Bounded z ∈ [-6000.0, 0.0] variably spaced with min(Δz)=5.24961, max(Δz)=438.409; ```. This claims that whatever grid I've constructed is ""RightConnected"" in latitude. This doesn't really make sense to me... but let's set that aside (it's a separate issue with the tripolar grid). The bigger issue is that the y-topology is NOT the ""latitude topology"" --- on an orthogonal spherical shell grid, ""y"" and ""latitude"" are different (that's the whole point, when they do coincide we are on a LatitudeLongitudeGrid). We should design a good show method for this grid type. My impression is that the show method was copied from LatitudeLongitudeGrid. But we need to work a bit harder for OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid because it is more general. I think we should give information both about the coordinate system (lat, lon, z), and in addition to that and separately, give information about the logical arrangement of the grid (x, y, z), including the topology. The former is important for understanding the geography of the grid and the latter is important for understanding the discretization, and the two are distinct from one another. So the show method for this grid is going to be more involved than the others. I don't think we need to indicate whether the x, y directions are ""variably spaced"". That is useful for rectilinear and lat-lon grids, but not for general grids. . cc @navidcy @simone-silvestri",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3808:291,variab,variably,291,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3808,4,['variab'],['variably']

Modifiability,"For now this PR just adds a function `convective_adjustment!(model, Δt, K)` that performs a convective adjustment step on a model. . I believe this results in an operator splitting method for treating vertically implicit diffusion using backward Euler. ## TODO. If this seems like an appropriate method for implementing vertically implicit diffusion, I'd suggest the following steps for turning this PR into something that can be merged:; 1. Define a new closure; ```julia; 	struct ConvectiveAdjustment{K, ∂}; 	 κ :: K; 	∂b∂z :: ∂; 		...; 	end; ```; 2. Maybe `ConvectiveAdjustment` should act on a `BuoyancyField`?; 3. Refactor `convective_adjustment!` to use the `BatchedTridiagonalSolver`.; 4. Add a free convection test to test that using `ConvectiveAdjustment` on a linearly stratified column model results in a mixed layer with ∂b/∂z ≈ 0 (could also test for the mixed layer depth). `ConvectiveAdjustment` could then be used as part of a tuple of turbulence closures, e.g. ```julia; closure = (IsotropicDiffusivity(κ=1e-4), ConvectiveAdjustment(κv=10)); ```. ## Future plans?. Vertically implicit diffusion with the `BatchedTridiagonalSolver` could then be abstracted to support other parameterizations such as `OceanTurb.KPP` and `OceanTurb.TKEMassFlux`. I think @glwagner envisioned a more general way of time-stepping implicit terms in general, i.e. adding IMEX time-steppers I think?. ## Note on user interface. Right now the user must manually call `convective_adjustment!` inside the `simulation.progress` callback so it's very awkward to use, but it should be usable if we need it. Ideally `convective_adjustment!` would be called at the end of each time step, perhaps by `time_step!` or by a simulation callback.

Modifiability,"From the standpoint of `NonhydrostaticModel`, the only requirement (I think?) is a pressure solver that's valid on more grids. The `FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` combines FFTs with a tridiagonal solve in one direction to solve the Poisson equation. Thus, this method can be used if the grid is stretched in just one (1) direction. Right now, we only support grids that are stretched in `z`, the third direction / index. Presumably it's at most a matter of copy and paste and index permutation to support grids that are stretched in `x` (and regular in `y, z`) or stretched in `y` (and regular in `x, z`). Under the hood, the `FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` relies on the `BatchedTridiagonalSolver` to perform the tridiagonal solve:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/4551a78b1f3fe4bb3b238676c128dc751be9b934/src/Solvers/fourier_tridiagonal_poisson_solver.jl#L81-L82. The `BatchedTridiagonalSolver` launches a kernel over `xy` and performs a tridiagonal solve in `z`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/4551a78b1f3fe4bb3b238676c128dc751be9b934/src/Solvers/batched_tridiagonal_solver.jl#L79-L80. So the first task is to extend the tridiagonal solver to support integrals in `x` and `y`. . This could be straightforwardly supported by adding some kind of tag to indicate the ""tridiagonal direction"" (ie `:x`, `:y`, or `:z`), and copy-pasting the functionality for each case. It's a bit of code duplication but pretty straightforward... Alternatively we could introduce some kind of abstraction that permutes array dimensions. Then we just have one algorithm which assumes the tridiagonal index is `k`, and support `i` or `j` under the hood via an array wrapper that performs an index permutation. I'm leaning towards copy/paste because it's a little easier to understand and it's not that much code in this case...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3116#issuecomment-1557689620:1147,extend,extend,1147,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3116#issuecomment-1557689620,1,['extend'],['extend']

Please let me know if I'm missing something. ## General simulation tips; - In general defining variables (that are used in the calculations) as constants makes things faster as it helps the compiler optimize things; - It's probably worth inlining small functions that get called often to reduce function call overhead (at the very least it's worth playing with this). ## GPU simulation tips:; - Any global variable that needs to be accessed by the GPU needs to be a constant or the simulation will crash; - Complex `ComputedField`s may not work, so the user can either nest `ComputedField`s (simple, but costly; probably good for development) or use `KernelComputedField`s (complex but efficient; probably what you wanna use for production-ready code); - GPU runs are generally memory-limited, so it's good to both keep track of and try to reduce the size of your runs. Useful tips in this regard are; - Try to use higher-order schemes as you need fewer grid points to achieve the same resolution; - Use `nvidia-smi` to monitor the memory usage of the GPU; - Manually define scratch space to be reused in diagnostics, to avoid creating one scratch space for each separate diagnostic you have.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1478#issuecomment-802225575:281,variab,variables,281,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1478#issuecomment-802225575,2,['variab'],"['variable', 'variables']"

So really all that is needed is some metadata that implements the flag. I hope this makes sense to folks. . Maybe we get some of the sgrid folks into this discussion?

Modifiability,"Good suggestion. Actually, this should help fix one problem I've been having with JLD2 output: Julia ranges like `grid.xC` are serialized to the JLD2 file, and cannot be read outside of Julia. You might want to serialize the grid when checkpointing to easily restore from a checkpoint file. But when saving the grid to a JLD2 output file, which may be read by a language other than Julia, the grid properties should be saved in a language-agnostic manner. Same for boundary conditions. So I changed the way structs are saved to disk for both the JLD2 output writer and the checkpointer. It's all done recursively via multiple dispatch so it should be flexible enough to work for all current `Model` properties and it should accomodate future changes to `Model` with minor changes. When saving stuff to disk like a JLD2 file, `saveproperty!` is used, which converts Julia objects to language-agnostic objects. When checkpointing, `serializeproperty!` is used, which serializes objects, with fields and boundary conditions require special treatment. We checkpoint structs that are important for timestepping. Diagnostics and output writers are not checkpointed, as they are not essential and can be added in any time after model constructions. But if one or more boundary conditions contain a function, `model.boundary_conditions` are not serialized and must be manually restored. There is one mess bits associated with restoring from a checkpoint:; * Fields cannot be passed to the `Model` constructor. When restoring fields we want to avoid loading a field from disk and allocating `Model` memory for it at the same time, as we won't be able to restore models whose memory footprint exceed ~half the CPU/GPU memory. Thus restoring fields is treated as a special case (see `restore_fields!`). It is done after model creation where fields are read from disk and used to fill up existing model fields. Unfortunately, `model.timestepper` doesn't fit the pattern and is treated as an extra special case. @g",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/326#issuecomment-524941619:651,flexible,flexible,651,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/326#issuecomment-524941619,1,['flexible'],['flexible']

Modifiability,"Got bitten by CuArray scalar operations while debugging some Europa runs so this PR adds an `__init__()` function to the Oceananigans module that disables CuArray scalar operations once the module has been loaded and only allows scalar ops via the `CUDA.@allowscalar` macro. Now when we accidentally perform scalar ops on CuArrays we should get an error, which is much better than having silent performance regressions which has happened multiple times in the past. Two remaining problems:; 1. `set!(u::Field, v::Number) = @. u.data = v` actually incurs scalar ops because `a::CuArray .= 1.5` does not but `a::OffsetArray{CuArray .= 1.5` does, so it's probably something we have to fix by adapting broadcasting over offsetarrays?; 2. For similar broadcasting reasons I think; ```julia; data = cpudata(output); ds[name][:, :, :, time_index] = view(data, ow.slices[name]...); ```; also incurs scalar ops during NetCDF output so I will try changing back to the old behavior where we used something like `	 ; ```julia; data = interiorparent(output); !isa(output, Array) && (data = Array(data)); ds[name][:, :, :, time_index] = view(data, ow.slices[name]...); ```.

Modifiability,"Hello everyone,. I'm trying to calculate the pressure terms shown in the following figure (Eq.(2.5) from [Pearson et al., 2019](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/pressurestrain-terms-in-langmuir-turbulence/C13A4550F408F770740F47C7CBDDEAED)):. ![4031706602798_ pic](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/112752688/4672fa09-2fa1-4302-8c33-684cefe3612c). The equation in the above figure I think is another form of writing the pressure equation to maintain incompressibility, but different from the common way ($p = p_{HY'}+ p_{NHS}$), it may provide new insights into how different processes contribute to pressures and help to improve second-moment vertical mixing parameterizations, which is the motivation that I want to calculate them. What I'm trying to do is write the code that repeats the pressure solver algorithm for non-hydrostatic pressure (cause this is also an elliptic problem I think) to calculate the terms in the above equation, and re-run the pressure solver separately for each of these new terms. Lastly, I want to save these new pressure terms in a way that will not overwrite the original pressures. . I tried to start with the second term ($p_r'$) in the RHS of the equation. This term is the component that results from rapid distortion by the current shear. For this term, the vertical boundary condition is $\partial p_r' / \partial x_3 = 0$ (see more details about boundary conditions in Appendix A in [Pearson et al., 2019](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/pressurestrain-terms-in-langmuir-turbulence/C13A4550F408F770740F47C7CBDDEAED)). So the goal is to solve an equation $\nabla^2p_r' = -2\frac{\partial U_i}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial u_j'}{\partial x_i}$ with applying the boundary condition $\partial p_r' / \partial x_3 = 0$.

Modifiability,"Here's a few notes on a model with fetch dependence. ## Time-dependence of the spectral peak. Under persistent winds, the sea state continuously evolves.

Modifiability,"Hey @arcavaliere thanks for working on this! Just added ""[WIP]"" to the title as that's our convention for PRs that are still a work in progress. About your error, you did define `min_enabled_level` but I think you need to [import methods from `Logging` to extend them](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/overloading-operators/6773). I think something like this would work:; ```julia; import Logging: min_enabled_level; min_enabled_level(logger::ModelLogger) = logger.min_level; ```; or; ```julia; import Logging; Logging.min_enabled_level(logger::ModelLogger) = logger.min_level; ```; and the same goes for `shouldlog` and `handle_message`. ---.

Modifiability,"Hey, original author of both https://github.com/JuliaGeo/NetCDF.jl and https://github.com/meggart/ZarrNative.jl here. Regarding the state of NetCDF.jl , yes I would say I mostly stopped developing the package due to time constraints and currently shift my focus towards Zarr since this is what we are using in our current project. . My last attempt at improving the NetCDF solved many of the issues with the package https://github.com/JuliaGeo/NetCDF.jl/pull/61 but was not merged because of conflicts with other bugfix PRs. However, might be source of inspiration if someone wants to do a rewrite. . Regarding write performance, I would be very interested to see examples where NetCDF.jl performs worse than e.g. python-netcdf4, since most of the time should be spent in the same NetCDF C library. I have been using the package extensively and did not experience it to be slower than comparable packages. . I you are worried about the robustness of NetCDF.jl, you should not even look at ZarrNative.jl, since it is still very young and rather a prototype. .

Modifiability,"Hi @c42f thank you for chiming in! Will definitely ping you as we work on logging. I think we probably should have tackled logging much earlier. We still use `@printf` and vanilla `@info` for logging, which has been quite counter-productive haha. Definitely hoping we can reach a useful logger that can; * help developers by providing info and debug messages. Also nice in test logs.; * help users understand what the model is doing and provide a better and more responsive user experience by logging what the model is doing. This is where `@setup` and `@diagnostic` logging messages might be really nice. Although `@setup` and `@diagnostic` might be bad names as they don't imply logging? Not sure of the best solution but maybe your kwarg suggestion would help here, e.g. `@info source=""diagnostic"" msg`?. @arcavaliere seems to be developing a pretty general-purpose `ModelLogger` which hopefully we can adapt for all these uses! @arcavaliere I'm more than happy to help if you need anything.

Modifiability,"Hi @pnavaro thanks for opening this issue. Yeah this is an issue on some clusters so it might be worth adding a note in the documentation. In my case I think the login node had a GPU so I was able to build on the login node then just precompile and run on the compute node without internet access. But this was also before CUDA.jl which very nicely downloads CUDA artifacts for you so it just relied on the local CUDA toolkit. Do you have access to the CUDA toolkit on the login node via something like `module load cuda`? Might allow you to build on the login node without a GPU but might be weird to have CUDA but no GPU. Your compute node must have a CUDA installation. Looks like the CUDA.jl documentation has a section on how to make use of a local CUDA installation: https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/installation/overview/#CUDA-toolkit. If you can find where the CUDA toolkit is installed on your compute node, then maybe all you have to do is set one of the `CUDA_HOME`, `CUDA_ROOT` or `CUDA_PATH` environment variables?. Looks like creating a container with CUDA.jl is an option but it still requires a CUDA toolkit at runtime: https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/installation/overview/#Containers. Let us know if this helps or if you're able to get up and running on your compute node. Would be good to figure this out and add to the documentation.

However, @vchuravy points out that a `CuArray` is not `isbits` only because it contains a `finalize` function (essentially a destructor) which makes it not `isbits` on the host. Apparently CUDAnative converts the `CuArray` to some sort of `CuDeviceArray` using [Adapt.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/Adapt.jl) which is `isbits` and can be used as a device argument.

Maybe we just need to generalize the free surface tendency for `ExplicitFreeSurface`?. On a regular `RectilinearGrid`, `NonhydrostaticModel` with `Flat` z is hydrostatic and has equivalent physics (because the free surface physics are linearized in `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`). Before generalizing anything we could add an error message to the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` constructor to point this out (and maybe link to this issue). `ShallowWaterModel` has a nonlinear free surface and thus finite ""Mach number"" (ratio between gravity wave speed and flow speed).

As every CCE graduate student learns, computers take many tens of cycles to evaluate an operation like a an add or multiply. The operation is sequential and carried out in a multi-stage pipeline in the heart of a CPU (or GPU). So unless the compiler has something else for the processor to do, the processor will have to wait for one step to make it through the pipeline before the next step? . I think the normal way to do this is to have some inner horiz blocking that is flexible (and can be 1,1) and then iterate over levels with some intermediate stores? The horiz block can be some fraction of inner cache or GPU local proc shared mem. The math doesn't quite look at this way because it assumes that a+b and/or a*b etc.. happen ""instantaneously"". It does not take into account that the awnser from a*b might take; 5-10 clock cycles to pass through the CPU floating point unit. . I think that is fairly generally true? Functional style code in Julia should make it possible; to express this in a fairly clean way, but with flexibility to change blocking for different ; target arch.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/470#issuecomment-541363073:660,flexible,flexible,660,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/470#issuecomment-541363073,1,['flexible'],['flexible']

Modifiability,"Hmmm, do we know why we can't adapt the full `Field` to work inside GPU kernels? I think you said you've tried it but ran into some issues a while back?. The definition is; ```julia; struct Field{X, Y, Z, A, G, B} <: AbstractField{X, Y, Z, A, G}; data :: A; grid :: G; boundary_conditions :: B; ```; where the `grid` has been adapted, `data` is usually an offset array which has also been adapted, and I thought individual boundary conditions have been adapted as well so feels like it should be easy to adapt the full `Field`. Note: `boundary_conditions` is a named tuple of `FieldBoundaryConditions` so maybe we just need to adapt `FieldBoundaryConditions`, `CoordinateBoundaryConditions`? Hmmm but they're really named tuples so maybe they're already adapted. If we can't adapt `Field` then yeah the adapt rules you've suggested sound pretty good and would simplify the time stepping a lot. The kernels already deal with data tuples so not much would even have to change I think.

Modifiability,"Hydrostatic pressure is _supposed to be_ calculated by integrating downwards using a stencil in which pressure is located at `(Center, Center, Center)`. This requires interpolating buoyancy to `(Center, Center, Face)`. However, in the kernel of the integral, the buoyancy is multiplied by `Δzᵃᵃᶜ(i, j, k+1, grid)`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/ade8ff03da722d1dd904022fc60997093d9e2e0f/src/Models/IncompressibleModels/update_hydrostatic_pressure.jl#L15. This isn't the correct kernel if the integral corresponds to a discretization of the hydrostatic pressure term in the vertical momentum equation (omitting `i, j` for brevity) using a pressure field `p` located at (`Center, Center, Center`):. ```julia; (p[k] - p[k-1]) / Δzᵃᵃᶠ[k] = ℑzᵃᵃᶠ(k, b); ```. In other words, differencing a field at vertical `Center` requires dividing by `Δzᵃᵃᶠ`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/ade8ff03da722d1dd904022fc60997093d9e2e0f/src/Operators/derivative_operators.jl#L12. Another way to view the error is that we are multiplying a field located at `Center, Center, Face` by a grid metric located at `Center, Center, Center`. Possibly this error crept into the code due to a confusion about the superscript notation (there have been a few others of this nature).

Modifiability,"Hyperviscosity _is_ an LES closure. It's not just a great one because it requires tuning (ie you have to select the hyperviscosity, and the hyperviscosity doesn't change). You can use a scaling argument to find the hyperviscosity:. $$ \nu_4 = \Delta^4 / \tau $$. where $\Delta$ is a length scale (typically the grid spacing) and $\tau$ is the time-scale over which you'd like to damp grid scale motions. The longer the better. Perhaps you can estimate a time-scale in terms of the buoyancy frequency (eg to damp grid scale buoyancy oscillations) --- like $\tau = C / N$ where $N$ is the buoyancy frequency and $C$ is a constant (perhaps not O(1)). $C = 10$ could be a good starting point. If you need more dissipation then decrease $C$, if you need less increase $C$. Its not ""less correct"" than an LES closure. (Both are closures, not exact.) As for all LES or macroscale computational science in general the goal is to find solutions with statistics of interest that are indepednent of resolution. Note that upwinding can be thought of as adding hyperdissipation which scales with the velocity (similar to traditional LES closures in fact).

Another issue to add into this discussion is the fact of how to handle output (e.g. `file.nc`) with checkpoints and `file_splitting`. Currently, when a simulation is pickup from a checkpoint having the flag `overwrite_existing = true` rewrites to empty all the pre-existing files (i.e. file_part1.nc, file_partN.nc). With `overwrite_existing = false`, the simulation crashes because it doesn't find the file `file.nc`.

Modifiability,"I am happy to follow this discussion and even though I am very new to the table but will share a perspective. Outside of the context of Oceananigans, I would think of the collection of PDEs as the physical model, and the method by which we discretize them in both space and time, as the numerical model. In this context, when we say model we mean the spatial discretization of the physical model, which is most of but not quite all of the numerical model. The fact that we don't have Advection in the Models folder is consistent and a good idea. It makes sense to me to put the time stepping in simulations since that is the part where we turn the crank and find the solutions to the prognostic variables. . I suspect the user might benefit from a little bit of discusson on this in the docs so that they can better understand the framework you've set up, which works great.

Modifiability,"I believe Oceananigans currently has the option to have curvilinear coordinates in the horizontal and a regular grid in the vertical. This has been used to solve the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` in spherical coordinates. Using what is currently available, it seems like one could adapt this to create a `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` and maybe `IncompressibleModel` that allows for topography that varies in one-dimension. We could use a curvlinear grid in the `x-z` plane that is build on terrain following coordinates over smooth topography and then use a regular grid for the `y` direction. . I think this model would be interesting in it's own right but if nothing else it could be used for comparison with immersed boundary methods that include topography, which I presume is an idea people have? Immersed boundary could be more powerful in that it would allow for two-dimensional topography. **Questions**: . - If I define a `terrain-following` grid then what new code will need to adapted to do the above? ; - Would this be as easy to do for the nonhydrostatic model as for the hydrostatic one?; - If we define a `boundary-following` shallow water model to deal with smooth coastlines, could we modify the `ShallowWaterModel` to evolve in this geometry? This is actually purely horizontal so maybe it would be easier?.

In other words, a ""golden master"" in our case is another numerical model that we (arbitrarily) deem to be a master. These tests are not ""golden master"" tests in that sense. Instead, they test whether the output of the model has ""regressed"", or changed relative to a prior output of the model generated in an identical configuration. Basically, we should not commit ""updates"" to golden master output, because the golden master is... the golden master. However, we do have to update the regression test data when we find bugs in `Oceananigans`. Make sense?. It would be nice to have golden master tests, too. Our best hope for this are tests that use a turbulence closure, since there are many published results for ""low-resolution"" solutions using common turbulence closures like Constant Smagorinsky. Unfortunately, we do not support the boundary conditions that the majority of published results use at low-resolution (either triply-periodic, or vertically-bounded with a 'wall model'). .

Modifiability,"I don't think there's a chicken and egg problem. Testing new features requires some initiative and also experience with / understanding of the relevant science applications. I think the ""egg"" is the validation test itself. A groomed, pedagogical docs example is the ""chicken"" that emerges from that egg. I also think that validation is not just about ensuring quantative accuracy, but about working out the user interface. We want the docs implementations to reflect relatively mature user interfaces, since the docs examples are relatively influential pieces of code. I believe immersed boundaries are still experimental, not least in light of #3142. What are the quantitative validation tests that use immersed boundaries? The only one that I know if is the one I worked on, which shows that a stratified ocean remains at rest:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/main/validation/immersed_boundaries/resting_stratified_bumpy_ocean.jl. We haven't documented those results well, though. The internal tide case could be adapted to validate immersed boundaries with the hydrostatic model, leveraging the vast literature on that subject. I don't think the example involves a comparison with theory or other published numerical results though. It wouldn't be that much work to turn that case into a validation test. As for `NonhydrostaticModel`, by all accounts it seems that it should be experimental until we have a validated pressure solver. It could be interesting to see if we can validate the nonhydrostatic model for certain LES cases, somehow. Otherwise, we do know that pressure solver is in general incorrect (either impenetrability across immersed boundaries is not satisfied, or the velocity field is divergent close to the immersed boundary).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3148#issuecomment-1601130874:1030,adapt,adapted,1030,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3148#issuecomment-1601130874,1,['adapt'],['adapted']

Modifiability,"I draft a repo on this matter [here](https://github.com/iuryt/Bioceananigans.jl).; I tried to summarize my ideas in the README:. > Most of the interelationships between biogeochemical tracers could be implemented using the **forcing functions** (see [Convecting Plankton](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/generated/convecting_plankton/) example from Oceananigans documentation), but commonly the light or light-limiting growth of the phytoplankton are **averaged over the mixed layer** in order to parameterized the effects of the mixing in the upper boundary layer. In other words, the mixing timescale is usually longer than photosynthesis, but shorter than cell-division time, which makes phytoplankton **see the average light or grow at the average light-limiting growth rate** while on the mixed layer. Other example of processes that are not easily implemented on Oceananigans include the **shading of phytoplankton** to deeper layers and the **sinking velocity**. The latter is currently being implemented on Oceananigans by this [Pull Request](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2389) with a new forcing called `AdvectiveForcing`.; > ; > For now, this repository basically gives a set of modules that can be used to estimate the mixed-layer depth, estimate the phytoplankton shading and calculate the light-limiting growth, which is defined by the user as a function, and then the light (or the light-limiting growth) can be averaged over the mixed layer. So basically the repository can simply give all auxiliary functions that are needed for the biogeochemical models, but not the interelationship functions, which can be defined as forcing functions and added to a list of examples on the documentation.

Modifiability,"I have been thinking that we should expand a bit our Smagorinsky models.; Currently the only Smagorinsky-type model we have is the Smagorinsky-Lilly, which works well in some cases, notably the canonical horizontally-periodic turbulence, but has some downsides for more complex flows. For example when turbulence is not heterogeneous, or when there are persistent mean gradients in the flow. AMD is a good option in some cases, but often there are numerical artifacts in stratified, laminar regions in the flow (I don't think it's clear exactly what causes this, but it happens in many of my simulations, and I've herd similar things from others). So I think having at least one option to run a dynamic Smag would be good. One possibility is that, as a start, we allow for user-defined Smagorinsky coefficients that could depend on the velocities. Something like. ```julia; cₛ(i, j, k, grid, C::Function) = C(i, j, k, grid, u, v, w); ```; where `C(i, j, k, grid, u, v, w)` is provided by the user. That would allow the user a bit more control, and they could implement local dynamic Smag models, such as the [dynamic gradient Smagorinsky](https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.7.074604). Something similar is currently done for AMD, although I think it's a bit more restrictive than what I'm proposing. Soon, if there's interest, I'm planning on implementing a scale-independent Smagorinsky that's averaged in the symmetric flow directions (generally this is referred to as Planar-Averaged Scale-Independent Smag, but we wouldn't be limited to a planar average in our case).

Modifiability,"I have created a new branch called ""ShallowWaterS1waveeqn"". S1 is for step 1. It doesn't do much right now but I'm trying to set up the skeleton so that we can actually do something intereting, like evolve the equation. At the moment I have the following:. 1. Created a ShallowWaterModels folder. 2. Created a ShallowWaterModels.jl module. It doesn't do much except include shallowwater_model.jl. 3. shallowwater_model.jl defines a mutable struct and a function. I couldn't get a lot of things to work but it does regularlize the boundary condtions, set up the velocities and a new variable called layer_depth. The name is not great and can go with depth or height, as people prefer. It will be in in the governing equations. 4. Created an example, in the same folder, called onedim_shallowwater.jl. Currently, this includes the module mentioned above, defines a grid (yes, a single point!), defines the initial conditions and sets the velocity. Questions:. 1. This is pretty bare bones so far but does this follow the philosophy of Oceananigans?. 2. I have tried to inititalze the layer_depth by adding an argument into the set! command but it failed. Below is the command that I thought would work and below is the error because layer_depth is not model.velocities or model.tracers. Can someone help me to see what silliness I am doing?. ```; set!(model, u = u, v = v, layer_deth = layer_depth); fails with ""ERROR: LoadError: ArgumentError: name layer_depth not found in model.velocities or model.tracers."". After I get the initial conditions defined I then need to specify the fluxes for the PDE. That should not be difficult but one issue is the nomenclature.

If I just pass `model.velocities` to it, it works fine and returns `u`. If I try to pass, for example, the perturbation `u - Average(u)`, then for some reason the KFO returns `u`:. ```julia; julia> velocities = (u = (model.velocities.u - Field(Average(model.velocities.u))),);. julia> @compute f1 = Field(KernelFunctionOperation{Face, Center, Center}(ufunc, model.grid, velocities));. julia> interior(f1) # This should be all zero; 1×1×4 view(::Array{Float64, 3}, 4:4, 4:4, 4:7) with eltype Float64:; [:, :, 1] =; 2.0.

Modifiability,"I refactored the interface significantly. Now instead of using a model property `immersed_boundary`, I've introduced a new grid ""wrapper"" called `ImmersedBoundaryGrid`. This new grid wrapper replicates the behavior of the underlying or ""primary"" grid, except where functions are overridden. This allows functions like `diffusive_flux_x` to be extended without touching model time-stepping code.

Modifiability,"I started tackling this issue in ClimaAtmos last week. I wrote a module, `OutputPathGenerator`, in a separate utilities package ([documentation](https://clima.github.io/ClimaUtilities.jl/dev/outputpathgenerator/)). This module defines an object, `OutputPathGenerator` that can be extended with different `OutputPathGeneratorStyle`s. ; The `OutputPathGenerator` is used in a `generate_output_path` function that takes the base output dir and the style.; The simplest of such styles is ""overwrite"". . The style that is currently being used in Atmos is `ActiveLinkStyle`. Citing from the docs:; > This style provides a more convenient and non-destructive approach. It manages a sequence of subfolders within the base directory specified by `output_path`. It also creates a symbolic link named `output_active` that points to the current active subfolder. This allows you to easily access the latest simulation results with a predictable path. > Example:; > Let's assume your output_path is set to data.; > If data doesn't exist, the module creates it and returns data/output_active. This link points to the newly created subfolder data/output_0000.; > If data exists and contains an output_active link pointing to data/output_0005, the module creates a new subfolder data/output_0006 and updates output_active to point to it.; > If data exists with or without an output_active link, the module checks for existing subfolders named data/output_XXXX (with XXXX a number). If none are found, it creates data/output_0000 and a link data/output_active pointing to it. Atmos uses `OutputPathGenerator` internally. My vision is that end users would be providing the base path and possibly choosing a `Style` if they don't want the default behavior (which is the ActiveLinkStyle). `Styles` are Julia objects and new ones can be defined in scripts by implementing a method for the function `generate_output_path`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3543#issuecomment-2041168662:280,extend,extended,280,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3543#issuecomment-2041168662,1,['extend'],['extended']

Modifiability,"I support a `Rotation` abstract type with subtypes like `FPlane`, `BetaPlane`, and `FullCoriolis` (you are referring to including the horizontal components of the rotation vector within the tangent plane approximation?). Do you think that we should not have the concept of a molecular transport coefficient at all? I feel we should have something like `MolecularTransportCoefficients` for things like molecular viscosity and different molecular diffusivities for each tracer (so that we support the most basic and easiest simulation case: DNS). `TurbulenceClosure` can handle all the cases in which the transport coefficients are non-molecular, as in the case of a constant anisotropic viscosity. My comment about the reference density was actually my attempt to channel @jm-c and I think I mangled it. The point is that density is not a variable in a Boussinesq code and the value of the reference density has no effect on the dynamics. Buoyancy is the Boussinesq variable. It gets confusing when you add nonlinear equations of state, because you will still need to store a reference density somewhere in order to calculate boundary fluxes of temperature and velocity associated with, for example, heat fluxes and momentum fluxes. For that reason it makes sense to divorce the reference density from the equation of state and consider it separately. As long as you have a Boussinesq code you will not need to calculate density. You'll get to this point in a hurry if you try to implement nonlinear equations of state for your Europa simulation.

Modifiability,"I think broadcasting for same-field operators, e.g. `CellField .+ CellField` would be really useful and make the code more readable.

But cross-field broadcasting is a bit trickier so might be better to leave it unimplemented especially as it's not a very common operation, I only use it when adding `f .* v` to `Gu` or `f .* u` to `Gv`. Without it you would have to explicitly write `u .+ avgx(avgy(v))` so if you forget it then it might make finding the bug a bit harder. With it, you can just write `u .+ v` with the averaging happening behind the scenes, so you might apply it by mistake without realizing it. Another potentially difficult bug to find.

Modifiability,"I think it's ok that ""rigid lid"" is implicit. In fact all the sides are rigid and there's no special direction at all. In fact, it might make sense to omit ""free surface"" from the hydrostatic model description. We could soon have a rigid lid option there, and then it wouldn't really make sense to continue calling it a ""HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel"". There's a few things I think should go in before 1.0:. * Abstraction for vectors. It's only for simple grids that we can really get away with referring to the velocity field component wise with `u, v, w`. Building an abstraction for vectors changes the API because we'll specify boundary conditions on the whole velocity field, not just each component separately. I don't think we should do 1.0 without this.; * Resolve #1825 (specifying `architecture` when building `grid`). Another major API change, not to mention a substantial internal refactor.; * Simplify grids. We really only need one `RectilinearGrid`, one `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`, and one ""arbitrary"" (not aligned with a coordinate system, like what's used for the cubed sphere). Another API change because we don't need `RegularRectilinearGrid` and `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid`. Also simplifies the code a lot.

Modifiability,"I think something that we haven't fully grasped in the past (and I am largely to blame) is how to properly display information to users in the REPL and log files (eg by extending existing methods so the interface for displaying `Oceanangians` types is the same as other julia types). There are a few functions available:. * `show`; * `print` (seems similar to `show`, except used where fancy formatting such as colors, etc may not be appropriate or available); * `summary`. We also want even more minimal representations than those produced by `summary`, like `string(typeof(obj).name.wrapper)`. There may also be a julia function for this, but I didn't find one after a cursory search. We have (unfortunately) introduced what appears to be a needless alternative to `summary` in the source code; we call this `short_show`. So we already have sizeable technical debt...

Modifiability,"I think that many of the functions and types at the top level, such as . https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/bcc34f07b3f949ea6fb34c7814f4b856d24924c2/src/Oceananigans.jl#L171-L188. indicate that code is included out of order, or that the notion of ""dependency"" (ie which parts of the code define an interface, vs which parts of the code implement an interface) is not well-established. In other words, we don't know what parts of the code are lower-level than other parts of the code. Therefore I think we should strive to reduce or eliminate those definitions if possible. This disorganization presents two problems. First it means that the code is harder to reason about, because its not logical (ie constructed ad-hoc rather than following clear rules). The more serious practical problem is that it will prevent us from splitting up the repo (ie separating core finite volume utilities such as grids, fields etc, from the physics / models, from simulations). It's possible that we will need to port out the ""simulations"" utilities fairly soon to facilitate coupled simulations (this would be required to avoid circular dependencies in the coupling software). The cause is mostly historical; the code was developed from the ground-up as-needed rather than following some preconceived design. We now understand that ""simulations"" should be incorporated before models; simulations should really _define_ the interface that a model needs to provide (mostly the function `time_step!`, but also a few auxiliary functions like `prognostic_fields`, `initialize!`, etc). I'm opening this issue because I think this concern should be written down somewhere so developers are aware and can strive to avoid worsening (ideally new development should work towards eliminating ""bad"" top-level definitions rather than adding new ones).",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3048:1153,coupling,coupling,1153,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3048,1,['coupling'],['coupling']
Modifiability,"I think that's a decent idea and also might help de-complexify some of the code associated with buoyancy models. We would have to refactor our equations of state a bit but that's not hard. The main question is what to do about `gravitational_acceleration`. Right now, `gravitational_acceleration` is a parameter of `SeawaterBuoyancy`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/da9c53ddd9e28d123b40726cfac2fad835284879/src/BuoyancyModels/seawater_buoyancy.jl#L10-L15. because if you're using `BuoyancyTracer()`, there's no gravitational acceleration parameter (since its absorbed into the definition of buoyancy). However, we could move `gravitational_acceleration` into `Buoyancy`, and then set it to `nothing` when we are using `BuoyancyTracer`. The downside of this approach is that people can then change this parameter when using `BuoyancyTracer`, even though such changes would have no dynamical effect on the model (we've tried to limit such possibility for confusion otherwise...). It could be reasonable to move `constant_temperature` and `constant_salinity` into `equation_of_state`. `SeawaterBuoyancy` is then a type union of buoyancies with either `LinearEquationOfState` or something else from `SeawaterPolynomials.jl`.

This will not ensure a zero second order derivative on the face.; we have to extend the boundary condition to the halos to ensure 0 laplacian on the boundary.

Implement a ""mask"" that replaces `correct_immersed_tendencies!` that forcibly overwrites immersed regions to specified values in `update_state!` (this is effectively what `correct_immersed_tendencies!` does now); 2. Extend `calculate_boundary_tendency_terms!` to adjust tendencies in cells adjacent to immersed boundaries.

Modifiability,"I think there's still a use for `KernelComputedField`! It's more expensive to construct a calculation by nesting `ComputedField`s inside it. The difference is in the number of kernel launches: when expressing a calculation with a single kernel, the computation is computed with a single loop over all grid points. When expressing a calculation using intermediate `ComputedField`, then first we launch kernels to calculate the intermediate `ComputedField`s, and launch a final kernel to compute the quantity of interest. It can also be more memory intensive since the intermediate `ComputedField`s need to be stored. For some applications, the ""optimization"" of avoiding intermediate kernel launches / calculations may be unimportant (for example, if plenty of memory is available and computations are made very rarely). I think nesting `ComputedField`s is a nice solution that avoids having to hand-write kernels for those cases. But sometimes I do think that users want to optimize diagnostics calculations. There are also some other nice applications of `KernelComputedField`; for example I think it would be nice to make the LES eddy diffusivities into `KernelComputedField` (which are computed every tendency evaluation so performance is crucial), and perhaps some other auxiliary variables.

Modifiability,"I think this is a a big step forward and happy to share my two cents worth. I agree that we should keep `gravitational_acceleration` the same as before. We will need to have a bunch of `g'`. Since we have a free surface, we assume that we have air above, then `g'` of the top layer is really just `g`. That's why I would suggest having n reduced gravities for n layers. We will need n interfaces and we could also store the n heights. Sometimes it's convenient to have one or the other. For efficiency we only need one, but for convenience we might want to have both. What are people's preferences?. The more layers we have, the thinner each layer tends to be. This means that it's more likely that layer depths can vanish. If this ever happens, then a numerical instability can happen.

This is similar to how `SeawaterBuoyancy` works, in that it provides a concrete structure with a slot `equation_of_state` whereby ""external"" packages like `SeawaterPolynomials` can insert custom behavior. Another possibility is to build out a new abstract type below `AbstractBiogeochemistry` with a function-based interface (somehow). I was also thinking it would be nice to supply a ""continuous form"" interface, so that model developers can implement functions that look something like. ```julia; biogeochemical_transition(x, y, z, t, N, P, Z, D, parameters); ```. rather than having to use the ""discrete form"".

The docs are much shorter than they should be right now because the hydrostatic model in particular is still somewhat ""experimental"" (it's a multi-year effort to develop a fully functional GCM, and we are in the thick of it now). There will be so much more in the docs in the end --- a dozen or more parameterizations for ocean turbulence, sea ice, biogeochemistry, and on and on. As a result, it's going to become very important that the docs are as concise as possible (eg, the same constraint we face when writing a textbook). Thus in this process we'll have to carefully curate whatever goes into the docs as a community, and I think it will be helpful if the docs are only used for ""big"" things. A third reason is just that I think this is will reduce the effort required to maintain docs. For example, this change to the docs will become incorrect when we merge the multi-region PR (which hopefully will be soon). That means that we need to update the docs when we merge that PR.

Modifiability,"I think what we want in terms of API is the ability to specify boundary conditions on the surface of an immersed boundary. One design would be to introduce a type called `ImmersedBoundary` that collects information about the location of the boundary and the boundary conditions for each field prescribed on it. This could be relatively simple to implement in the code, though it doesn't exactly conform to our current code design in which boundary conditions are embedded in `Field` objects. Another possibility that may better conform to our current boundary conditions / field design would be to embed `boundaries` in `grid` objects. With this design, `ImmersedBoundary` collects only information about its geometry and parameters related to its numerical implementation (eg regularization functions, interpolation methods, etc). We can then infer from `grid` the information needed to define boundary conditions for fields in both (`x` ,`y`, `z`), as well as on any `ImmersedBoundary`s. Grid constructors would then be something like. ```julia; grid = RegularCartesianGrid(; immersed_boundaries = ImmersedBoundary(geometry = # a function of (x, y, z, t); transfer_function = # parameters ; ); topology = # etc; ); ```; ; As for verification, I think we should use a quantitative test that verifies that boundary conditions are satisfied on the immersed boundary.

Modifiability,"I think what you have discovered is that simulations with `BackgroundField` can behave differently on the GPU than on the CPU for some reason. What do you mean when you say the `BackgroundField` is not consistent with the boundary condition? The boundary condition is applied only to the prognostic variable (the deviation) only. Indeed, one of the most important applications of `BackgroundField` is to run simulations in which the deviations are _periodic_ even though the `BackgroundField` is not. The Eady turbulence problem is an example of one such problem. In that case the background velocity and buoyancy fields are not periodic in the y-direction; but because they only vary _linearly_, deviations from that background state _can_ be idealized as periodic. There may indeed be some issue regarding `BackgroundField` and `Bounded` directions, but I believe this is a bug and not expected. Certainly there is a bug if different results occur on the CPU versus the GPU.

I think it makes sense `model` is a field of `Simulation`. Its simple to envision `Simulation` parameters that are identical, with a different underlying `model` (eg, changing the number of passive tracers)`. The way I envision a logical course for the development of complex software in general is that we start with the fundamental building blocks and make them as easy to use in their low-level form as possible. When we've decided we can proceed no farther, we add another layer of abstraction that fuses these underlying building blocks into a higher-order coherent object. And so on.

I was hoping that not including rogue metrics like `Δx` would facilitate in excising them from the code base. Where in `ShallowWaterModel` to you use `Δx`? I think in the stack trace for the error you received you should be able to locate where the problematic `Δx` is called.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1663#issuecomment-845306836:131,extend,extend,131,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1663#issuecomment-845306836,2,['extend'],"['extend', 'extended']"
Modifiability,"I'd like to resurrect this issue. We've implemented 5, but we don't have callbacks. I think we should just add a callback layer to `Simulation` to replace `simulation.progress` and address whether diagnostics should become callbacks later. The key change is that `iteration_interval` would no longer be an argument to `Simulation`. Instead we would refactor all the examples and validation tests to implement logging and adaptive time stepping via callbacks. Because of that this ends up being a big API change. A barebones callback feature might be. ```julia; struct Callback{F, S}; func :: F; schedule :: S; end; ```. Usage would be something like. ```julia; progress(sim) = println(""Iteration $(sim.model.clock.iteration)""); progress_printer = Callback(progress, schedule = IterationInterval(100)). wizard = TimeStepWizard(cfl=0.1, initial_dt = 2minutes, schedule = IterationInterval(10)). simulation = Simulation(model, stop_time=2hours, callbacks = [progress_printer, wizard]); ```. In other words, the `TimeStepWizard` becomes a callback with a schedule, and we can print progress and adapt the time step on different schedules.

Modifiability,"I'm a little conflicted about this. In python the convention is to put import statements at the top of a file? So the python convention is *not* to have local import statements. Since every file is a module, this means that in python import statements are at the top of modules by convention. In julia modules can be split among many files. Thus if imports are at the top of a *file*, they are scattered within the module. One reason to put things at the top level is so that its easy to see at a glance what a package imports. It's also nice to see what methods are being extended via implication; for example if one sees `import Base: +` we can expect that `+` is redefined. However, I understand that it is not easy to connect an import statement at the top of a massive module (like ours) with where it is used among the many files that comprise the code of a module. I think having more submodules (#495, #456) is really the right solution to this problem; in that case each module is short so the issue of tracing import statements to usage within a huge module is alleviated. What is the problem that this change would solve? If one is reading code in a file, and an unfamiliar function appears, one presumably looks to the top-level to see where it is imported. If one is reading a module, why is it crucial to know *where* in the code the package is used?. This new convention could create issues in which functionality from a package imported in one file is used elsewhere, making it hard to trace exactly where an unfamiliar function first arrived in the namespace. Or, if two packages conflict with one another. In julia, resolving method conflicts when two packages export the same name can be tricky and the resolution depends on the order in which packages are imported.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/497#issuecomment-545594755:573,extend,extended,573,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/497#issuecomment-545594755,1,['extend'],['extended']

Modifiability,"I'm not sure if this is known (or even expected) or not, but with recent versions of Oceananigans I've noticed that we're allocating more and more memory on GPUs. Basically the scenario is that I've running simulations with a given script for the past 6 months or so. The simulation and model itself has stayed the same, I've been running on the same GPUs, and the only changes that I made were those forced by changes in Oceanigans. . When I started this setup, I could run up to ~105 million points. Then as the versions increased I had to decrease to size of simulations to 100 million and then to 95 million. Now with the change to Julia 1.8 (I had been using Julia 1.6 until version 0.77.5) there was a steep increase in memory use and my max size went from 95 to 80 million. Compared to my original size of ~105 million, that's a decrease of about 25% in the grid size. Has anyone else noticed this? Is this expected since we added more features/flexibility to the code lately?. A few notes:. - My simulation is pretty complex (it's got IBM, forcings for every variable, a tracer, LES closures and drag BCs), so I think for most other simulations the max size would be smaller; - I understand that part of the memory allocation depends on the package dependencies (and the Julia version itself), not being directly controlled by Oceananigans code; - It's also worth noting that since the cluster I use (Casper) hasn't installed Julia 1.8, I started trying the newest version from the pre-compiled binaries for Julia 1.8. I don't know if that can somehow affect the memory allocation since the binaries aren't optimized for that specific machine (I haven't yet tried compiling Julia 1.8 from source).

Modifiability,"I've had a go at implementing a proper NPZD model (rather than one I just made up on the fly) and have some thoughts on how we should modify the API:; - I think we need an `required_biogeochemical_auxiliary_fields` like `required_biogeochemical_tracers` because for most models we're going to want the user to at least specify a PAR field (I suppose we may want this to also check the shape of the field because some models may have a pre defined depth dependence of PAR so we might want the user to specify a 2D PAR field rather than doing it properly by integrating a 3D field); - Given what you said the other day about callbacks only being used for features that should be built into Oceananigans we might want to have a think about how a BGC model can specify the attenuation of PAR. You've mentioned that we could define some kind of integrated field?; - It might be helpful to have a simpler interface for advection in biogeochemical models. Although a user could just add another forcing, I think the only way for a model to automatically add an advective forcing is how I've implimented it in the below example. I Think this works quite well since a lot of BGC models write the sinking terms with the other forcing terms, but its a little cumbersome to write e.g. `sinking = div_Uc(i, j, k, grid, bgc.adv_scheme, bgc.u⃗ᵖ, fields.P)`, and model makers will need to do the setup stuff I've done to make the advective velocity fields.

Modifiability,"I've long been unsatisfied with how we build output. It requires a lot of typing --- that is, [_boilerplate_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_text). I often feel a sense of dread when I have to go beyond ""visualizing the final iteration"" of a prototype to defining an output writer. _So much typing_. This PR is an attempt to make output easier and more fun. I use JLD2 as an example but if there is some consensus then I think this PR should extend the same to NetCDF. The main thrust of this PR is a new function called `output!`. It works like this:. ```julia; output!(simulation, outputs; schedule=TimeInterval(1), filename=""low_hanging_fruit""); ```. The default is `JLD2Format()`. For `NetCDF` users would write. ```julia; output!(simulation, outputs, NetCDFFormat(); kw...); ```. The function adds an output writer to `simulation`, choosing a ""generic name"" for the `simulation.output_writers` dictionary. Does this enable one line output writing?. I'd love to hear feedback about this design. I implemented it in the `two_dimensional_turbulence.jl` example for illustration:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/6a6853ddf53c53c321c16393682b786e82ef5a8f/examples/two_dimensional_turbulence.jl#L109. There are two more things. First, we need to default `with_halos=true` for JLD2OutputWriter. The time has come because `FieldTimeSeries` is mature. We do, in fact, want halos. The other conundrum is `overwrite_existing` which is discussed on #3543. In short I am wondering whether the best course of action is simply to make default `overwrite_existing=true` and solve so much boilerplate. Simulations are cheap, but life is short!.

Modifiability,"Indeed the pressure solver at the moment allows only a variable z-direction. This is because for a regular grid we can use a full FFT solve while with a singular stretched direction we can solve a tridiagonal system. . For more than one stretched direction we should use an iterative solver to solve the Poisson equation (the solvers are there but the infrastructure not quite yet). We should implement the iterative solver as a default for two or more stretched directions. And set up the FFT-tridiagonal solver as default when we have one stretched direction (either x, y or z).

Modifiability,"Instructions to adapt the code to `MultiRegion` from a Slack conversation with @simone-silvestri:. If you want to adapt your script to multiregion you have to:; - define a multiregion grid with: `grid = MultiRegionGrid(grid, partition = XPartition(n_gpus_you_want_to_use), devices = n_gpus_you_want_to_use)` . The multiregion grid supersedes the immersed boundary grid, i.e. if you are using an immersed boundary grid then `grid = MultiRegionGrid(ibg; kwargs...)` , not the other way around.; - if you are using any array for forcing or boundary condition, you have to adapt it to the multiregion paradigm as follows: `using Oceananigans.MultiRegion: multi_region_object_from_array; my_adapted_array = multi_region_object_from_array(my_array, grid)`. MultiRegion works only on single node multi GPU, so all the GPUs should be accessible from a single process in the node. You can check the number of GPUs available by logging in a node and typing nvidia-smi , if you want to split your grid on specific devices (let’s say GPU 0 and 3), you can pass `devices = (0, 3)` to the `MultiRegionGrid` constructor. There is another thing that you have to take care of: the pressure solve is performed on one GPU only so both the storage and source term (a field of complex values of the size of the full grid) reside on 1 GPU only (usually the one corresponding to the last region). This means that if your grid is 100M points, 2.98 GB will have to be reserved for the solver’s auxiliary fields; ```julia; julia> sizeof(complex(zeros(Int(100e6)))) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 * 2; 2.9802322387695312; ```; So make sure you have that space available. (When I have time I ll try to find a solution to run truly parallel pressure solvers, for both nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic models).

Modifiability,"Interesting! Good find. This not the only thing to worry about regarding the entrainment diffusivity. It's effect also seems to depend on vertical resolution, and it only seems useful at low resolutions. In general, I recommend switching to CATKEVerticalDiffusivity, where we have put a lot of effort into solving those problems. I'm going to suggest a different solution that setting some maximum capping diffusivity. I think setting a maximum diffusivity could work, but that there are better solutions that more directly address the underlying issue. I think the issue here is that ""entrainment"" should not occur across low stratification regions. Thus this model for ""entrainment"" assumes the stratification is ""strong"". More generally, we are dividing the boundary layer into a convecting region and an entraining region. We identify the convecting region by `N² < 0`. However, in reality the convecting region should extend further down into regions of stable, but still weak stratification below the unstable region. The ""entraining"" layer is more properly where stratification significantly increases over the weakly stratified lower part of the convecting region. (This analysis is based on LES.) `RiBasedVerticalDiffusivity`'s formulation --- apart from being overly simple --- simply cannot cope with the complexity of real boundary layer structure because it is not truly non-local. Really addressing this issue (eg implementing a more physically accurate model of boundary layer structure) might require using a vertical integral instead of a 3D kernel. (We decided that because CATKE seems like a decent parameterization, it's not worth it to pursue those accuracy improvements). One way to fix the issue but retaining a 3D kernel is to change the way we estimate ""convecting"" and ""entraining"" regions. Those criteria are. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/94e99e1d5fb3d121a6d801a931987bb6ff59f20e/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/ri_based_vertical_d",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3283#issuecomment-1731439718:923,extend,extend,923,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3283#issuecomment-1731439718,1,['extend'],['extend']

Modifiability,"It's hard because even [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_drift) is misleading on this subject and says. > For a pure wave motion in fluid dynamics, the Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. Yet if a mean velocity exists, the motion is not a ""pure wave"" motion; it has a mean component and a wave component, each of which have dynamics that are independent in the limit of small amplitude waves. In other words, if particles and thus fluid undergo some net drift, then some external mean force must have imparted mean momentum to the fluid. So the first sentence of the Wikipedia article misleads. It's easy to get this wrong because in many systems the mean dynamics are ""trivial"" and do not evolve. But this is not always the case... The reason this subject is so tricky is because the physics of surface gravity waves _require_ a transfer of mean momentum from some external agent if they are excited (this is part of what it means for a wave field to have pseudomomentum). Thus the forced growth of waves is _also_ associated with a transfer of mean momentum (from the atmosphere to the ocean). But the mean momentum so transferred is not by any reasonable definition a ""wave property""; it undergoes an independent evolution and is easily divorced from wave fields that propagate rapidly away. In particular, if the system is rotating, the mean momentum excites a stationary inertial oscillation that has no net transport over long periods of time (while the wave field happily propagates ad infinitum)... Not that Wikipedia was always right before this on every topic --- but the view on Wikipedia is the same one that's taught in classrooms. I think users know _mathematically_ what is indicated by the keyword `stokes_drift`, especially if we well-document the fact that we solve for the Lagrangian-mean velocity.

E.g.,. ```Julia; function compute_this_and_that(model::ShallowWaterModel{1}); a = 1 # simple calculation for single-layer models; return a; end. function compute_this_and_that(model::ShallowWaterModel); number_of_layers = model.number_of_layers; a = sum(rand(number_of_layers)) # more complicated stuff only needed for multi-layer models; return a; end; ```.

Modifiability,"Just as an update --- we actually currently cannot do this verification experiment because of a problem with LES models (a theoretical problem, not an implementation problem) with specified buoyancy flux boundary conditions and zero stress boundary conditions. In short, we observe grid-scale oscillations in the near-surface buoyancy gradient when buoyancy fluxes are specified. The primary issue is associated with a too-small near-surface LES diffusivity. . I want to emphasize that this is not a numerical issue with boundary condition specification, or a bug in the LES implementation --- this is a fundamental, theoretical problem with LES formulation. Others have observed this issue before with a variety of LES formulations, so this issue is not particular to AMD, either. I'm working on a fix because this is an important, canonical problem. The easiest way to fix the problem is to allow the LES model constant (which we should view as a free parameter) to vary in space and in particular to increase near the wall. This is simple, yet completely empirical solution. . The level of empiricism / near-wall enhancement of the model constant needed for a smooth solution is mitigated somewhat if we can specify the gradient of buoyancy / temperature on the boundary. This second component of the fix can be done by introducing a wall model on top of the interior LES formulation that applies *on* boundaries. The wall model introduces a second free parameter in addition to the interior LES free parameter. Adjusting the wall model's free parameter allows us to ""effectively"" increase the near-wall value of the AMD diffusivity. An even better, more complete fix would also modify the interior LES model near the wall.

Modifiability,"Just for completeness, what do we think about `pseudomomentum`?. The issue with Stokes ""drift"" is that it implies a ""drifting"" which is not quite the right way to think about how surface waves affect the motion of fluid beneath them. In reality, average momentum (and thus any ""drifting"" that might occur) is imparted by external forces (such as the atmosphere); the averaged effect of surface waves is rather more subtle and is associated with changes to the relationship between mean momentum and vorticity (eg, vorticity feels the effect of pseudomomentum, despite that momentum does not). These concepts are confused routinely in the literature, so our community doesn't have a solid conceptual foundation on which standardized terminology is easily built. But suffice to say that in practice most people say ""Stokes drift"" but mean ""pseudomomentum"".

Re is roughly a factor of 2 too large. Nu is too large by ~60%. (edited) ; I might try changing the Poincare ""constant"" to see if it makes a difference here. Currently C = 1/12, so I'll try 1/24 and 1/6. Might also try 128 vertical levels, but that's no longer a fair comparison. ![Stratified_couette_flow_UT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20099589/64424696-bc478480-d077-11e9-8b1e-f4d93e912214.png). ![Stratified_couette_flow_VK](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20099589/64424702-bf427500-d077-11e9-890f-56096e6719a0.png). ![Stratified_couette_flow_ReNu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20099589/64424706-c2d5fc00-d077-11e9-9711-d03c30d5a97e.png)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/310#issuecomment-528817838:338,layers,layers,338,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/310#issuecomment-528817838,1,['layers'],['layers']
Modifiability,"Just to frame the discussion: this is probably most important in the context of new users or scientists trying to read examples, docs, and scripts that implement numerical experiments for scientific purposes. In that context I agree with @ali-ramadhan that `BoussinesqModel` is misleading for models with `tracers = nothing` and `buoyancy = nothing`. I think we've also discussed making this default, since its simple... As for the distinction between hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models I agree that with currently supported configurations, `NonhydrostaticRigidLid` is better than `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. I'm only hesitant about this change because I wonder if we may want to combine these two models in the future. The motivation to develop `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` separately is largely practical and caves to short term timeline pressures (it's easier to break things when nobody's using it, and we throw a warning right in the constructor so people know its experimental). In the long run it might make sense to have just a single interface to all incompressible models and support all combinations of hydrostatic, non-hydrostatic, free surface / rigid lid, etc through a single interface, similar to what MITgcm offers. The interfaces / model specific code is expensive to maintain, which motivates having just one interface. If this is our goal, it'd be premature to change the name of `IncompressibleModel`. If people feel they'd like to commit to maintaining two interfaces / model constructors / time-stepping code then I think changing the name to be clearer but less general is an option to consider. I personally would rather maintain as few `AbstractModel` as possible because I feel they are fairly expensive in terms of person-time to maintain. And we probably have a lot of improvements that need to be made (features like `model.auxiliary_fields`, `VectorField` for velocity field rather than baking in the coordinate system which fails on the cubed sphere), proper su",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1620#issuecomment-827842772:529,config,configurations,529,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1620#issuecomment-827842772,1,['config'],['configurations']

Probably good to keep these 2 separated to be able to switch on/off different terms in the MEKE budget. For instance, as of now, MOM6 OM4 only uses the `PrognosticMEKEDiffusivity` (and no backscatter), but the CPT and others are looking into the energetically-constrained backscatter term intensively these days!; 3. **MEKE vs. GEOMETRIC**: As you mention above, the two schemes are very similar. There are maybe three notable differences: ; a) **energy type**: MEKE solves a prognostic equation for `EKE`, whereas GEOMETRIC solves a prognostic equation for `EKE + EPE`. To inform GM, the two schemes then use the variable `2 * EKE` and `EKE + EPE`, respectively. [Bachman (2017)](10.1016/j.ocemod.2016.12.004) found that in practice, kappa_GM is not sensitive to whether one solves for `EKE` (as MEKE does) or `EKE + EPE` (as GEOMETRIC does). So we could probably start by following the MEKE approach, and just solve for `EKE`.; b) **GM/energy source term**: In MEKE, it is left to the user how to specify the mixing length scale `L_mix` in `kappa_GM = c * sqrt(2 MEKE) * L_mix` and in the inferred MEKE source term. (Options are: the deformation scale, Rhines scale, grid scale, frictional halting scale, Eady length scale, or any combination of those, see [here](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6/blob/0e8acd90b46656ccb7fbc73bc5911ef2733a345c/src/parameterizations/lateral/MOM_MEKE.F90#L995-L1012).) In GEOMETRIC, the mixing length scale is essentially chosen as the Eady length scale. So if you use MEKE with the Eady length scale `L_e` (see Appendix Ab in Kong and Jansen, 2021), you recover the GEOMETRIC source",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2431#issuecomment-1122829692:1730,variab,variable,1730,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2431#issuecomment-1122829692,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"Let me try to reframe the problem and tell me if you agree. I think its a real issue that the output files are created when the output writers are instantiated. Because of this, we find ourselves having to write `overwrite_existing=false` when we pickup from a checkpoint, but `overwrite_existing=true` otherwise. This is a hack for sure. It's a failure of the checkpointer design --- the whole point of the design is to make checkpointing easy. We should be able to change just one line. I even think we should be able to pick up from a checkpoint with an environment variable so we don't have to change the run script at all. That would be more robust. What you're describing sounds like an additional problem of this deficiency. The fix seems straightforward. We just need to introduce the concept of output ""initialization"". Then we can delay creating the output file to `run!`. At that point we know if we are picking up from a checkpoint or not, obviously if we are picking from a checkpoint we don't want to delete any existing files. It seems like if we introduce initialization we can also handle file splitting. What do you think? If you want to help we can get started on it. I was putting it off myself because I don't have immediate needs for checkpointing but that will probably change pretty soon.

Modifiability,"Lots of interesting discussion here. Nomenclature can be a pain as people use a lot of different words for the same things and sometimes use the same word for different things. I wonder whether finding a good review article and citing that would be a good way to establish our foundation? I imagine there is a lot to choose from out there but don't have a specific one in mind. Below are a few thoughts. 1) I would argue that molecular viscosity is real (resolved) physics, in these continuum models, is derived from physical principles and you should not change the coefficients based on the grid you are using. These are measured in experiments and are what the community to believe as true when doing lab experiments. 2) For large-scale flows, as many of us consider, molecular viscosity is insignificant and should probably be ignored as it has no real meaning on the large scales. That is why summing molecular and eddy viscosities does not seem like such a good idea to me. However, adding a very small number to a large number will nto make much of a difference for all intensive purposes. I would think that the user has the onous of responsibility of picking the viscosity that is appropriate for their problem. . 3) For large-scale flows where you need some parameterization, I think that using `eddy` or `sgs` are accepted by large groups in the community.

Modifiability,"Might be cool to be able to dispatch on the order so the order could be specified as part of the model, e.g. ```julia; model = ShallowWaterModel(grid=grid, order=4); ```. and it would make it easier to use the operators in other models. We could define new types like. ```julia; struct SecondOrderCenteredDifference end # one option; struct CenteredDifference{N} end # another option; ```. then dispatch on `::SecondOrderCenteredDifference` or `::CenteredDifference{Val{4}}` or we could dispatch on numbers via `Val`. ```julia; julia> δ(i, A, ::Val{2}) = A[i] - A[i-1]; δ (generic function with 1 method). julia> δ(i, A, ::Val{4}) = (-2A[i+1] + 16A[i] - 16A[i-1] +2A[i-2]) / 12; δ (generic function with 2 methods). julia> δ(10, collect(1:20) .^ 2, Val(2)); 19. julia> δ(10, collect(1:20) .^ 2, Val(4)); 15.833333333333334; ```. but might have to be careful to [avoid performance regressions with `Val`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#man-performance-value-type). That said it might take a non-trivial amount of refactoring to support and test dispatching on the operator order, at least for the incompressible model. Maybe it makes sense for `ShallowWaterModel` to add support for 4th-order operators first (with or without dispatch, probably easier without first) and from there we can investigate how to generalize?.

Modifiability,"Might be good to clarify some of this discussion: a ""sponge layer"" refers to any region in a simulation domain that dissipates energy. A wide variety of forcing functions are ""valid"" sponge layers, including the example in the documentation. The Gaussian mask appears to be behaving correctly, and as one expects given the documentation, source code, and known/measurable/plottable properties of Gaussians. Using a Gaussian to define the masked region is valid strategy used successfully in research. Of course, this does not mean that other masking functions may be more appropriate, or that a ""smooth step"" function might be more useful to users, since the width of the sponge, and width of the sponge layer *transition* region may be modulated independently. This is not the case for the Gaussian, which has only one width parameter. A sharp heaviside is not a good choice for a sponge layer when the sponge is intended to absorb radiating internal waves. The reason is that waves can reflect off a sponge layer if the transition between undamped and damping regions is too abrupt (as pointed out by @navidcy). was under the impression this might even be an issue for problems without waves... ?. The requirement that sponge layers involve smooth transitions does mean that sponge layers can take up a substantial portion of the computational domain. This is often cited as a downside of sponge layers (eg Klemp and Durran 1993).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1203#issuecomment-734408323:190,layers,layers,190,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1203#issuecomment-734408323,4,['layers'],['layers']
Modifiability,"Might be interesting to give adaptive time-stepping a try. @christophernhill says it didn't work super well last time they tried it in the MITgcm but that might have been a long time ago.

Not sure if this changes anything. I suspect you just calculate the time step using; ```julia; C = 1 # Maximum Courant number. Probably 1 for our explicit AB2 time-stepping scheme.

Modifiability,"More of a general issue that #1118 made me think about is that we've been mixing data types and instantiated types.

It seems there's some element of memorization to know which one to use when. Maybe this will confuse future users (certainly it confused us in #1118).

For geophysical flows, the time step will almost always be limited by advection, but there seem to be many other flows where the time step will be limited by diffusion.

Modifiability,"No worries about the late response! Here's a couple of comments, might have more later. > The current implementation I have going projects the velocity into tangential and normal directions (with respect to the immersed surface) before interpolating over the boundary. Since the boundary can be pretty variable in made more sense for us to take this approach. So the user would specify what they want the two tangential and 1 normal direction to be instead of (u,v,w) specifically. Right, this is what I mean by having an ""abstraction for vectors"" --- awesome! If the momentum equation is treated in vector form then the three components are coupled. User specification is then on the vector momentum equation; users will specify `VelocityBoundaryConditions` (rather than boundary conditions for each component, and `VectorForcing`, rather than forcing on each component. It may also make sense to coalesce the kernels that compute tendencies for each velocity component (but I'm less sure about that). Either way this is a major change to the API at the very least, but probably necessary and something we also need for complex domains for GCM simulations, like the cubed sphere. > the original idea was to infer Flux from Gradient. This makes sense for a continuous immersed boundary where it's not possible to _discretely_ specify fluxes. If we can't discretely specify fluxes, we have to rely on a diffusivity extracted from the specified turbulence closure. This is simple for closures that have isotropic diffusivities, but gets more complicated for closures with anisotropic / tensor diffusivities. Even worse is supporting flux boundary conditions for the case that a closure doesn't use a diffusivity at all...

Modifiability,"Now that `ShallowWaterModel` is established I think it's important to make it more efficient. At the moment when we use `WENO5`, as I've been doing, we define 3 halo points in each direction. That means that our 1-layer model is really a 7-layer model, which is much more storage than we need. I very much want to remove this so that we can be much more efficient and have the code run faster. I know that #1024 tried to establish a flat dimension for `IncompressibleModel`. This is before my time and I heard multiple people tried doing this and it was a challenge. . I would like to do something independent of #1024, and force that any grid for `ShallowWaterModel` not define halo regions in the vertical and then not fill in those halo regions as it evolves. Below are a list of different things that I think should be done but am very curious to know what people suggest. I haven't tried this so I'm sure there are some details that I have not thought of and hoping to learn from others. - [ ] Maybe define the boundary conditions to be `flat` in the vertical and then try and get flat to work for this model?; - [ ] Maybe in `field_boundary_conditions.jl`, define `uhFluxBoundaryCondtions`, `vhFluxBoundaryCondtions`, `hBoundaryCondtions` that do not do anything to `top` and `bottom`?; - [ ] If we set the number of halos in the vertical to be 0, then we should still be able to use `new_data.jl` without having to modify it?; - [ ] Tell `fill_halo_regions.jl` to not do anything for `bottom` and `top`.; - [ ] If we remove the halos then I don't think we have to modify the tendencies at all so that might be fine.; - [ ] Other things that I've not considered?",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1499:754,evolve,evolves,754,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1499,1,['evolve'],['evolves']
Modifiability,"Now that finally `MultiRegion` is merged we can implement the single node multi GPU paradigm also in the Nonhydrostatic model. cc @tomchor . The work can be divided in three tasks. - [x] Adapt the NonhydrostaticModel to accept a `MultiRegionGrid`. i.e., wrap local function calls in `@apply_regionally` and extend global methods in `multi_region_models.jl`. ; - [ ] Expose the parallelism in `RungeKutta3` timestepper and in the `update_state!` method. This is achieved by lumping together local function calls (all possible kernel calls such as calculate tendencies, rk substeps, etc) in outer functions and wrapping everything in `@apply_regionally`; - [ ] Implement a multi GPU pressure solver. This can be achieved in a couple of different ways. (1) transpose local memory and perform one direction FFT at the time (at we do now in the `Distributed` module through PencilArrays). (2) exploit the multi GPU capabilities of cuda through the cufftxt library that can perform single node distributed FFT to up to 16 GPUs. (3) Allocate storage and plan in Unified memory and perform the FFT in only one GPU. Ideally we would implement (3) only if we are desperate. The best solution would be to go with method (2), as (1) incurs in hefty memory transfer costs (I am not sure as to how the cufftxt implements multi GPU FFT though).

Modifiability,"OK, let me put my 2 cents. If we have the validations in the docs just because of the animations then we should just put the animations on YouTube or somewhere and point people there. Having the non-working versions of, e.g., `lid_cavity.jl` script in the repo and in the docs has lead many new users in the rabbit hole of figure it out. Then users feel that scripts are not working, sometimes they post an issue or ask in Slack. But who know how many other users are simply discouraged. Personally, if I download a code that includes non-working pieces of code I am very discouraged. Thus, bottom-line: I see @glwagner's point that the functionality or pipeline for maintaining healthy validations scripts (even a subset of them) then *only those* should be included in the Docs. `Sandbox`: I'm so against a `sandbox` directory! It's like keeping your trash bin in your house for ever in case there is something useful there. I used to to it all the time: I'd keep commented out code in my scripts... But I think it's a bad practice. We need to let go. The repository and the tagged versions should not include half-bake scripts and what not. I'm happy with a sandbox repository `Oceananigans.jl-sandbox` where we keep things. Or a `sandbox` branch even. Regarding this PR and what's should be kept in the Docs: I vote we keep the convergence tests in the docs and nuke the validations. I agree with the git history size issue and probably the method of including the `.png` files that @ali-ramadhan suggests would work -- I've never done it though.

Modifiability,"Oceananigans.jl supplies an interface for inserting user-defined functions into a model via `ContinuousForcing`, `DiscreteForcing`, `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` and `DiscreteBoundaryFunction`. User functions are also permitted as input to some model terms: turbulence closures, Stokes drift, etc, and can be used in diagnostics and AbstractOperations. It's often necessary or convenient to formulate user functions in terms of global variables. For, example, a Gaussian surface cooling might be written as. ```julia; patch_width = 200meters; patch_amplitude = 1e-8 # m^3 s^-2; cooling_patch(x, y, t) = patch_amplitude * exp(-(x^2 + y^2) / 2patch_width^2). cooling_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(cooling_patch); ```. Alas, this simple function will not compile on the GPU and is too slow on the CPU. To fix this, users need to declare `patch_width` and `patch_amplitude` as `const`:. ```julia; const patch_width = 200meters; const patch_amplitude = 1e-8 # m^3 s^-2; ```. For this problem, GPU scenario is a relatively happy one: `cooling_patch` will throw an error --- the ever-mysterious ""dynamic function invocation"" error --- but at least it will not run. On the CPU the situation is more insidious: the code will run, but slowly, leading to all sorts of issues: lost sleep, missed deadlines, wasted cluster credits, or abandonment of the Julia programming language. It'd be nice to recover the GPU situation on the CPU and throw an error (perhaps with the ability to opt-out) in this case --- or something. Here's a few possibilities (thanks @vchuravy!):. 1. Some utility in [JET.jl](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl), [JETTest.jl](https://github.com/aviatesk/JETTest.jl), or perhaps [GPUCompiler.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUCompiler.jl) (?!). 2. `Test.@inferred`:. ```julia; julia> using Test: @inferred. julia> a = 2; f(x) = a * x # non-const'd global --- bad!; f (generic function with 1 method). julia> const b = 2; g(x) = b * x # oh good, there's const; g (generic function with 1 method)",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1885:434,variab,variables,434,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1885,1,['variab'],['variables']
Modifiability,"Oh ya. This is solved for sure by `BuoyancyField`. Strictly speaking density is not constant. The Boussinesq equations are an asymptotic expansion around a constant density, in which only the first effect of variable density is retained (the gravitational acceleration such variations impart) and other effects are ignored. Due to this reduction of the equations of motion, however, the density cannot always be reconstructed. More over it is linearly related to buoyancy via. ```; density = reference_density * (1 - b / g); ```. where `b = BuoyancyField(model)` and `g = buoyancy.gravitational_acceleration` when `buoyancy::SeawaterBuoyancy`. Linear equations of state do not have `reference_density` (it is arbitrary); however `buoyancy` terms with nonlinear equations of state should use `buoyancy.equation_of_state.reference_density`.

Modifiability,"Ok @navidcy I've updated the parameters. For the sake of documentation: these parameters were obtained by calibrating CATKE against 5 LES from LESbrary's ""4 day suite"" at 8m resolution. The defaults are now the ""best"" parameters at the end of that calibration. The last iteration of the calibration produced these plots:. <img width=""687"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/155354710-33778efc-b52a-4fdb-a54d-e9ba97c4bda1.png"">. The blue line is the forward solution produced by a column model with CATKE using the best parameters. The TKE is a bit off, and the velocity profiles aren't ""perfect"" (still very good); but the buoyancy profiles are near perfect. I have some ideas for improving CATKE further, but it's going to take a bit of time. I think moving forward the right approach is to always use CATKE's default configuration for experiments. Then, whenever we update CATKE we'll take a new version. That way we can figure out what CATKE flavor we used by referencing the Oceananigans version. Also for documentation, here's a screenshot of the parameter values from the end of the calibration:. <img width=""1549"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/155355188-089d306f-32ae-46ed-a5e1-f70d3b16f4df.png"">.

We would need to have a type that indicates whether or not we should somehow truncate the `args` that are passed to `fill_halo_regions!` (in that generalization, the pattern on `main` would be the special case that all the args after the first 2 are discarded). ## Nota bene. A different solution one might invent would _copy_ `model.closure` and `model.buoyancy` into CATKE's `TKETopBoundaryConditionParameters`. The reason this doesn't work is that we support _changing_ the parameters of `model.closure` after creating the model. (This is a nifty feature that makes calibration a lot more efficient.)

Modifiability,"Okay, so I'm just gonna throw this out there: is it advantageous to migrate the Poisson solvers to a separate package (PoissonSolvers.jl)? It would be akin to the relationship between PencilFFTs.jl and PencilArrays.jl. I've been thinking about it for the past few days and I can see some pros:. - Separating the code can make Oceananigans easier to maintain:; - fewer things to test in every PR (the tests are becoming larger and larger and apparently we're starting to have backlogs on buildkite); - fewer lines/modules in general can make it easier to make sense of the code, especially for beginner users/contributors (in general the smaller the code base, the easier it is to attract contributors). Also having (brief) docs just for the solvers would be a very useful reference in general imho.; - Efficient Poisson solvers are hard to write and it's an art of their own since different BCs generally require different algorithms. With that said, having a separate package just for that might not only benefit the community (a quick google search for something like ""poisson solver julia"" shows that there's interest) but also it might make it easier for someone who needs a specific algorithm that we don't yet have to make a contribution that might help us.

Do you have any feedback on that? Partly, this was motivated by my own confusion with the API. (Note, we also discussed some internal changes like getting rid of `settings`.) One detail is that we shouldn't have to pass `grid` because the free surface already must be ""materialized"" on the model grid in order to allocate memory for fields. My opinion is that we _either_ should pass `grid` and cut out the materialization, or we should not pass `grid` and materialize under the hood.

That said, I think if we are able to specify the gradients of a field across a boundary it will likely be straightforward to extend that implementation to specifying fluxes.

Modifiability,"PJ Tuckman (@qwert2266) recently wrote a pretty sweet Julia script for doing automated parameter exploration with Slurm on Satori (see https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/JuicyMoons.jl/pull/14). The script itself can be found at: https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/JuicyMoons.jl/blob/pjt/enceladus-slurm/slurm/20201031ScriptCreator.jl (needs some refactoring and might have bugs). The automation was complicated by the fact that Satori only allows you 1 Slurm job (through which you can request 4 GPUs and cram 4 GPU simulations on one node) and there's a 12 hour time limit on all jobs. So the idea/hack we came up with was for the simulation scripts to touch a file to indicate they have checkpointed themselves and to touch another file to indicate they have reached steady state. The Julia script keeps creating and submitting Slurm scripts until all simulations have reached steady state (""checkpointed"" simulations are queued/scheduled again while simulation that have reached ""steady state"" are not queued/scheduled any more). The point of this issue is to discuss whether it makes sense to add an example/tutorial of automating parameter exploration with Slurm? The specific workflow discussed above is specific to Satori so it might not make sense to include it in the docs (might be more of an internal resource). We looked at ClusterManagers.jl but don't think it's super useful since we're working around only have 1 job, and we don't know what the next job will be until the 4 simulations crammed into the first job are done running.

Modifiability,"Pressure is different from other variables because it doesn't have a dedicated `compute!` function. I do actually think it would be nice to ""regularize"" the code in this way by making the pressure (and eddy diffusivities) into `KernelComputedField`s (or other kinds of special fields) so that `compute!` works on them in the same way it works on other `ComputedField`s. The reason it is different is because while we have always had pressure auxiliary variables, `ComputedField`s are only a relatively recent addition to the code. In fact, it hadn't even occurred to me that it would be nice if we could use `compute!(hydrostatic_pressure)` until recently. More on the top of this issue, there is a small difference between the two kernels: in one the reference density (which is otherwise arbitrary?) appears to be `1027` and in the other its `1024`.

Modifiability,"Probably not the best use of time to try to get `reverse` to work. But if someone is interested in looking further, we can see that `reverse` starts by building a new object with `copymutable`:. https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/d7dc9a8cc8f2aebf04d5cecc8625be250169644b/base/arraymath.jl#L59-L60. `copymutable` works correctly because it relies on 1) `similar` and 2) `copyto!`, both of which we define for `Field`. So that's nice, showing the power of extending those functions. The error that @siddharthabishnu finds occurs because we haven't defined `view` for `CartesianIndices`. This is used by `_reverse`:. https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/d7dc9a8cc8f2aebf04d5cecc8625be250169644b/base/arraymath.jl#L95. The fix is pretty easy I think. We simply need to extend `reverse!`:. ```julia; Base.reverse!(f::Field; dims=:) = reverse!(parent(f); dims); ```.

I'm not even sure if it's even possible to make this run fast and work on a GPU... We might have to compile something every time a new forcing function is created to move it away from `Main` and make it inline-able?. Initially the forcing is zero so Julia sees `Oceananigans.zero_func` which it presumably knows how to optimize away.

Modifiability,"Right now `SpecifiedTimes` is acting in a way different from its documentation. In addition to triggering a callback in the specified times, according to the docs, it's also triggering the callback in initialization. For example, the following MWE. ```julia; using Oceananigans. grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(4, 4, 4), extent=(1, 1, 1)); model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid); simulation = Simulation(model, Δt=1, stop_iteration=10). callback_func(sim) = @warn ""Function called in iteration $(sim.model.clock.iteration)""; simulation.callbacks[:cfl_changer] = Callback(callback_func, SpecifiedTimes([5, 10])). run!(simulation); ```. produces the following output. ```julia; [ Info: Initializing simulation...; ┌ Warning: Function called in iteration 0; └ @ Main ~/repos/Oceananigans.jl/sandbox/test_specified_times.jl:7; [ Info: ... simulation initialization complete (262.483 ms); [ Info: Executing initial time step...; [ Info: ... initial time step complete (28.766 seconds).; ┌ Warning: Function called in iteration 5; └ @ Main ~/repos/Oceananigans.jl/sandbox/test_specified_times.jl:7; [ Info: Simulation is stopping.

Modifiability,"Running a simulation with `FT=Float32` is fairly onerous because the number type has to be passed to a huge number of model components individually. Eg we need to write. ```julia; using Oceananigans; using SeawaterPolynomials: TEOS10EquationOfState. FT = Float32; grid = RectilinearGrid(FT, size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 1, 1)); coriolis = FPlane(FT, f=1); equation_of_state = TEOS10EquationOfState(FT); buoyancy = SeawaterBuoyancy(FT; equation_of_state); ```. Here are two ideas to make this easier:. ## Use an environment variable. For this we introduce an environment variable, say `OCEANANIGANS_NUMBER_TYPE`. Then we can write a small utility:. ```julia; function global_number_type(default=Float64); user_number_type = get(""OCEANANIGANS_NUMBER_TYPE"", ENV, nothing). if isnothing(user_number_type); FT = default; else; try; FT = eval(Symbol(user_number_type)); catch; error(""The environment variable OCEANANIGANS_NUMBER_TYPE=$user_number_type is not supported!""); end; end. return FT; end; ```. This also permits a script-based approach because users can write. ```julia; ENV[""OCEANANIGANS_NUMBER_TYPE""] = ""Float32"". grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 1, 1)); coriolis = FPlane(f=1); equation_of_state = TEOS10EquationOfState(); buoyancy = SeawaterBuoyancy(; equation_of_state); ```. ## Introducing an internal ""settings"" dictionary. Then users might write. ```julia; Oceananigans.settings[:default_number_type] = Float32; ```. This avoids the string-based restriction of environment variables, so may generalize to more types of settings should we need that. It's a slippery slope of course, we want to keep this to a minimum because global settings inhibit programmability (ie one cannot have multiple simulations in a single instance with different settings). Here, the setting only controls a default, so it remains possible to have two simulations in one instance with different number types --- they just cannot be set up simultaneously (or one has to do more work to set the num",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3800:521,variab,variable,521,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3800,3,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"Running the example to t = 100 rather than t=150 would yield a quick 2/3. I think we can also decrease the resolution and increase the time-step. The resolution also is not isotropic, which essentially wastes grid points. The x dimension is 2pi but y is width 20. So if we use Ny = 128 then we might as well use something like Nx = 64 or 48. Further decreasing the resolution would also help a lot, because the time steps could be increased. And I think the movie doesn't need to plot so many frames. I think the writing and notation can also be improved. It's confusing to use `L_z` to refer to the reference depth.

Modifiability,"So in summary, a future effort should take these steps:. 1. Write a function like `substepped_tracers(bgc::AbstractBiogeochemistry)` that can be extended by a hypothetical substepping BGC implementation.; 2. Prototype this concept by implementing a new (hopefully simple, one tracer) BGC model, and prototype the time-stepping algorithm that substeps the tracer forward during `update_biogeocemical_state!`. This should be easy to merge since it only requires defining the one new function `substepped_tracers` for skipping the tracer update. Furthermore, the prototype will demonstrate that the substepping is useful for a stiff problem, and will also develop a substepping scheme. Next, we can consider building an interface for doing the substepping itself, much like we have an interface for doing ordinary time-stepping. That will require a bit more design, but I think the initial prototype will give us a lot of information about the best way to go about it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3888#issuecomment-2455678251:145,extend,extended,145,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3888#issuecomment-2455678251,1,['extend'],['extended']

Modifiability,"So, I've been running some simulations with a bunch of diagnostics, which make the simulation slower. I think some of the diagnostics that I'm calculating are already being calculated by Oceananigans (like derivatives). If I understand correctly, in each of those cases Oceananigans calculates that variable once to get the tendencies and then does the same calculation again when for my diagnostics, which seems wasteful. Is it possible (or desirable) to create a way for the code not to do the calculation twice if the user wants that diagnostic specifically? Maybe pass options when creating the model like:. ```julia; model = IncompressibleModel(grid, computed_fields=(:dudz, :dvdz,)); ```; so that those fields get stored just like the velocity and the tracers do?.

Modifiability,"Some pretty promising Lagrangian particle tracking benchmarks!. Couple of takeaways (all assuming a model with 128^3 grid points and QAB2 time stepping):; 1. **Low overhead**: You can advect up to ~100,000 particles on the CPU and up to ~10,000,000 particles on a (Titan V) GPU before the model slows down by more than 30%.; 2. **Great on GPUs**: Seems that the GPU is great for advecting millions of particles. You can advect ~100,000,000 particles and your model only slows down by a factor of 4x. In this scenario, the GPU is ~620x faster than a single CPU core.; 3. Calculated using `(t_100000000 - t_0) / 100000000`, advecting a single particle on the CPU takes ~110 ns while on the GPU it only takes ~0.127 ns. This seems a little too good to be true but I'll double check this.

Modifiability,"Some recent improvements in `CUDA.jl`:. https://juliagpu.org/post/2022-01-28-cuda_3.5_3.8/#preserving_array_indices. attempt to avoid promoting index types from 32-bit to 64-bit integers (64-bit integers are Julia's default). Throughout `Oceananigans` we use 64-bit integers by using the constant `1` for index calculations:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9f6d841393094b123c99287fab7157a65db4d513/src/Operators/difference_operators.jl#L7. According to that blog post, changing the above line. ```julia; @inline δxᶜᵃᵃ(i, j, k, grid, u) = @inbounds u[i+0x1, j, k] - u[i, j, k] ; ```. may decrease register pressure (perhaps dramatically, especially for wide stencils with lots of indices). `0x1` is the integer 1 with type `UInt8`:. ```julia; julia> i = 0x1; 0x01. julia> typeof(i); UInt8. julia> i == 1; true. julia> i === 1; false; ```.

In Oceananigans.jl right now each component of the tensor diffusivity is calculated on-the-fly so the unapproximated tensor could end up being 2-4x more expensive to compute. We cannot compute the full tensor in one go (reusing the isopycnal slopes) and we may not want to since it takes up a lot of memory (9 extra field?). But maybe there's a good reason to not make the small-angle approximation? We could eventually support both (unapproximated and small-angle approximation). See https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phys_pkgs/gmredi.html#redi-scheme-isopycnal-diffusion for a comparison of the two. 2. Is GM-Redi the main parameterization of interest? Would people use the fully symmetric or the fully anti-symmetric diffusivity tensor by themselves?. If not then maybe we can save some time by just implementing one new closure, `GMRedi` or `GentMcWilliamsRedi`. If we take the isopycnal diffusivity to be the same for both the symmetric and anti-symmetric tensor then we the resulting tensor is quite cheap to compute (only 3 components) if performance is impo",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1492:87,parameteriz,parameterization,87,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1492,2,['parameteriz'],"['parameterization', 'parameterizations']"

We're pretty familiar with the code so we don't need files to be as neat or organized. But to a newcomer, a code base with a few long/dense files is much harder to understand, it's especially hard to figure out where to find stuff.

Modifiability,"Sorry about the GPU errors, they're much scarier than they look! Looks like a pretty involved setup so I'll let @glwagner comment on the setup. In this case it looks like Julia is complaining about an `unsupported dynamic function invocation (call to overdub)` in `Fxn_scale` at line 93. ```julia; @inline Fxn_scale(t) = spl_scale(t); ```. which itself is calling some kind of spline. ```julia; spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, df.scale, k=1) ; ```. Since these functions are going to be called in GPU kernels, I think everything used by these functions should be made locally available to the functions and any arrays need to be `CuArray`s. Just looking around your script it looks like `secs` is just a regular array when it should be a `CuArray` if you want to use it in a GPU kernel, e.g. as part of `UniformStokesDrift`. I think the `df` dataframe object might not be GPU-compatible (i.e. it's not `isbits` and has no Adapt.jl function) so you might not want to use the `df` variable inside GPU kernels. It looks like you mostly use numbers from `df` (?) so you could instead pull out what you need. ```julia; const secs = CuArray(...); const scale = CuArray(...); const spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, scale, k=1); @inline Fxn_scale(t) = spl_scale(t); ```. You might also need to make variables `const`, e.g. `const secs = ...` so that they can be accessed from the GPU kernels. There's also the question of whether these splines are GPU-compatible, i.e. do they do the right thing on the GPU when given `CuArray`s instead of regular `Array`s. Unfortunately not every Julia package is GPU-compatible and not always efficient if it falls back on CPU methods to deal with `CuArray`s. I notice you're using Dierckx.jl for splines, which looks like a wrapper around a Fortran library so that's not going to work inside a GPU kernel. The Julia GPU/CUDA compiler can only compile pure Julia code to run on GPUs. We can look around a bit to see if there's a better package unless Dierckx splines are essential to ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1317#issuecomment-767551660:917,Adapt,Adapt,917,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1317#issuecomment-767551660,2,"['Adapt', 'variab']","['Adapt', 'variable']"
Modifiability,"Sorry about the confusion @tomchor! Opening a new issue might actually be a good idea since it's true we currently only support a subset of the 3^3 = 27 possible topologies (I went ahead and quoted your post in this new issue). I actually might avoid using the `Flat` topology right now since until it's fully tested (see e.g. #1023). You can substitute `Bounded` for `Flat` and your simulation should do the same thing except it will take up some extra memory and slow down your model by a tiny bit. The functional difference is that halo regions have non-zero size along `Bounded` dimensions (and derivatives are computed along `Bounded` dimensions which will evaluate to zero unless you have some weird boundary conditions). Yeah currently the four supported topologies are:; 1. `(Periodic, Periodic, Periodic)`; 2. `(Periodic, Periodic, Bounded)`; 3. `(Periodic, Bounded, Bounded)`; 4. `(Bounded, Bounded, Bounded)` (unfortunately only works on the CPU, see #1007). We could support all possible topology combinations. The only bottleneck is implementing pressure solver that work for all topologies (see #586). This is on my current list of things to do but is not super trivial (see https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/issues/119 and possibly related #1170) so it's taking some time... 😅 .

Modifiability,"Sorry if I'm missing something obvious (still new with the working of Oceananigans/Julia), but I was trying to test this feature and expand it to `BuoyancyTracer` over the weekend and I wonder if this implementation can be made more general. . The way I understand @ali-ramadhan created some functions `g_x` to extract the gravity components in each direction and then used them in the `x_dot_g_b` functions to calculate each component of the gravity acceleration. The thing is that gravity can only be a vector using `SeawaterBuoyancy`. When trying to apply this to `BuoyancyTracer` I found that I'd need to replicate the same feature but with a different name (since, as @glwagner pointed out, `gravitational_acceleration` would be a confusing name when working directly with buoyancy). Also, if you also think issue https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1372 is relevant, it might be nice to have one unified word/approach for the tilting of the domain. So what do you guys think if this tilting is implement at the `AbstractBuoyancy` level? If I understand correctly all buoyancy types inherit that, right? That way we'd have a keyword for the tilt (maybe `tilt`, `gravitational_direction` or `gravity_projection`) that would default to `(0, 0, 1)` and a similar option could be given to `FPlane`, avoiding confusion.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1242#issuecomment-782900312:1100,inherit,inherit,1100,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1242#issuecomment-782900312,1,['inherit'],['inherit']

Modifiability,"Suggestions are definitely welcome for streamlining everything!. Note: in dedalus, this problem is handled by allowing users to accumulate parameters into something like `model.parameters` (in dedalus, this is essentially a dict whose keys are accessible by their names to any function/equation defined with a string expression). Having a ""global-like"" variable (like `model.parameters`) is pretty convenient, but also leads to more complicated code. The more democratic callable object strategy is a bit simpler and more modular, but may involve a slightly more complicated API (though I'm not 100% sure about that --- users must decide!)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/682#issuecomment-595948214:353,variab,variable,353,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/682#issuecomment-595948214,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"Summary of latest thoughts:. 1. Change `ParameterizedForcing` to `DiscreteForcing`.; 2. Change `SimpleForcing` to `ContinuousForcing`. Use the field name `ContinuousForcing.func` rather than `ContinuousForcing.forcing`. (This will then be consistent with `DiscreteForcing`.); 3. Change `field_in_signature` to more general a `depends_on` keyword. `ContinuousForcing` functions with dependent fields have the signature `f(x, y, z, t, field1, field2)`, where `depends_on=(:field1, :field2)`.; 4. Use assumed field locations (eg the names `u`, `v`, `w` are special and everything else is a tracer) to infer interpolating functions for the fields in `depends_on`. Move `AbstractOperations/interpolation_utils.jl` to `Operators` so they can be used in `Forcing/`.; 5. Implement a unified interface `Forcing` which permits the construction of both `ContinuousForcing` and `DiscreteForcing`.; 6. Change `ModelForcing` so that ""unwrapped"" inputs `forcing::Function` are automatically wrapped in `ContinuousForcing`. This means that unwrapped forcing functions are assumed to be functions of `x, y, z, t` (rather than a discrete forcing). Users that want to use discrete forcing must wrap their functions via `forcing = Forcing(func, discrete_form=true)`.; 7. Change the constructor for `IncompressibleModel` so that forcing functions are accepted via a `NamedTuple`, similar to boundary conditions. @ali-ramadhan thoughts?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/896#issuecomment-698312095:40,Parameteriz,ParameterizedForcing,40,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/896#issuecomment-698312095,1,['Parameteriz'],['ParameterizedForcing']

Modifiability,"Sure, we can talk about code design at the CliMa meeting. Let me summarize what we've discussed so far:. ## The current design. A ""boundary condition"" is a flux, gradient, or value of a field (`u`, `v`, `w`, `T`, `S`) at the end (`left`, `right`) in a given direction (`x`, `y`, `z`). ### Pros. * Generality: any boundary condition can be specified; * Similarity to the mathematics: this design corresponds to how boundary conditions are specified in PDEs; * Extensibility: the design accommodates changes in *types* of boundary conditions or changes in dimensionality. (Adding new solution variables requires code modification, but that is true throughout the code). ### Concerns. * It's more complicated than allowing only 3-4 possibilities to users; as @johncmarshall54 says:. > It's not obvious to me what a field boundary condition is, vs a coordinate boundary condition.; Fundamentally we are applying boundary conditions to u, v, w, T, and S fields, and that's it. It all seems a bit too complicated. * The hierarchical dependence of this design on parameterized types creates a lot of possibilities for different boundary conditions to be specified, and this is a concern for performance (@ali-ramadhan). * We aren't sure what to call the function (currently `bc.calc`) whose purpose is to return the value of the boundary condition (either the field value, flux, gradient, or whatever) at a given grid point and simulation time. ### Other miscellaneous thoughts. * This PR implements a backend / abstraction system for specifying boundary conditions. For users we can add as much sugar on top as we want. * As we have discussed, the way we implement boundary conditions is intimately connected to the way that we specify equations. This can be seen in the current code (though it is commented out) in that [the lines that specify a no-slip condition depend on the ""vertical viscosity""](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/7fb355d77df98e37a80b3e796291fa2856d3e1ce/src/time_",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/118#issuecomment-472372026:591,variab,variables,591,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/118#issuecomment-472372026,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"Thank you for the links !. The Oceananigans src code is very clearly written so the reading is relatively OK (I could use some explanations on your closure usage). If it was up to me I would prefer an extended documentation of GPUifyLoops ;) I only understand how it works by reading what you do with it. . The GPU shared memory is basically a programmable cache while the cache of CPU can't be (easily) controlled. In both cases there is cache so, if you compute multiple partial derivatives of a given (set of) field(s) (d/dx,d/dy, d2/dx2,...) once a block has been fetched in the cache then the memory operations are cheap. Cache is also useful for performing tiny transpositions enabling fast access and vectorized (SIMD) CPU or GPU ops in both X,Y or Z directions. . I hope that obtaining an efficient code for both (multicore SIMD) CPUs and GPUs maybe possible adjusting the (recursive?) block sizes (i.e. controlling the data layout and adapt it to the computing target). I will try to use part of your code to rewrite the toy 2D CFD solver I have translated from Matlab (https://discourse.julialang.org/t/asynchronous-makie/27127/9?u=laurentplagne).

Modifiability,"Thank you for the written explanation! Here are my comments:. > to split the bgc tendencies from the rest I needed a way to turn them off in the normal tendency computation, I did this by passing a keyword all the way through to biogeochemical_transitions - when I did it this way the intention was to touch as little of the existing code as possible, but it might not be the cleanest/most maintainable. I don't think we need to change anything in the existing kernels code. Instead, we can design an interface that allows biogeochemical models (like the models implemented in OceanBioME) to ""opt-in"" to a substepping scheme. In this design, there's no need to change the existing ""slow"" kernels I don't think. However, we could consider changing the name of them. For example, all that's needed is for the _implementation_ to know when to return a slow source term vs fast source term. > this is where I had to make some more changes to the existing code (and probably the messiest part of what I did), because the code often expects the tendencies to live at timestepper.G / $G^-$, so I made functions that dispatched on the timestepper and usually returned that, but for the new timestepepr returned timestepper.physics.G etc. I'm not sure that new tendencies are needed for substepping. The substepping scheme for CATKE manages to avoid allocating any additional tendencies by preserving the ""slow"" source term:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/6c40d7e225c2127051b2703b9c62a8b18260e3a5/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/TKEBasedVerticalDiffusivities/time_step_catke_equation.jl#L167-L171.

Modifiability,"Thank you for your feedback @maleadt! What is CUDAnative compilation? If you mean the precompilation phase when CUDAnative is first loaded, then it's not that as I start timing after all packages are loaded. I thought 6-7 minutes was normal/expected as @vchuravy et al. reported similar GPU compilation times for their shallow water model: https://github.com/JuliaLabs/ShallowWaterBench. I haven't done any rigorous benchmarking yet but out of those 6 minutes, ~1.5 minutes are spent on compiling code that creates CuFFT plans (the first plan takes 1.5 minutes then the others take <1 second). From watching the log I'm guessing the other 4.5 minutes are evenly split between setting up the model (creating CuArrays, initializing them, etc.) and the first time step (where the kernels are getting compiled presumably). I don't think we have that many kernels (just 5 bigger ones) but one of them; https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Oceananigans.jl/blob/2b64d584c79ece0429f2421335ddb6bc0c6c6663/src/time_steppers.jl#L213; has several layers of inlining (it's inlining the majority of the functions in [operators/ops_regular_cartesian_grid_elementwise.jl](https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Oceananigans.jl/blob/master/src/operators/ops_regular_cartesian_grid_elementwise.jl)) after which it probably balloons up to be a pretty big kernel. They also have tons of arguments crammed in as the structs I was passing weren't `isbitstype` (working on this #59). I should come back and update this issue once we do some proper benchmarking (note to self: nvprof seems like it's being deprecated in favor of Nsight). Caching kernels between sessions sounds tough but will definitely look into timing compilations in CUDAnative, might provide some insight on how to speed things up.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/66#issuecomment-466847765:1030,layers,layers,1030,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/66#issuecomment-466847765,1,['layers'],['layers']
Modifiability,"Thanks @Mikejmnez , that is helpful. Any model can do this but I suspect that using `IncompressibleModel` in 2D is probably the best place to start. It is essentially equal to the 2D vorticity equation and does allow for variable shear flow. . I'm guessing you want to start off with a sinusoidal shear and add on a perturbation and see how things evolve?

Modifiability,"Thanks @glwagner and @ali-ramadhan for your suggestions. They all sound very interesting and gives me a lot to think about. Here are my initial reactions. Given that I don't know the numerics of Oceananigans, yet, but know the physics, I can imagine myself contributing to the following pretty quickly:. 1. Shallow Water model (and maybe even a Green-Naghdi version) with several layers for fun.; 2. Layered and stratified Quasi-Geostrophic Model; 3. Hydrostatic Boussinesq Model (rigid lid first and then a free-surface). Something that I can imagine giving to good undergraduate research students would be. 4. Verticall-Implicit time-stepping for diffusion. ; 5. Profiling parallelism. If I had keen student in computer science then maybe . 6. Distributed parallelism with MPI. . I have never used GPU's before but given the efficiency of GPU's vs CPU's that you have in the docs, I am definitely going to learn. Initial thougths on 1 and 2:; I know that FourierFlows has both QG and SW, which are spectrally based. I gather that Oceananigans is Finite Volume based. If I wanted to start with either of these would you suggest I start wtih FourierFlows or ignore that?. I kind of like the idea of having a QG code that can either be FV or Spectral, depending on the users whims, but that might be difficult, depending on how compatable these two libraries are.

Modifiability,"Thanks @glwagner for the help. Much appreciated. I tried to adapt it and the good news is that I don't get an error. The bad news is that I don't think the boundary conditions are being set correctly. . Below are a few ideas of things I think I need to do. Maybe you can confirm whether I understand this correctly?. - You had it set up for the sponge to depend on x but if I want the inflow and outflow to be in the south and north, respectively, then it should depend on `y`, right?; - `smoothed_step_mask` is currently only acting on the south. I pressume I need to add a similar function for the north?; - Do I need to have a sponge on `h` as well? I thought imposing this on `vh` might be enough in the case when the flow doesn't vary in the zonal direction. I imagine if I want inflow from the west only, which I do want, and the meridonal velocity depends on the zonal coordiante, then I should pick the sponge to relax to a geostrophically balanced state.; - Even though I am trying to set the inflow/outflow boundary conditions to `vh -> h` so that `v -> 1`, when I look at the final matrix, I have that `vh` is zero everywhere. This tells me that the boundary conditions are not being set. It does seem to say that `vh` does have `NormalFlow` boundary conditions so that seems like something is right. ```; using Oceananigans; using Oceananigans.Grids; using Oceananigans.Models; using Oceananigans.ImmersedBoundaries: ImmersedBoundaryGrid, GridFittedBoundary. using Oceananigans.BoundaryConditions: NormalFlow. grid = RegularRectilinearGrid(size=(64, 64),; x=(-10, 10), y=(0, 5),; topology=(Periodic, Bounded, Flat)). bump(x, y, z) = y < exp(-x^2); grid_with_bump = ImmersedBoundaryGrid(grid, GridFittedBoundary(bump)). damping_rate = 1/100 # relax fields on a 100 second time-scale; const y0 = 0 # center point of sponge; const dy = 1.0 # sponge width; smoothed_step_mask(x, y, z) = 1/2 * (1 + tanh((y - y0) / dy)). vh_sponge = Relaxation(rate=damping_rate, mask=smoothed_step_mask, target",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1730#issuecomment-852653935:60,adapt,adapt,60,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1730#issuecomment-852653935,1,['adapt'],['adapt']

Modifiability,"Thanks @tomchor for your feedback. It is greatly apprecaited. For the first point, I completely appreciate that we need to be clear. This can be done in the docstrings but it is certainly nice to pick variable names that are intuitive and make the code easier to read. I think Oceananigans does this very well and I very much want to continue in this direction. . I wonder if something like `zF_stretch` might do the trick? The `zF` suggests the result will be at faces and `stretch` suggests that this is a stretching of some kind. Or maybe `z_Faces_stretched`?. I am sorry if I mispoke. I did not mean to say that users do not care about what kind of stretched grid we use. This is clearly not the case. What I wanted to say is that a beginning user probably would be more concerned about having a stretched grid and probably not so much of the details. Some users would of course care a great deal about the kind of grid, and we definitely want to help both kinds of users. I agree with @glwagner 's suggestion of us supply a few basic examples for people to use, as a starting point. Users should certainly be able to take these examples, build on them, and build whatever kind of stretched grid they want. This is currently available and this should always be the case. When defining our examples we should not only define the region (or regions where we want it stretched, as it shouldn't only have to be one spot), but also the degree to which it decays. I don't necessarily have the language to describe this accurately now, but when putting together a sample function/array, I think a lot of this will beome clearer (to me at least).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1544#issuecomment-813565145:201,variab,variable,201,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1544#issuecomment-813565145,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"Thanks for the feedback! We were also thinking that if the ocean and atmosphere shared the same vertical indexing then maybe using some shared parameterizations would be easy but as pointed out, vertical indexing isn't necessarily a rigid thing in DG. Also sounds like the ocean and atmosphere don't need to agree as they're arbitrary decisions anyways. Interesting point about setting the vertical index to be the fastest running index to help speed up vertical integrals.

Modifiability,"Thanks for the help guys. I also agree with @francispoulin that plotting the mask would make it very helpful! . Here are some thought that I had that might be worth discussing:. 1 - Sponge layers (afaik) should only alter the NS equations in a finite part of the domain, right? Otherwise, even far from the relaxed edge, you're not really solving the NS equations --- it's being modified by an extra unphysical forcing. So one question is: is this really the behavior you want your sponge layer to have? (And here I'm assuming you're using relaxation as a synonym for sponge, because that's what the docs imply.); 2 - The nomenclature is kinda misleading, because `width`, coupled with the wording used in the docs really makes one believe that the effects of the relaxation function are confined to a layer of width `width`. For a reference, here's what's written on the docs:. > We illustrate usage of mask and target by implementing a sponge layer that relaxes velocity fields to zero and restores temperature to a linear gradient in the bottom 1/10th of the domain.

Modifiability,"Thanks for the questions @simone-silvestri . I'll answer them here as it's probably easier for the discussion. **Q1**: You can certainly solve the equations in the non-conservative form and the method should work. But it does't have any advantages compared to other methods: i.e. doesn't help with conserving anything and does not easily extend to other geometries. **Q2**: The pressure term in the momentum equation is ` 1/\rho_0 \nabla p`. In the case of a rigid lid we have that `p` is the surface pressure. I thought that redefining pressure with ` p/\rho_p -> p` might be easier, to get rid of the constant, but it's easy enough to include the coefficent. We should continue to do whatever Oceananigans is currently doing, and I thought it was absorving the constant density, but I could be wrong. **Q3**: In the shallow water model with a free-surface the pressure is always hydrostatic, `p = p_0 + g \rho_0 (h - z)`, where `h` is the total depth. The case of a rigid lid is a bit different since we just have the surface pressure `p`. You are correct that the free-surface shallow water model is very similar to the 3D compressible Euler equations. The free-surface SW is a compressible model, which is why we don't have to solve any elliptic problem, and instead we simply integrate the three prognostic equations. . The rigid-lid SW model (which we don't have yet) is different of course. I am sure we can use the existing solves to determine the surface pressure as the hydrostatic model currently does. Here are some thoughts to consider:. 1. Introducing topography is pretty easy but when we do so, we should probably introduce a free-surface. Following the convention of the hydrostatic model seems like the way to proceed. Agreed?; 2. Visosity is not difficult to include but there's a question of which form of viscosity to include. The standard harmonic or biharmonic diffiusivities would be good choices, where they act on the velocities not the transport velocities.

Modifiability,"That could work --- though I'd point out that listing the model components that can be inconsistent with one another might be more explicit. I would advocate for a ""blacklisting"" method whereby blacklisted combinations of components are listed local to the implementation of the component. For example, in `beta_plane.jl` we could add. ```julia; validate_coriolis(::BetaPlane, ::AbstractGrid{FT, TX, <:Periodic}) where {FT, TX} = # error; ```. we also need, in `hydrostatic_spherical_coriolis.jl`,. ```julia; validate_coriolis(::HydrostaticSphericalCoriolis, ::AbstractRectilinearGrid) = # error; ```. I think a warning is better than an error for `WENO5` on a curvilinear grid. That'd be a fun scheme to experiment with and we don't know ""how wrong"" it is. If the curvilinear grid is almost regular, we have reason to think it might work. In cases like these where we aren't completely, rock-solid positive that a certain model configuration is invalid I think we should also err conservative and allow such models to be constructed. . We do need to strike a balance between being helicopter parents to users, and catching common mistakes.

Modifiability,"That's a good point @glwagner - I think it's a mix of CI tests and more involved experiments. Some of these can be easily integrated in to CI since they are very cheap to run. A one level wind-driven gyre should take only a few minutes of run time to equilibrate sufficiently. Full simulations from option 3 are almost certainly too heavy for CI (unless there are plans afoot to use external resources for CI). These sort of simulations are more likely to be run occasionally and interrogated by real eyeballs. Having said that, you could setup CI to run a few time steps and compare the output with blessed output - this is what MITgcm does for its CI tests. This comes with a couple of advantages:; - the tests are useful setups for people to start using; and; - because they run regularly (for at least a few time steps) you know when the examples break.

Modifiability,"The advection-like Coriolis scheme was a non-sequitur because `f` is a very regular field, so upwinding it was just decreasing performance without a significative increase in quality of the simulation. On the other hand, upwinding `u` is very much discouraged because the energy builds up rapidly (by upwinding the velocity the divergence of the reconstructed tangential velocity is not a direct interpolation of the divergence of the original velocity, which is a necessary condition to maintain the algorithm stable). The only thing I can think to increase the order of velocity interpolation in the Coriolis force is to use a centered high-order scheme to interpolate velocity, but that would not help with the noise since a centered scheme is dispersive in nature. . I converted this PR to implement a `WetPointCoriolisScheme` (described in [Numerical boundary layers and spurious residual flows](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JC091iC09p10621)). ; This is just a simple addition to an enstrophy conserving scheme where edge (""dry"") points are neglected in the interpolation of the velocity in the tangential direction.

Modifiability,"The convention we use for the other variables stored on faces is that our ""interior"" data spans from `i=1` to `i=N`. Thus we call the `i=N+1` a ""halo point"" for fields on faces, even though it really is not (its on the boundary, see #455). . In addition, we use a convention that face indices are ""left"" of cell indices. Thus `iFace=1` corresponds to the ""left"" boundary of the domain. `iCell=N` is the rightmost cell in the domain; and `iFace=N+1` corresponds to the rightmost boundary. Why do you want ""direct"" access to the surface at `k=Nz`? Can you explain why you want this? This is confusing to me and I don't see why we would want to have an odd and surprising convention for the vertical coordinate. The fact is simply that the face at `i=N` is a very concrete and real place. It lies in the interior of the domain, to the left of the cell point `i=N`.

Modifiability,"The equations of motion for most or all major ocean modeling software are implemented using a ""Generalized Vertical Coordinate"" (GVC). Generalized vertical coordinates contain a ""fixed z"" coordinate as a limiting case, but generalize to vertical coordinates that. * Are fixed in time but conform to topographic variations (`σ` coordinates);; * Vary in time in a diagnostic manner (for example, _z-star_ coordinates, which vary with the sea surface displacement);; * Vary in time according to some prognostic equation (fully Lagrangian isopycnal coordinates, semi-Lagrangian hybrid coordinates / _z-tilde_ coordinates that vary only with high frequency motion, and adaptive methods that prescribe GVC dynamics to obtain favorable properties like concentration in regions of strong stratification). A fully general GVC typically also requires a ""Lagrangian remapping"" step to avoid extreme grid distortions in regions of persistent vertical velocities. The implementation of GVC is likely a major refactoring of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` because it will change the equations of motion and could even potentially change the nature of its prognostic variables. For time-dependent GVC, tracer equations must be reformulated in terms of the ""thickness-weighted"" tracer concentration, which in our case means the tracer concentration normalized by the local grid spacing. This could mean either using the thickness-weighted tracer conservation as a state variable, or it could mean rewriting the time-stepping algorithm so that unweighted tracer conservation can be updated according to the conservation of thickness-weighted tracer. A preliminary roadmap towards GVC in `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is. 1. Introduce `AbstractVerticalCoordinate` and refactor the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` to integrate thickness-weighted equations.

Modifiability,"The intention of this PR is to extend the capability of `FieldTimesSeries` such that it can be used in time-dependent boundary conditions and forcing. This PR develops over 2 main points, but it is still a work in progress so suggestions are welcome. 1) Allow writing down files with `set!`ing the `OnDisk` flavor of a field time series so that it aligns with the format of our jld2 output writer. In this way, it is possible to easily format BC from different file types (such as binary or text) to be used with Oceananigans. ; An example of this is:; ```julia; grid = LatitudeLongitudeGrid(size = (16, 16, 10), latitude = (-60, -40), longitude = (-10, 10), z = (0, 1)); u = XFaceField(grid); fts = FieldTimeSeries{location(u)...}(grid, 1:100, backend = OnDisk(), path = ""testfile.jld2"", name = ""u""); for i in 1:length(fts.times); set!(u, 2i); set!(fts, u, i); end; ```; This will generate a file called `testfile.jld2` with the following structure; ```; julia> f = jldopen(""testfile.jld2""); JLDFile /Users/simonesilvestri/development/Oceananigans.jl/testfile.jld2 (read-only); ├─📂 serialized; │ └─🔢 grid; └─📂 timeseries; ├─📂 u; │ ├─🔢 1; │ ├─📂 serialized; │ │ ├─🔢 location; │ │ └─ ⋯ (2 more entries); │ └─ ⋯ (99 more entries); └─📂 t (100 entries); ```; which can be easily read by the other field time series types. 2) To do linear interpolation we need at least 2 fields in memory, so `OnDisk` will not do. On the other hand, we might not want _all_ fields in memory as if we are dealing with forcings that might overwhelm the memory (especially on the GPU). So the proposal is to implement a `Chunked` abstraction that only keeps in memory a ""chunk"" of the data. The details of this implementation are still open do be decided, especially if we want an automatic update of the chunk if we index into an index not existing in memory or if we want the user to be responsible in updating the data in memory through something like a callback; ```julia; julia> fts3 = FieldTimeSeries(""testfile.jld2"", ""u",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3233:31,extend,extend,31,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3233,1,['extend'],['extend']

Modifiability,"The main contribution of this pull request is a refactor of the function `time_step!` and related functions to reduce code duplication and improve readability. There is now a function called `time_step_kernel!` that dispatches on the value of its first argument (provided by `model.metadata`) to execute on the CPU or GPU. A `Model` constructor is now provided in which all important information can be input via keyword arguments. I favor this kind of design for fluids codes because I believe it improves the understand-ability of scripts, as it encourages explicit naming of parameters passed into the `Model` constructor. The output writing functionality has also been refactored slightly. However, many more changes will be made in the future so this is not consequential. I also reduced the computational burden of a few of the tests, and changed to factor of 2 resolutions since this makes sense for FFTs (though relatively unimportant for testing, I think should encourage users to use powers of 2 and make a habit of using them ourselves). A few more notes:. * We need tests for output writers, and the output writing functionality needs to be revamped; * The model constructor needs work; * The examples are outdated.

So now I've added a test that makes sure that forcing functions don't crash when used in a CPU or GPU model (one with and one without `const`).,MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/388:128,variab,variable,128,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/388,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"The objective of this PR is to more clearly and quickly advertise the setting up of Oceananigans models in more than one configuration. We currently have one ""quickstart"", which sets up `NonhydrostaticModel` to do decaying turbulence. I propose that we add two more for `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`: a rectangular configuration (say baroclinic adjustment) and a spherical configuration, maybe with bathymetry. I think we should also change defaults to grease the wheels a bit. So this PR will change the free surface to split explicit. I also think we should use WENO advection schemes and increase the default halo size to (4, 4, 4) so that 5th order WENO works on immersed boundary grid. Basically, I think the default should be useful: second-order advection with nothing closure is not useful. . I'd also like to add the quick start setups to the docs, in addition to the README.

Modifiability,"The reason that the advection term is the only term account for is because this is typically what one wants. If you want diffusion to act on the entire temperature profile (not just the perturbation), then perhaps you shouldn't use a background field at all. Instead you should initialize the temperature to `T(z) = N^2 * z + T'(z)` where `T'(z)` is the perturbation and evolve the entire temperature field. This is more correct anyways... Background fields are useful when one wants to consider either some kind of (implicit) forcing that maintains the background field, preventing it from evolving. If we include a diffusion term associated with the background field, then we defeat much of the purpose of having a background field feature in the first place. The same is true for boundary conditions. One important use case for background fields is when we can set up a problem where the perturbation is periodic even though the background is not. In that scenario the total field is not periodic, and we could not use a periodic domain. Enter `BackgroundFields`: decomposing the solution into background + perturbation allows us to model the perturbation in a periodic domain with periodic boundary conditions. If the periodic boundary condition were defined as a boundary condition on the total (background + perturbation), then we wouldn't be able to achieve this important case.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3568#issuecomment-2081949716:371,evolve,evolve,371,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3568#issuecomment-2081949716,1,['evolve'],['evolve']

Modifiability,"The way I implemented it, the matrix ""constructors"" are saved in the solver without the variable diagonal term. Basically the constructors include all the terms except for the term that varies with the time step which is saved in `solver.diagonal`. ; i.e. the `Dᵢⱼₖ` in; ```; Axᵢ₊₁ ηᵢ₊₁ + Axᵢ ηᵢ₋₁ + Ayⱼ₊₁ ηⱼ₊₁ + Ayⱼ ηⱼ₋₁ + Azₖ₊₁ ηₖ₊₁ + Azₖ ηⱼ₋₁ ; - 2 ( Axᵢ₊₁ + Axᵢ + Ayⱼ₊₁ + Ayⱼ + Azₖ₊₁ + Azₖ ) ηᵢⱼₖ ; + ( Cᵢⱼₖ + Dᵢⱼₖ/Δt^2 ) ηᵢⱼₖ = b; ```. Every time that the time step changes this is the operation that is performed:; ```; constructors = deepcopy(solver.matrix_constructors); M = prod(solver.problem_size); update_diag!(constructors, arch, M, M, solver.diagonal, Δt, 0); solver.matrix = arch_sparse_matrix(arch, constructors) ; ```. So the matrix is constructed from a copy of the updated constructors. In this way there is no need to subtract anything to the diagonal because `solver.matrix_constructors` does not include the diagonal term. . `update_diag!` adds `Dᵢⱼₖ/Δt^2` to the diagonal elements. . If you want to do the something analogous with the linear operation, remove the time dependent term from it. Then add it separately with `update_diag!` every time the time step changes. Of course you want to make sure that you have elements in your diagonal, non trivial if `Cᵢⱼₖ` because a sparse matrix removes 0 elements. check out this function ; `ensure_diagonal_elements_are_present!(sparse_matrix)`",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2396#issuecomment-1179415403:88,variab,variable,88,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2396#issuecomment-1179415403,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"There is a mismatch between what the docstring of the `RectilinearGrid` claims for what the metrics (e.g., `Δxᶜᵃᵃ` or `Δxᶠᵃᵃ`) are and what the metrics actually correspond to. The docstring says that, e.g., `Δxᶜᵃᵃ` is the distances between cell centers. I think this is wrong. First of all, this is not uniquely defined as, e.g., the distance between a cell center and the adjacent cell centers may be different on each side of the cell. I believe that `Δxᶜᵃᵃ` is, instead, the length of the corresponding cell that is centered at `caa`, _or equivalently_, is the distances between the adjacent faces of each cell's center.

Modifiability,"Thinking about this more, I think it would make sense to make an even more radical change. I think we should add `diagnostics`, `output_writers`, and `clock` to `Simulation`. . The `time_step!` function then performs a single time-step, whereas to run a simulation one should write `run!(simulation)`, which handles diagnostics, output writing, adaptive time-stepping, and logging in an integrated way. This orthogonalizes the design a bit: `diagnostics` and `output_writers` are not really aspects of a ""model"", if we use a narrow interpretation of a model as a discrete representation of a physical system. A single physical system might conceivably be associated with a wide range of disparate diagnostics and output, depending on what kind of science is being done. I think scripts become clearer. The user writes. ```julia; model = Model(; model_parameters...). simulation = Simulation(model; simulation_parameters...). simulation.diagnostics[:diag] = # something. run!(simulation); ```. As an example to illustrate why `Simulation` is orthogonal to `Model`, here's a possible clear and coherent usage of this separation:. ```julia; model = Model(; model_parameters...). set!(model; first_interesting_initial_condition...). first_simulation = Simulation(model, first_simulation_parameters...); first_simulation[:diag] = diag_specific_to_first_simulation; run!(first_simulation). set!(model; second_interesting_initial_condition...) # same physical model, but different starting initial condition... no new memory allocated, no recompilation --- fast. second_simulation = Simulation(model, second_simulation_parameters...); second_simulation[:diag] = diag_specific_to_second_simulation; run!(second_simulation); ```.

Modifiability,"This PR adds Lagrangian particle tracking for incompressible models. You construct `LagrangianParticles` by passing in a bunch of x, y, z coordinates as 1D arrays (`xs`, `ys`, `zs`) when constructing an incompressible model:. ```julia; model = IncompressibleModel(grid = grid, ..., particles = LagrangianParticles(x=xs, y=ys, z=zs)); ```. then the particles are advected with the flow at every time step (i.e. online particle advection). If arrays are used for `x`, `y`, `z` then I think you should be able to add/remove/birth/kill/breed/split/combine/beach/teleport/etc. particles at any time since arrays are mutable and the type signature of the `LagrangianParticles` won't change. In a futue PR we might want to add `LagrangianParticles` parameters, forcing functions (?), and callafters so that particle properties can be tracked, evolved, and interacted with tracers to model biogeochemistry (https://github.com/JuliaOcean/PlanktonIndividuals.jl) or play ecological games (https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/lagrangian-microbes). Right now I suppose it only advects particles using forward Euler. Using the model's RK3 for particle advection would double (or triple?) the memory usage of the particle tracker as we would have to store previous tendencies (velocities). I wonder if the accuracy of forward Euler is acceptable for Lagrangian particle tracking. I'm also wondering whether it makes sense to support both forward Euler and RK3 in case you want to advect a huge number of particles and memory is limiting the amount of particles you can track? I guess you can do RK3 or RK4 inside the `advect_particles!` kernel but it would assume that the velocity field is constant between stages. Perhaps a convergence test is needed to answer these questions.

Modifiability,"This PR adds a GPU-enabled `CompressibleModel`, developed with @thabbott and @RaphaelRR in a separate repository (https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Atmosfoolery.jl). This is a large PR and I'm not even sure if it makes sense to merge it into Oceananigans.jl. The main purpose of opening this PR is to document progress made and ultimately decide on what to do with this feature. I don't think I can continue working on it. # Description. The compressible model implements the conservative Scheme by Satoh (2003), suitable for compressible non-hydrostatic models with moist processes, and is valid in the limit of a condensable gas/atmosphere with multiple moist species. Two choices of prognostic thermodynamic variables are available, internal energy and entropy, although in the Oceananigans spirit adding new thermodynamic variables is pretty easy!. @thabbott implemented the Satoh (2003) equation set. I initially implemented the Klemp et al. (2007) equation set which is only valid in the limit of a dry atmosphere with trace amounts of moist species. An RK3 time-stepper is used that is apparently 3rd-order accurate for linear terms but only 2nd-order accurate for non-linear terms. This is because it's developed to allow for acoustic time stepping between RK stages. This split-explicit time-stepping scheme is described by Wicker & Skamarock (2002), Klemp et al. (2007), and Satoh (2003). It's essentially the same one used by the NCAR WRF model (Skamarock et al., 2019). No acoustic time stepper is implemented yet. Explicit acoustic time stepping could make sense for regular Cartesian grids while a vertically implicit acoustic time stepper would make sense for vertically stretched grids (possible with `Oceananigans.Solver.BatchedTridiagonalSolver`). Building the compressible model on top of Oceananigans.jl has allowed it to run on GPUs and make use of the same operators, grids, Coriolis terms, forcing function and boundary conditions, diagnostics, output writers, higher-order advect",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1079:709,variab,variables,709,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1079,2,['variab'],['variables']
Modifiability,"This PR adds a benchmarking script that times how long a single time step takes on the CPU and GPU using `Float32` and `Float64` for various model resolutions. It uses TimerOutputs.jl to nicely format the benchmarks. It also prints out CPU->GPU speedups and Float64->Float32 ""speedups"". It only executes the GPU benchmarks if executed on a CUDA-enabled machine. We can later extend it to time model initialization, different parts of the time stepping, etc. Right now it only benchmarks a simple ""static ocean"" configuration so no fancy forcing functions are used, but we can extend the number of scenarios/experiments we benchmark. The time stepping and Poisson solver still takes the same amount of time whether the ocean is static or active. Resolves #67. Well, kind of. It's not clear to me how to easily incorperate this with CI in a way that doesn't involve one of us eyeballing the text output.

Modifiability,"This PR adds a new function `accurate_cell_advection_timescale` that is used to compute CFL at every grid point then reduced to find the maximum (which is the correct way as discussed in #1201). It will allow us to use the `TimeStepWizard` for adaptive time-stepping on all grids. I'll also extend it to `ShallowWaterModel` before merging. So it works great and scales well on the CPU but not so well on the GPU (see below). At 256^3, `cfl(model)` takes as long as ~5 time steps. Is this something we want to merge? If we don't want to slow down adaptive time-stepping for existing models we could just export `accurate_cell_advection_timescale` so that adaptive time-stepping with accurate CFL is opt-in, e.g. via an `AccurateTimeStepWizard` or something. Motivation for using Tullio.jl:. Originally I tried just using `mapreduce` but couldn't get it to work without a nested `mapreduce` which would trigger tons of kernel launches: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/is-it-possible-to-do-a-mapreduce-with-multiple-arrays-while-broadcasting-over-so/57433. Then I found out about Tullio.jl (super neat package we might want to use more) which allows us to compute CFL and reduce it down elegantly, however, reducing to one scalar does not currently work so I have to reduce the 3D CFL calculation to a 1D vector: https://github.com/mcabbott/Tullio.jl/issues/91.

This major change to the API is crucial for supporting a clean, simple API for grid metrics stored in arrays (all cases except the edge case of a fully regular grid). In the new API, both the architecture and floating point type are exclusive properties of `grid`. In addition this change will simplify the construction of models on distributed architectures and will eliminate the need for special model constructors for that case. Ultimately, we hope to go beyond this change to support just three grids:. 1. `RectilinearGrid`; 2. `LatitudeLongitudeGrid`; 3. `OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid`. In the first two cases, ""regularity"" is established if the grid metrics are numbers (rather than arrays or functions).

In the case of partial overlaps on curvilinear grids, the volumes of the overlaps are approximated and thus the regridding is not perfectly conservative.

The vertical momentum equation in `NonhydrostaticModel` is. $$ \partial_t w = - \partial_z p + b + G_w' $$. where $G_w'$ collects the contributions to the vertical momentum tendency other than pressure gradient and buoyancy. Prior to this PR, the kinematic pressure $p$ is decomposed into (note that in this Boussinesq formulation, a hydrostatic component has already been removed from $p$) . $$ p = p_h' + p_n $$. with the hydrostatic anomaly $p_h'$ defined by. $$ p_h' = - \int^0_z b \mathrm{d} z $$. Using the hydrostatic pressure anomaly eliminates buoyancy from the vertical momentum equation, such that. $$ \partial_t w = - \partial_z p_n + G_w' $$. Buoyancy forces enter the dynamics via horizontal gradients of the hydrostatic pressure anomaly. For example, x-gradient of the kinematic pressure becomes. $$ \partial_x p = \partial_x p_h' + \partial_x p_n $$. This decomposition is advantageous for two reasons. First, in a hydrostatic model the vertical momentum equation reduces to the equation for $p_h'$. This means that switching from a hydrostatic to non-hydrostatic model is particularly simple given this decomposition. Second --- and this must be evaluated --- it's possible to carefully control the evaluation of the hydrostatic integral so that a resting stratified fluid remains at rest, even in the presence of complex bathymetry. When we use the ""MITgcm algorithm"" we achieve this perfectly, even with partial cell bathymetry. This PR proposes to eliminate the pressure decomposition so that there is only one pressure.

Modifiability,"This PR enhances the convecting plankton example to simulate nonlinear plankton dynamics embedded in transient convection with a time-dependent, decreasing buoyancy flux. . As described by [Taylor and Ferrari (2011)](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.2011.56.6.2293), turbulence shuts down shortly after the surface buoyancy flux vanishes, precipitating a ""bloom"" of phytoplankton in the well-mixed, nutrient-rich waters. This is a canonical model for the spring bloom of phytoplankton. I was worried these changes dilute the pedagogical potential of this example, but ultimately decided that the changes are minor enough that it's worth it for the great increase of relevancy of this problem to oceanography. The main additional complications are the ""nonlinearization"" of the plankton dynamics (which now depend on the local plankton concentration), and the addition of time-dependent rather than constant buoyancy flux.

Modifiability,"This PR extends the capability of our ""conditional computation"" framework wherein the ""re-calculation"" of expensive diagnostics and computations may be avoided if possible. Previously, expensive field recalculations were avoided *only* at the outermost level (if the field were used directly in output), which in hindsight doesn't seem very useful since we often average or otherwise reduce expensive calculations for output (if we were not reducing an expensive calculation, we could simply calculate it offline). Avoiding recalculation for field ""dependencies"" requires adding a third function for field computation: we now have `compute_at!(field, time)`, `conditional_compute!(field, time)`, and `compute!(field, time)`. `compute_at!(field, time)` is the outermost function called by `fetch_output`. It falls back to `compute!(field)`. Fields opt-in to conditional computation by overloading `compute_at!`; for example, `ComputeField` implements. ```julia; compute_at!(field::ComputedField{X, Y, Z, <:FieldStatus}, time) where {X, Y, Z} = conditional_compute!(field, time); ```. Thus `ComputedField`s that have a `field.status` which is not `Nothing` are _conditionally_ computed. But if `field.status === nothing`, the computed field is always recomputed. The function `conditional_compute!(field, time)` examines `field.status` to determine whether a field has already been computed at `time` or not. If the field has been computed, it does nothing. If the field has not been computed, then `compute!(field, time)` is called, and `field.status.time` is updated. Conditionally computed fields must define a function `compute!(field, time=nothing)` that takes an optional positional argument `time`. This ensures that both `compute!(field)` and `compute!(field, time)` are available. Finally, fields that depend on other fields should call `compute_at!(dependency, time)` on all field dependencies.

Modifiability,"This PR extends the implementation of `IsotropicDiffusivity` to accept `AbstractField`s (such as `ComputedField`) as diffusivities and viscosities. Using this implementation with `model.velocities` or `model.tracers` requires that users instantiate the velocity and tracer fields prior to building the model. The test provided with this PR gives an example:. ```julia; arch = CPU(); grid = RegularCartesianGrid(size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 2, 3)) . tracer_names = (:T, :S, :c) ; u, v, w = velocities = VelocityFields(arch, grid); T, S, c = tracers = TracerFields(arch, grid, tracer_names). ν = @at (Cell, Cell, Cell) u^2 * ∂z(T); κ = @at (Cell, Cell, Cell) S * c * sin(T). closure = IsotropicDiffusivity(ν = ComputedField(ν),; κ = ComputedField(κ)). model = IncompressibleModel(architecture=arch, grid=grid, closure=closure,; velocities=velocities, tracers=tracers); ```. A major gotcha with this implementation is that users _must_ pass the velocity and tracer fields on to `IncompressibleModel` (or the prescribed viscosity will be meaningless. We should probably also ensure that diffusivities-as-`Field`s are located at `Cell, Cell, Cell`, as the viscous and diffusive flux operators assume. A way we can prevent this error is to check that `ComputedField` viscosities or diffusivities contain references to `model.velocities` or `model.tracers`. However, this could --- in principle anyways --- exclude valid cases. I'm happy to merge as-is, or to make the implementation more robust, somehow.

Modifiability,"This PR implements a major refactor of the `TurbulenceClosures` module. In particular, it ""standardizes"" how turbulence closures specify diffusive fluxes. Each turbulence closure now defines 12 functions (or opts in to functionality via subtyping, eg `AbstractEddyViscosityClosure`):. * `diffusive_flux_x`, `diffusive_flux_y`, and `diffusive_flux_z` for tracer diffusive fluxes; * `viscous_flux_ux`, `viscous_flux_uy`, and `viscous_flux_uz` for viscous fluxes of x-momentum; * 6 other functions similar to `viscous_flux_ux`, etc for `y` and `z` momentum components. Then there is a single implementation of `∇_κ_∇c`, for example, which calculates the divergence of the diffusive fluxes in a way that generalizes to curvilinear grids. This refactor was not that difficult because many turbulence closures had functions analogous to these --- they were just called by different names. So in a way this PR simply establishes standard notation. A major advantage of standard notation is that we can now correctly specify flux boundary conditions even when we cannot fill halos for this purpose. For example, right now we fill halos so that (fingers crossed!) boundary fluxes are zero when the diffusion operator is evaluated on boundary-adjacent cells, and then in a second step add the specific boundary fluxes. But with a function `diffusive_flux_x`, we can now ""reverse"" boundary fluxes and add specified fluxes generically. This PR therefore makes progress towards #1400. Work on this PR started with a few extra tests for `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` (though its focus is not quite different).

(Others please feel free to update this comment as necessary.). ------------------------------------------------------------------------; Hi all,. Following discussion with @glwagner, @simone-silvestri, and @jm-c this is a first attempt at implementing open boundary conditions. First I will try to get it working for the non-hydrostatic model which seems to be relatively straightforward. As a first step, I have implemented east/west boundaries which allow a flow to be prescribed or to travel out of the domain (i.e. if you set `OpenBoundaryCondition(nothing)` then my code is assuming the flow will be travelling into that boundary). The outflow condition is equivalent to having a nondimensional phase speed of 1 (sec 3.1 of https://doi.org/10.1016/S0924-7963(97)00023-7) which seems to work fine. When I vary the inflow velocity I do see waves in the velocity field reflecting from the downstream boundary. I gather that we expect this with any outflowing boundary and would remedy this with a sponge layer, but maybe this is where we need to add something to the pressure solver. With a constant inflow (0.1 m/s, 0.625m resolution, AMD and SeawaterBuoyancy), and a turbulent outflow, it seems to work okay:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/26657828/1509c8fa-ea24-40a2-84d5-33da424567b1.

Modifiability,"This PR implements vertically-implicit time integration for tracers and momentum. We restrict attention to the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` and quasi-Adams-Bashforth time integration. This requires some refactoring of function-calling in `TurbulenceClosures` some upgrades to `BatchedTridiagonalSolver`, and changes to `ab2_step!(model::HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel, dt)`. At first we will only support vertically implicit diffusion for `HorizontallyCurvilinearAnisotropicDiffusivity`. However, `TurbulenceClosures` has been extensively refactored to permit quick extension of vertically-implicit time-stepping to `IsotropicDiffusivity`, `AnisotropicDiffusivity`, and LES closures. ~~There are a few questions to answer before implementing implicit time-stepping there that we should discuss in issues.~~ It should be straightforward enough to implement vertically implicit time stepping for these closures and test them with existing regression tests. To construct a model that steps forward the vertical component of `HorizontallyCurvilinearAnisotropicDiffusivity` implicitly, we introduce the syntax. ```julia; ivd_closure = HorizontallyCurvilinearAnisotropicDiffusivity(κz = 1.0, time_discretization = VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization()); ```. The default `time_discretization` is `ExplicitTimeDiscretization`. The constructor for `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` handles constructing a `VerticallyImplicitDiffusionSolver` when implicit time discretization is specified.

If the regression tests don't pass, we will unfortunately have slightly more pain ahead of us in refactoring the regression tests. In addition to the above advantages, we also need to eliminate vertical integrals in `NonhydrostaticModel` to permit 2D distributed memory parallelization. This is because `PencilFFTs` only allows parallelization across dimensions higher than 1 (or in other words, we cannot parallelize in `x`).

Modifiability,"This PR introduces a major refactor of `FieldBoundaryConditions` and changes the user API. The `grid` and field location are no longer necessary to build `FieldBoundaryConditions`. This means that the constructors `TracerBoundaryConditions`, `UVelocityBoundaryConditions`, etc, are gone. Instead we have only `FieldBoundaryConditions`, which is used like. ```julia; u_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(top=FluxBoundaryCondition(-1e-4), bottom=FluxBoundaryCondition((x, y, t, u) = -1e-3 * u, field_dependencies=:u)). T_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(top=FluxBoundaryCondition(1e-8)); ```. There's also a new constructor `AuxiliaryFieldBoundaryConditions` which takes the place of `ComputedFieldBoundaryConditions` and is now the default for `Field` and `ComputedField`. The difference is that `AuxiliaryFieldBoundaryConditions` have `nothing` instead of an `ImpenetrableBoundaryCondition` in `Bounded` directions when they're located on faces. Under the hood the `FieldBoundaryConditions` struct is ""flattened"" so there's no more `CoordinateBoundaryConditions`. In addition, a new field `immersed` is added to `FieldBoundaryConditions` in addition to `east`, `west`, etc. This will be used to support boundary conditions on immersed boundaries in the future. There's still quite a few validation experiments to clean up and probably some lingering issues with tests, but I was able to get the examples to run so I thought it was the right time to open the PR.

So far it implements pressure solvers for all types of domains (triply/doubly periodic, channels, and boxes) on regular grids (except boxes on GPUs for now). Equally important, it refactors and cleans up the pressure solvers so that we can now easily add in pressure solvers for vertically stretched grids and distributed models. A lot of cleanup was done in the process as well. Pressure solver code and kernels have been fully moved from the `TimeSteppers` submodule to the `Solvers` submodule. Different parts have been reorganized into multiple files and the index permutation business has been abstracted away a bit so we have fewer ugly kernels (and fewer kernels!). I could have gone much further in condensing the code base and number of pressure solvers. You'll notice quite a bit of code repetition, but I think for now and the forseeable future this is actually a good thing. The pressure solver code is nontrivial and keeping it as simple as possible will improve the readability and longevity of the code base. It's also easier to add and modify pressure solvers now.

Modifiability,"This PR modifies the time-stepping algorithm so that the tendencies for wall-normal velocity components are calculated on boundaries in `Bounded` directions. In other words, when `x` is `Bounded`, the algorithm now calculates `Gu` on east boundaries, where `i=Nx+1`. Previously `Gu` was only calculated on west boundaries where `i=1`. The same applies to `y` and `z`. This change is necessary because, in general, the values of `Gu`, `Gv`, and `Gw` on `x`, `y`, or `z` boundaries are needed to impose predictor velocity and pressure boundary conditions when `x`, `y`, or `z` are `Bounded` --- respectively. The changes in this PR also motivated a slight refactoring of the way ""equations"" are specified.

Figuring out the exact system to solve and getting it working in 3D took a while.

Modifiability,"This PR overhauls halo filling to improve performance, especially for models that are ""thin"" in one direction (meaning that halo filling in the ""fat"" directions is expensive). It combines halo filling for opposing boundaries when possible (this is almost always possible except when using value / gradient boundary conditions). Notably it implements kernels for filling periodic boundary conditions rather than using `view` plus broadcasting, leading to significant performance improvement and reduction in memory allocations. The main problem was periodic directions I think, but there were also issues for normal velocity components. There may be more improvements to be had there. I think we can also do a lot less halo filling for flux boundary conditions, but full optimization would require a bit of work to the turbulence closures. For the default model configuration, we launch about half as many kernels for halo filling now.

Modifiability,"This PR overhauls the API for `Simulation`, `TimeStepWizard`, and printing of progress. It also simplifies the implementation of `run!`. After this PR, `Simulation` no longer accepts the keyword arguments `iteration_interval` or `progress`. Instead, progress printing is achieved with callbacks, eg:. ```julia; progress(sim) = @info ""Iteration: $(iteration(sim)), time: $(time(sim))""; simulation.callbacks[:progress] = Callback(progress, IterationInterval(100)); ```. It also refactors the `TimeStepWizard` so that it can be used as a callback, eg. ```julia; wizard = TimeStepWizard(cfl=1.0, max_change=1.1, max_Δt=2minutes); simulation.callbacks[:wizard] = Callback(wizard, IterationInterval(10)); ```. This is a better design for a few reasons:. 1. Adaptive time-stepping and progress printing are not longer arbitrarily constrained to occur on the same iteration interval.; 2. Both progress printing and adaptive time-stepping can use any `schedule` (rather than only `IterationInterval`).; 3. The simulation time-step is always `simulation.Δt`. No more shenanigans like `simulation.Δt.Δt`. Eventually, we should also eliminate the ""diagnostics"" list so that we have only two lists of callback-like objects: `simulation.callbacks` and `simulation.output_writers`. I think this resolves an issue or two but I need to find them. Also, I've so far only updated the examples.

Modifiability,"This PR overhauls the infrastructure supporting user-defined forcing functions. Many of these changes are discussed in #896 . ## `ModelForcing` is no more. The first important change is the elimination of `ModelForcing`. The `forcing` kwarg in the constructor for `IncompressibleModel` now accepts a named tuple, similar to the kwarg `boundary_conditions`. ## New default for `IncompressibleModel`. Second, functions that are passed directly to `IncompressibleModel` are assumed to have the ""continuous form"" signature. ```julia; func(x, y, z, t); ```. ## New user-facing function: `Forcing`. Third, forcing functions that deviate from this default behavior should be constructed with the function `Forcing`. Thus `SimpleForcing` is eliminated, as well as `ParameterizedForcing`. Moreover, simple-forcing-like functions can now depend on arbitrary fields interpolated to the location at which the forcing is applied. We thus support constructs like. ```julia; growth_in_sunlight(x, y, z, t, P) = exp(z) * P. plankton_forcing = Forcing(growth_in_sunlight, field_dependencies=:P); ```. provided that `:P` is in `model.tracers`. ### Docstring for `Forcing`. ```julia; """"""; Forcing(func; parameters=nothing, field_dependencies=(), discrete_form=false).

Modifiability,"This PR provides a substantial rewrite to the user API for ""scheduling"" output and diagnostics. Previously, output was scheduled by specifying one of two keyword arguments when constructing the `AbstractOutputWriter`: `time_interval`, and `iteration_interval`. An example from the documentation is. ```julia; simulation.output_writers[:field_writer] =; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, fields, filename=""output_fields.nc"", time_interval=60). # output; NetCDFOutputWriter (time_interval=60): output_fields.nc; ├── dimensions: zC(16), zF(17), xC(16), yF(16), xF(16), yC(16), time(0); └── 2 outputs: [""T"", ""u""]; ```. Time-averaging was specified by providing one or two additional keyword arguments: `time_average_interval` and (optionally) `time_average_stride`. This PR eliminates these keyword arguments in favor of a single argument `schedule`. In general, the `schedule` is an object which returns `true` (when output should be written, or a diagnostic calculated) and `false` (otherwise). This PR implements four `AbstractSchedule`s, and more are possible:. * `TimeInterval`: periodic schedule that reoccurs on a interval of model time.; * `IterationInterval`: periodic schedule that reoccurs on an iteration of model iterations; * `WallClockInterval` periodic schedule that reoccurs on an interval of ""wall time"", as kept by the clock on your wall; * `AveragedTimeInterval`: periodic schedule that reoccurs on an interval of model time, and specifies time-averaging of output over a `window` (and a default `window` equal to `interval` is now provided for friendliness). The old syntax thus becomes. ```julia; simulation.output_writers[:field_writer] =; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, fields, filepath=""fields.nc"", schedule=TimeInterval(60)); ```. and averaging is specified (with a time window of 20 seconds) by writing. ```julia; simulation.output_writers[:field_writer] =; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, fields, filepath=""fields.nc"", schedule=AveragedTimeInterval(60, window=20)); ```.

Modifiability,"This PR refactors the Poisson solvers so that:. 1. All our solvers (FFT-based, mixed FFT / tridiagonal, tridiagonal, and preconditioned conjugate gradient) have a consistent interface that's reminiscent of linear algebra solvers, eg we use the syntax. ```julia; solve!(x, solver, b); ```. which solves `A*x = b` for `x`, where `A` is described by `solver`. This resembles the syntax `ldiv!(x, A, b)` implemented by `LinearAlgebra.jl`. One exception is the mixed FFT / tridiagonal solver, which also permits `solve!(x, solver)` as an optimization. This extension is used because the ""source term"" is represented differently (eg in a way that depends on the vertical grid spacing) than the other Poisson solvers. The mixed solver also accepts `solve!(x, solver, b)` like the others; this will launch an extra kernel to copy and scale `b` appropriately. 2. The FFT-based solver supports the ""screened"" Poisson equation. ```; (∇² + m) ϕ = b; ```. via `solve!(x, solver, b, m)`, where `m` is a _constant_.

Modifiability,"This PR refactors the names we export publically. I think that many names have been added that are poorly motivated --- for example, MultiRegionGrid and cubed sphere grid are _very_ experimental yet still exported. This PR mostly removes exports. Most of the removals are motivated by one of two reasons: (i) the feature is experimental or (ii) the feature is not commonly used. For (i) we would like to avoid export because as an experimental feature we would like to fix bugs or change the API without incurring an ""officially breaking change"". For (ii), the purpose is merely to avoid over-polluting the namespace. For example, `XPartition` for `MultiRegionGrid` is very easily confused with `Partition` for `DistributedComputations` (the API here should probably be reconsidered, cc @simone-silvestri). More than once I have lost cluster time because I confused `YPartition(N)` with `Partition(y=N)`. But `YPartition` isn't really useful so there's little benefit to exporting this. Of course these changes are up for debate so I welcome comments. More detail:. * Remove `OceananigansLogger`: rarely used; * Add `PartialCellBottom`: we are using it in an example, indicating that it is ready for use (not necessarily completely bug-free but we would like to bring it into regular / default use now); * Remove `WENOThirdOrder`, `WENOFifthOrder`: the syntax `WENO(order=5)` is preferred (same for `Centered` and `UpwindBiased`); * Remove `location`: this is a low-level function that does not need to be part of the API; * Add `CATKEVerticalDiffusivity`: this is ready for use, a publication is imminent.; * Remove `StateChecker`: not used as far as I know.; * Remove multi-region and cubed sphere functionality: these are experimental.; * Remove `apply_regionally!, construct_regionally, @apply_regionally, MultiRegionObject`: experimental.; * Remove `Time`: too low-level.",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3872:8,refactor,refactors,8,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3872,1,['refactor'],['refactors']

Need to test GPU checkpointing, checkpointing with LES closures (I assumed `model.diffusivities` does not need to be checkpointed), and checkpointing with fancier boundary conditions.

But if the model is using up all memory, then there's no room for reading data from disk to memory. It should feed the data directly through the Model constructor, but this would require refactoring some of the model and field code.

Modifiability,"This PR removes a bunch of scalar operations introduced by #3575 on the GPU and instead performs operations on CPU and converts to CuArrays afterwards. There are two issues that don't allow us to create the grid natively on the GPU but rather force us to create the grid on CPU and then convert it. 1. The metrics for the `OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid` use scalar operations; see the functions that are called at https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/4c853b94e6c99949134981153250a4e2391bb0f1/src/Grids/orthogonal_spherical_shell_grid.jl#L780-L782. 2. When we create the `ConformalCubedSphreGrid`, to fill the metric and coordinate horizontal halos properly we use the same functionality that we use to fill halos for prognostic variables. To do that, we create Fields with the coordinate and metric values, call `fill_halo_regions!` on these fields, and then copy back the data from the Fields to the metrics. Copying the data from the metrics to the fields and vice-versa requires scalar operations, e.g., see ; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/7f12be3d82486b8be2923d8675d2e59c84efd722/src/MultiRegion/cubed_sphere_grid.jl#L280-L292. cc @siddharthabishnu",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3579:736,variab,variables,736,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3579,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"This PR resolves #2052 by consolidating `Field` to encompass:; - `Field`; - `ComputedField`; - `ReducedField`; - `AveragedField`. In addition, it gets rid of `KernelComputedField` since that functionality is now covered by `KernelComputedOperation` + `Field`. `Field` will no longer explicitly keep track of `architecture`, because `architecture` belongs to `grid` now. This PR also change the API for constructing fields:. ```julia; a = Field{Face, Face, Center}(grid) # constructs a field at `(Face, Face, Center)`; b = Field{Nothing, Face, Center}(grid) # constructs a field that is reduced in the x-direction at `(Face, Center)` in `y, z`; c = Field{Center, Center, Center}(grid); csq = Field(c^2) # constructs a ""computed field"" that calculates and stores c^2 via `compute!(c_sq)`; ```. There are also convenience constructors that take a tuple of locations:. ```julia; loc = (Face, Face, Center); a = Field(loc, grid); ```. `AveragedField` functionality is now wrapped into `Field`. Rather than writing `c_sq_avg = AveragedField(c^2, dims=(1, 2))`, we now write. ```julia; c_sq_avg = Field(Average(c^2, dims=(1, 2))); ```. There is also an interface for generic reductions, so another possibility is. ```julia; c_sq_max = Field(Reduction(maximum!, c^2, dims=(1, 2))); compute!(c_sq_max); ```. It was already possible to compute `maximum!` with a `ReducedField` and an `AbstractField`; this interface simply provides a way to compute these things on the fly for diagnostics purposes while running simulations. In summary, this PR is meant to reduce the amount of code we have to maintain, significantly declutter our `Field` implementations, clean up the API, and hopefully make it easier to extend `Field` implementations in the future, especially regarding reductions of operations such as `SummedField`, `SlicedField`, etc.",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2121:1697,extend,extend,1697,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2121,1,['extend'],['extend']

Modifiability,"This PR rewrites the user interface for specifying rotation rates and buoyancy parameters, such as gravitational acceleration, and the relationship between tracers and density via an equation of state. The main purpose of this PR is to move towards a more logical, functionality-driven encapsulation of parameters. . For rotation, this PR defines a new type called `AbstractRotation` whose subtypes are intended to describe parameters related to the background rotation rate of the model. At the moment there is only one such type: `VerticalRotationAxis`, or `FPlane`. In the future we expect to have `BetaPlane` and `TiltedRotationAxis` or `FullCoriolis`. The `AbstractRotation` types are uniquely associated with a function that computes the x, y, and z components of ""f X U"", associated with the background vorticity `f`. For density, equations of state, and buoyancy, a new abstract type `AbstractBuoyancy` is defined. This type is intended to encapsulate both a gravitational acceleration parameter (when applicable), and an equation of state that contains parameters associated with the relationship between tracer values and density. The advantage of this design is that parameters logically associated with certain terms in the equation of motion are now associated with a particular abstract type. This permits an easy extension of the rotational of buoyancy/equation of state models currently contained in the code; for example in the future we hope to support a `TracerBuoyancy` type for the case that buoyancy is itself a tracer and gravitational acceleration is no longer a parameter, and perhaps a `TemperatureBuoyancy` type for the case that only temperature contributes to buoyancy, rather than both temperature and salinity as is currently the case. In addition, our hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic pressure fields now have the same units and can be directly summed to obtain the total pressure.

Modifiability,"This PR simplifies the API for specifying boundary conditions that are functions. We build boundary conditions by writing. ```julia; bc = BoundaryCondition(BCType, condition); ```. where `BCType` is the ""type"" of the boundary condition (`Value`, `Gradient`, `Flux`, `NormalFlow`), and `condition` is the boundary condition. If `condition` is a function, it is now assumed it can be called with the signature `condition(ξ, η, t)`, where `(ξ, η)` are spatial coordinates that vary along the boundary in question (`y, z` for `x`-boundaries, `x, z` for `y`-boundaries, and `x, y` for `z`-boundaries). Different behavior is achieved by specifying keyword arguments of `BoundaryCondition`. For example, a non-`nothing` `parameters` keyword argument means that the last argument of condition is `parameters`: `condition(ξ, η, t, parameters)`. If `discrete_form=true`, the original behavior of `BoundaryCondition` is recovered, so that `condition` is called with the ""discrete form"" `condition(i, j, grid, clock, state)`, where `i, j` are indicies that vary along the boundary in question. Specifying both `discrete_form=true` and non-`nothing` `parameters` transforms `condition` into a `ParameterizedDiscreteBoundaryFunction`, which is called with `condition(i, j, grid, clock, state, parameters)`. Under the hood, this functionality is achieved by assuming that boundary conditions for fields are always built with `FieldBoundaryConditions`. This assumptions means we can use the information provided there to ensure that `BoundaryFunction`s are always tagged with the correct boundary plane and cell location. This relieves the user from having to specify the boundary plane and cell location of a `BoundaryFunction` explicitly. We hope this simplifies the API.

Modifiability,"This PR updates CATKE with an improved model for how the presence of shear modulates the mixing length and turbulent mixing. A few preliminary calibration results suggest that these changes are very promising, especially at coarse resolutions. A short summary is that, originally, CATKE was flexible enough to model both convection and shear-driven mixing --- just not at the same time (because TKE levels are much higher for shear-driven mixing). Adding a more explicit model for the modulation of the mixing length in the presence of shear allows CATKE to capture both convection and shear-driven regimes. We can update the default values for CATKE in this PR as well. This figure is a little out of context, but it shows agreement between LES (gray line) and the ""best parameters"" from a calibration run (blue line) at 8m resolution with five physical scenarios (from LESbrary's 4 day suite).

I would note unless we write *a lot* of new code, the user will be essentially limited to either providing an array for *all* fields, or forcing for *all* fields. To allow the user to implement either forcing functions or forcing arrays requires writing 5! = 120 new methods (right?) which is not desirable. A convenience constructor for `Forcing` that detects when the user passes arrays for any of the fields will help users avoid accidentally specifying forcing arrays for some fields and functions for others. However, once we resolve the `isbitstype` problem (perhaps also using `FieldVectors` or `LabeledArrays` for `velocities` and `tracers` to retain high performance) we can introduce abstractions for the idea of an `equation` function for each field individually (which would also be stored in a `LabeledArray`), and permit more flexible equation specification by the user without inducing a combinatorial explosion of code length.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/110#issuecomment-470324259:1305,flexible,flexible,1305,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/110#issuecomment-470324259,1,['flexible'],['flexible']

Modifiability,"This issue describes an overhaul / refactoring of the ""Model setup"" part of the documentation. We've noticed that while our examples and docstrings seem to be useful, the ""model setup"" is less so, and also leaves out a lot of information necessary for running more complex simulations. ## What we have now. The basic idea is to flatten the current structure a bit. Right now it reads:. ```; - Home; - Quick start; - Examples > ; - Physics > ; - Numerical implementation > ; - Model setup > ; - <etc>; ```. ## What we propose. We propose to create top-level sections for important concepts such as `Grids`, `Fields`, `Simulations` etc. Then less important details would be subsumed into the `Models` section (which would overlap strongly with the current `Model setup` section).

Modifiability,"This kind of feature can't be implemented directly in `Forcing`, because all explicit tendency terms are evaluated in the same kernel. So we have to evaluate `forcing` in every cell that requires a tendency. It is possible to expose a feature that allows kernels to be launched over some subset of cells. Then users could implement this kind of optimization in their script by using an array to represent the forcing, and then by precomputing the forcing into that array using a kernel that only evaluates some subset of all the cells in a callback. Or something like that. If forcing functions are expensive there may be simpler ways to do performance optimization though.

Modifiability,"This major PR changes the way difference operators work so that across boundaries (either the end of the domain in `Bounded` directions, or across immersed boundaries), differences always return 0 and interpolation always returns the value on the ""active"" or ""wet"" side of the domain. This change means the halos do not need to be filled for `Value / Gradient` boundary conditions. Instead, value and gradient boundary conditions will be enforced across `Bounded` the same way they are enforced across immersed boundaries. Moreover these boundary conditions will only be supported for `AbstractScalarDiffusivity`. This leads to considerable code reduction, because it unifies the algorithms for non-immersed and immersed boundaries. This may decrease compile times. In addition, the reduction in halo filling will hopefully lead to further performance increases, as we have found that halo filling is inefficient especially on the GPU and should be avoided when possible. Finally, avoiding halo filling is important for distributed models, since it eliminates the dependency that halos must be filled across `Bounded` before they are sent between processes across a `Communication` topology. Evaluating performance changes will be an important part of this PR. There's still a bit todo:. - [x] Refactor halo filling and `apply_flux_x` to enforce value / gradient boundary conditions; - [x] Implement homogeneous interpolation operators; - [ ] Possibly eliminate halo filling for `OpenBoundaryCondition`, leaving halo filling only for periodic and communication bcs",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2477:1294,Refactor,Refactor,1294,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2477,1,['Refactor'],['Refactor']

Modifiability,"This would be a major new feature for Oceananigans!.

I would vote to implement Burchard and Umlauf's ""generic length scale"" equation.

Modifiability,"Those are all possible developments. To put fields in `closure` we have to implement a pattern (implemented for things like boundary conditions, though it's taken a lot of work to get it right) whereby users instantiate a ""template"" `closure`, to which fields / data are added later given knowledge of the grid in the model constructor. Otherwise, users have to provide `grid` as an argument when constructing both a closure and a model. Either pattern is possible --- but implementing a ""template + materialization"" design is complicated, whereas requiring users to provide `grid` when constructing a closure changes the API. When a complicated algorithm endows the code with more features, I feel it could be justified if the feature is good enough. But if its only purpose is to rearrange where array references are bound, it feels less worth the trade off of code maintenance and the work to implement it. Another solution is documentation. Storing constant values in `diffusivities` is possible, but could be interpreted as boilerplate. The coefficients need to be stored in `closure`, because that's where users specify them. So copying the constants or functions into `diffusivities` (this would have to be done individually for all closures) requires additional code. I think of all the changes to `diffusivities`, the one that makes the most sense is to eliminate that field and change the API so that `grid` is a required argument for closures that have fields associated with them. This is a substantial internal refactor, but perhaps someone wants to take it up?.

Modifiability,"Upon thinking about it I think perhaps it makes more sense to run `dynamics` first before `advect_lagrangian_particles!`, one example of which might be that particles sink depending on the radius of the particle, which changes with time. In such a case it is perhaps better to evolve the particle radius, then compute the sinking velocity given the new radius before advective it. Also provided a draft example of how one could set up a problem where the particle sinks with a drag in the form of $\frac{d \boldsymbol{v}}{dt} = \frac{C_d}{\tau}(\boldsymbol{u} - \boldsymbol{v})$. ; Note: in the calculation the velocity of the particle itself needs to be tracked. This is done in `u_particle`, `v_particle`, and `w_particle` in `particles.properties` where `particles::LagrangianParticles`. The particle velocities are computed and updated in the `dynamics` step, then `ParticleVelocities` only has functions that access the particle properties to grab the particle velocity. It is slightly clunky but unless we keep track of the particle velocities right out of the box and update them during the `advect_lagrangian_particles!` step, this is the way I could think of. Since particle velocities are not updated when the particle is bounced, it will not work if the particles bounce from the boundaries back into the interior during the advection step, but for doubly-periodic domian and sinking particles it might not be very important.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3396#issuecomment-1872156350:277,evolve,evolve,277,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3396#issuecomment-1872156350,1,['evolve'],['evolve']

Modifiability,"Very nice @simone-silvestri . I think we have to regenerate the ocean LES regression test data. Unfortunately this regression test doesn't use `DataDeps` yet so regenerating it will increase the size of the repo by a little bit. Another option is to refactor the regression tests to use DataDeps but this might be best saved for a future PR. I think this fix may actually resolve some ancient issues that we didn't understand until now, for example:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1179. To summarize:. When running a model that has both `Periodic` and `Bounded` directions, _and_ when using a stencil that touches corner points (such as with `coriolis isa FPlane`, the order in which halos are filled matters. In particular, we must fill periodic directions _last_, because the corners then depend on a halo point which is just outside the boundary in the `Bounded` direction(s). The ocean large eddy simulation regression test is one such case (horizontally-periodic, bounded in z). There is a no-flux surface velocity boundary condition that creates a dependency between the bounded and periodic halo fills. The previous algorithm assumed that all halos could be filled simultaneously with no dependencies on one another. However, because the CPU is serial the halos were nevertheless filled in the ordering prescribed by `fill_halo_regions!`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/2d6ccfe94ce2c68857f70b2f8839020049932e00/src/BoundaryConditions/fill_halo_regions.jl#L32-L42. In other words, the vertical halos (the bounded direction) are filled last on the CPU. On the GPU the ordering may change because on the GPU KernelAbstractions is no longer serial. Thus on occasion the periodic halos might have been filled _after_ the bounded halos, leading to a failure of the regression test. This PR fixes that issue so that periodic directions are always filled last. So I think we should expect that regression tests fail on both the CPU and GPU.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2035#issuecomment-958102800:250,refactor,refactor,250,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2035#issuecomment-958102800,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

Boundary condition functions have the signature:. ```julia; condition(i, j, grid, time, iteration, U, C, parameters); ```. To stabilize the API, we may want to get rid of `parameters`, include `clock` rather than `time` or `iteration`, and add a named tuple container called `state` that holds `U`, `C`, and any other state variables that we want to add (now or in the future) as accessible to forcing functions or boundary condition functions. I'd propose that state be defined something like. ```julia; state = (velocities=U, tracers=C, diffusivities=K, pressures=pressures, tendencies=G); ```.

Modifiability,"We may have discussed this in the past or proposed similar ideas but just thought I'd open a suggestion issue as I think it might make model construction simpler for future users. Right now, for example, creating a parameterized boundary function takes 5 steps; ```julia; B_params = (; Ly = Ly,; B½ = 1.96e-7, # Buoyancy flux at midchannel [m²/s³]; Lᶠ = 10kilometer # Characteristic length scale of the forcing [m]; ); B(x, y, p) = p.B½ * (tanh(2 * (y - p.Ly/2) / p.Lᶠ) + 1) # Surface buoyancy flux [m²/s³]; B_bf = BoundaryFunction{:z, Cell, Cell}(B, B_params); top_b_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(B_bf); b_bcs = TracerBoundaryConditions(grid, top=top_b_bc); ```. I wonder if we can brush a lot of this under the hood so the user just has to type; ```julia; B_params = (; Ly = Ly,; B½ = 1.96e-7, # Buoyancy flux at midchannel [m²/s³]; Lᶠ = 10kilometer # Characteristic length scale of the forcing [m]; ); B(x, y, p) = p.B½ * (tanh(2 * (y - p.Ly/2) / p.Lᶠ) + 1) # Surface buoyancy flux [m²/s³]; b_bcs = TracerBoundaryConditions(grid, top=FluxBoundaryCondition(B)); ```; I guess it really only skips one step but with 3 arguments it can be inferred to be a parameterized boundary function and the location `{:z, Cell, Cell}` can be inferred from the fact that the BC is being applied at the `top` and it's for a tracer field.

Modifiability,"We need a unified interface for specifying forcing functions. The first change needed is to assume that, by default, forcing functions are called with the signature. ```julia; forcing(x, y, z, t); ```. This can be achieved with modest changes to [`ModelForcing`](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/f13a0a26df78cd1c1495d56ef5e7ea2fbbbfb23c/src/Forcing/model_forcing.jl). Next, we can introduce an interface, something like `Forcing(func; kwargs...)`, where `func` is the forcing function. A few kwargs that we might want:. - `parameters`: when `parameters` is specified, `func` is transformed into either a `SimpleForcing` or `ParameterizedForcing` which takes parameters. - `discrete_form`: when `discrete_form=true`, the function signature is assumed to have the ""discrete form"" `func(i, j, k, grid, clock, state)`. - `field_dependent`: this only applies when `discrete_form=false`, and specifies that the function signature contains field. We'll also need a new type, perhaps `DiscreteForcing`, that ensures a forcing function is not transformed into a `SimpleForcing` inside the `ModelForcing` constructor.

Modifiability,"We need an MPI tips / wiki section... been working on getting distributed simulations running on Engaging since yesterday (we need people to be able to start running distributed simulations immediately with minimal start up time). Here are a few things I learned:. * Remember to load a system MPI on your HPC, eg `module load openmpi`; * MPI may have to be installed / configured carefully --- after loading a system MPI. `MPIPreferences` can help:. ```julia; using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(); ```. https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/configuration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`. Interactive jobs launch faster, so we get a faster trial-error iteration. I'm still working on things, but it seems like another point may be salient:. * Initialize / precompile outside of a parallel job before trying to launch a parallel job via `mpiexec`. Here are some notes that may be specific to engaging:. I'm using `srun` to get a 4-GPU node to use interactively:. ```; srun -p my_partition --tasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:4 --gpus-per-node=4 --mem=0 -t 01:00:00 -N 1; ```. it seems we have to use the option `gpus-per-node`, rather than setting the total number of GPUs. Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node.

Modifiability,"What is the intent of these tests? Are they intended to be included in CI, or are they more in the style of “benchmarks” that are run relatively infrequently?. @edoddridge A twist on option 1 is to design a forcing that exactly cancels the terms associated with nonlinear and linear terms in a given equation for some simple initial condition consisting of sines and cosines. For example, pick an initial condition, calculate all terms in a given equation, and then write a forcing that exactly cancels those terms. Then check that the initial condition doesn’t change after a few time-steps. This method allows a test at low resolution with low computational burden and allows each nonlinear and linear term in each equation to be assessed separately. .

Modifiability,"When setting up scripts to run on HPC clusters with strict job time limits you need to write scripts that continuously checkpoint and restore from checkpoint and submit the job script again once a wall time limit has been reached. This introduces some complexity into the script, e.g. a `if model.clock.iteration != 0` statement for setting initial conditions and potentially extra data wrangling if an output writer needs to be configured to append to an existing file. It's quite easy to forget to do something important and introduce bugs into these scripts which is undesirable as these jobs tend to run for a long time and we frequently submit many such jobs so the cost of a mistake can be quite high. In the future I think developing some kind of abstraction for setting up this kind of script will be important for people who run scripts on HPC clusters with time limits.

The same issue also appears on GPU. This speed issue disappears either when `ζ = ∂x(v) - ∂y(u)` is replaced with `ζ = Field(∂x(v) - ∂y(u))`, or when `ζ` is the only variable in `fields_slice`.

Modifiability,"Yes we definitely need to speed up the tests. I think 95% of the time it takes to run tests is spent in compilation, however, so creating fewer models may not help much. Instead we may need to be more strategic with how we run tests, and perhaps also work on speeding up compilation time using something like [SnoopCompile.jl](https://github.com/timholy/SnoopCompile.jl). On #1962 we add bars capability, which will allow us to separate the tests into a few categories: fast-running, crucial tests will run on every commit to a PR, and slower, more comprehensive integration tests will run only when `bors try` or `bors r+` is invoked. This might help streamline the development workflow. Also if we are using Caltech's central cluster for CI we can potentially split the jobs amongst more workers, which might help speed up tests overall. Even more important is simplifying the test implementation. Right now updating tests and validation experiments is a time sink for developers that change the API and has really slowed development down lately. So we shouldn't rewrite tests in a way that makes development more difficult (eg keeping the maintenance burden of the test infrastructure small is more important than decreasing the computational cost of tests).

Modifiability,"Yes, that is pretty much what I had in mind but for a different physical problem. . There are a variety of ways one can do this. Below are a few that come to mind. 1. Power method: worked well for Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and should work well for other problems. Two nice features are that it's pretty simple, and it's already coded up for one example so should be easy to adapt. One not so nice feature is that it only tells us the most unstable mode (spatial structure, growth rates and phase speed) but it doesn't tell us about any other unstable modes. 2. Arnoldi Method: A quick google search came across this [library](https://haampie.github.io/ArnoldiMethod.jl/stable/). I have not tried it but could try adapting it to the above mentioned KH problem. . 3. Standard eigenvals: If we assume periodicity in two directions it boils down to a 1D eigenvalue problem that should be easy to solve using eigenvals. There should be a direct solver that forms a full matrix and gives you all the eigenfunctions but the indirect uses Arnoldi and gives you some. .

Modifiability,"Yesterday, @ali-ramadhan and I discussed a new idea for improving the abstraction of equations. The idea is to abstract a `RightHandSide` consisting of a tuple of `Flux`es and `VolumeTerm`s or `SourceTerm`s. Each `Flux` or `VolumeTerm` type would define a `getindex` method, and carry around the references needed to execute that `getindex` method on CPU or GPU. This would greatly simplify the time-stepping routines, which currently involve long function signatures. There'd be no need for 'unpacking', because each term in the equation would perform unpacking upon instantiation. It would also probably be easier for users to extend / add terms to an equation. As an example, we can consider a simple implementation. ```julia; struct AdvectiveFlux{S, D, C, G}; u :: D; v :: D; w :: D; c :: C; grid :: G; scheme :: S; end. getindex(adv::AdvectiveFlux{Centered}, i, j, k) = # centered advective flux calculation. struct IsotropicDiffusiveFlux{N, D, G}; ν :: N; ψ :: D; grid :: G; end. getindex(diff::IsotropicDiffusiveFlux, i, j, k) = # calculates flux due to isotropic diffusion by ν. struct RightHandSide{F, V}; fluxes :: F; volume_terms :: V; end. advection = AdvectiveFlux(velocities..., tracers.c); diffusion = IsotropicDiffusiveFlux(ν, tracers.c). tracer_rhs = RightHandSide((advection, diffusion), nothing); ```. We'd have functions that look something like. ```julia; function x_flux_divergence(i, j, k, grid, fluxes...); incoming_flux = add_fluxes(i, j, k, grid, fluxes...); outgoing_flux = add_fluxes(i+1, j, k, grid, fluxes...); return (incoming_flux - outgoing_flux) * grid.Ax / grid.V; end; ```. ... for example. Obviously questions of performance are paramount, though in the case that _everything_ is inlined I think there is hope. A downside of this approach is that we can't use shared memory stencils on the GPU.

By default, we use $\chi = 0.1$, which is quite large (20% of the smaller coefficient). This will introduce quite a bit of implicit dissipation in the model. Generally, there is a tradeoff between the stability obtained by a larger $\chi$ and the dissipation introduced by deviating from the AB2 behavior. I wondered if 0.1 is too high, especially when using diffusive methods. ; Did anyone experiment with lower $\chi$, and if yes, with what results?. Would it make sense to exclude $\chi$ from diffusive terms to limit the implicit dissipation of the time-stepping scheme?. Regarding the time integral for variable time-stepping, the correct form of the AB2 with variable step would have to include the time step at $n$ and the time step at $n-1$ to be correct. This might not make a huge impact, but if we want to save time averaged tendencies and the time step changes size every ten iterations or so, the error will compound and the time average will probably be off. ; Would it make sense to implement time-step dependent coefficients for the AB2 scheme?. The problem is that if the time step changes size, the tendency terms at $G^{n-1}$ do not cancel, which is what happens with constant time stepping.; ```math; c^{n+1} = c^{n} + \Delta t (1.5 G^{n} - 0.5 G^{n-1}) ; ```; ```math; c^{n+2} = c^{n+1} + \Delta t (1.5 G^{n+1} - 0.5 G^{n}); ```; In the above, between $c^{n+1}$ and $c^{n+2}$ we have added only one $G^{n}$ because the extra tendency we have added in $c^{n+1}$ is removed in the successive timestep.; With variable time steps, this is not the case!

Modifiability,"`Oceananigans.Solver.BatchedTridiagonalSolver`). Building the compressible model on top of Oceananigans.jl has allowed it to run on GPUs and make use of the same operators, grids, Coriolis terms, forcing function and boundary conditions, diagnostics, output writers, higher-order advection schemes, and user-interface niceties. Turbulent diffusivity closures may take more work to integrate and not all of them can be shared as the stress tensor is not traceless when the fluid is compressible (see #654 for more discussion). # Reasons why we may consider adding a compressible model to the Oceananigans.jl ecosystem. 1. I see Oceananigans.jl as a general-purpose package for fluid dynamics even though we mostly apply it to ocean problems. With both incompressible and compressible models, Oceananigans.jl would appeal to a larger audience and may be used to investigate a greater range of problems.; 2. One potential use of the `CompressibleModel` is to simulate a compressible ocean (with pressure as a prognostic variable) in which sound waves artificially slowed down for practical purposes. There were some discussions around this idea and @johncmarshall54 might still be interested.; 3. With PR #590, Oceananigans.jl will support distributed parallelism via MPI. While incompressible models (and anelastic models) don't scale that well to many nodes due to the need to solve an elliptic Poission equation globally across all ranks, a compressible model is completely local and might easily scale well on many GPUs. So even if the scalability of incompressible models on many GPUs is dissapointing, we may get a very scalable compressible model almost for free. Actually, the efficiency of the Oceananigans MPI algorithm might be best tested using a compressible model.; 4. Since distributed FFTs aren't generally available on GPUs (CuFFT only goes up to 16 GPUs), CUDA-aware MPI for incompressible models might take some time and effort to support once PR #590 is merged. However, CUDA-aware M",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1079:2732,variab,variable,2732,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1079,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"`const` matters when a variable is referenced as a global variable in a function; something like. ```julia; const a = 2; f(x) = a * x; ```. `a` is not an argument to `f(x)`; it's value is taken from the global scope. In that case it needs to be `const`, or `f(x)` cannot be compiled on the GPU. When numbers are added to explicit data structures --- which is what happens when they are inserted into the `parameters` kwarg in the constructor for `BoundaryCondition` or `Forcing` --- then it's irrelevant whether a variable is declared `const`. This is because in that case the variable is explicitly an argument to the function (eg via the argument `p` in `boundary_condition(x, y, t, p)`). In fact, this is the purpose of the `parameters` kwarg --- to avoid having to use `const` (which is annoying or inconvenient, and has compilation / performance pitfalls).

To implement the optimizations discussed in this issue, we need to also consider the calculation of hydrostatic pressure and nonlinear diffusivities to intertwine communication with interior tendency computation. Can this be done abstractly perhaps via some combination of launch configurations and macro specifications to `@loop_xyz`? This would allow us to exert control over the ""region"" of interior source term computation from the ""outside"", while keeping our kernels intact. Notice that the ""pre-computation"" of nonlinear diffusivities and the isolation of the hydrostatic pressure both add communication steps. We should monitor whether these become significantly suboptimal algorithms in the presence of expensive communication. We can easily combine hydrostatic pressure with nonhydrostatic pressure with no loss of performance (probably a small performance increase, in fact). We can also in principle calculate nonlinear diffusivities ""in-line"", though when we tried this previously we were unable to achieve good performance. Also, ""in-line"" calculation of diffusivities makes the application of diffusivity boundary conditions much more difficult (or impossible).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/615#issuecomment-583379290:2584,config,configurations,2584,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/615#issuecomment-583379290,1,['config'],['configurations']

Modifiability,"amadhan thanks a lot for this great work. I'm super excited to have this feature!. > Domain decomposition is supported and tested in x, y, and z. But for IncompressibleModel z-decomposition won't work right now because vertical integrals are done inside GPU kernels (so we probably don't want to decompose in z). And PencilFFTs.jl supports decompositions in dimensions 2 and 3 (since dimension 1 FFTs are the fastest). As a result, right now Oceananigans.jl only supports slab decompositions in y although we should figure out if pencil decompositions are possible. Sorry if I'm misunderstand some things (I'm not very familiar with the pressure-solver implementations) but it looks to me like this isn't an issue for the pressure solver, right? (Based on the fact that you got a 2D turbulence example going.) . If that's the case, then this limitation might be okay for now, as it would only affect cases we're you'd want to parallelize in `x` for efficiency purposes but you could still get away with running your set-up in a less-than-optimal configuration, no? I think this would be similar to the old limitation of being able to run `(Bounded, Periodic, Bounded)` domains only in CPUs. This was not optimal but if you wanted to circumvent this you could easily do so by rotating your domain to make it `(Periodic, Bounded, Bounded)` which _could_ be run on GPUs. Also (again correct me if I'm missing something) from my talks with you guys about this it seems that the primary goal of MPI-distributed parallelism is to run multi-GPU simulations, since GPUs have a relatively low memory limit. In this case, I think the way to use MPI is very different from the traditional multi-CPU runs. That is, I think the important capabilities when distributing a simulation across a few GPUs are different from the important capabilities when distributing it across hundreds of CPU cores. > I guess if we consider communication as a boundary conditions, then it makes sense to use Bounded in any case where",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/590#issuecomment-785220748:1052,config,configuration,1052,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/590#issuecomment-785220748,1,['config'],['configuration']

In the experiment, I have specified both the initial temperature (perturbation) and a constant background temperature < T > gradient, so that the total temperature T_total = < T > + T.; ; The movie below shows T_total and presents two simple experiments with an existing initial temperature. In the blue case, the default no-flux boundary condition is applied (i.e., no gradient in the wall-normal direction), but the gradient at the boundaries is nonzero because the boundary condition does not account for the background temperature. In contrast, the red case includes a boundary condition that forces the gradient of T_total to be 0. ; With this corrected boundary condition (red curve), the flux at the boundaries is 0, which is physical. However, it remains unclear how to incorporate these corrected fluxes for more complicated configurations. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/68127124/69e64cf9-6248-4274-9b6d-5f763827e768.

Since these functions are going to be called in GPU kernels, I think everything used by these functions should be made locally available to the functions and any arrays need to be `CuArray`s. Just looking around your script it looks like `secs` is just a regular array when it should be a `CuArray` if you want to use it in a GPU kernel, e.g. as part of `UniformStokesDrift`. I think the `df` dataframe object might not be GPU-compatible (i.e. it's not `isbits` and has no Adapt.jl function) so you might not want to use the `df` variable inside GPU kernels. It looks like you mostly use numbers from `df` (?) so you could instead pull out what you need. ```julia; const secs = CuArray(...); const scale = CuArray(...); const spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, scale, k=1); @inline Fxn_scale(t) = spl_scale(t); ```. You might also need to make variables `const`, e.g. `const secs = ...` so that they can be accessed from the GPU kernels. There's also the question of whether these splines are GPU-compatible, i.e. do they do the right thing on the GPU when given `CuArray`s instead of regular `Array`s. Unfortunately not every Julia package is GPU-compatible and not always efficient if it falls back on CPU methods to deal with `CuArray`s. I notice you're using Dierckx.jl for splines, which looks like a wrapper around a Fortran library so that's not going to work inside a GPU kernel. The Julia GPU/CUDA compiler can only compile pure Julia code to run on GPUs. We can look around a bit to see if there's a better package unless Dierckx splines are essential to your setup? Interpolations.jl might be an option but I'm not sure if it's GPU compatible. Worst case scenario maybe it wouldn't be too hard to code up a simple spline/interpolation scheme?.

The UW APL group has very nice [Waverider mooring observations there](https://cdip.ucsd.edu/themes/cdip?d2=p70&u2=s:166:v:parameter). Fig. 7 and Fig.8a,b of [this paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4261-2021) is a comparison of the Stokes drift between the ""theory wave"" and OS Papa in one year. [Here](https://github.com/qingli411/A2020_CVMix_in_GOTM/blob/main/OSPapa/ospapa_stokes_drift.nc) is the half-hourly Stokes drift data I computed from the wave spectrum at OS Papa used in that paper (without directional spreading). It was computed on a 1 m vertical grid in the upper 36 m and a much coarser grid below. But I can easily compute it on a finer grid if we need. . > Since Oceananigans doesn't yet have bulk formulae, we have to ""invert"" a toy bulk formula to obtain an ""expected air speed"" for a given kinematic momentum flux τ. I'm not sure whether it makes more sense to parameterize Stokes drift in terms of U10 or momentum flux (momentum fluxes saturate when waves stop growing at high wind speeds?). The reason we used U10 in the ""theory wave"" is that the empirical relations we used to estimate the peak wave number are based on wind speed. We need a bulk formula to convert these relations to momentum flux. The relation between U10 and surface Stokes drift does vary with U10 (see, e.g., Fig. 6 of [Rascle & Ardhuin 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2012.12.001)). But Langmuir number also seems to vary with U10 even for fully developed waves (Below is an example showing the relation between the turbulent Langmuir number and U10 assuming Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum).

Modifiability,"ce to provide but I can describe the problem as I've seen it. Basically, very rare, subtle irregularities have been observed on the GPU when using `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` in a `Periodic, Bounded, Bounded` configuration. I think that it is possible the main issue is an interaction (a read-write race condition) associated with both impenetrable boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions that affects the 8 corner points. The race condition affects model trajectories via the Coriolis force (which is the only term as far as I know that touches the 8 ""corner"" points affected by this race condition). Because the race condition only manifests when a `Coriolis` or `VectorInvariant` stencil touches corner points, it may not affect _most_ `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` models, which could explain why we haven't caught it. The reason it doesn't affect those models is because this race condition would only affect the corner points of `w`, which are not touched when using an `FPlane` Coriolis model. However, it's possible (I'm not sure) that the race condition could affect models using `NonTraditionalFPlane` in `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` configurations. More generally, it will also affect models that are bounded in the `y`-direction, because in those models the corner points of the `y`-velocity are affected and also invoked when using `FPlane` or `BetaPlane` coriolis. That's as much as I know. It's very hard to gather information about this bug because it's so rare are subtle. In other words, only one grid point among 10,000 iterations might be affected, and the errors induced are very small. To find this issue, we have to run tens of thousands of iterations of identical models on the GPU, and then compare some statistic of the model (ideally the entire velocity field, but @sandreza has gotten away just comparing something like `[maximum(abs, u), maximum(abs, v), maximum(abs, w)]`). If there's no race condition, identical models should produce identical results.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1985#issuecomment-921143865:1427,config,configurations,1427,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1985#issuecomment-921143865,1,['config'],['configurations']

Therefore we have another function,. ```julia; peripheral_node(i, j, k, grid, lx, ly, lz); ```. which returns true if a cell is inactive _or_ if it lies on the boundary between active and inactive (ie, the ""periphery"" of the domain).

We use the term ""node"" because this can be used for cells _or_ cell interfaces. `external_node` is `false` for locations that ""touch"" wet cells.; - `peripheral_node` identifies whether a location is either _on or external_ to the `Bounded` domain. So this intersects with `external_node` in the exterior, but additionally contains locations that touch wet cells.; - `immersed_peripheral_node` identifies locations that are on or external to the immersed domain, but _not_ external to the underlying grid domain (we need this so that we don't apply immersed boundary conditions at all peripheral nodes).; - `immersed_cell` is now the name of the function `is_immersed` --- immersed boundary implementations define this to obtain correct logic for boundary conditions. We then extend `external_cell` to cover both the external cells of the underlying bounded domain and the immersed cells. I think there's still a fair amount of work to do on this interface but hopefully this is a good step forward. Here's a few more thoughts:. * It seems that we should really use `Bounded` topology to be synonymous with ""impenetrable"". This might help us disentangle a few issues (eg satisfying impenetrability, correct divergences, etc.) I think we are discovering that in some cases its better to hard code certain ""assumed boundary conditions"" directly into operators, such as impenetrable conditions (considering complex domains is the key to realize the right abstractions here, since there are many simple solutions for non-complex domains and no obvious way to distinguish their tradeoffs).

I would even argue from an economic standpoint that the productivity saved from this setting outweights any rare instances of lost data, if they actually would ever occur due to changing the default. Now it is clear. If we handle properly picking up simulations, I completely agree with you that best option is for the user to manually change `overwrite_existing=false` to ensure their own data. I also follow the same workflow when creating a simulation in which I rely on the `overwrite_existing=true` until I reach the ""production"" phase of the simulation. > Also curious --- do you split files to make them easier to download? . I mostly do it to keep a consistent size and chunks across files for post-processing, but supporting both things will make the user workflow more flexible, particularly when running long simulations with multiple pickups.

For example, we might have just doubly periodic in (x, y) plus flux in z on all fields, or singly-periodic in x and flux in (y, z) on all fields. Agree that `CoordinateBoundaryConditions` might be a weird name but yeah, maximum flexibility would be very powerful. Maybe the common use case isn't to impose each of the 30 boundary conditions one-by-one but we can just have nice helper functions/abstractions like; ```julia; model.boundary conditions += HorizontallyPeriodic(); ```. > @ali-ramadhan do you mean with regards to performance? I'm not sure. With multiple dispatch being core to julia it seems this scenario is not uncommon (30+ may not be very large). I'm still pretty new to Julia so yeah don't know if that will be an issue, especially on the GPU. Only way to find out is to try and benchmark! Maybe you're right and 30+ isn't a lot. @vchuravy any idea on whether 30+ parameterized types for a struct is too many? Would this hurt performance on the GPU?. > The function calc does not actually impose a boundary condition --- the imposition of boundary condition depends on, for example, the viscosity and diffusivity, and is a property of the equation (or turbulent closure) being implemented. Again for example, the K-Profile-Parameterization includes a modification of how a flux boundary condition is implemented. In other words, the ""specification of flux"" is separate from the ""imposition of a boundary condition"". The former is determined by the user. The latter is determined by the model/governing equation. I see. So if no parameterizations are being used, are the boundary conditions actually being _imposed_ then? Even with KPP, isn't the boundary condition still being _imposed_ only to later be modified by KPP?. I still feel like `bc.calc()` feels obscure, I'm not sure why a boundary condition should have to calculated.

Modifiability,"consider the tilted bottom boundary layer example: https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/literated/tilted_bottom_boundary_layer/. In this problem, the buoyancy is decomposed ($b=\bar{b} + b^{\prime}$) into a background component $\bar{b} = N^{2} \hat{z}$ (where $\hat{z}$ is positive in the direction opposite the gravitational vector) and the remaining perturbation. The current example script applies no boundary conditions to the perturbation buoyancy, which I believe defaults to a no-normal-flux condition at the top and bottom boundary. Because no boundary conditions are applied to the background field, there is an implied diffusive flux $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot (-\kappa \nabla \bar{b}) = ±\kappa N^{2} \cos{\theta}$ across these boundaries. This means that the boundary condition on the total buoyancy is a non-zero flux across the seafloor, which does not make much sense for this problem. The normal way of implementing this problem is to apply a gradient boundary condition, $\frac{\partial b^{\prime}}{\partial z} = -N^{2}\cos{\theta}$, at the bottom, to impose the no-flux condition. (In my MITgcm configurations, I verified that implementing the boundary condition this way recovered the classical analytical solutions of [Garrett et al. 1993](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.fl.25.010193.001451). Here is [another example using Dedalus](https://github.com/hdrake/bmli-linear/blob/main/examples/evp_replicate_Wenegrat2018_growth_rates.ipynb) to replicate some of Jacob Wenegrat's results, where I also include a non-zero gradient boundary condition on the perturbation buoyancy to impose no flux on the total buoyancy.). I understand why one might want background fields to be constructed a certain way for idealized problems, but it should be communicated clearly (and consistently) to the user exactly how this works. Is the tilted bottom boundary layer example incorrectly implemented or do I still not understand how the background fields work?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3568#issuecomment-2083158198:1186,config,configurations,1186,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3568#issuecomment-2083158198,1,['config'],['configurations']

Additional work to do on `MultiRegion` is ; - Perform more systematic benchmarking; - Design correct `OutputWriters` and `OutputReaders` for `MultiRegionFields`. Maybe not immediate priorities but definitely important; - Adapt `RungeKutta3` to `Multiregion` through `@apply_regionally`; - Implement a multi-region version of the Nonhydrostatic pressure solver; - Overlap computation and communication (for this we require _non-blocking_ `fill_halo_regions!` with returning `events`); - Optimize the distributed implicit solver (maybe using `PETSc.jl`?

Modifiability,"e code/documentation and examples of Oceananigans. When I started this issue, I wasn't really expecting to have Pacanowski-Philander parameterization implemented in a few hours. Kudos to you!!; I know this parameterization is very simple, but implementing it on a FORTRAN-based GCM from scratch would take waaaay more time, at least for me. Can you help me to see if I understood everything correctly? Please, sorry if I am asking too-trivial questions. Why you need to define `f²`, wouldn't work simply using `∂zᶠᶜᶠ` and squaring the operation?. I understand that you create a fake model and don't run it, simply use it to update the auxiliary field. I don't understand why you could not do the same for the main model. For instance, you could first create the model, define Ri and closure and then `set!` the model with this new closure and auxiliary field. Does that makes sense? I understand the in the background this might not work the way it is now. Something like this:. ```; model = HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel(; grid, tracers=:b, buoyancy=BuoyancyTracer()). Ri = Field(KernelFunctionOperation{Center, Center, Center}(Riᶜᶜᶜ, grid, computed_dependencies=(model.velocities, model.tracers.b))). ν = ν₀ + ν₁ / (1 + c * Ri^n); κᵇ = κ₀ + κ₁ / (1 + c * Ri^(n+1)). closure = ScalarDiffusivity(VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization(); ν, κ=(; b=κᵇ)). set!(model, closure = closure, auxiliary_fields = (; Ri)); ```. Thinking on a more general way, it would be awesome to give a general function that could depend on any field in the model, including auxiliary. I am thinking that this way it would be easier for users to create and implement their own parameterizations. Including using any model in general that could come in a form of a function. For instance, a ML model could be simply used as a turbulence closure. Again, thanks for all attention you are giving to me. As a new user, it makes me learn more and more and maybe sometime I can also retribute by contributing to the model development.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1066110688:1817,parameteriz,parameterizations,1817,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1066110688,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterizations']
Modifiability,"e easier for users to extend / add terms to an equation. As an example, we can consider a simple implementation. ```julia; struct AdvectiveFlux{S, D, C, G}; u :: D; v :: D; w :: D; c :: C; grid :: G; scheme :: S; end. getindex(adv::AdvectiveFlux{Centered}, i, j, k) = # centered advective flux calculation. struct IsotropicDiffusiveFlux{N, D, G}; ν :: N; ψ :: D; grid :: G; end. getindex(diff::IsotropicDiffusiveFlux, i, j, k) = # calculates flux due to isotropic diffusion by ν. struct RightHandSide{F, V}; fluxes :: F; volume_terms :: V; end. advection = AdvectiveFlux(velocities..., tracers.c); diffusion = IsotropicDiffusiveFlux(ν, tracers.c). tracer_rhs = RightHandSide((advection, diffusion), nothing); ```. We'd have functions that look something like. ```julia; function x_flux_divergence(i, j, k, grid, fluxes...); incoming_flux = add_fluxes(i, j, k, grid, fluxes...); outgoing_flux = add_fluxes(i+1, j, k, grid, fluxes...); return (incoming_flux - outgoing_flux) * grid.Ax / grid.V; end; ```. ... for example. Obviously questions of performance are paramount, though in the case that _everything_ is inlined I think there is hope. A downside of this approach is that we can't use shared memory stencils on the GPU. Shared memory stencils on the GPU require _functions_ for all terms that avoid carrying around internal references to data (since we need to be able to pass them references to shared memory blocks, rather than references to global memory. This is a fair rewrite of the code internals. For example, each term in the `u_velocity_tendency`:. https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/8e3c27504be68ca06bacc7502cd6095ae390f8c6/src/TimeSteppers/velocity_and_tracer_tendencies.jl#L24. would get it's own type. It's worth brainstorming ways to implement such abstraction incrementally so we might avoid possibly time-consuming total-code-demolishment. This is mostly food for thought at this point.

Modifiability,"e to accommodate channels. Some notes:. A new Poisson solver has been added that solves Poisson's equation with periodic boundary conditions in the x and staggered Neumann BCs in the y and z. This involves computing a 2D DCT on the GPU, which has no native DCT, so I implemented the fast 2D cosine transform from Makhoul (1980). Unfortunately the 2D FCT does not generalize from the 1D version, and extra steps are involved. In particular, as Fourier coefficients need to be indexed in multiple ways in some statements, we need a second buffer/storage array until I can figure out whether this is necessary. A couple of 1D masks are also needed. Anyways, so this PNN Poisson solver is a little involved, but is still decently fast. We have more tests and more GPU tests in general, but this also means that the test suite takes even longer to run especially with GPUs. I've moved each test set to it's respective file so we can use the regression tests as a stand-alone . In particular, this PR heavily refactors `poisson_solvers.jl`. It's more modular, concrete, and better documented I still need to describe the algorithms in the docs, especially important as it's not easy to figure this out and the only references are sparse papers (no code or implementations as far as I can tell). `time_steppers.jl` has also been cleaned up. Several kernels were converted to broadcasts. I also removed several bits of code that aren't used anymore. I considered making separate PRs to clean things up but I had to refactor and clean up to implement stuff so I ended up doing it all in this PR. The front-end has not changed at all but this PR ended up changing/cleaning a lot of the backend so I'd like to merge it ASAP before it starts to go out of date. Currently it's twice as slow as running a doubly periodic model. Will have to profile to figure out where it's spending that extra time.

I'm not sure I understand the point about newbie mistakes though. > I also think a user can easily infer that z in the signature can be ignored if they just defined a grid with a Flat z topology, so I think the added user-friendliness is minor. It's true that in our examples, `set!` is typically invoked close to the grid definition. But such proximity is not guaranteed. In complicated applications (say for example a realistic simulation on the globe), a grid may be constructed ""for"" the user. One case that's come up recently is coupled ocean, sea-ice simulations. For a realistic case covering the globe, the user script may well not include the creation of the grid (which would happen within a helper function like `build_global_ocean_sea_ice_simulation`). Even if the grid construction is immediately readable, I think it's still weird to read. ```julia; initial_ice_thickness(x, y, z) = 1 # meter; ```. as determining sea ice thickness --- its nonsensical for the ice thickness to depend on `z`. Ice thickness _cannot_ depend on `z`. The z topology of a slab ice model cannot be anything but `Flat`; it doesn't make sense to have a z-coordinate. That's also true for the `ShallowWaterModel`. Also there function signatures depend on `z` despite that no shallow water field can possibly depend on the third coordinate. > (Maybe even negative since the signatures now can change based on topology(grid)?). I think it's correct to observe that this change does not prioritize _writing_ scripts --- it prioritizes the experience of _reading_ scripts. I think the scripts read better with this change. The purpose of ""function notation"" is to indicate the variables on which the function depends (usually including just dependent coordinates, like `x`, `y`, or `z`). In almost all contexts, we should not include irrelevant variables in a function signature.

Modifiability,"e. I guess you're trying to couple an agent-based larvae model to an ocean model?. Oceananigans.jl should have the features you need I think: mainly Lagrangian particle tracking to advect the larvae around and arbitrary forced passive tracers for the odor from the reef?. I've actually been meaning to set up an example of an agent-based model coupled to Oceananigans.jl (simulating interacting ""microbes"" in the ocean). It's not fully complete yet but might give you some ideas of how to use Lagrangian particles as agents: https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1244. > If that works, I will implement a continuity equation to simulate the odor which comes from the reef and which is supposed to help the larvae to find back to the home reef. What is the continuity equation for the odor? It should be easy to advect the odor around as a passive tracer but just curious what the equation looks like. > Since I have found Oceananigans, which is also a CFD tool, I was wondering what you think the differences are between that and WaterLily.jl? Given my description of the project above, would you tend to use either of them?. I'm not super familiar with WaterLily.jl but it's definitely a very nice package (and a great README)!. I think WaterLily.jl has a more mature immersed boundary implementation if you need to have complex boundaries and is auto-diff friendly if you need to do some optimization/inference. @weymouth might be able to elaborate!. Oceananigans.jl has native support for Lagrangian particle tracking and might have more mature diagnostics (e.g. if you need to compute vorticity or other statistics) and more mature output writers (among other quality of life features). The examples in the docs should give a pretty good of the current set of mature features.

It's not a built-in feature but is pretty easy to implement by adding appropriate forcing functions to an Oceananigans model. For example, in PR #693 we used such a method to simulate viscous flow around a cylinder (in 2D). Here is the simulation script: https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/ar/flow-around-cylinder/verification/flow_around_cylinder/flow_around_cylinder.jl. These are the most relevant lines: https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/a921fc3edbf795bf4a2193cca84cad41ebdd5625/verification/flow_around_cylinder/flow_around_cylinder.jl#L18-L27. In this case the boundary was described analytically and `boundary(x, y, z)` evaluates to `1` inside the cylinder and to `0` outside. In your case maybe it's easier to describe the boundary or missing nodes with a mask or array (also updated snippet for v0.29):; ```julia; # ... Create boundary[i, j, k] array that's 1.0 inside the boundary and 0.0 outside ... K = 50.0 # ""Spring constant"" for immersed boundary method ; parameters = (boundary=boundary, K=K). # Continuous forcing immersed boundary method ; @inline u_immersed_boundary(i, j, k, grid, clock, state, params) =; @inbounds -params.boundary[i, j, k] * params.K * state.velocities.u[i, j, k] ; @inline w_immersed_boundary(i, j, k, grid, clock, state, params) =; @inbounds -params.boundary[i, j, k] * params.K * state.velocities.w[i, j, k] . u_forcing = ParameterizedForcing(u_immersed_boundary, parameters); w_forcing = ParameterizedForcing(w_immersed_boundary, parameters). forcing = ModelForcing(u=u_forcing, w=w_forcing) ; ```. Note that the API has changed a bit since PR #693 so the example is a little out of date. See release notes for details, especially for v0.26.0 onward: https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/releases. Let us know if this helps and if you run into any issues.

In the case where the interior velocity is already the same as the specified velocity (and everything else is uniform), this means that at `i=1` $\nabla^2 P_{non}$ changes from being positive to zero, so we go from having a pressure gradient at the wall counteracting the flow away from the wall (or I suppose a reconfiguration to `u=0` everywhere to enforce compressibility) to having no pressure gradient across the wall. . Thinking about it this is exactly what happens for periodic domains where we are essentially specifying the flow outside of the domain.

Modifiability,"eling software are implemented using a ""Generalized Vertical Coordinate"" (GVC). Generalized vertical coordinates contain a ""fixed z"" coordinate as a limiting case, but generalize to vertical coordinates that. * Are fixed in time but conform to topographic variations (`σ` coordinates);; * Vary in time in a diagnostic manner (for example, _z-star_ coordinates, which vary with the sea surface displacement);; * Vary in time according to some prognostic equation (fully Lagrangian isopycnal coordinates, semi-Lagrangian hybrid coordinates / _z-tilde_ coordinates that vary only with high frequency motion, and adaptive methods that prescribe GVC dynamics to obtain favorable properties like concentration in regions of strong stratification). A fully general GVC typically also requires a ""Lagrangian remapping"" step to avoid extreme grid distortions in regions of persistent vertical velocities. The implementation of GVC is likely a major refactoring of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` because it will change the equations of motion and could even potentially change the nature of its prognostic variables. For time-dependent GVC, tracer equations must be reformulated in terms of the ""thickness-weighted"" tracer concentration, which in our case means the tracer concentration normalized by the local grid spacing. This could mean either using the thickness-weighted tracer conservation as a state variable, or it could mean rewriting the time-stepping algorithm so that unweighted tracer conservation can be updated according to the conservation of thickness-weighted tracer. A preliminary roadmap towards GVC in `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is. 1. Introduce `AbstractVerticalCoordinate` and refactor the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` to integrate thickness-weighted equations. When using `ZCoordinate`, the resulting model produces identical results to the current implementation of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`.

When pick there to be zero perturbations, the jet is an exact solution to the governing equations (even though it is an unstable one) and it should persist, until perturbations arise because of numerical errors. The good news is that when we use method 1, evolve the perturbations, when we pick zero perturbations, no pertrubations develop for a long time. . The not so good news, is that when we use method 2, evolve the total field, a distrubance develops right away,in the center of the jet that spans the entire depth, and this seems to radiate gravity waves to the left and right. The amplitude of the distrubance is small and it does decrease with increasing resolution but it seems problematic. I am going to include an animation that shows the problem that develops in the first 6 hours and the two codes, which are almost identical.

Modifiability,"environment variable. For this we introduce an environment variable, say `OCEANANIGANS_NUMBER_TYPE`. Then we can write a small utility:. ```julia; function global_number_type(default=Float64); user_number_type = get(""OCEANANIGANS_NUMBER_TYPE"", ENV, nothing). if isnothing(user_number_type); FT = default; else; try; FT = eval(Symbol(user_number_type)); catch; error(""The environment variable OCEANANIGANS_NUMBER_TYPE=$user_number_type is not supported!""); end; end. return FT; end; ```. This also permits a script-based approach because users can write. ```julia; ENV[""OCEANANIGANS_NUMBER_TYPE""] = ""Float32"". grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 1, 1)); coriolis = FPlane(f=1); equation_of_state = TEOS10EquationOfState(); buoyancy = SeawaterBuoyancy(; equation_of_state); ```. ## Introducing an internal ""settings"" dictionary. Then users might write. ```julia; Oceananigans.settings[:default_number_type] = Float32; ```. This avoids the string-based restriction of environment variables, so may generalize to more types of settings should we need that. It's a slippery slope of course, we want to keep this to a minimum because global settings inhibit programmability (ie one cannot have multiple simulations in a single instance with different settings). Here, the setting only controls a default, so it remains possible to have two simulations in one instance with different number types --- they just cannot be set up simultaneously (or one has to do more work to set the number type ""manually""). External packages can opt into using this only if they depend on Oceananigans. Which may be ok, in fact. External packages that extend Oceananigans of course must depend on Oceananigans. There is just the question of what to do with SeawaterPolynomials, where the dependency goes the other direction...

You can always try with higher order (maybe 7th?) but the higher the order the lower the stability (i.e. at a certain order your implicit dissipation will be so low that you will start to generate grid-scale noise). . The KE dissipation is there with `closure=nothing` and a WENO scheme, it is just not strictly physical: it's (roughly) akin to a 4th to a 6th-order hyperviscosity. You can compare this to using `UpwindBiased(order = 5)` which would give you everywhere a dissipation that converges to a 6th-order hyperviscosity. In general:. $$\partial_x {uu}^{Upwind_N} \sim \partial_x {uu}^{Centered_{N+1}} + \partial_x {K_{numerical}} \partial_x^{N} u$$. where $K_{numerical} \sim \Delta x u$ and $N$ is the order. The nice thing about using WENO instead of a simple Upwind discretization is that the order of the hyperviscosity adapts to the smoothness of the field. Therefore, where the field is noisier (like in regions of higher gradients) the dissipation is more aggressive. . This procedure not only ensures a smooth field but can be thought of as mimicking the subgrid-scale dissipation (which also increases with the gradient of resolved scale variables. As such people have referred to using particularly diffusive advective schemes (such as WENO) as _Implicit_ LES. I like the idea of implicit LES because it allows you to ""fill in"" for the subgrid-scale dissipation without committing to any sophisticated formulation derived in a particularly idealized situation (take the example of Leith derived in homogeneous 2D turbulence and the geostrophic eddies in the ocean), and guarantees (or at least helps) stability.

Modifiability,"erent advection schemes and time steppers to help us decide what to implement. I hope this PR can serve as test-driven development: Oceananigans should be able to reproduce the results of this PR, at which point it becomes a true verification experiment. `weno.jl` defines `advective_tracer_flux` functions (`weno5_flux`) so it should work nicely with the existing `Oceananigans.Operators`. At some point in the future I'd like to follow this PR up with a 2D advection test using the Munk gyre solution. Should also test momentum advection. Of course, can't always generalize 1D advection results to 3D turbulence simulations... Things to do to integrate WENO-5:; 1. Design an abstraction for selecting advection schemes.; 2. Extend to multi-dimensional advection scheme.; 3. Extend to a momentum advection scheme as well.; 4. Decide whether we want WENO-3 and/or WENO-7 (or even higher-order advection schemes). Note: On extending to multi-dimensional advection, we can perform the 1D WENO interpolation along each dimension separately to come up with a multidimensional advection scheme. This is what most packages do in practice as true multidimensional would involve huge stencils (and some numerical quadrature?) so it's not worth it for the small increase in accuracy. Doing it dimension-wise might be fine at lower order like WENO <= 7. I should cite the appropriate papers for these claims. This relatively recent paper might be of interest to us: Buchmüller & Helzel (2014), [Improved Accuracy of High-Order WENO Finite Volume Methods on Cartesian Grids](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-014-9825-1). Resolves #481; Resolves #934. ---; Not sure if it'll generalize to 3D but seems that you get better accuracy even with half the number of grid points (per dimension?).

Modifiability,"es. In no particular order:. 1. Having to compile two separate models and `Simulation`s can take a long time for small runs. When your code is production-ready and you're running the final big simulations that's okay, since those extra minutes of compilation are small compared to the many hours of run. But when you're doing small exploratory simulations (which may be the majority of times you run your code), then that extra compilation time required to build an extra model, simulation, writers, etc., can increase the code run-time significantly.; 2. Since you end up compiling and running two sets of model and simulation, this ends up taking extra space which can be a problem on the GPU. (I'm not aware of any way to ""remove"" the old `Simulation` from the GPU memory, but if there is, then this downside can be negated.); 3. It makes for more complex code, especially when figuring out when it's safe to pick-up a simulation or not, due to the way pick-ups work.; 4. When outputting to NetCDF you generally need at least two files: one for the fields in the spin-up simulations and one for the extra tracers (or one NetCDF for the spin-up period and another one for the rest of the run). I'm not sure if this is also a limitation of the JLD2 writer though. I think if we implement a way to build just one model which has every tracer needed and (optionally ofc) specify start times for each tracer (before which the tracers would just not be evolved in time) it would solve all the of the problems above. The downsides that I can think of are:. 1. Simulations using this feature would possibly waste space on disk by outputting ""frozen"" tracer fields before they start evolving.; 2. One more thing in the models to test and maintain. Maybe the biggest issue is that I'm not sure this is something enough people actually want to do with their simulations.

Modifiability,"escribes a time-evolving state. In this case, parent velocities and tracers are specified at each point in space and time -- both on the boundary, and inside the ""child"" `NonhydrostaticModel` domain. We can imagine that this case would involve a utility that takes in the parent state (or a filename / list of filenames) and returns boundary conditions on velocities and tracers. The utility might also return forcing functions that prescribe a sponge layer that relaxes the model solution to the parent state near the boundary, like [MITgcm's ""relaxation boundary conditions"" package](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phys_pkgs/rbcs.html). As for how the boundary conditions work, an arbitrary parent state will dictate wall-normal velocities that are variously either inward or outward (fluxing information out of the domain). Somehow, the inflow / outflow specified by the parent state has to be reconciled with the model state. The discussion on this PR seems to suggest that the outflow velocity used by the boundary condition may need to be _different_ than what is specified by the parent state (otherwise, why would we need to ""compute"" an outflow velocity?). But I don't understand anything further than that. I also don't understand the implications of a sponge layer, which almost certainly seems required. . 2. Constant or idealized inflows and outflows. This seems to be the case in the movie on the original post and also of @simone-silvestri 's movie. On one (or more?) boundaries, an inflow state is prescribed. The inflow boundaries could use 1) `OpenBoundaryCondition` on both velocities and tracers, or 2) `OpenBoundaryCondition` for velocities and `ValueBoundaryCondition` on tracers. The second case would be used when attempting to prescribe the tracer fluxes precisely. There are also outflow boundaries, which either have a prescribed outflow velocity, a computed-yet-still-spatially-uniform bulk outflow velocity, or a computed and spatially-variable outflow velocity?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-1979894207:2130,variab,variable,2130,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-1979894207,1,['variab'],['variable']

It's convenient to toggle this on when starting from 0 (sometimes there's an iterative process involved in starting a simulation: fiddling with time-steps, an error in the output writer, error in a callback, blah blah). But when running with `pickup=true` we definitely do _not_ want to overwrite an existing output file. I'm wondering if we should implement behavior where `pickup=true` _overrides_ `overwrite_existing=true`. This would mean that if we pickup we _cannot_ overwrite an existing file (if for some reason we do want that, we'd have to delete it manually). I think this is really the behavior we want. However, it requires refactoring the output writers, because we have to move output writer initialization from the output writer constructor to another function that gets called after `run!(simulation)`. Not very hard, but something to ponder. Here's a few other random ideas that would also address this issue in slightly different ways. 1. Implement a ""pickup mode"" specified with an environment variable like `OCEANANIGANS_PICKUP=true` (rather than something we write in a script). Then output writer constructors can search for this environment variable and override `overwrite_existing` (with a warning?) in the output writer constructor. ""pickup mode"" has other usability benefits (ie it's annoying we have to change the run script / prepare the run script to be ""pickup"" aware: pickup mode avoids this so we can toggle to pickup mode from _outside_ the run script without internal changes) and also obviates the need to separate output writer constructor from output writer ""initialization"". 2. If we ""delay"" output writer construction, we can also extract the option ""overwrite_existing"" and put it elsewhere (eg as a global option `overwrite_existing_output` for all output writers in `run!`). This makes a stronger connection between `pickup` and `overwrite_existing`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2535:2279,variab,variable,2279,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2535,2,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"face on which the boundary condition is defined, in other words `n̂ ⋅ u = 0`. This is true for the time being because we don't have 'open' or non-zero 'penetration' boundary conditions. On the other hand, a penetration boundary condition is a condition on *mass* specifically --- a condition on `n̂ ⋅ u`. More specifically because we only have `NoPenetration`, it is the statement that `n̂ ⋅ u = 0` on that boundary. Currently we only have horizontal boundaries in the vertical direction, so this boundary condition can only be applied to `w`. Consider that we can apply a no penetration condition to the velocity field on all boundaries, but still permit a (diffusive) flux of velocity / momentum at the boundaries --- this will be the case, for example, for the free decay of turbulence to a quiescent state in a closed, impermeable box. Earlier there was also confusion about the difference between a `Value` (Dirichlet) condition and a no penetration condition. Mathematically speaking I do think these are the same. However, their implementation on the staggered grid differs, since we assume that `Value` conditions are applied to fields that are not defined *on* the boundary, but in between the boundary face and the boundary-adjacent face. On the other hand, we assume that a penetration boundary condition applies to fields that have values on boundaries; e.g. to the velocity components that are normal to that boundary. Does that make sense? Documentation is of course easy, but I'm open to changing the API or refactoring the code internally as well. I think that in part an internal refactoring will require dispatching on field type / location at some level; for example we have to interpret a `Value` condition applied to a field that is defined on a certain boundary in the same way that we interpret a `Penetration` condition currently, while interpreting a `Value` condition applied to a field defined between the boundary and boundary-adjacent face in the same way that we do now.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/389#issuecomment-527164624:2272,refactor,refactoring,2272,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/389#issuecomment-527164624,2,['refactor'],['refactoring']

That way we only have to change `arch` when switching from single-process runs to distributed runs.; * We need `Base.summary(::MultiArch)` so logs don't get mutilated; * How should reductions behave? Should `mean` over all dims reduce everything, or should we do a local reduction (as we do now?) Perhaps we want a special `mean` for `DistributedField`, and `mean(interior(field))` can still be used for local reductions? We already have to redefine any reductions on `Field`, so it makes sense that we further extend for `Field` on `MultiArch`; * `ReducedField` across the partition is also hard. We can reduce only locally, which could be fine for output in some cases. But if `ReducedField` are used in `AbstractOperation` we clearly need to gather and scatter for that to work. Probably the right thing is to implement gather and scatter by default, and then to add features for ""local `ReducedField` that could maybe be used to optimize I/O performance for the biggest problems.

Modifiability,"hat sometimes `model` has to use a very tiny time-step to bridge the gap between the current time and the output time? If so, that's an interesting possibility that I hadn't considered. Although in the example above I'm fixing the time-step at `25`, while the output time interval is `200`, so I wouldn't expect any issues there. Can you check just to be sure? Because having an output interval that's some multiple of the time step is exactly when we expect to see miniscule time-steps due to round off error. The pressure source term is the divergence of the predictor velocity divided by time-step. As the time-step vanishes, the divergence of the predictor velocity also vanishes (because the flow has not evolved from its previous, non-divergent solution). We get a situation tending to 0/0. I think there's a few things we could do to solve this. First of all if we take a very small time-step, I think we can actually just re-set the model time rather than taking a time-step. Second I am wondering if we want to implement a time type that has finite resolution (ie there is a smallest time increment one can take). For example, datetimes have a smallest unit (micro or nanoseconds). A non-dimensional or dimensional-agnostic time type could also be designed analogously (eg every time is the multiple of an integer by the fundamental unit). This would eliminate round off error but it's a bit of work and also we have to put some thought into how best to accomplish it. There might also be a simpler solution by adjusting how we increment time. I'm not sure. > Also wouldn't that also affect simulations with `buoyancy=nothing` if the pre-output time-step were to blame?. I think so, but I also don't think that you can guarantee this problem won't ever occur. The presence of the buoyancy does somehow impact the divergence that accumulates during a time-step / the pressure correction that has to be applied. So it's possible that the buoyancy configuration affects these results.

Modifiability,"he context of this theory (in other contexts, the drag coefficient is a non-dimensional number that characterizes the bulk drag on an object and in that case its more appropriate). But anyways. When the distance is fixed (ie when we evaluate this on a fixed mesh) --- and the roughness length is given --- then it's a constant. The roughness length is not always constant. Above a wavy free surface, we often use the Charnock relation $\ell = c_g u_\star^2 / g$ where $g$ is gravitational acceleration and $c_g$ is the Charnock parameter, often taken to be $c_g = 0.011$. Above a _smooth_ surface, laboratory measurements indicate $\ell = 0.11 \nu / u_\star$ (the reference for this is hard to pin down, but it dates to laboratory experiments in the 1930s, see [Turbulent transfer near the interface from ""Atmosphere-Ocean interaction""](https://academic.oup.com/book/42082/chapter-abstract/355996383?redirectedFrom=fulltext) by Kraus and Businger). With this background let's talk about how these parameterizations might be implemented in Oceananigans... ## Constant roughness case. For an isotropic grid, _constant roughness length_ case --- a lot of simplification! --- we have to write something like. ```julia; using Oceananigans.Operators: ℑxyᶠᶜᵃ, ℑxyᶜᶠᵃ, ℑxzᶠᵃᶜ, ℑxzᶜᵃᶠ, ℑyzᵃᶠᶜ, ℑyzᵃᶜᶠ. @inline ϕ²(i, j, k, grid, ϕ) = @inbounds ϕ[i, j, k]^2; @inline speedᶠᶜᶜ(i, j, k, grid, u, v, w) = @inbounds sqrt(u[i, j, k]^2 + ℑxyᶠᶜᵃ(i, j, k, grid, ϕ², v) + ℑxzᶠᵃᶜ(i, j, k, grid, ϕ², w)); @inline speedᶜᶠᶜ(i, j, k, grid, u, v, w) = @inbounds sqrt(v[i, j, k]^2 + ℑxyᶜᶠᵃ(i, j, k, grid, ϕ², u) + ℑyzᵃᶠᶜ(i, j, k, grid, ϕ², w)); @inline speedᶜᶜᶠ(i, j, k, grid, u, v, w) = @inbounds sqrt(w[i, j, k]^2 + ℑxzᶜᵃᶠ(i, j, k, grid, ϕ², u) + ℑyzᵃᶜᶠ(i, j, k, grid, ϕ², v)); @inline u_drag(i, j, k, grid, clock, f, cᴰ) = @inbounds - cᴰ * f.u[i, j, k] * speedᶠᶜᶜ(i, j, k, grid, f.u, f.v, f.w); @inline v_drag(i, j, k, grid, clock, f, cᴰ) = @inbounds - cᴰ * f.v[i, j, k] * speedᶜᶠᶜ(i, j, k, grid, f.u, f.v, f.w); @inline w_d",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3807:2450,parameteriz,parameterizations,2450,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3807,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterizations']

A ""boundary condition"" is a flux, gradient, or value of a field (`u`, `v`, `w`, `T`, `S`) at the end (`left`, `right`) in a given direction (`x`, `y`, `z`). ### Pros. * Generality: any boundary condition can be specified; * Similarity to the mathematics: this design corresponds to how boundary conditions are specified in PDEs; * Extensibility: the design accommodates changes in *types* of boundary conditions or changes in dimensionality. (Adding new solution variables requires code modification, but that is true throughout the code). ### Concerns. * It's more complicated than allowing only 3-4 possibilities to users; as @johncmarshall54 says:. > It's not obvious to me what a field boundary condition is, vs a coordinate boundary condition.; Fundamentally we are applying boundary conditions to u, v, w, T, and S fields, and that's it. It all seems a bit too complicated. * The hierarchical dependence of this design on parameterized types creates a lot of possibilities for different boundary conditions to be specified, and this is a concern for performance (@ali-ramadhan). * We aren't sure what to call the function (currently `bc.calc`) whose purpose is to return the value of the boundary condition (either the field value, flux, gradient, or whatever) at a given grid point and simulation time. ### Other miscellaneous thoughts. * This PR implements a backend / abstraction system for specifying boundary conditions. For users we can add as much sugar on top as we want. * As we have discussed, the way we implement boundary conditions is intimately connected to the way that we specify equations.

Modifiability,"he source code. As for the source code and the topic of this issue, I think it will be generally impossible to include the diffusivity fields in the model fields. First of all, closures and diffusivity fields can be user defined. We want people to be free to do creative things in closure design without having to worry about whether trying to merge the diffusivity fields into `model_fields` will cause their model to fail to compile, preventing them from doing work. However, it might be possible to ""whitelist"" some fields when the situation calls for it, like the eddy diffusivities in LES closures. For that we need to introduce a new function, something like `nonhydrostatic_fields` (mirroring the `hydrostatic_fields` we have now for the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`) which, unlike `fields`, is more low-level and not user facing. Then this function can be designed to take `closure` as an argument to support the inclusion of diffusivity fields where appropriate, something like. ```julia; @inline nonhydrostatic_model_fields(closure, velocities, tracers, aux_fields, diffusivity_fields) =; merge(velocities, tracers, aux_fields) # fallback. @inline nonhydrostatic_model_fields(::SmagorinskyLilly, velocities, tracers, aux_fields, diffusivity_fields) =; merge(velocities, tracers, aux_fields, (; νₑ=diffusivity_fields.νₑ)) # desired behavior; ```. then we can use that in the tendency kernel functions. I think this would probably succeed because we can simply omit the closures with too-complex diffusivity fields. It might require a bit more work for closure tuples though. It's an interesting idea for a contribution. But note that the current ways to solve this problem (creating a new field for the forcing, and then utilizing callbacks to compute the needed field during time stepping) are fairly straightforward and also generalize to much more complex situations that I'm not sure it makes sense to go down the rabbit hole of extending `model_fields` to cover more exotic situations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3582#issuecomment-2095180262:2450,extend,extending,2450,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3582#issuecomment-2095180262,1,['extend'],['extending']
Modifiability,"hich accepts the use of a generalized vertical coordinates. 2. Introduce `ZStarCoordinate` (or maybe `FreeSurfaceWeightedVerticalCoordinate`). ""z-star"" vertical coordinate is a relatively simple GVC, with a small, diagnostic time-dependence. A successful implementation will require integrating thickness-weighted equations, correct vertical derivatives, and ensuring correct horizontal pressure gradients. 3. Implement remapping as an alternative to vertical advection and test using `ZCoordinate` and `ZStarCoordinate`. Of course, steps 3 might evolve depending on our experience during step 2. . An important choice that's part of step 1. is whether to use thickness-weighted variables as state variables rather than unweighted variables (eg `hu` rather than `u`, and `hc` rather than `c`. I suspect it makes sense to use thickness-weighted state variables because this simplifies the underlying implementation (for example, we only need `hⁿ` rather than both `hⁿ⁺¹` and `hⁿ` to evolve a tracer field, and we can evaluate the prognostic equations in the same order that we do now), and because it is easy to provide abstractions for users to compute, inspect, and output unweighted variables `u = hu / h`.

Modifiability,"hm described by Makhoul (1982) as CUFFT does not provide cosine transforms for the GPU and does not support FFTs along non-batched dimensions (see https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/issues/119). This has been a very unpopular decision for good reasons. The 2D DCT algorithm is quite slow (channels are ~2x slower than doubly periodic on GPUs) and is quite complicated. Due to my inexperience, I didn't realize that transposing the array to do the FFT was the way forward. The pressure solver module is also quite out of date, it hasn't been updated since topologies were introduced (#614) almost exactly a year ago. This PR refactors the pressure solver module to:; 1. Support all topologies on the CPU and GPU performing transposes and index permutations as needed by each transform.; 2. Use the fastest transforms as allowed by the topology. This means batching dimensions when possible.; 3. Consolidating all pressure solvers into a single solver for all topologies. This should simplify the code and make it easier to extend.

The results for triply-periodic are posted below. Based on the benchmarks, it seems that for 256^3 doing three 1D transforms is ~15% slower than doing one 3D transform. So it makes sense to batch transforms when possible. Note than FFT along dimension 1 is the fastest and FFT along dimension 2 is the slowest. FFT along dimension 3 is in the middle.

Modifiability,"ich is kind of similar to #73 #85. I suppose we can interpret every term in the momentum equation as an ""arbitrary function"". The design I've been using is to define a type that represents part of the governing equation to make the equation modular and changeable by the user. Definitely suggest alternative designs if good alternatives come to mind. > Is a closure always meant to replace the viscous dissipation (𝜈∇²u) operators? Will Smag/AMD replace the Laplacian diffusion operators (e.g. κ∇²T) as well?. I am proposing that we consider using this conceptual model for a ""closure"". Perhaps a better name than ""closure"" is `Dissipation`... ? All of the turbulent closures we are considering introduce a ""turbulent"" viscosity and diffusivity which is typically much larger than the molecular value. Thus a ""molecular"" isotropic diffusivity can be interpreted as the limiting case of a turbulent closure. The reason it might be good design is because turbulent closures can modify boundary conditions (which depend on viscosity/diffusivity), and because we may want to use common implicit time-stepping methods for the turbulent diffusivity in addition to a ""molecular"" diffusivity. > Out of curiousity, can these closures be framed as ODEProblems using DifferentialEquations.jl?. A subgrid turbulent kinetic energy variable in a typical turbulence closure obeys a three-dimensional PDE and is advected, diffused, dissipated, and interacts with terms in the momentum and tracer equation via nonlinear terms. It is a first-class solution variable similar to the velocity field or active tracers.

Modifiability,"iguration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`. Interactive jobs launch faster, so we get a faster trial-error iteration. I'm still working on things, but it seems like another point may be salient:. * Initialize / precompile outside of a parallel job before trying to launch a parallel job via `mpiexec`. Here are some notes that may be specific to engaging:. I'm using `srun` to get a 4-GPU node to use interactively:. ```; srun -p my_partition --tasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:4 --gpus-per-node=4 --mem=0 -t 01:00:00 -N 1; ```. it seems we have to use the option `gpus-per-node`, rather than setting the total number of GPUs. Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node. Finally we also have to specify ``--tasks-per-node=4` (matching `gres` _and_ the number of GPUs per node), otherwise we cannot launch `mpiexec` with 4 tasks (1 for each GPU). It's helpful to have the maximum number of CPUs for precompilation. Otherwise precompilation is very slow. I also set. ```; export JULIA_NUM_PRECOMPILE_TASKS=64; ```. (half the total) --- adapt for your system. Here is also a small test script for debuggin Oceananigans:. ```julia; using Oceananigans; arch = Distributed(GPU()); @show arch; ```. as a side note, it would be nice if we could print to the screen from different ranks without them talking over one another.

Modifiability,"ilities. For example, we might have just doubly periodic in (x, y) plus flux in z on all fields, or singly-periodic in x and flux in (y, z) on all fields. Agree that `CoordinateBoundaryConditions` might be a weird name but yeah, maximum flexibility would be very powerful. Maybe the common use case isn't to impose each of the 30 boundary conditions one-by-one but we can just have nice helper functions/abstractions like; ```julia; model.boundary conditions += HorizontallyPeriodic(); ```. > @ali-ramadhan do you mean with regards to performance? I'm not sure. With multiple dispatch being core to julia it seems this scenario is not uncommon (30+ may not be very large). I'm still pretty new to Julia so yeah don't know if that will be an issue, especially on the GPU. Only way to find out is to try and benchmark! Maybe you're right and 30+ isn't a lot. @vchuravy any idea on whether 30+ parameterized types for a struct is too many? Would this hurt performance on the GPU?. > The function calc does not actually impose a boundary condition --- the imposition of boundary condition depends on, for example, the viscosity and diffusivity, and is a property of the equation (or turbulent closure) being implemented. Again for example, the K-Profile-Parameterization includes a modification of how a flux boundary condition is implemented. In other words, the ""specification of flux"" is separate from the ""imposition of a boundary condition"". The former is determined by the user. The latter is determined by the model/governing equation. I see. So if no parameterizations are being used, are the boundary conditions actually being _imposed_ then? Even with KPP, isn't the boundary condition still being _imposed_ only to later be modified by KPP?. I still feel like `bc.calc()` feels obscure, I'm not sure why a boundary condition should have to calculated.

(Adding new solution variables requires code modification, but that is true throughout the code). ### Concerns. * It's more complicated than allowing only 3-4 possibilities to users; as @johncmarshall54 says:. > It's not obvious to me what a field boundary condition is, vs a coordinate boundary condition.; Fundamentally we are applying boundary conditions to u, v, w, T, and S fields, and that's it. It all seems a bit too complicated. * The hierarchical dependence of this design on parameterized types creates a lot of possibilities for different boundary conditions to be specified, and this is a concern for performance (@ali-ramadhan). * We aren't sure what to call the function (currently `bc.calc`) whose purpose is to return the value of the boundary condition (either the field value, flux, gradient, or whatever) at a given grid point and simulation time. ### Other miscellaneous thoughts. * This PR implements a backend / abstraction system for specifying boundary conditions. For users we can add as much sugar on top as we want. * As we have discussed, the way we implement boundary conditions is intimately connected to the way that we specify equations. This can be seen in the current code (though it is commented out) in that [the lines that specify a no-slip condition depend on the ""vertical viscosity""](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/7fb355d77df98e37a80b3e796291fa2856d3e1ce/src/time_steppers.jl#L293). Adding other diffusive terms (hyperdiffusivity, Leith diffusivity, various turbulent diffusivity parameterizations/closures) can affect how the boundary condition is implemented. We are not ready to develop an equation abstraction system yet, but we must keep in mind the difference between *implementing* a boundary condition in the context of a set of equations, and *specifying* a boundary condition. This PR attempts to solve the latter problem. . * It would be nice to know how MITgcm implements different boundary conditions.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/118#issuecomment-472372026:2117,parameteriz,parameterizations,2117,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/118#issuecomment-472372026,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterizations']
Modifiability,"in general. We currently handle this only during time-stepping --- there is no guarantee, for example, that the diffusivities or ghost cell values are consistent with the velocity field if the velocity field is set by the function `set!` (in fact, the diffusivities are *always* inconsistent with the current velocity field due to the fact that they are calculated *prior* to taking a time-step). If we want to guarantee such a consistency, we can develop the concept of a model ""state"" and apply it to both ocean and atmospheric models (eg a function `update_state!(model)`, or something similar). What does the jargon ""sounding"" mean?. Merger means we need to think carefully about how to reduce boilerplate to minimize (within reason) the cost of maintaining two parallel models as we develop their shared subcomponents. I wonder if splitting off the output writers and diagnostics into a `Simulation` type that wraps `AbstractModel` may help.

This would be easy to implement (while I think an `Equation` abstraction would be relatively difficult due to myriad difficult design problems, including the abstraction of tuples of terms with heterogeneous function signatures, numerical aspects of the equation, implicit vs explicit treatment of terms, etc).; The `Simulation` type can then be used to ""run"" simulations over multiple time steps, eg. ```julia; simulation = Simulation(model, Δt=1.0, end_time=8day, output=output_writers, diagnostics=diagnostics); run!(simulation); ```. and is tasked with managing things like output writing, diagnostics calculation, adaptive time-stepping, and progress logging. Each `Model` then simply needs to define a function that performs a single time-step to interface with `Simulation`. This is discussed further in #447.

Modifiability,"is PR proposes to eliminate the pressure decomposition so that there is only one pressure. In principle, this has a computational advantage because the hydrostatic pressure integral does not need to be evaluated (in practice, this computation has a negligible cost). It also reduces the number of memory loads that take place in the momentum advection kernels (though these are typically domained by advection scheme, so this may not matter except for centered advection schemes). Also in principle, it would allow 3D domain decompositions for distributed computations, in addition to 2D (but again, these are rarely used because typical ocean domains are shallow and wide, rather than deep and narrow). Having a single pressure also simplifies diagnostics. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we can avoid allocating memory for an additional 3D field. In the absolute best case scenario of a model with no tracers and pure implicit dissipation, this means we go from 14 3D fields (9 for prognostic momentum + tendencies, 4 (?) for nonhydrostatic pressure including scratch variables for FFTs, and 1 for hydrostatic pressure) to 13 3D fields. So it saves about 7%. In more typical situations with LES closure and one active tracer, the savings is more marginal: we go from 19 3D fields to 18 3D fields, and thus have 5% more memory. Note also that more scratch variables are needed for FFTs in domains that are not horizontally-periodic. (This memory bookkeeping should be double checked.). In summary, the main advantages and risks of this PR are:. **Risk**: loss of accuracy in scenarios that are dominated by hydrostatic balance. This issues may be exacerbated by experimental or not-yet-existing features, such as: cut cell and partial cell bathymetry, curvilinear grids, nonlinear free surfaces, reduced precision arithemetic, etc. . **Advantage**: memory savings of at most 7% but more typically 1-5%, and a cleaner code and user interface.

Then users might write. ```julia; Oceananigans.settings[:default_number_type] = Float32; ```. This avoids the string-based restriction of environment variables, so may generalize to more types of settings should we need that. It's a slippery slope of course, we want to keep this to a minimum because global settings inhibit programmability (ie one cannot have multiple simulations in a single instance with different settings). Here, the setting only controls a default, so it remains possible to have two simulations in one instance with different number types --- they just cannot be set up simultaneously (or one has to do more work to set the number type ""manually""). External packages can opt into using this only if they depend on Oceananigans. Which may be ok, in fact. External packages that extend Oceananigans of course must depend on Oceananigans. There is just the question of what to do with SeawaterPolynomials, where the dependency goes the other direction... I thought of the environment-variable approach so that SeawaterPolynomials could implement it without depending on Oceananigans. But as I think about it more, it is hacky for SeawaterPolynomials to contain an environment variable called OCEANANIGANS_NUMBER_TYPE. So now I think the second approach may be better in fact, and to support this kind of thing with SeawaterPolynomials, perhaps what we need is a way to extend the key SeawaterPolynomials constructors inside Oceananigans somehow.

Modifiability,"l and we end up with `Nx*Ny` tridiagonal systems, one for each column so they can be solved in parallel. We might be able to speed up the already fast tridiagonal solve via cyclic reduction. For PNN boundary conditions, it should work if we use an FFT in the x and a DCT in the y. So far I have a working 1D solver. The two tricks that had to be made were:; 1. @christophernhill figured out that we need to stop the algorithm once a zero eigenvalue is reached. This should only occur at the last element for our tridiagonal systems.; 2. There are `Nz+1` faces in the vertical but we only keep track of the first `Nz`. The tridiagonal system needs to explicitly account for all `Nz+1` faces. Thus we impose the staggered Neumann boundary conditions at `k=Nz+1` and the (Nz+1)th entry of right-hand-side is zero. (Chris probably told me this but I forgot...) Previously, the DCT did this for us as all the eigenfunctions satisfied the boundary condition anyways. I tested it against our existing solver but it doesn't work for variable dz yet. Not sure if it's because of my implementation of the Laplacian in PR #283 or because I discretized the vertical derivative incorrectly here. Just opening this PR early so everyone's in the loop. I'm not 100% sure whether we will be able to utilize cyclic reduction:; * I think you need a symmetric tridiagonal system (or at least block-symmetric) which we don't have when the grid is vertically stretched. Maybe this is a sign that I discretized things wrong?; * It can be modified for Neumann boundary conditions (which break the symmetry on the first and last rows) but in this case it seems cyclic reduction must be applied recursively `m+1` times for a system of size `Nz = 2^m + 1`. The optimal number of cyclic reductions is `log2(log2(Nz))` so it's possible that we don't gain much. There may also be numerical accuracy issues with taking too many cyclic reduction steps.

A boundary condition is now specified by defining a function that calculates it within a kernel that loops over the boundary in question. The arguments of a flux boundary conditions on a top or bottom boundary (the only situation supported so far) are. ```julia; u, v, w, T, S, t, step, Nx, Ny, Nz, Δx, Δy, Δz, i, j; ```. This will probably change in the future. The user API is rather threadbare at the moment. To define a constant flux boundary condition, for example, the user might write (to specify the boundary condition as a function). ```julia; model = Model(...). const constant_flux = # something; surface_temperature_flux(args...) = constant_flux; flux_bc = BoundaryCondition{Flux}(surface_temperature_flux); model.boundary_conditions.T.z.right = flux_bc; ```. to specify the boundary condition as a constant, . ```julia; model = Model(...). flux_bc = BoundaryCondition(Flux, constant_flux); model.boundary_conditions.T.z.right = flux_bc; ```. There are probably some sugary things that we can implement to smooth this specification. ### Caveats. * We support only flux boundary conditions at top and bottom at the moment; * We can only handle fluxes in terms of the constant vertical viscosities and diffusivities; * If the viscosities and diffusivities are allowed to vary in the vertical at some point in the future, we will have to re-configure the implementation; * We cannot intercept the specification of a flux if we have, for example, a parameterization like KPP that takes care of the surface fluxes with a closure (rather than as a boundary condition). ### A side note.

Modifiability,"losures for LES and ocean modeling (Dynamic Smagorinsky, Deardorff, k-epsilon, Gent-McWilliams, convective adjustment (?) etc --- physics). We have a need to implement new turbulence closures new and old alike. Gent-McWilliams is probably easy since we already have a Leith closure implemented which calculates the tensor needed to rotate the diffusivity into an isopycnal coordinate. The others are a bit more challenging. 4. Extensive profiling and benchmarking on the GPU to identify bottlenecks / places for improvement in the algorithm (numerics). We might be able to make the code a lot faster (but we aren't sure). 5. A solver for hydrostatic problems with a free surface that uses a split-explicit time-integration method. This is notoriously tricky, but we've made a lot of progress on this for the purposes of the ClimateMachine and it might be interesting to translate what we've learned into Oceananigans. There's also some minor package stuff that I want to work on, such as refactoring the output writer (#963), improving logging / feedback while oceananigans builds a model or runs a simulation (#1013), getting arrays with named axes to work (#457), and figuring out what's going wrong with models that have `Flat` dimensions (#1024). A more fun project is to come up with cool plotting recipes in 1D, 2D, and 3D (!) We'd like to show people how to use Makie (for example) to create really cool visualizations / animations of turbulence. The examples do some animation, but more complicated stuff (such as 3D contourf plots, or volume rendering) might require dedicated scripts. @navidcy and I have also discussed projects to implement 1) a shallow water model using Oceananigans functionality and 2) a quasi-geostrophic model in Oceananigans (which would use the tridiagonal solver I mentioned earlier). What else? The best project is probably one that aligns with you and your students' research... ? Definitely happy to chat further and also collaborate on something if you'd like.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1153#issuecomment-724262281:2654,refactor,refactoring,2654,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1153#issuecomment-724262281,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

You can always try with higher order (maybe 7th?) but the higher the order the lower the stability (i.e. at a certain order your implicit dissipation will be so low that you will start to generate grid-scale noise). . The KE dissipation is there with `closure=nothing` and a WENO scheme, it is just not strictly physical: it's (roughly) akin to a 4th to a 6th-order hyperviscosity. You can compare this to using `UpwindBiased(order = 5)` which would give you everywhere a dissipation that converges to a 6th-order hyperviscosity. In general:. $$\partial_x {uu}^{Upwind_N} \sim \partial_x {uu}^{Centered_{N+1}} + \partial_x {K_{numerical}} \partial_x^{N} u$$. where $K_{numerical} \sim \Delta x u$ and $N$ is the order. The nice thing about using WENO instead of a simple Upwind discretization is that the order of the hyperviscosity adapts to the smoothness of the field. Therefore, where the field is noisier (like in regions of higher gradients) the dissipation is more aggressive. . This procedure not only ensures a smooth field but can be thought of as mimicking the subgrid-scale dissipation (which also increases with the gradient of resolved scale variables. As such people have referred to using particularly diffusive advective schemes (such as WENO) as _Implicit_ LES. I like the idea of implicit LES because it allows you to ""fill in"" for the subgrid-scale dissipation without committing to any sophisticated formulation derived in a particularly idealized situation (take the example of Leith derived in homogeneous 2D turbulence and the geostrophic eddies in the ocean), and guarantees (or at least helps) stability. For this reason, it's pretty handy when you have different unresolved processes at different scales that may be characterized by different dissipation characteristics.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2869#issuecomment-1404144433:1749,variab,variables,1749,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2869#issuecomment-1404144433,1,['variab'],['variables']

So basically there's a discontinuity in the vertical direction's pressure, which causes an artificial vertical pressure gradient, causing a spurious flow at the top and bottom, even those aren't supposed to be boundaries since the grid is periodic in `z`.; It seems like this comes from the fact that the hydrostatic pressure isn't periodic (since it always comes from a vertical b integral I think), but the nonhydrostatic pressure *is* periodic. This in turn leads the total pressure to have a discontinuity. In fact if we run the exact same configuration but make both the gravitational direction and the periodic direction the `x` direction (code [here](https://pastebin.com/skAB1Bt4)) we have a plume looks and behaves as expected and has no discontinuities:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/13205162/97ab7df9-4b64-4f65-9433-4eb9a5e7fe22. I'm not sure if this is something that needs fixing or if it's just a consequence of the hydrostatic decomposition, which always assumes gravity is in the `NegativeZDirection()` and that `z` is `Bounded`. Hence I'm not sure this is better left as an issue or a discussion, so please lmk if I should move this to a discussion. Also, if I run the example above (where gravity is in the `z` direction) using https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3080, which gets rid of the hydrostatic pressure separation, then I get what I believe to be the correct behavior (all pressures in the animation below are actually total pressure):. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/13205162/60ef470d-22d7-429a-9029-adb7db5687ba.

In the experiment, I have specified both the initial temperature (perturbation) and a constant background temperature < T > gradient, so that the total temperature T_total = < T > + T.; ; The movie below shows T_total and presents two simple experiments with an existing initial temperature. In the blue case, the default no-flux boundary condition is applied (i.e., no gradient in the wall-normal direction), but the gradient at the boundaries is nonzero because the boundary condition does not account for the background temperature. In contrast, the red case includes a boundary condition that forces the gradient of T_total to be 0. ; With this corrected boundary condition (red curve), the flux at the boundaries is 0, which is physical.

It solves two problems: messy module files, and makes it easier to understand where import statements are used. Maybe we do things differently, but I always scroll to the top of the current file to look for import statements. I've never thought to look the module top-level file. Additionally, a list of import statements at the top of the file tell me what to expect in this file.

In julia, resolving method conflicts when two packages export the same name can be tricky and the resolution depends on the order in which packages are imported. We can break with convention when needed, but presumably this is the rare exception rather than rule. > I think having more submodules (#495, #456) is really the right solution to this problem; in that case each module is short so the issue of tracing import statements to usage within a huge module is alleviated. Yeah maybe after we have more submodule it'll be clearer how to tackle this issue and maybe it won't be as bad. Although I think some refactoring/reorganizing/reordering of import statements may be needed to make the import statements more local.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/497#issuecomment-547225547:3004,refactor,refactoring,3004,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/497#issuecomment-547225547,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

We have asynchronous output writing #137 but spending 2-3 minutes to write out the fields of a 256³ grid is ridiculous.; * Compression doesn't seem to work in NetCDF.jl: See https://github.com/JuliaGeo/NetCDF.jl/issues/87; * We might want to share this output writing feature with CliMA.jl. See https://github.com/climate-machine/CLIMA/issues/114; * @simonbyrne and @charleskawczynski suggested looking at [HDF5.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/HDF5.jl). As NetCDF4 is built on HDF5, we should be able to generate valid NetCDF files with it.; * Whatever we end up doing, @christophernhill makes a good point that we should produce portable NetCDF files as this is what all our potential users would expect and want.; * Thinking more long-term @lcw says that IO performance is a hard problem and thinks we are going to want something that plays well on clusters (e.g., something MPI IO based). Some extra features we might want in the short-term:; - [ ] Option to only write out a specific subset of the model state, e.g. surface velocities only, or a vertical temperature slice. This would really speed up IO if you don't need full 3D fields.; - [ ] Select which fields to write out to NetCDF.; - [ ] Include diagnostics in NetCDF output. I believe this will be possible if we resolve the item above as output writing occurs right after diagnostics are run, so diagnostic fields can just be included as one of the fields to write out.; - [ ] Option to create one NetCDF file for each iteration, or to combine all output into one NeCDF file. I think the main point of this issue is that we should decide how to output NetCDF.

Modifiability,"nicDiffusivity` (defaults to 2) to be specified by the user which sets the required halo for the specific `ν` or `κ` function (closures have now an explicitly required number of halos); #### **Major** internals change; 1) The tendencies are calculated at the **end** of a time step. Therefore at the end of a simulation `model.timestepper` will hold tendencies for the last time step completed . 2) Removed `fill_halo_regions!` for hydrostatic pressure in both the non-hydrostatic and the hydrostatic model and for w-velocity in the hydrostatic model. The halos are filled by enlarging the size of the kernels in `update_hydrostatic_pressure!` and `compute_w_from_continuity!` to incorporate the needed ghost points. 2) Removed `fill_halo_regions!` for diffusivities **only for halo-passing BC**; the halo calculation is now performed by launching the `calculate_diffusivity!` kernel inside the ghost nodes before recomputing the tendencies. This requires knowing how many halos each closure requires. 3) Added a _required_halo_ parameter to `AbstractTurbulenceClosure`. This means that each parameterization will have to specify explicitly the number of halos required to calculate the diffusivity: ; e.g ; ```julia; abstract type AbstractTurbulenceClosure{TimeDiscretization, BoundaryBuffer} end; abstract type AbstractScalarDiffusivity{TD, F, N} <: AbstractTurbulenceClosure{TD, N} end; struct TwoDimensionalLeith{FT, CR, GM, M} <: AbstractScalarDiffusivity{ExplicitTimeDiscretization, ThreeDimensionalFormulation, 2}; ``` ; Where Leith closure requires 2 halos (one for the vorticity calculation and an additional one for the vorticity derivative). #### **Minor** internals change; removed the general `calculate_nonlinear_viscosity!` and `calculate_nonlinear_diffusivity!` kernels (to each turbulence closure their own kernel). ~Requires https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl/pull/399 # On hold at the moment~; Closes #615; Closes #1882; Closes #3067; Closes #3068 ; Supersedes #2953",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3125:4263,parameteriz,parameterization,4263,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3125,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterization']

Modifiability,"ntext of the Nonhydrostatic model and having some success but some difficulties as well. We have tried two different approaches: . Method 1: define the jet and stratification to be part of the background field and evolve the perturbations. Method 2: define the jet and stratification as part of the initial conditons and evolve the total field. These are mathematically equivalent and should both yield the same results, but we are finding a difference and believe there is a problem with method 2 (evolving the total fields). . When pick there to be zero perturbations, the jet is an exact solution to the governing equations (even though it is an unstable one) and it should persist, until perturbations arise because of numerical errors. The good news is that when we use method 1, evolve the perturbations, when we pick zero perturbations, no pertrubations develop for a long time. . The not so good news, is that when we use method 2, evolve the total field, a distrubance develops right away,in the center of the jet that spans the entire depth, and this seems to radiate gravity waves to the left and right. The amplitude of the distrubance is small and it does decrease with increasing resolution but it seems problematic. I am going to include an animation that shows the problem that develops in the first 6 hours and the two codes, which are almost identical. Is there something that we are doing wrong here? @glwagner ?.

Modifiability,"o switch on/off different terms in the MEKE budget. For instance, as of now, MOM6 OM4 only uses the `PrognosticMEKEDiffusivity` (and no backscatter), but the CPT and others are looking into the energetically-constrained backscatter term intensively these days!; 3. **MEKE vs. GEOMETRIC**: As you mention above, the two schemes are very similar. There are maybe three notable differences: ; a) **energy type**: MEKE solves a prognostic equation for `EKE`, whereas GEOMETRIC solves a prognostic equation for `EKE + EPE`. To inform GM, the two schemes then use the variable `2 * EKE` and `EKE + EPE`, respectively. [Bachman (2017)](10.1016/j.ocemod.2016.12.004) found that in practice, kappa_GM is not sensitive to whether one solves for `EKE` (as MEKE does) or `EKE + EPE` (as GEOMETRIC does). So we could probably start by following the MEKE approach, and just solve for `EKE`.; b) **GM/energy source term**: In MEKE, it is left to the user how to specify the mixing length scale `L_mix` in `kappa_GM = c * sqrt(2 MEKE) * L_mix` and in the inferred MEKE source term. (Options are: the deformation scale, Rhines scale, grid scale, frictional halting scale, Eady length scale, or any combination of those, see [here](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6/blob/0e8acd90b46656ccb7fbc73bc5911ef2733a345c/src/parameterizations/lateral/MOM_MEKE.F90#L995-L1012).) In GEOMETRIC, the mixing length scale is essentially chosen as the Eady length scale. So if you use MEKE with the Eady length scale `L_e` (see Appendix Ab in Kong and Jansen, 2021), you recover the GEOMETRIC source term.; c) **sub-grid dissipation**: MEKE assumes only bottom drag, GEOMETRIC uses one ""catch-all"" linear damping term as the energy sink term in the sub-grid energy budget. As highlighted in [Mak et al. (2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL097259), this sub-grid dissipation term is probably the big elephant in the room, which the solution is very sensitive to but noone knows what the term should look like.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2431#issuecomment-1122829692:2466,parameteriz,parameterizations,2466,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2431#issuecomment-1122829692,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterizations']
Modifiability,"o the 3D compressible Euler equations. The free-surface SW is a compressible model, which is why we don't have to solve any elliptic problem, and instead we simply integrate the three prognostic equations. . The rigid-lid SW model (which we don't have yet) is different of course. I am sure we can use the existing solves to determine the surface pressure as the hydrostatic model currently does. Here are some thoughts to consider:. 1. Introducing topography is pretty easy but when we do so, we should probably introduce a free-surface. Following the convention of the hydrostatic model seems like the way to proceed. Agreed?; 2. Visosity is not difficult to include but there's a question of which form of viscosity to include. The standard harmonic or biharmonic diffiusivities would be good choices, where they act on the velocities not the transport velocities. If we had a `VectorInvariant` form then I think we could use the current libraries. For the conservative forms, I think we have to adapt them, which will take more effort I suspect.; 3. Note: these forms of viscosity are not strictly positive preserving and they can increase kinetic energy. I know of a form of the harmonic case that is positive preserving and we could include that. But does anyone case about those levels of details? If yes I can include the form in the writeup and even a short derivation of how to get it from the 3D equations.; 4. @glwagner pointed out that `ShallowWaterModel` is very separate from everything else in Oceananigans and that is a bit of a pain to maintain. One advantage of a `VectorInvariant` form is that it could rely heavily on `HydrostaticModel`, that way they grow together. It might even ben an embarassingly simply application.; 5. I would like there to be a switch from free-surface to rigid-lid. In the latter we have to solve an elliptic problem, and again probably easier with a `VectorInvariant` form but probably not difficult with a conservative form either.

Modifiability,"ognostic equation (fully Lagrangian isopycnal coordinates, semi-Lagrangian hybrid coordinates / _z-tilde_ coordinates that vary only with high frequency motion, and adaptive methods that prescribe GVC dynamics to obtain favorable properties like concentration in regions of strong stratification). A fully general GVC typically also requires a ""Lagrangian remapping"" step to avoid extreme grid distortions in regions of persistent vertical velocities. The implementation of GVC is likely a major refactoring of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` because it will change the equations of motion and could even potentially change the nature of its prognostic variables. For time-dependent GVC, tracer equations must be reformulated in terms of the ""thickness-weighted"" tracer concentration, which in our case means the tracer concentration normalized by the local grid spacing. This could mean either using the thickness-weighted tracer conservation as a state variable, or it could mean rewriting the time-stepping algorithm so that unweighted tracer conservation can be updated according to the conservation of thickness-weighted tracer. A preliminary roadmap towards GVC in `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is. 1. Introduce `AbstractVerticalCoordinate` and refactor the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` to integrate thickness-weighted equations. When using `ZCoordinate`, the resulting model produces identical results to the current implementation of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. I think we will also want a rectilinear grid to use for testing to avoid modifying `RegularRectilinearGrid`, such as a refactored or reimplemented three-dimensionally `StretchedRectilinearGrid` from #1532 which accepts the use of a generalized vertical coordinates. 2. Introduce `ZStarCoordinate` (or maybe `FreeSurfaceWeightedVerticalCoordinate`). ""z-star"" vertical coordinate is a relatively simple GVC, with a small, diagnostic time-dependence.

Modifiability,"on getting a WENO-5 tracer advection scheme working in Julia. Thanks @RaphaelRR for helping with the WENO-5 advection scheme!. This PR adds a 1D advection verification experiment to start exploring different advection schemes and time steppers to help us decide what to implement. I hope this PR can serve as test-driven development: Oceananigans should be able to reproduce the results of this PR, at which point it becomes a true verification experiment. `weno.jl` defines `advective_tracer_flux` functions (`weno5_flux`) so it should work nicely with the existing `Oceananigans.Operators`. At some point in the future I'd like to follow this PR up with a 2D advection test using the Munk gyre solution. Should also test momentum advection. Of course, can't always generalize 1D advection results to 3D turbulence simulations... Things to do to integrate WENO-5:; 1. Design an abstraction for selecting advection schemes.; 2. Extend to multi-dimensional advection scheme.; 3. Extend to a momentum advection scheme as well.; 4. Decide whether we want WENO-3 and/or WENO-7 (or even higher-order advection schemes). Note: On extending to multi-dimensional advection, we can perform the 1D WENO interpolation along each dimension separately to come up with a multidimensional advection scheme. This is what most packages do in practice as true multidimensional would involve huge stencils (and some numerical quadrature?) so it's not worth it for the small increase in accuracy. Doing it dimension-wise might be fine at lower order like WENO <= 7. I should cite the appropriate papers for these claims. This relatively recent paper might be of interest to us: Buchmüller & Helzel (2014), [Improved Accuracy of High-Order WENO Finite Volume Methods on Cartesian Grids](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-014-9825-1).

We call this a `Computation`. From the tests:. ```julia; T, S = model.tracers; computation = Computation(S + T, model.pressures.pHY′); compute!(computation); ```. which launches a 3D kernel to compute the result of an `AbstractOperation` at every grid point, storing the result in `computation.result` (which here has been defined as `model.pressures.pHY′`). We also extend `HorizontalAverage` to work with `Computation`, (and add a constructor that constructs a `Computation` from an `AbstractOperation` and `Model`), eg. ```julia; T, S = model.tracers; ST = HorizontalAverage(S + T, model); computed_profile = ST(model); ```. Calling `run_diagnostic` for `HorizontalAverage{<:Computation}` first calls `compute!(computation)`, and then compute the horizontal average of `computation.result`. # Some important details. * This PR changes the meaning of `data`, which is used extensively in forming operations. This resolves #454. A new function `interior` serves the original purpose of `data`. * This PR depends on the arbitrary tracers PR.

Modifiability,"or example, we'll have to make sure all unit tests for differential operators pass before we can add a new biogeochemistry model implementation. I think development might be faster and more accessible if we do it in a different repo. There are also some details to discuss regarding implementation. Oceananigans' design already supports reacting systems via `Forcing`. Oceananigans `Forcing` are arbitrary functions of spatial coordinates, time, prognostic model fields, and forcing function parameters --- or alternatively, indices `i, j, k`, `grid`, `clock`, and a NamedTuple of model fields that can be indexed into arbitrarily. @iuryt and @syou83syou83 (and perhaps others) have experimented in this direction. However, I think we might benefit from adding a model property to both `NonhydrostaticModel` and `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` that's specifically dedicated to `biogeochemistry`, and designing an interface that allows users / other packages (like Biogeoceananigans.jl) to build custom `biogeochemistry` types. One advantage I think is we'll have more flexibility in designing the code that hooks into Oceananigans than if we limit ourselves to using `model.forcing`. I also think it will yield a cleaner and more interpretable user API: biogeochemistry models are sometimes complicated, so it's helpful to disentangle their specification from the specification of more ""vanilla"" forcing terms, like sponge layers, etc. We may want special time-stepping methods for some types of biogeochemistry in the future. I also think we can build an interface for `biogeochemistry` that uses similar or identical syntax to `Forcing` (like requiring functions of `x, y, z, t, fields` --- etc) because this will allow directly transferring code for biogeochemistry models that's first implemented as a system of forcing functions (a very common and useful development paradigm).

Modifiability,"otentially change the nature of its prognostic variables. For time-dependent GVC, tracer equations must be reformulated in terms of the ""thickness-weighted"" tracer concentration, which in our case means the tracer concentration normalized by the local grid spacing. This could mean either using the thickness-weighted tracer conservation as a state variable, or it could mean rewriting the time-stepping algorithm so that unweighted tracer conservation can be updated according to the conservation of thickness-weighted tracer. A preliminary roadmap towards GVC in `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is. 1. Introduce `AbstractVerticalCoordinate` and refactor the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` to integrate thickness-weighted equations. When using `ZCoordinate`, the resulting model produces identical results to the current implementation of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. I think we will also want a rectilinear grid to use for testing to avoid modifying `RegularRectilinearGrid`, such as a refactored or reimplemented three-dimensionally `StretchedRectilinearGrid` from #1532 which accepts the use of a generalized vertical coordinates. 2. Introduce `ZStarCoordinate` (or maybe `FreeSurfaceWeightedVerticalCoordinate`). ""z-star"" vertical coordinate is a relatively simple GVC, with a small, diagnostic time-dependence. A successful implementation will require integrating thickness-weighted equations, correct vertical derivatives, and ensuring correct horizontal pressure gradients. 3. Implement remapping as an alternative to vertical advection and test using `ZCoordinate` and `ZStarCoordinate`. Of course, steps 3 might evolve depending on our experience during step 2. . An important choice that's part of step 1. is whether to use thickness-weighted variables as state variables rather than unweighted variables (eg `hu` rather than `u`, and `hc` rather than `c`. I suspect it makes sense to use thickness-weighted state variables because this simplifies the underlying implementation (for example",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1679:2090,refactor,refactored,2090,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1679,1,['refactor'],['refactored']

For closures, all tracer-diffusivity-related fields permit users to specify either:. * a constant (applied to all tracers), or ; * a `NamedTuple` with fields for *every* tracer. . In the future, we could possibly implement some mixed behavior where the user specifies both a default *and* particular values for tracer diffusivity. This would be useful in the (possibly rare) use-case of a large number of tracers with the same diffusivity, but where one or two of them require a special, different diffusivity. I am not sure this API is necessary so I left it for future work. Diffusivity-like fields include:. * `κ` (constant component of tracer diffusivity) for `ConstantIsotropicDiffusivity`, `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation`, and `ConstantSmagorinsky`; * `Pr` (turbulent Prandtl number) for `ConstantSmagorinsky`; * `κh` and `κv` for `ConstantAnisotropicDiffusivity`. ## Internal algorithmic considerations. This implementation includes a major refactor of the time-stepping algorithm. In particular, kernels are launched for *each* tracer for all operations that involve tracers. This differs from the previous pattern, in which a single kernel was called in some cases (for example, to update the velocity and tracer fields, or to store previous source terms). The reason for this change is because I ran into some issues (dynamic function invocations) using `ntuple` to unroll a loop over tracers inside the kernel. In addition, I think that with a large number of tracers the kernels may become too large and their performance could degrade (but I'm not sure). This refactoring of the algorithm means we need to . - [ ] benchmark the changes in this PR to see if there are any significant changes in model performance. . @ali-ramadhan, can you help with this?.

For example, there are several functions that, based on name, appear to do the same thing (`νᶜᶜᶜ`, `calc_νᶜᶜᶜ`, `getdiffusivity`; there's also a `calc_κᶜᶜᶜ` but no `κᶜᶜᶜ` function) and often the naming of the variables also doesn't help much. For example in these lines:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/56c70fb07eeeb8171958dc62ed7948ff2617cf7a/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/anisotropic_minimum_dissipation.jl#L138. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/56c70fb07eeeb8171958dc62ed7948ff2617cf7a/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/anisotropic_minimum_dissipation.jl#L160. it's not clear to me what's `c`, `C`, `U`. It takes some amount of digging for me (who, admittedly, am not super familiar with the code) to conclude that `c` is the `tracer` and `U` is the `velocities` tuple. (I'm still not 100% sure what `C` is). I understand that, again, I'm not super familiar with the code, so most Oceananigans developers would understand that module faster than me, but I think it's advantageous to make the code in general more easily understandable for",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2751:1702,variab,variables,1702,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2751,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"propriately under the hood. For constant `ValueBoundaryCondition` (eg no-slip) or constant `FluxBoundaryCondition`, this is simple --- just copy the boundary condition into every direction. For `FluxBoundaryCondition` we orient the flux along the inward normal (eg positive for `west, south, bottom` and negative for `east, north, top`. This breaks existing convention for fluxes... but we really don't have a choice. We may want to change the convention for the _other_ boundaries eventually. `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` is perhaps the most important case since we'll use this to implement drag boundary conditions. For this I believe we can use the existing infrastructure for `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` (eg we have a way to properly interpolate fields in a manner consistent with the application of drag boundary conditions, etc). It's functionality will have to be extended to accept functions of `i, j, k` (the way it works now is that the ""third"" index (normal to the boundary) is stored inside the object; for immersed boundary conditions we don't need that). `DiscreteBoundaryFunction` won't be very convenient for most people for immersed boundary conditions, but we can treat it the same way we treat constant `Value` or `Flux`. I wasn't planning to implement support for `Gradient` just yet, though this can be done too. Finally, one remaining task is to define or generalize the existing `conditional_flux` so that it adds fluxes only on _immersed_ boundaries. It looks like right now it's too eager and will add fluxes on non-immersed boundaries. Associated with this development I'd like to refactor our naming scheme for the boolean tools we have. Right now these are `solid_node` and `solid_interface`. I'd like to change `solid_node` to `external_node` (ie external to the active domain) and perhaps something like `external_or_boundary_node` for `solid_interface` to represent _both_ nodes that are completely external, or which lie _on_ the boundary.

Modifiability,"rdinate` and refactor the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` to integrate thickness-weighted equations. When using `ZCoordinate`, the resulting model produces identical results to the current implementation of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. I think we will also want a rectilinear grid to use for testing to avoid modifying `RegularRectilinearGrid`, such as a refactored or reimplemented three-dimensionally `StretchedRectilinearGrid` from #1532 which accepts the use of a generalized vertical coordinates. 2. Introduce `ZStarCoordinate` (or maybe `FreeSurfaceWeightedVerticalCoordinate`). ""z-star"" vertical coordinate is a relatively simple GVC, with a small, diagnostic time-dependence. A successful implementation will require integrating thickness-weighted equations, correct vertical derivatives, and ensuring correct horizontal pressure gradients. 3. Implement remapping as an alternative to vertical advection and test using `ZCoordinate` and `ZStarCoordinate`. Of course, steps 3 might evolve depending on our experience during step 2. . An important choice that's part of step 1. is whether to use thickness-weighted variables as state variables rather than unweighted variables (eg `hu` rather than `u`, and `hc` rather than `c`. I suspect it makes sense to use thickness-weighted state variables because this simplifies the underlying implementation (for example, we only need `hⁿ` rather than both `hⁿ⁺¹` and `hⁿ` to evolve a tracer field, and we can evaluate the prognostic equations in the same order that we do now), and because it is easy to provide abstractions for users to compute, inspect, and output unweighted variables `u = hu / h`. The pros and cons of this important choice should be discussed.

One could then expand on this design by setting up the `diagnostics` field to accept a list of callable objects or functions.

As for option 1 of using a logging package, perhaps it could be nice to use some logging functionality that's configurable with global variables (?) rather than manually creating a `ProgressPrinter` that does ""brute force"" printing as I have described above. However I think that it would require some customization of existing logging packages, since the typical `info` or `debug` settings are not sufficient for the purposes of logging simulation output (right?) Instead, we would need more options, and it'd be nice to obtain the ability to also print the output of diagnostics / monitoring functions, as we do in the example script. And I think doing it this way might involve adding some lines to our time stepping loop. Perhaps @ali-ramadhan has more to say. Another thing we have talked about is somehow having the ability to live-update messages in the terminal (rather than printing a stream of message).

Modifiability,"rsed_bc, velocities, tracers, clock, buoyancy); ```. This would allow the `immersed` boundary condition specified by the user to make its way into the tendency calculation. We think this might be simpler (in terms of the code) than passing `immersed_bc` into ` ∂ⱼ_τ₁ⱼ` (where we would throw it away unless we are on `ImmersedBoundaryGrid`.). Another advantage is that we can then isolate the code that calculates flux divergences for `Value` and `Gradient` (eg for no-slip boundary conditions), which could get a little complicated. I'm also trying to figure out if that would cover this case. I think we can use `ContinuousBoundaryCondition` for this kind of drag boundary condition. So in the user script we'd write something like. ```julia; u_drag(x, y, z, t, u, v, w, Cd) = - Cd * u * sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + w^2); v_drag(x, y, z, t, u, v, w, Cd) = - Cd * v * sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + w^2); w_drag(x, y, z, t, u, v, w, Cd) = - Cd * w * sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + w^2). u_immersed_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(u_drag, parameters=Cd, field_dependencies=(:u, :v, :w)); v_immersed_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(v_drag, parameters=Cd, field_dependencies=(:u, :v, :w)); w_immersed_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(w_drag, parameters=Cd, field_dependencies=(:u, :v, :w)). u_boundary_conditions = FieldBoundaryConditions(immersed=u_immersed_bc); v_boundary_conditions = FieldBoundaryConditions(immersed=v_immersed_bc); w_boundary_conditions = FieldBoundaryConditions(immersed=w_immersed_bc); ```. and then under the hood, if we implement fluxes across immersed boundaries correctly, we'll get the right thing? Note the above code assumes that fluxes are along the ""inward facing normal"" --- one of the complications of the user API for this...

Modifiability,"s of strong stratification). A fully general GVC typically also requires a ""Lagrangian remapping"" step to avoid extreme grid distortions in regions of persistent vertical velocities. The implementation of GVC is likely a major refactoring of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` because it will change the equations of motion and could even potentially change the nature of its prognostic variables. For time-dependent GVC, tracer equations must be reformulated in terms of the ""thickness-weighted"" tracer concentration, which in our case means the tracer concentration normalized by the local grid spacing. This could mean either using the thickness-weighted tracer conservation as a state variable, or it could mean rewriting the time-stepping algorithm so that unweighted tracer conservation can be updated according to the conservation of thickness-weighted tracer. A preliminary roadmap towards GVC in `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is. 1. Introduce `AbstractVerticalCoordinate` and refactor the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` to integrate thickness-weighted equations. When using `ZCoordinate`, the resulting model produces identical results to the current implementation of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. I think we will also want a rectilinear grid to use for testing to avoid modifying `RegularRectilinearGrid`, such as a refactored or reimplemented three-dimensionally `StretchedRectilinearGrid` from #1532 which accepts the use of a generalized vertical coordinates. 2. Introduce `ZStarCoordinate` (or maybe `FreeSurfaceWeightedVerticalCoordinate`). ""z-star"" vertical coordinate is a relatively simple GVC, with a small, diagnostic time-dependence. A successful implementation will require integrating thickness-weighted equations, correct vertical derivatives, and ensuring correct horizontal pressure gradients. 3. Implement remapping as an alternative to vertical advection and test using `ZCoordinate` and `ZStarCoordinate`.

Modifiability,"s without waiting for the communication to complete.; - the `only_local_halos::Bool` keyword argument, which fills only the halo in case of a local (i.e., Flux, Value, Gradient, Periodic, and, temporarily, MultiRegionCommunication) boundary condition. This is required for having explicit boundary conditions (like Value or Flux) for turbulent diffusivities (we directly calculate diffusivities in the halos in the case of distributed BC). This PR allows hiding MPI passing of barotropic auxiliary variables behind the implicit vertical solver and prognostic variables behind the tendency calculations. The latter is done by splitting the tendency kernels into an interior kernel that calculates tendencies between, e.g., `i = Hx` and `i = Nx - Hx`, and a boundary kernel, executed once communication is complete, that calculates tendencies adjacent to boundaries.; Before computing tendencies near the boundaries, boundary-adjacent auxiliary diagnostic variables are recalculated (hydrostatic pressure, vertical velocity and diffusivities for the hydrostatic model, hydrostatic pressure and diffusivities for the non-hydrostatic model).

Modifiability,"s); * the gradient between the interior node of a field and the associated boundary where the boundary condition is prescribed (for `Value` boundary conditions). `calculate_boundary_source_terms!` is still a part of the algorithm and is used to enforce `Flux` boundary conditions. This function may also prove useful in the future for more sophisticated boundary conditions and for enforcing boundary conditions associated with irregular boundaries. This algorithm permits the gradients of fields to be computed accurately on the boundary both in time stepping and post processing (which is useful, for example, for computing nonlinear diffusivities on the boundary when `Value` or `Gradient` boundary conditions are prescribed), and the code is more mathematically correct as a result. It also means that diffusivities are never involved in enforcing boundary conditions, which is an important simplification. Previously, the diffusivity of a field (or some proxy for diffusivity) on the boundary was used to add the flux associated with a `Value` or `Gradient` boundary condition. . This PR also adds special boundary conditions for tendency terms (sometimes called 'source terms' in the code), and for the pressure field. Finally, we introduce the boundary condition `BoundaryCondition{Flux, Nothing}` as a synonym for a no-flux boundary condition that does not require the calculation of boundary source terms, to save a few accesses to global memory. Right now there is a bit left to do:. - [x] adapt the checkpointer for the new `timestepper` structure (checkpointer tests currently fail); - [ ] decide whether pressure boundary conditions should be precomputed and stored in `poisson_solver` (currently they are computed at the beginning of a time-stepping cycle inside `time_step!`). If we add pressure boundary conditions to `poisson_solver`, we can also get rid of the special `PoissonBCs` types, since the pressure fields now have explicit bcs associated with them.

Modifiability,"solves to calling a function, whereas calling `getindex` on a `Field` / `Array` fetches data from memory. So they are different. Naively I would expect that evaluating a complicated advection term involving `BackgroundField` would be cheaper than one that involved two concrete `Array`. But sometimes unexpected things happen (the compiler might decide to optimize the code differently...). Can you try running the code on the GPU? I think it would be enlightening to see if there's a slowdown in that case. We could potentially implement an interface whereby `Field`s can be used as `BackgroundField` rather than functions. That might give us some insight, because then the ""additional"" advection terms associated with `BackgroundField` would truly be identical to the ""original"" advection term. > because presumably the advection of the background state by the background state is zero. I would say that the background self-interaction terms are _neglected_ rather than presumed to be zero. Linear terms associated with the background fields are also neglected. The idea being that if there is a valid way to decompose a flow into background and perturbation components, then the equation that governs the background component is completely neglected (this includes both the nonlinear terms and any linear terms involving the background flow). _Side note:_ some nonlinear terms are additionally neglected in the case of nonlinear viscosity. Ideally I think we would include these because the above argument doesn't justify neglecting them, but the implementation seemed too complicated the last time I thought about it so I put it off. I think it's a solvable problem but requires a bit of thought to integrate into the current algorithm seamlessly. > Mu understanding is that it is required for GPU runs, but it also helps optimize CPU runs.

Modifiability,"sonally quite picky about specifying outputs and output file names, so I might always end up with verbose boilerplate for output writing (and I'm personally fine with that). But I'd support reducing boilerplate and maybe just a bit of flexibility would work even for picky people! I remember having this conversation in #1171 actually!. One-line flexible output writing would be especially great for examples, new user friendliness, and quick iteration. Some thoughts:; 1. I think the name `output!` is a bit vague in what it does. Does it just output the current state of the simulation? Would `add_output_writers!` be clearer and align more closely with existing Oceananigans nomenclature? For the same reason, I'd suggest keeping `add_callback!` over renaming to `callback!`.; 2. I frequently output both JLD2 and NetCDF versions of the exact same data. So ideally subsequent calls to `add_output_writers!` with `JLD2Format()` and `NetCDFFormat()` would add both.; 3. Would definitely support extending this to NetCDF as well!. > First, we need to default `with_halos=true` for JLD2OutputWriter. The time has come because `FieldTimeSeries` is mature.

In short I am wondering whether the best course of action is simply to make default `overwrite_existing=true` and solve so much boilerplate. Is the ""so much boilerplate"" just the extra one line `overwrite_existing = true` for each output writer? Maybe I'm too conservative here but I think the default should be `overwrite_existing = false` just because the cost of overwriting and losing data can be very high.

If so, that's an interesting possibility that I hadn't considered. Although in the example above I'm fixing the time-step at `25`, while the output time interval is `200`, so I wouldn't expect any issues there. Can you check just to be sure? Because having an output interval that's some multiple of the time step is exactly when we expect to see miniscule time-steps due to round off error. The pressure source term is the divergence of the predictor velocity divided by time-step. As the time-step vanishes, the divergence of the predictor velocity also vanishes (because the flow has not evolved from its previous, non-divergent solution). We get a situation tending to 0/0. I think there's a few things we could do to solve this. First of all if we take a very small time-step, I think we can actually just re-set the model time rather than taking a time-step. Second I am wondering if we want to implement a time type that has finite resolution (ie there is a smallest time increment one can take). For example, datetimes have a smallest unit (micro or nanoseconds). A non-dimensional or dimensional-agnostic time type could also be designed analogously (eg every time is the multiple of an integer by the fundamental unit). This would eliminate round off error but it's a bit of work and also we have to put some thought into how best to accomplish it. There might also be a simpler solution by adjusting how we increment time.

This has been a very unpopular decision for good reasons. The 2D DCT algorithm is quite slow (channels are ~2x slower than doubly periodic on GPUs) and is quite complicated. Due to my inexperience, I didn't realize that transposing the array to do the FFT was the way forward. The pressure solver module is also quite out of date, it hasn't been updated since topologies were introduced (#614) almost exactly a year ago. This PR refactors the pressure solver module to:; 1. Support all topologies on the CPU and GPU performing transposes and index permutations as needed by each transform.; 2. Use the fastest transforms as allowed by the topology. This means batching dimensions when possible.; 3. Consolidating all pressure solvers into a single solver for all topologies. This should simplify the code and make it easier to extend. Resolves #586; Resolves #593; Resolves #594; Resolves #1007. # To batch or not to batch for FFTW on CPUs?.

Modifiability,"t place to start to justify changing the `Open` classification. > For example, in a nested case, this would prevent higher resolution eddies from exiting the domain without un-physically modifying the upstream solution. I apologize if this is just a problem with communication style, but I don't think this statement can possibly be correct. The above example seems to demonstrate, for example, that the cylinder wake can be represented well by _either_ making the domain large enough (with sponge layers), _or_ by using a better numerical method with a smaller domain. Basically this allows us to exclude statements like ""we can't model X flow"". The question is not whether or not we can represent the physics of a flow. The question is rather about representing the flow in a domain that is as small as possible / with optimal computational expense. We're pursuing performance optimization. Our language has to take the form ""this scheme allows us to reduce the sponge layer thickness by XX%"", or ""this scheme reduces the width of the near-boundary region where the interior physics are modified"". The statement ""this scheme does not unphysically modify the solution"" makes no sense to me. The presence of the open boundary is unphysical by definition... I personally don't need much convincing that a matching scheme of some kind is needed. I'm just confused about how all of the different pieces that seem to enter into nesting interact with one another --- sponge layers, matching scheme, and also the particular physics of the flow in question (idealized in and outflows vs true nesting). With so many degrees of freedom and complexity I think a systematic approach is absolutely essential. I really hope that the outcome of this work are a set of solid recommendations for nesting (better yet, a recipe that does not have to be changed --- a recommended matching scheme, or a combination of matching scheme and sponge layer) which is supported by unequivocal and rationally presented evidence.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-2033120291:2271,layers,layers,2271,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-2033120291,1,['layers'],['layers']

We _could_ also add a property to control this behavior with an innocuous default (ie `catch_errors=false` or something). ## The dangerous overwrite_existing. Another usability issue I noticed is that it's easy to make mistakes with `overwrite_existing`. It's convenient to toggle this on when starting from 0 (sometimes there's an iterative process involved in starting a simulation: fiddling with time-steps, an error in the output writer, error in a callback, blah blah). But when running with `pickup=true` we definitely do _not_ want to overwrite an existing output file. I'm wondering if we should implement behavior where `pickup=true` _overrides_ `overwrite_existing=true`. This would mean that if we pickup we _cannot_ overwrite an existing file (if for some reason we do want that, we'd have to delete it manually). I think this is really the behavior we want. However, it requires refactoring the output writers, because we have to move output writer initialization from the output writer constructor to another function that gets called after `run!(simulation)`. Not very hard, but something to ponder. Here's a few other random ideas that would also address this issue in slightly different ways. 1. Implement a ""pickup mode"" specified with an environment variable like `OCEANANIGANS_PICKUP=true` (rather than something we write in a script). Then output writer constructors can search for this environment variable and override `overwrite_existing` (with a warning?) in the output writer constructor. ""pickup mode"" has other usability benefits (ie it's annoying we have to change the run script / prepare the run script to be ""pickup"" aware: pickup mode avoids this so we can toggle to pickup mode from _outside_ the run script without internal changes) and also obviates the need to separate output writer constructor from output writer ""initialization"". 2. If we ""delay"" output writer construction, we can also extract the option ""overwrite_existing"" and p",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2535:1902,refactor,refactoring,1902,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2535,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']

Modifiability,"the original purpose of `data`. * This PR depends on the arbitrary tracers PR. The arbitrary tracers PR should be merged before this one. * To permit mixing `Function`s in with `Field`s and `Number`s in `AbstractOperations`, we also define a `FunctionField` type that acts like a field, but invokes a function to compute values at its location under the hood. This type probably needs more tests. We should also investigate whether this type can be used to specify things like background fields. A `FunctionField` can either be time-dependent and a function of `x, y, z, t` (achieved by allowing it to possess a reference to `clock`), or a static function of `x, y, z`. * This PR changes the result of a horizontal average to `HorizontalAverage.result` to provide a common terminology with `Computation`, as well as future reductions along other dimensions (previously the result of a horizontal average was called `profile`). * This PR adapts `Field` to work on the GPU (after the hard work of adapting all the `AbstractOperation`s to work on the GPU, this seemed trivial). That this works now should be tested. If it does indeed work and there is no loss of performance, we can eliminate a lot of cruft from our `time_step!`, and also use fields directly in `AbstractOperation`s (right now we extract the underlying `OffsetArray` instead). # In summary. Miraculously, tests pass on the GPU. However, this framework is quite general and powerful, so we need to . - [x] think carefully about the tests we need (and don't need). .

Modifiability,"this is that `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is _concretely typed_, which means that functions of `model` can be optimized based on the types of _every_ property of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. This gives us performance advantages / reduces overhead, but also creates some limitations like: we have to define a `closure` before building model. Here's a simple example:. ```julia; julia> mutable struct Test{T}; a :: T; end. julia> t = Test(1.0); Test{Float64}(1.0). julia> t.a = 2.0; 2.0. julia> t.a = ""hi""; ERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type String to an object of type Float64; Closest candidates are:; convert(::Type{T}, ::T) where T<:Number at number.jl:6; convert(::Type{T}, ::Number) where T<:Number at number.jl:7; convert(::Type{T}, ::Base.TwicePrecision) where T<:Number at twiceprecision.jl:250; ...; Stacktrace:; [1] setproperty!(x::Test{Float64}, f::Symbol, v::String); @ Base ./Base.jl:34; [2] top-level scope; @ REPL[6]:1; ```. Here, `t` is `Test{Float64}`. We can change `a` as long as the new value can be converted to `Float64` via `convert(Float64, new_value)`. Otherwise we can't and we just have to write `s = Test(""hi"")` instead. Another possible solution is to build a ""dummy"" closure with the correct type, and then replace it with the ""real"" closure after constructing model by writing `model.closure = real_closure`. It could be fun to try that and see if the code is simpler. I suspect it might not be but it's worth a shot (you might learn something). . > Thinking on a more general way, it would be awesome to give a general function that could depend on any field in the model, including auxiliary.

Modifiability,"this to work seamlessly when a `JLD2OutputWriter` is involved we might need to modify the constructor for `JLD2OutputWriter`. Currently the constructor runs an arbitrary `init(file, model)` function, and saves certain properties identified in the constructor signature:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9cfb568ec3a8e6f7efe8c7c41300ea9673c6b103/src/OutputWriters/jld2_output_writer.jl#L157-L160. This will fail if the output file already exists; thus it's not possible to pickup from a checkpoint with the same script used to initialize the model (without destroying prior output). A simple change could just be to allow `init` and `save_properties!` to fail with `try/catch` (or to avoid running those functions if a file already exists). There are also some shenanigans that'd have to be done for output files split into multiple `part`s. (We could, potentially, require `pickup=true` in the `JLD2OutputWriter` constructor, rather than changing its default behavior to accommodate auto-checkpoint-pickup). Another caveat is that this method of restoring checkpointed data will not work for large CPU models that consume almost all of the CPU memory (such that a single field cannot be loaded from file after `model` has been instantiated). These cases are relatively rare right now, since such large models would typically run very slowly on a typical single node. The basic idea is:. ```julia; # Model and simulation setup. simulation.output_writers[:checkpointer] = Checkpointer(...). run!(simulation, pickup=true); ```. We could also allow `pickup` to be an iteration number, eg. ```julia; # Model and simulation setup. simulation.output_writers[:checkpointer] = Checkpointer(...). run!(simulation, pickup=10138); ```. It may also be possible to enable this functionality with an environment variable; eg. ```bash; PICKUP=true julia --project run_cool_simulation.jl; ```.

Modifiability,"this work if you have one spin up script and another script for the interesting part of the simulation that picks up from the checkpoint made at the end of spin up?. This is an interesting and I think common use case that's worth thinking about (cc @sandreza). The current mode, which I think works well, is to build a new model `restore_from_checkpoint` but reassigning some properties of model (as well as including the ones that couldn't be checkpointed). (Thinking about it more, we might almost rename `restore_from_checkpoint` to `IncompressibleModel`, since it sort of is an alternative constructor for `IncompressibleModel`...). If we deprecate `restore_from_checkpoint`, then users would be required to rebuild `IncompressibleModel` from scratch and use a function. ```julia; set!(model, checkpoint_filepath::String); ```. which would be implemented as part of the `pickup` feature we're discussing. I think this method has pros and cons over the ""constructor"" method:. ### Cons. 1. It generates boilerplate in user scripts, since the second script will inevitably reproduce much of the original ""spinup"" run script. 2. It wastes memory. ### Pro. 1. The setup script for the second simulation is easier to interpret, since its more ""stand-alone"", containing all the information necessary to understand basic aspects of the model configuration, like the grid, coriolis, buoyancy, etc. In other words, using `restore_from_checkpoint` ties two scripts together, since one cannot understand the script containing `restore_from_checkpoint` without looking at the script that produced the checkpoint in the first place. I think we can mitigate Con.1 by designing helper functions that restore individual model properties. Something like. ```julia; grid = restore(checkpoint_filepath, :grid); coriolis = restore(checkpoint_filepath, :coriolis); ```. (This kind of feature is important for post processing with the the other output writers too.).

Modifiability,"thub.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-738870593. There may be other problems that we haven't uncovered. An important additional case that doesn't work right now is operations that have embedded `AveragedField`. I think this is some kind of type inference issue. For `Field` on the GPU we ""throw away"" the wrapper and expose the underlying `OffsetArray` to GPU kernels. So compilation of functions of `Field` is ""no more difficult"" than compilation of functions with `OffsetArray`. This idealization is successful because indexing into the underlying `field.data` is identical indexing into the field itself, and because we don't require field locations _inside_ the kernel (we build expression trees for AbstractOperations on the CPU, prior to launching the kernel). But this idealization doesn't hold for `AveragedField` or any `ReducedField`. In particular, abstract operations index into these objects at all `i, j, k`. However, they don't vary on one or more of these directions; the indexing operation needs to be ""collapsed"" so that reduced indices are translated correctly. Thus when we adapt `AveragedField` for the GPU, we hold onto the wrapper:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/98cd4f7a56aa581defc721a01d6e1ab89b534d26/src/Fields/averaged_field.jl#L94-L96. Peeking at the broadcasting code used by julia Base gives a hint. Broadcasting has to solve the same problem: we have to be able to make computations between arrays of size (Nx, Ny, 1) and (Nx, Ny, Nz), for example. In this case, the indices of the first array are ""extruded"" into the third dimension. There are [some shenanigans in `Base.Broadcast`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/e467661f080a1b14ca1a9cf6681a8c713a3ae20c/base/broadcast.jl#L572-L630) that look like they are solving some type instability problem (which would doom GPU compilation for us if it were occurring). So we might be able to learn / borrow code from `Base.Broadcast`.

Modifiability,"tical results to the current implementation of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. I think we will also want a rectilinear grid to use for testing to avoid modifying `RegularRectilinearGrid`, such as a refactored or reimplemented three-dimensionally `StretchedRectilinearGrid` from #1532 which accepts the use of a generalized vertical coordinates. 2. Introduce `ZStarCoordinate` (or maybe `FreeSurfaceWeightedVerticalCoordinate`). ""z-star"" vertical coordinate is a relatively simple GVC, with a small, diagnostic time-dependence. A successful implementation will require integrating thickness-weighted equations, correct vertical derivatives, and ensuring correct horizontal pressure gradients. 3. Implement remapping as an alternative to vertical advection and test using `ZCoordinate` and `ZStarCoordinate`. Of course, steps 3 might evolve depending on our experience during step 2. . An important choice that's part of step 1. is whether to use thickness-weighted variables as state variables rather than unweighted variables (eg `hu` rather than `u`, and `hc` rather than `c`. I suspect it makes sense to use thickness-weighted state variables because this simplifies the underlying implementation (for example, we only need `hⁿ` rather than both `hⁿ⁺¹` and `hⁿ` to evolve a tracer field, and we can evaluate the prognostic equations in the same order that we do now), and because it is easy to provide abstractions for users to compute, inspect, and output unweighted variables `u = hu / h`. The pros and cons of this important choice should be discussed. The discussion on #1549 is related (I decided to start a new issue because GVC are more general than terrain-following coordinates). **Some references**; * [MOM6 description](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2019MS001726) (Adcroft et al 2019); * [Primer on “remap” methods](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2019MS001954) (Griffies et al, 2019); * [“z-tilde” GVC used by the NEMO ocean model](https",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1679:2856,variab,variables,2856,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1679,3,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"tl;dr. 1. Should we change the flux convention in Oceananigans so that `FluxBoundaryCondition` specifies the flux along the _inward pointing normal_? This reverses the convention we use on ""right"" boundaries (west, north, top). For example, a negative buoyancy flux would cause cooling at the surface with this convention. This is a huge change, but I think is necessary to do things like specifying a drag boundary condition on vertical velocity (I can discuss further why this is the case if needed.). 2. How do we feel about wrapping boundary conditions for immersed boundaries in `FieldBoundaryConditions` (this requires refactoring `FieldBoundaryConditions` under the hood, but does not change the API). We can do 2. without 1. In that case we'll be able to support a lot of common cases, including ordinary oceanic cases (where boundaries do not overhang, and we only specify drag on tangential components). It's really LES cases that become tricky because we can't specify drag on vertical velocity components, or on tangential components when the boundary overhangs.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-867684689:625,refactor,refactoring,625,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-867684689,1,['refactor'],['refactoring']
Modifiability,"to discuss on what exactly needs to be implemented. My main reference is https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phys_pkgs/gmredi.html. It seems that there are three different new closures that could potentially be added:; 1. Redi (symmetric) tensor diffusivity.; 2. Gent-McWilliams (anti-symmetric) tensor diffusivity.; 3. GM-Redi combining the two. Note: @glwagner has already implemented parts of the Redi tensor and GM for `TwoDimensionalLeith` so GM-Redi might not need too much extra work: https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/master/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/leith_enstrophy_diffusivity.jl. # Questions/proposal. 1. Do we make the small-angle approximation? I would say yes. In Oceananigans.jl right now each component of the tensor diffusivity is calculated on-the-fly so the unapproximated tensor could end up being 2-4x more expensive to compute. We cannot compute the full tensor in one go (reusing the isopycnal slopes) and we may not want to since it takes up a lot of memory (9 extra field?). But maybe there's a good reason to not make the small-angle approximation? We could eventually support both (unapproximated and small-angle approximation). See https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phys_pkgs/gmredi.html#redi-scheme-isopycnal-diffusion for a comparison of the two. 2. Is GM-Redi the main parameterization of interest? Would people use the fully symmetric or the fully anti-symmetric diffusivity tensor by themselves?. If not then maybe we can save some time by just implementing one new closure, `GMRedi` or `GentMcWilliamsRedi`. If we take the isopycnal diffusivity to be the same for both the symmetric and anti-symmetric tensor then we the resulting tensor is quite cheap to compute (only 3 components) if performance is important:.

Modifiability,"tradeoff between the stability obtained by a larger $\chi$ and the dissipation introduced by deviating from the AB2 behavior. I wondered if 0.1 is too high, especially when using diffusive methods. ; Did anyone experiment with lower $\chi$, and if yes, with what results?. Would it make sense to exclude $\chi$ from diffusive terms to limit the implicit dissipation of the time-stepping scheme?. Regarding the time integral for variable time-stepping, the correct form of the AB2 with variable step would have to include the time step at $n$ and the time step at $n-1$ to be correct. This might not make a huge impact, but if we want to save time averaged tendencies and the time step changes size every ten iterations or so, the error will compound and the time average will probably be off. ; Would it make sense to implement time-step dependent coefficients for the AB2 scheme?. The problem is that if the time step changes size, the tendency terms at $G^{n-1}$ do not cancel, which is what happens with constant time stepping.; ```math; c^{n+1} = c^{n} + \Delta t (1.5 G^{n} - 0.5 G^{n-1}) ; ```; ```math; c^{n+2} = c^{n+1} + \Delta t (1.5 G^{n+1} - 0.5 G^{n}); ```; In the above, between $c^{n+1}$ and $c^{n+2}$ we have added only one $G^{n}$ because the extra tendency we have added in $c^{n+1}$ is removed in the successive timestep.; With variable time steps, this is not the case! Suppose the time-step changes between $n+1$ and $n+2$; ```math; c^{n+1} += \Delta t^n (1.5 G^{n} - 0.5 G^{n-1}) ; ```; ```math; c^{n+2} += \Delta t^{n+1} (1.5 G^{n+1} - 0.5 G^{n}); ```; we remain with a spurious $G^n (1.5\Delta t^{n} - 0.5 \Delta t^{n-1}) - G^n$. . Given [this](https://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/mcs471/variablestep.pdf) reference, the correct formualtion might be; ```math; G^{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left( 2 + \frac{\Delta t^n}{\Delta t^{n - 1}} \right) G^n - \frac{\Delta t^n}{\Delta t^{n - 1}} G^{n-1} \right); ```; However, also in this form, successive tendencies do not cancel out.",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3738:2119,variab,variable,2119,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3738,2,['variab'],"['variable', 'variablestep']"

Modifiability,"underlying issue. I think the issue here is that ""entrainment"" should not occur across low stratification regions. Thus this model for ""entrainment"" assumes the stratification is ""strong"". More generally, we are dividing the boundary layer into a convecting region and an entraining region. We identify the convecting region by `N² < 0`. However, in reality the convecting region should extend further down into regions of stable, but still weak stratification below the unstable region. The ""entraining"" layer is more properly where stratification significantly increases over the weakly stratified lower part of the convecting region. (This analysis is based on LES.) `RiBasedVerticalDiffusivity`'s formulation --- apart from being overly simple --- simply cannot cope with the complexity of real boundary layer structure because it is not truly non-local. Really addressing this issue (eg implementing a more physically accurate model of boundary layer structure) might require using a vertical integral instead of a 3D kernel. (We decided that because CATKE seems like a decent parameterization, it's not worth it to pursue those accuracy improvements). One way to fix the issue but retaining a 3D kernel is to change the way we estimate ""convecting"" and ""entraining"" regions. Those criteria are. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/94e99e1d5fb3d121a6d801a931987bb6ff59f20e/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/ri_based_vertical_diffusivity.jl#L247-L248. If we introduce a new parameter, say `minimum_entrainment_buoyancy_frequency`, then we can modify this criteria to read. ```julia; convecting = N² < 0 # applies regardless of Qᵇ . N²_entrainment = minimum_entrainment_buoyancy_frequency; entraining = (N²_above < 0) & (N² > N²_entrainment) (Qᵇ > 0); ```. Now the user can determine `minimum_entrainment_buoyancy_frequency` to stabilize their model. Probably some default like `minimum_entrainment_buoyancy_frequency = 1e-7` would work for Earth-like situations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3283#issuecomment-1731439718:1618,parameteriz,parameterization,1618,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3283#issuecomment-1731439718,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterization']

Diagnostics; 8. Output writers; 9. Advection schemes; 10. User interface (setting initial conditions, boundary conditions, time stepping, etc.).

Base state (dry adiabatic, isothermal, analytic sounding, form from initial conditions, etc.); 3. Acoustic time stepper (nothing, fully explicit for regular grids, vertically implicit for stretched grids); 4. Setting fields and initial conditions is more complicated because the density needs to be adjusted when setting the potential temperature. Also because the prognostic variables are ρ, ρu, ρv, ρw, ρθ, etc.; 5. Other atmospheric things like cloud microphysics and radiation but for this there are packages that can be relied on, e.g. [RRTMGP.jl](https://github.com/climate-machine/RRTMGP.jl) and [Cloudy.jl](https://github.com/climate-machine/Cloudy.jl). It would be ideal if we have a single `Model` type and just change the equation between the `CompressibleModel` and `IncompressibleModel` but the numerical methods and abstractions employed are sufficiently different that I think it makes sense to have two separate model types. It might even make sense to keep a separate package for this `CompressibleModel` but I think for now it's better if we keep it all inside the Oceananigans.jl repository (see https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/issues/284 for some previous discussion) until the code is more stable and also for extra visibility while the package is young.

Modifiability,"ures, such as sinking/rising velocities, or reaction systems for biological/chemical tracer systems. When I have talked to various people about this, there was a concern that this system would be 'inelegant' or 'complex'. However I believe an equation abstraction system provides the opposite: with an abstraction system, equations are 'written down' in some logical place (like a file `equations.jl` in the `src` directory where they can be easily read and modified, rather than buried inside a time-stepping loop. Correspondly, our time-stepping code becomes shorter and more concise. Using multiple dispatch correctly, we avoid the `infinite if-statement` problem. This abstraction may also make the code more modular such that we move closer to supporting multiple time-steppers. Below I provide one example of an implementation that would solve some of the problems I listed. However, *this is not the only solution*, and I think we should expend some intellectual effort and have a discussion about what the best solution might be, so that we design something that is nice, easy to extend, performant, and powerful. ## A list of kernel equations in a named tuple. The simplest solution for this abstraction is probably just to add new fields to `Model` (`model.equations.velocities` and `model.equations.tracers`) that are named tuples of kernel equations. An example of how this might work while demonstrating hierarchical multiple dispatch is:. ```julia; forcing(i, j, k, grid, F::Function, u, v, w, T, S) = F(grid, u, v, w, T, S, i, j, k); forcing(i, j, k, grid, F::AbstractArray, u, v, w, T, S) = F[i, j, k]. u_eqn(i, j, k, grid, etc...) = (-u∇u(grid, u, v, w, i, j, k); + fv(grid, v, fCor, i, j, k); - δx_c2f(grid, pHY′, i, j, k) / (Δx * ρ₀); + ∂ⱼ_2ν_Σ₁ⱼ(i, j, k, grid, closure, eos, grav, u, v, w, T, S); + forcing(i, j, k, grid, F, u, v, w, T, S); ). # Note omission of pressure term here; u_eqn(i, j, k, grid, pHY::Nothing, etc...) = (-u∇u(grid, u, v, w, i, j, k); + fv(grid, v, fCor, i,",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/259:2072,extend,extend,2072,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/259,1,['extend'],['extend']

Modifiability,"user perspective my opinion is that it would have been better to throw a ""method not found"" error or a warning then have the code fail silently. So I propose we either get rid of that general default behavior and just let the code fail with an error for the unimplemented cases, or at least add a warning to the lines above. Thoughts?. A follow-up question/comment regards the organization of the `TurbulenceClosure` module. Part of the reason for my delay in catching the `calc_κᶜᶜᶜ()` issue is that I often get confused about the organizational aspect in that module. For example, there are several functions that, based on name, appear to do the same thing (`νᶜᶜᶜ`, `calc_νᶜᶜᶜ`, `getdiffusivity`; there's also a `calc_κᶜᶜᶜ` but no `κᶜᶜᶜ` function) and often the naming of the variables also doesn't help much. For example in these lines:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/56c70fb07eeeb8171958dc62ed7948ff2617cf7a/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/anisotropic_minimum_dissipation.jl#L138. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/56c70fb07eeeb8171958dc62ed7948ff2617cf7a/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/anisotropic_minimum_dissipation.jl#L160. it's not clear to me what's `c`, `C`, `U`. It takes some amount of digging for me (who, admittedly, am not super familiar with the code) to conclude that `c` is the `tracer` and `U` is the `velocities` tuple. (I'm still not 100% sure what `C` is). I understand that, again, I'm not super familiar with the code, so most Oceananigans developers would understand that module faster than me, but I think it's advantageous to make the code in general more easily understandable for people like me, who aren't experts in the code. . I also understand that that is an incredibly complicated module, with no obvious way to organize it concisely. But I think using more verbose names would make it a lot more clear.

Modifiability,"utflow speed may have caused some confusion here as it is neither the specified outflowing velocity, the outflowing velocity at the boundary point, or the outflowing velocity in the interior, but an approximation of bulk velocity advecting the interior solution to the boundary point (and its approximation is case specific).**. The next problem is that if the interior solution is outflowing and then switches to inflow it may have deviated from the external solution causing oscillations near the boundary. This is why we might want relaxation rather than specifying as described before. . What I have been calling the ""inflow_speed"" is $1/\tau$ because I don't see why the ""relaxation"" should be fixed and the user might want to change it. For example it seems to me it would be reasonable to pretend that the specified external velocity is a further halo point and upwind it into the actual boundary point. I believe sponge layers are both a different solution to over-specifying at the boundary, and a way to dampen the residual reflection/oscillation from the unwinding approximation. In the first case, the sponge has to be large enough to fully restore the interior solution to the external solution before the boundary, but in the latter, it can be smaller (so having a complicated boundary saves computational expense). . > 2. Constant or idealized inflows and outflows. I think the only real difference for these idealised cases is that you normally know that information will only travel away from one of the boundaries and so can specify the halo point with `Open`. With both of the cases shown above we also know that the mean outflowing velocity will be the same as the inflow so can approximate the ""bulk velocity"" as a constant instead of having to compute it (but we still can't specify the boundary points of the outflow because otherwise, perturbations generated in the interior wouldn't be able to escape).

A two-dimensional turbulent case would be sufficient. > To resolve this PR I could tidy up a simple matching scheme where we compute the mean outflow on the boundary and do a 1D advection for the boundary point, or relax to the external state if there is inflow. I think this shows how to use all parts of the new infrastructure, and is a satisfactory boundary condition for some cases. Would this be okay?. A simple matching scheme is a great place to start to justify changing the `Open` classification. > For example, in a nested case, this would prevent higher resolution eddies from exiting the domain without un-physically modifying the upstream solution. I apologize if this is just a problem with communication style, but I don't think this statement can possibly be correct. The above example seems to demonstrate, for example, that the cylinder wake can be represented well by _either_ making the domain large enough (with sponge layers), _or_ by using a better numerical method with a smaller domain. Basically this allows us to exclude statements like ""we can't model X flow"". The question is not whether or not we can represent the physics of a flow. The question is rather about representing the flow in a domain that is as small as possible / with optimal computational expense. We're pursuing performance optimization. Our language has to take the form ""this scheme allows us to reduce the sponge layer thickness by XX%"", or ""this scheme reduces the width of the near-boundary region where the interior physics are modified"". The statement ""this scheme does not unphysically modify the solution"" makes no sense to me. The presence of the open boundary is unphysical by definition...

Modifiability,"y `validate_buoyancy` in the `Model` constructor. For `BuoyancyTracer`, the user must specify a tracer named `:b`. For `SeawaterBuoyancy`, the user must specify tracers named `:T` and `:S`. (In the future, we could also allow the names of these buoyancy, temperature, and salinity tracers to be specified in the constructor for the respective buoyancy models, eg `SeawaterBuoyancy(temperature=:T, salinity=:S)`.). 2. The constructor for `ModelForcing` (which will have to be merged with #444 when it is approved) now allows the user to specify forcing for any of the tracer fields. If the user specifies a forcing for a tracer field that does not exist, an error is thrown. If a user does not specify a forcing for some tracer field, a default zero forcing is applied. 3. The same logic for `ModelForcing` applies to `BoundaryConditions` / `SolutionBoundaryConditions`. When boundary conditions for a tracer field are unspecified, a default tracer boundary condition is inferred from the x-velocity field: tracers either inherit `Periodic` boundary conditions, or are given a `Flux, Nothing` boundary condition for all other cases. 4. For closures, all tracer-diffusivity-related fields permit users to specify either:. * a constant (applied to all tracers), or ; * a `NamedTuple` with fields for *every* tracer. . In the future, we could possibly implement some mixed behavior where the user specifies both a default *and* particular values for tracer diffusivity. This would be useful in the (possibly rare) use-case of a large number of tracers with the same diffusivity, but where one or two of them require a special, different diffusivity. I am not sure this API is necessary so I left it for future work. Diffusivity-like fields include:. * `κ` (constant component of tracer diffusivity) for `ConstantIsotropicDiffusivity`, `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation`, and `ConstantSmagorinsky`; * `Pr` (turbulent Prandtl number) for `ConstantSmagorinsky`; * `κh` and `κv` for `ConstantAnisotropicDiffusiv",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/452:1430,inherit,inherit,1430,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/452,1,['inherit'],['inherit']
Modifiability,"y conditions so PRs like #601 won't be necessary again. The only change in user interface is that you pass a named tuple to the model constructor now instead of an instance of `SolutionBoundaryConditions`. This also works for LES diffusivities so the amount of convoluted scripting gymnastics is much reduced (see test from #601). Setting a diffusivity BC is now almost as easy as a tracer BC. ```julia; grid = RegularCartesianGrid(FT, size=(16, 16, 16), length=(1, 1, 1)). buoyancy_bcs = TracerBoundaryConditions(grid, bottom=BoundaryCondition(Gradient, bz)); κₑ_bcs = DiffusivityBoundaryConditions(grid, bottom=BoundaryCondition(Value, κ₀)); model_bcs = (b=buoyancy_bcs, κₑ=(b=κₑ_bcs,)). model = IncompressibleModel(; grid=grid, architecture=arch, float_type=FT, tracers=:b, buoyancy=BuoyancyTracer(),; closure=AnisotropicMinimumDissipation(), boundary_conditions=model_bcs; ); ```. Internally: No surprise, this change ended up being pretty invasive. But note that we now have a more flexible and easier to use package with fewer lines of code!. I'm happy to discuss and iterate over the choices that were made in this PR. But glad that I was able to make these changes. Development of the compressible model can continue based on this branch. Changes:; 1. Fields has a new property: `field.boundary_conditions`. 2. Better pretty printing for fields:; ```; Field located at (Cell, Cell, Cell); ├── data: OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,3,Array{Float64,3}}, size: (18, 18, 18); ├── grid: RegularCartesianGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded}(Nx=16, Ny=16, Nz=16); └── boundary conditions: x=(west=Periodic, east=Periodic), y=(south=Periodic, north=Periodic), z=(bottom=NoFlux, top=NoFlux); ```. 3. Field tuple constructors have two versions now. One that accepts boundary conditions (useful in model constructors) and another that accepts full fields (useful for checkpoint restoration and other custom functionality). 4. ~~You can pass anything into `VelocityFields` and `TracerFields`.

Essentially we need an FFT for periodic dimensions and we have the choice of using either a DCT or a TRIdiagonal solve for wall-bounded dimensions, although TRI may only be used once. . Some notes:; 1. Multiple wall-bounded dimensions will require the use of a DCT somewhere.; 2. Solvers for vertically stretched grids need to use TRI in the vertical.; 3. For stretched grids in multiple dimensions I believe that a direct solve is no longer possible and an iterative method such as conjugate gradient must be used. I do not consider this case.; 4. We have the option of using a DCT or a TRI. Which one we pick will depend on performance benchmarks between the two solvers. We should pick the faster one. This could depend on the number of vertical levels.; 5. Unfortunately I don't think we can get rid of the in-place DCT algorithm that employs permutations on the GPU as it will be needed for channels and boxes at least. It may also turn out to be more efficient for regular grids in some cases.; 6. We should reuse solvers as much as possible.; 7. While it looks like we have many solvers to implement, I think if we abstract away the steps then each solver just needs to implement something like a `forward_x_transform`, `forward_y_transform`, `forward_z_transform`, `backward_z_transform`, etc. then we can implement many solvers without repeating code. For now, I will first just focus on getting Poisson solvers working for vertically stretched grids in doubly periodic domains on the CPU and GPU.

Modifiability,"~~This PR adapts `BetaPlane` coriolis implementation for curvilinear grids (following #1371 and [MITgcm docs](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithm/algorithm.html#id8)).~~. ~~Note that the MITgcm docs specify averaging the Coriolis parameter / planetary vorticity (from corner / vorticity nodes, ffc, to the velocity nodes fcc and cfc). However, because the variation in the planetary vorticity is linear, I think the implementation in this PR is correct for beta planes? @jm-c please advise.~~. I would ~~also~~ like to add a Coriolis term valid for the sphere and hydrostatic models (which amounts to the ""traditional approximation""). ~~I'll do this once #1380 is merged.~~ This PR depends on #1380.

Performance," ; > > ; > > But for one layer, WENO vector invariant plus WENO for mass flux may be sufficient, and we don't need any other dissipation (which is nice, less work for us).; > ; > I agree. If we try using whatever closure here that is used in the hydrostatic model, I would think that it should yield a similar result. But that's maybe better saved for a future PR?. Let me clarify. We've never run the hydrostatic model with a single layer on the sphere, but this is a good idea. Most of our runs have been with 50 vertical levels. In the 3D configuration with 50 vertical levels, we smooth results with 1) WENO5 vector invariant advection and 2) biharmonic ""divergence damping"" of the divergence component of the flow. If we are going to compare the shallow water on a sphere to they hydrostatic model, we will have to produce additional runs with just 1 vertical level. In other words, there are no results to compare with right now. When we perform additional runs, we may choose to include divergence damping, or another kind of closure, if we want to. The results presented in #2317 also use a single layer hydrostatic model, and these did not require any explicit dissipation. Therefore, there is reason to believe that divergence damping is only required for 3D simulations. An additional point is that in the shallow water equations we can introduce a WENO reconstruction of the mass flux. This reconstruction may provide divergence damping (whether or not we need it!). In summary, if we would like to perform a comparison, we can choose to either 1) produce a comparison between the shallow water model and one layer hydrostatic model with no explicit closure on the sphere or 2) run new 1 layer hydrostatic simulations with some closure (of our choosing) and then _also_ implement that closure in the shallow water model. My opinion is that with these nice WENO5 numerics there may not be a need for using explicit dissipation right now, so we might as well do the easy thing and avoid it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119959226:1624,perform,perform,1624,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119959226,1,['perform'],['perform']

Performance," GPU (see below). At 256^3, `cfl(model)` takes as long as ~5 time steps. Is this something we want to merge? If we don't want to slow down adaptive time-stepping for existing models we could just export `accurate_cell_advection_timescale` so that adaptive time-stepping with accurate CFL is opt-in, e.g. via an `AccurateTimeStepWizard` or something. Motivation for using Tullio.jl:. Originally I tried just using `mapreduce` but couldn't get it to work without a nested `mapreduce` which would trigger tons of kernel launches: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/is-it-possible-to-do-a-mapreduce-with-multiple-arrays-while-broadcasting-over-so/57433. Then I found out about Tullio.jl (super neat package we might want to use more) which allows us to compute CFL and reduce it down elegantly, however, reducing to one scalar does not currently work so I have to reduce the 3D CFL calculation to a 1D vector: https://github.com/mcabbott/Tullio.jl/issues/91. Apparently optimizing reductions on the GPU is non-trivial but can be done: https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/1.1-Beta/x86_website/projects/reduction/doc/reduction.pdf Not sure if an optimized reduction kernel is available in Julia/CUDA.jl but maybe they will be in the future. @maleadt or @vchuravy might know... ```; julia> model.architecture; CPU(). julia> size(grid); (32, 32, 32). julia> @btime time_step!(model, 1); 5.977 ms (2090 allocations: 343.97 KiB). julia> @btime cfl(model); 127.870 μs (10 allocations: 2.36 KiB); ```. ```; julia> model.architecture; GPU(). julia> size(grid); (32, 32, 32). julia> @btime time_step!(model, 1); 2.632 ms (7058 allocations: 820.19 KiB). julia> @btime cfl(model); 1.294 ms (257 allocations: 25.36 KiB); ```. ```; julia> model.architecture; CPU(). julia> size(grid); (256, 256, 256). julia> @btime time_step!(model, 1); 3.378 s (2090 allocations: 343.97 KiB). julia> @btime cfl(model); 134.737 ms (10 allocations: 4.16 KiB); ```. ```; julia> model.architecture; GPU(). julia> size(grid);",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1497:1372,optimiz,optimizing,1372,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1497,1,['optimiz'],['optimizing']

Performance," PDE in a user's model, and there's no way to pull out intermediate steps in that calculation to use elsewhere. It's important to note when considering optimization strategies that our computations are probably memory-limited, rather than compute-limited. In other words, we think the process of transferring data from global memory to local thread memory is a bottleneck for our computations (we can really only know this through profiling a particular application, however, since all models are different...) Storing intermediate components of the tendency terms would probably create more memory accesses overall (since rather than immediately using intermediate results for subsequent calculations, we would have to send them to global memory, and then back, to complete the evaluation of a tendency) --- and thus could slow down tendency evaluations that are performed 1-3 times per time-step. For example, our best idea for speeding up tendency evaluations is to better manage memory movement using GPU shared memory (unfortunately, we haven't had the time to explore such optimization strategies...). I think there may be other ways to optimize diagnostics calculations, however. # Fusing `ComputedField` kernels. One possibility to speed up diagnostics is to ""fuse"" kernels for different `ComputedField` diagnostics. The kernel for a `ComputedField` is. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9b52f3f911d26a66c75f1c3cb58fdd0a1cecb131/src/Fields/computed_field.jl#L112-L115. where `operand` is an `AbstractOperation`. But different `ComputedField`s may somehow depend on the same underlying data in memory. Thus if the kernels for differnet `ComputedField`s are fused into one, we overlap memory accesses for different computations. Our computations are usually memory-limited... so its possible this strategy could produce significant speed ups. For example, for two `ComputedField`s we might have something like. ```julia; function compute!(field1, field2); # calls _compute_two(field1",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1483#issuecomment-800567837:1411,optimiz,optimization,1411,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1483#issuecomment-800567837,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance," a multiple packages approach but for ancillary features. # Tests and validation experiments. We spent quite some time ensuring the `CompressibleModel` can simulate some known atmospheric test cases. Following recent trials and tribulations I also decided to add some simple 1D tests. Here I list the tests but will post a followup comment for each test with a figure or animation. Hopefully together these tests act as a starting point to start believing that the `CompressibleModel` indeed does work as expected. 1. Periodic advection of a square waveform; 2. Inviscid Burgers equation developing a shock; 3. Shock tube problem (Sod, 1978); 4. Rising thermal bubble with entropy and energy (Wicker & Skamarock, 1998); 5. Rising thermal bubble with 3 different gas species (entropy and energy); 6. Density current (Straka et al., 1993); 7. Dry convection. See comments below for movies and eyeball norms. The four dry rising thermal bubble simulations are used for regression testing. # GPU performance benchmarks. Preliminary benchmarks show a 75~80x speedup for large models when comparing a single CPU core to a single Titan V GPU on Tartarus. Not as good as the incompressible model as some of the functions that diagnose temperature and pressure need some optimizing, especially in the case of multiple gases. ```; Compressible model benchmarks ; ┌──────┬──────┬───────────┬───────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────┐; │ Arch │ Size │ Gases │ ThermoVar │ min │ median │ mean │ max │ memory │ allocs │; ├──────┼──────┼───────────┼───────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────┤; │ CPU │ 32³ │ DryEarth │ Energy │ 37.682 ms │ 38.012 ms │ 37.982 ms │ 38.199 ms │ 646.33 KiB │ 4499 │; │ CPU │ 32³ │ DryEarth │ Entropy │ 32.325 ms │ 32.920 ms │ 32.928 ms │ 33.628 ms │ 646.33 KiB │ 4499 │; │ CPU │ 32³ │ DryEarth3 │ Energy │ 52.473 ms │ 52.815 ms │ 52.896 ms │ 53.413 ms │ 816.50 KiB │ 5635 │; │ CPU │ 32³ │ DryEarth3",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1079:7289,perform,performance,7289,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1079,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance," based on latitude easily.; > ; > Questions:; > ; > * Should we keep the original `FPlane`? I think we could scrap it and only keep this one (which would then be renamed `FPlane`); > * I didn't see any tests that `FPlane` or any other Coriolis implementation is dynamically correct. Should we implement a test to see if our rotation implementations are actually doing what they're supposed to?. For API this is what I suggest:. Three ""modes"":. 1. A ""primitive"" mode whereby fx, fy, fz are all explicitly provided.; 2. A ""general rotation"" mode whereby `rotation_axis` and `rotation_rate` are provided. `fx`, `fy`, and `fz` are then calculated as a convenience.; 3. A ""tangent plane"" mode whereby `latitude` and `rotation_rate` are provided. This mode calculates `rotation_axis` based on `latitude` (and assuming that `y` is north-south). The code might look something like. ```julia; zero_if_nothing(f) = f; zero_if_nothing(::Nothing) = 0. function ConstantBackgroundRotation(FT=Float64; fx=nothing, fy=nothing, fz=nothing, rotation_rate=Ω_Earth, rotation_axis=nothing, latitude=nothing). if latitude !=nothing; isnothing(rotation_axis) && throw(ArgumentError(""Cannot specify latitude and rotation axis."")); all(isnothing.((fx, fy, fz)) || throw(ArgumentError(""Cannot specify latitude and (fx, fy, fz)."")); # calculate rotation axis; end. if rotation_axis != nothing; all(isnothing.((fx, fy, fz)) || throw(ArgumentError(""Cannot specify rotation_axis and (fx, fy, fz)."")); # calculate fx, fy, fz; end. fx, fy, fz = zero_if_nothing.((fx, fy, fz)) # set default fx, fy, fz. return ConstantBackgroundRotation(FT(fx), FT(fy), FT(fz)); end; ```. There's also the possibility of a somewhat minor optimization by keeping the possibility that `fx, fy, fz` might be `nothing`, and eliding the associated Coriolis operations in kernel functions for that case. This requires the struct to accomodate different types for each of them. I think `GeneralFPlane` is ambiguous, so I propose using a more specific name.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1892#issuecomment-887527990:2335,optimiz,optimization,2335,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1892#issuecomment-887527990,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

We use the term ""node"" because this can be used for cells _or_ cell interfaces. `external_node` is `false` for locations that ""touch"" wet cells.

So this intersects with `external_node` in the exterior, but additionally contains locations that touch wet cells. Not sure I understand this.

Performance," important changes:. * I removed the `BackgroundField` v-velocity, which had no effect on the solution because the domain is `Flat` in y. The only effect of the background flow is through the bottom drag boundary condition.; * I reduced the domain aspect ratio to 400 x 100 because based on the visualization it seemed the domain didn't need to be so wide. This lets us increase the resolution and reduce the diffusivity, which is neat. It's a bit more turbulent now. Minor changes:. * Update style to be consistent with other examples / source code (commas, spaces, etc); * Reorganized the script to read like the other examples / tutorials (like a paper, parameters are introduced when they are used rather than at the top); * Reorganized a few other misc stuff for pedagogical reasons, like building buoyancy + coriolis together; * Note using a tuple for `ĝ` rather than `Array` means it can be used as a parameter on the GPU, so that's probably preferred. Arrays are needed only if we need to mutate elements or perform linear algebra.; * Change tilting angle to 3 degrees rather than 0.05 radians; * Don't import CUDA because the example wasn't GPU friendly anyways (if you like, we can make it GPU friendly but I don't think it should be ""partially"" GPU friendly since it just makes the code more complicated); * When I try to run the example multiple times I get `ERROR: LoadError: NetCDF error: Permission denied (NetCDF error code: 13)`. How can we avoid this error? I think it's important that users can easily change parameters and re-run without having to manually delete a file; this is key to productivity; * Plotting fewer contours makes the animation faster (the most expensive part of this example); * We don't need to form `Field`s any more for the output writers any more. Idle thoughts:. * This is a great inexpensive example. I do wonder if we should make it 3D with an LES closure?; * Can we tilt the visualization?

Performance," infrastructure, and is a satisfactory boundary condition for some cases. Would this be okay?. A simple matching scheme is a great place to start to justify changing the `Open` classification. > For example, in a nested case, this would prevent higher resolution eddies from exiting the domain without un-physically modifying the upstream solution. I apologize if this is just a problem with communication style, but I don't think this statement can possibly be correct. The above example seems to demonstrate, for example, that the cylinder wake can be represented well by _either_ making the domain large enough (with sponge layers), _or_ by using a better numerical method with a smaller domain. Basically this allows us to exclude statements like ""we can't model X flow"". The question is not whether or not we can represent the physics of a flow. The question is rather about representing the flow in a domain that is as small as possible / with optimal computational expense. We're pursuing performance optimization. Our language has to take the form ""this scheme allows us to reduce the sponge layer thickness by XX%"", or ""this scheme reduces the width of the near-boundary region where the interior physics are modified"". The statement ""this scheme does not unphysically modify the solution"" makes no sense to me. The presence of the open boundary is unphysical by definition... I personally don't need much convincing that a matching scheme of some kind is needed. I'm just confused about how all of the different pieces that seem to enter into nesting interact with one another --- sponge layers, matching scheme, and also the particular physics of the flow in question (idealized in and outflows vs true nesting). With so many degrees of freedom and complexity I think a systematic approach is absolutely essential. I really hope that the outcome of this work are a set of solid recommendations for nesting (better yet, a recipe that does not have to be changed --- a recommended matching sc",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-2033120291:1669,perform,performance,1669,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-2033120291,2,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimization', 'performance']"

Performance," makes some significant source code changes for what I think is a rather narrow application, which is disproportional compared to most of the other features we have I think. > If for some reason we cannot use a forcing function approach, we'll have to think carefully about how to design a flexible user API for ""particle-induced tracer forcing"". I think if we are going to add this then it should be more general than just a source/sink calculation --- ie, we should attempt to have a small source code addition that makes a wide range of new behavior possible, if we can. I've reconsidered this now and think we may not even need any source code change to properly implement this behaviour and integrate some particle induced tracer forcing. If we have a model with some tracers `(:A, :B)` which we want to force with some particles, we can define an auxiliary field `G\_p=TracerFields((:A, :B), grid)`. We can then have a particle dynamics function that modifies `model.auxiliary_fields.G\_p`, for example sets the points surrounding the particles to `-A[i, j, k]` for `A`, and `+A[i, j, k]` for `B` like in my example above. You can then define a discrete forcing function for each of the tracers like `a_forcing(i, j, k, grid, clock, model_fields) = model_fields.G\_p.A[i, j, k]` etc. (this would only work with my other PR #2733 added so that the `auxiliary_fields` are available). > It seems the memory requirement of the forcing function approach is proportional to the number of tracers, not the number of particles --- right? We would nee an ""auxiliary tendency"" for every tracer; the memory requirement doesn't change based on the number of particles. My reservation with this was that if there's e.g. 1 particle effecting loads of tracers you have to store lots more fields, but I see now that this is much less of an issue.

Performance," mostly a matter of choice (if the reconstruction is performed correctly for all stencils!). The general way to do this is to make them functions of a ""local smoothness indicator"" <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_r""> which is calculated as such; <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_{r} = \sum_{l=1}^k \int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i %2B 1/2}} \Delta x^{2l -1} \left( \frac{\partial^l p_r(x)}{\partial x^l} \right)^2 dx""> . These <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_r""> simplify quite nicely for uniform grids. the `streched_smoothness=true` option calculates the coefficients of these smoothness indicators for a stretched grid, by assuming that (<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k = 2"">). Then the weights are calculated as such; <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w_{r} = \frac{\alpha_r}{\alpha_0 %2B \alpha_1 %2B \alpha_2}""> . where <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha_r""> depends on the scheme used and differs between JS-WENO and Z-WENO. In the former; <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha_r = \frac{d_r}{(\beta_r %2B \varepsilon)^2}"">; In the latter ; <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha_r = d_r \left[ 1 %2B \left( \frac{ \left |\beta_2 - \beta_0 \right|}{\beta_r %2B \varepsilon} \right)^2 \right] "">; <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_r""> are optimized constants equal in both the schemes. the `zweno = true` flag just switches between these two formulations. Now, I believe that `stretched_smoothness` does not have a such big impact because if you assure that the reconstruction is correct, then all stencil correctly interpolate to the face and weights will still be between 0 and 1. This might be more impactful for grids that are much more non-uniform (or ""irregular"") than what we usually use.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2060#issuecomment-975649397:3530,optimiz,optimized,3530,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2060#issuecomment-975649397,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']

Returns an object P which; represents the linear operator computed by the FFT, and which contains all of the information needed to compute fft(A, dims) quickly. To apply P to an array A, use P * A; in general, the syntax for applying plans is much like that of matrices. (A plan can only be applied to arrays of the same size as the A for which; the plan was created.) You can also apply a plan with a preallocated output array Â by calling mul!(Â, plan, A). (For mul!, however, the input array A must be a complex floating-point; array like the output Â.) You can compute the inverse-transform plan by inv(P) and apply the inverse plan with P \ Â (the inverse plan is cached and reused for subsequent calls to inv or; \), and apply the inverse plan to a pre-allocated output array A with ldiv!(A, P, Â). The flags argument is a bitwise-or of FFTW planner flags, defaulting to FFTW.ESTIMATE. e.g. passing FFTW.MEASURE or FFTW.PATIENT will instead spend several seconds (or more) benchmarking; different possible FFT algorithms and picking the fastest one; see the FFTW manual for more information on planner flags. The optional timelimit argument specifies a rough upper bound on; the allowed planning time, in seconds. Passing FFTW.MEASURE or FFTW.PATIENT may cause the input array A to be overwritten with zeros during plan creation. plan_fft! is the same as plan_fft but creates a plan that operates in-place on its argument (which must be an array of complex floating-point numbers). plan_ifft and so on are similar; but produce plans that perform the equivalent of the inverse transforms ifft and so on. help?> plan_fft!; search: plan_fft! plan_ifft! plan_bfft! plan_fft plan",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/119#issuecomment-471179127:1066,cache,cached,1066,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/119#issuecomment-471179127,1,['cache'],['cached']

It's easier for the compiler to optimize code that involves `ifelse`, especially on the GPU. The reason is that it's allowed to execute all code on both branches. If we use short-circuiting logic, then I guess many optimizations are not possible, because execution on one branch or another must be completely excluded.

The compiler decides based on a heuristic whether or not to ""inline"" a function (meaning, rather than compiling code for a function independently and jumping to that code at the right moment, it combines the function code with the code that calls the function).

Performance," some mixed behavior where the user specifies both a default *and* particular values for tracer diffusivity. This would be useful in the (possibly rare) use-case of a large number of tracers with the same diffusivity, but where one or two of them require a special, different diffusivity. I am not sure this API is necessary so I left it for future work. Diffusivity-like fields include:. * `κ` (constant component of tracer diffusivity) for `ConstantIsotropicDiffusivity`, `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation`, and `ConstantSmagorinsky`; * `Pr` (turbulent Prandtl number) for `ConstantSmagorinsky`; * `κh` and `κv` for `ConstantAnisotropicDiffusivity`. ## Internal algorithmic considerations. This implementation includes a major refactor of the time-stepping algorithm. In particular, kernels are launched for *each* tracer for all operations that involve tracers. This differs from the previous pattern, in which a single kernel was called in some cases (for example, to update the velocity and tracer fields, or to store previous source terms). The reason for this change is because I ran into some issues (dynamic function invocations) using `ntuple` to unroll a loop over tracers inside the kernel. In addition, I think that with a large number of tracers the kernels may become too large and their performance could degrade (but I'm not sure). This refactoring of the algorithm means we need to . - [ ] benchmark the changes in this PR to see if there are any significant changes in model performance. . @ali-ramadhan, can you help with this?. If there are changes in model performance, we can work on unrolling loops over the tracer fields *inside* our kernels. This is probably possible; it just requires some debugging. We would probably also want to make sure that this doesn't lead to poor performance for up to O(10) tracers. If any of this PR is not satisfactory, I'm happy to work on it and iterate until the PR is in mergeable shape.

Performance," tridiagonal solver in the pure FFT solver. You might argue that we just put nothing if we don't need it, but then we have more ""ambiguous"" fields like eigenvalues that are not needed in the tridiagonal solver and source_term that is not needed in the FFT. I am not convinced that a single solver would lead to less (or cleaner) code. Mostly because the underlying code (constructor and `solve!` functions) is compact and slender enough to justify writing individual functions for different grids (the number of lines in the docstring for the `DistributedFourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` is comparable to the code related to the solver). I think this improves the interpretability of the algorithm. Maybe an improvement would be writing a unified constructor that would spit out the different solvers. > 2. It might make sense to split the constructor into two parts, so that we can build a tridiagonal solver even when all three directions are regular. That could be useful for testing, for example. . I have added this capability by passing the `stretched_direction` kwarg. > Also note that in terms of operation count the tridiagonal solve is cheaper than FFT... I think, all things considered, the mixed FFT / tridiagonal solve will have basically the same computational cost as the pure FFT solve only for a stretched x direction. The additional transposes required for a y or stretched z direction will completely dominate the cost of the actual operations. As an example, this is a slab decomposition with a fairly big grid (512 x 256^2) split on 2 GPUs on Tartarus; ![311333172-43dba752-a91f-4b33-8ade-5a6ec57c982b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a376c1e-9912-4e00-8dca-91deb46338f8); The AlltoAllv is the dominant cost, while the FFT (in between the two transposes) is quite irrelevant. In the near future, I'll perform scaling tests on Perlmutter, which has a much better network, so it might be that (even if I think it's unlikely) the cost is not all communication after all.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3689#issuecomment-2276030073:2336,perform,perform,2336,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3689#issuecomment-2276030073,1,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"# Introduction. This PR introduces `AbstractOperation`s for constructing 3D expressions with a friendly syntax (eg, not writing kernels), which can then be evaluated online during a simulation for diagnostics / output purposes. This PR introduces four kinds of `AbstractOperation`s:. 1. `Derivative` (things like `∂x`, `∂y`); 2. `BinaryOperation` (things like `a-b`, `a^b`); 3. `UnaryOperation` (things like `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`); 4. `PolynaryOperation` (things like `a + b + c + d` or `a * b * c * d`). All of these act on combinations of `Field`, `Function`, and `Number`. `. `AbstractOperation`s arise from what appears to be ordinary arithmetic and calculus performed on `Field`s. Consider this example:. ```julia; julia> using Oceananigans; using Oceananigans: Face, Cell; using Oceananigans.AbstractOperations. grid = RegularCartesianGrid((16, 16, 16), (16, 16, 16));; a = Field(Cell, Cell, Cell, CPU(), grid);; b = Field(Cell, Cell, Cell, CPU(), grid);; a_times_b = a * b;. julia> typeof(a_times_b).name.wrapper; Oceananigans.AbstractOperations.BinaryOperation; ```. Here, the object `a_times_b` is of the type `BinaryOperation`. `a_times_b` can be indexed into like an array or field, however:. ```julia; julia> a_times_b[8, 8, 8]; 0.0. set!(a, rand(size(grid)...)); set!(b, rand(size(grid)...)). julia> a_times_b[8, 8, 8]; 0.5342645056606357; ```. # Staggered grids, interpolation, and operation ""location"". Operations can also be defined between fields at different locations in the staggered grid:. ```julia; julia> u, v, w = Oceananigans.VelocityFields(CPU(), grid);. julia> u_times_v = u * v;. julia> Oceananigans.location(u_times_v); (Face, Cell, Cell); ```. Note that the location of an operation defaults to the location of the *first* field involved. . This submodule also exports a macro `@at` for specifying the location of an operation. Therefore we can write. ```julia; julia> kinetic_energy = @at (Cell, Cell, Cell) (u^2 + v^2 + w^2) / 2;. julia> Oceananigans.location(kinetic_en",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/463:662,perform,performed,662,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/463,1,['perform'],['performed']

Thus when we _pickup_ from the checkpoint, we start a little bit in the past, and have to run past the point that was already saved. I think the simplest way to solve this is just to wrap `write_output!` in try/catch, so that we can try to continue even if we can't write output (perhaps emitting a warning). This is probably nice for other reasons too (ie in a very complex simulation with tons of output, some necessary, some not, we might prefer a very annoying, persistent, and obvious warning that one of the outputs doesn't work instead of an outright error). We _could_ also add a property to control this behavior with an innocuous default (ie `catch_errors=false` or something). ## The dangerous overwrite_existing. Another usability issue I noticed is that it's easy to make mistakes with `overwrite_existing`. It's convenient to toggle this on when starting from 0 (sometimes there's an iterative process involved in starting a simulation: fiddling with time-steps, an error in the output writer, error in a callback, blah blah). But when running with `pickup=true` we definitely do _not_ want to overwrite an existing output file. I'm wondering if we should implement behavior where `pickup=true` _overrides_ `overwrite_existing=true`. This would mean that if we pickup we _cannot_ overwrite an existing file (if for some reason we do want that, we'd have to delete it manually). I think this is really the behavior we want. However, it requires refactoring the output writers, because we have to move output writer initialization from the outpu",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2535:261,Load,LoadError,261,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2535,1,['Load'],['LoadError']
Performance,"## From Slack:; Why Julia? I think I know the answer, but I thought it would be nice to have a session answering this question on the documentation. What do you guys think?. @glwagner discussion:; That’s a great idea! I also think a little statement about our goals / mission would be good. My short answer is that achieving all our goals (script based API, cpu/gpu polymorphism, user code injection into the model, DSL for high performance diagnostics, etc) can be achieved in python but we think would probably be a lot more difficult and require a lot more engineering.",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2308:429,perform,performance,429,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2308,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,", no need to modify existing code. This way MPI does not invade the core code base making it easier to maintain, and there will be a very clear boundary between ""core Oceananigans"" and ""distributed parallelism functionality"" which I think will serve us well in the future as MPI seems to permeate deeply into other codes, making them hard to modify. The big thing that is missing is of course the distributed pressure solver, the hard thing to implement. This is where [DistributedTranspose.jl](https://github.com/leios/DistributedTranspose.jl) will come in handy. I also recently found [PencilFFTs.jl](https://github.com/jipolanco/PencilFFTs.jl) which also looks interesting. cc @leios. For testing purposes, I'm tempted to do the pressure solve via an `MPI.Gather` onto rank 0 where it can be solved locally then an `MPI.Scatter` to pass the pressure to all ranks. Super inefficient but might be good to ensure that the `DistributedModel` can reproduce existing regression tests. Performance issues:; * Right now `MPI.Isend`, `MPI.Recv!`, and `MPI.SendRecv!` all expect send and receive buffers to be contiguous in memory I believe. To get around this I allocate memory for these buffers, but this is definitely not performant. @vchuravy suggested that we may be able to send and receive into strided buffers, so will look into this. cc @simonbyrne maybe you know more about this?. Quality of life features we may want in the future (which might effect design choices):; * Distributed diagnostics: these will be pretty expensive no matter how we implement them due to the extra reduction step (`MPI.Gather`) required across all ranks.

Performance,", v, w)];. julia> kinetic_energy[8, 8, 8]; 0.789860912635921; ```. # Special considerations. There are a few special rules to how operations are handled:. * A `BinaryOperation` between two fields at the same location is always performed at their common location;. * a `BinaryOperation` between a field and a number always takes place at the location of the field. These special rules override the specification of operator location via `@at`. Thus, for example, in the operation. ```julia; uv = @at (Cell, Cell, Cell) u * v + v^2; ```. the product `u*v` is computed at the cell center, while `v^2` is computed at the `v`-point `Cell, Face, Cell`, and afterwards interpolated to cell centers. This functionality is achieved by endowing `BinaryOperation` with three interpolation operators: two interpolation operators applied to each field prior to interpolation, and an interpolation operator that is applied to the result. Special cases can then be handled by defining operators for cases in which a computation should be performed at the location of one or both of the fields. Furthermore, we do not provide `PolynaryOperation`s with default locations. In other words, a `PolynaryOperation` only arises when location is specified, eg:. ```julia; julia> op1 = u + v + w;. julia> op2 = @at (Cell, Cell, Cell) u + v + w;. julia> typeof(op1).name.wrapper; Oceananigans.AbstractOperations.BinaryOperation. julia> typeof(op2).name.wrapper; Oceananigans.AbstractOperations.PolynaryOperation; ```. This also means that all fields in a `PolynaryOperation` are interpolated *prior* to computation. # Computations. This PR also adds a type for making ""computations"" with an `AbstractOperation`. We call this a `Computation`. From the tests:. ```julia; T, S = model.tracers; computation = Computation(S + T, model.pressures.pHY′); compute!(computation); ```. which launches a 3D kernel to compute the result of an `AbstractOperation` at every grid point, storing the result in `computation.result` (which here h",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/463:4758,perform,performed,4758,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/463,1,['perform'],['performed']

Essentially we need an FFT for periodic dimensions and we have the choice of using either a DCT or a TRIdiagonal solve for wall-bounded dimensions, although TRI may only be used once. . Some notes:; 1. Multiple wall-bounded dimensions will require the use of a DCT somewhere.; 2. Solvers for vertically stretched grids need to use TRI in the vertical.; 3. For stretched grids in multiple dimensions I believe that a direct solve is no longer possible and an iterative method such as conjugate gradient must be used. I do not consider this case.; 4. We have the option of using a DCT or a TRI. Which one we pick will depend on performance benchmarks between the two solvers. We should pick the faster one. This could depend on the number of vertical levels.; 5. Unfortunately I don't think we can get rid of the in-place DCT algorithm that employs permutations on the GPU as it will be needed for channels and boxes at least. It may also turn out to be more efficient for regular grids in some cases.; 6. We should reuse solvers as much as possible.; 7. While it looks like we have many solvers to implement, I think if we abstract away the steps then each solver just needs to implement something like a `forward_x_transform`, `forward_y_transform`, `forward_z_transform`, `backward_z_transform`, etc. then we can implement many solvers without repeating code. For now, I will first just focus on getting Poisson solvers working for vertically stretched grids in doubly periodic domains on the CPU and GPU. This will offer a chance to do some refactoring and benchmarking. We also need to try out faster tridiagonal matrix algorithms",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/586:1868,perform,performance,1868,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/586,1,['perform'],['performance']

Some comments:; * Switching to `Float32` actually slowed things down on my CPU (and on the cluster).; * No surprise: GPU does better with bigger problems. Running another benchmark with 512x512x512 to see if we can break 200x!; * When I did this kind of timing a couple of weeks ago I only saw CPU->GPU speedups of ~90x but now we're getting ~195x for the largest model with `Float32`.

Performance,": `ImmersedBoundaryGrid(grid, ib, active_cells_map = true)`; - added a `required_halo_size::Int ` keyword argument to `ScalarDiffusivity` (defaults to 1) and `ScalarBiharmonicDiffusivity` (defaults to 2) to be specified by the user which sets the required halo for the specific `ν` or `κ` function (closures have now an explicitly required number of halos); #### **Major** internals change; 1) The tendencies are calculated at the **end** of a time step. Therefore at the end of a simulation `model.timestepper` will hold tendencies for the last time step completed . 2) Removed `fill_halo_regions!` for hydrostatic pressure in both the non-hydrostatic and the hydrostatic model and for w-velocity in the hydrostatic model. The halos are filled by enlarging the size of the kernels in `update_hydrostatic_pressure!` and `compute_w_from_continuity!` to incorporate the needed ghost points. 2) Removed `fill_halo_regions!` for diffusivities **only for halo-passing BC**; the halo calculation is now performed by launching the `calculate_diffusivity!` kernel inside the ghost nodes before recomputing the tendencies. This requires knowing how many halos each closure requires. 3) Added a _required_halo_ parameter to `AbstractTurbulenceClosure`. This means that each parameterization will have to specify explicitly the number of halos required to calculate the diffusivity: ; e.g ; ```julia; abstract type AbstractTurbulenceClosure{TimeDiscretization, BoundaryBuffer} end; abstract type AbstractScalarDiffusivity{TD, F, N} <: AbstractTurbulenceClosure{TD, N} end; struct TwoDimensionalLeith{FT, CR, GM, M} <: AbstractScalarDiffusivity{ExplicitTimeDiscretization, ThreeDimensionalFormulation, 2}; ``` ; Where Leith closure requires 2 halos (one for the vorticity calculation and an additional one for the vorticity derivative). #### **Minor** internals change; removed the general `calculate_nonlinear_viscosity!` and `calculate_nonlinear_diffusivity!` kernels (to each turbulence closure their own kerne",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3125:3996,perform,performed,3996,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3125,1,['perform'],['performed']
