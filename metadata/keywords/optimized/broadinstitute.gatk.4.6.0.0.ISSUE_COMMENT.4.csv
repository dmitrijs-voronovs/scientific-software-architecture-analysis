Deployability,"I thought after the last comment of @vdauwera in the [blog post about the removal](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/7131/is-indel-realignment-removed-from-gatk4) that it will be possible to port it here as a contribution (without too much effort from your dev team). If the final solution is that this is not going to be maintained in GATK4, I would port this code to my own software if you give me the permission; but it is definitely something that the community is interested. For example, I'm working with Pool-Seq data with hundreds of individuals together, so `HaplotypeCaller` is not a possibility in our case. I'm actually evaluating other approaches for realignment, such as [ABRA](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu376) or [SRMA](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r99). I'm even thinking on implementing a new realigner based on the GATK's assembler engine and its PairHMM; but this requires more time for evaluation, and it will be nice to be able to compare with the current indel realignment pipeline.

Deployability,"I would like to reiterate that the one code path in ADAM that is. 1. changed between 0.20.0 and 0.23.0 and; 2. that is used in both the GATK BQSR and HC engines. is the two bit file parsing and extraction engine. The main commit that changed in that code path was https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/commit/1eed8e8e464f8f92a6e87afc1d334e751423e810, which reverts cleanly on ADAM trunk. There are also some changes in the `ReferenceRegion` class, they appear to be mostly cosmetic, but this necessitated changing one parameter from `null` to `Strand.INDEPENDENT` in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/8a366c7ba570c61338f7109b86c3284b80d5cf47. The GATK does one lookup into the TwoBitFile (which creates one ReferenceRegion along the way) per read during BQSR and two per assembly region during HC, so this code is inside your inner loop. Again, all it should take to test this hypothesis is:. ```; git clone git@github.com:bigdatagenomics/adam.git; cd adam; git checkout adam-parent-spark2_2.10-0.23.0; git revert 1eed8e8e464f8f92a6e87afc1d334e751423e810; mvn install -DskipTests; ```.

Deployability,"I'm not sure what proportion of users leverage the incremental import functionality...it wasn't available when GenomicsDBImport was first made available, but has been around for ~3 years now. As for workspaces with whole chromosomes -- there is no requirement or performance benefits to using whole chromosomes. As you say, subsetting a chromosome to smaller regions will work and make the import and query parallelizable. (if you remember where the advice about whole chromosomes came from, let us know. That might be something that needs to be updated/clarified). Many small contigs does add overhead to import though and, till recently, multiple contigs couldn't be imported together (i.e., each contig would have it's own folder under the GenomicsDB workspace - which gets inefficient with many small contigs). For WGS, probably the best way to create the GenomicsDBImport interval list is to split based on where there are consecutive N's in the reference genome (maybe using [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#ScatterIntervalsByNs)) and/or regions that you are blacklisting. I think you suggested that some of the blacklisted regions were especially gnarly - maybe ploidy or high alternate allele count? - depending on the frequency of those, we may save a bit on space/memory requirements. That may address your concern about overlap between variants and import intervals. In general, any variant that starts in a specified import interval will show up in a query to that workspace.

However, this exercise has revealed some other changes:. `GenotypeGVCFsEngine.callRegion` contains the line `final VariantContext mergedVC = merger.merge(variantsToProcess, loc, ref.getBase(), !outputNonVariants, false)`. Since we want to remove the non-ref allele regardless, we should replace `!outputNonVariants` with `true`. It is important to do this here, because only then does `regenotypeVC` correctly restrict the `AD` to the emitted alleles. Also, doing this strips the variant QUAL from the output if it's monomorphic, which is desired (the `RGQ` field is in the output, so there remains a sense of the quality of the call).

Deployability,"In the WGS SV pipeline, for deletions and duplications that the pipeline believes to be biallelic we do the following:. - ALT: `<DEL>` or `<DUP>`; - SVTYPE: `DEL` or `DUP`; - GT: `0/0` or `0/1` or `1/1`. We currently report depth based copy number and quality for these variants in custom format fields `RD_CN` and `RD_GQ` if they are available; we could possibly move those values to the standard `CN` and `CNQ`, but there is some complexity in how to handle events detected by paired end and split reads without good read depth support; ie those under 1kb or so depending on our depth binning size and the coverage. Our depth genotyping module makes estimates of copy number for these sites but sometimes these can be very inaccurate so at the moment we prefer not to report total copy number in those fields. Probably what we _should_ do is fill in CN with 0, 1, or 2 based on the genotype we emitted and set CNQ to the value we computed for GQ. For multiallelic CNVs (i.e. sites where our model is not sure that the variant is bi-allelic) we write:. - ALT: `<CNV>`; - SVTYPE: `CNV`; - GT and GQ: `.`; - CN and CNQ: estimate of total (diploid/unphased) copy number and quality of the depth evidence. I think there are some tradeoffs in completely characterizing the evidence for and quality of each call and enabling easy searching across the whole VCF without having to parse and understand the entire record. Older versions of our pipeline used to put the diploid copy number of the event into the GT field, I think similarly to what's being described above. This is incorrect VCF -- GT values should be indices into the allele list for the variant, and should be a list of length equal to the ploidy. . My view is that if you can confidently infer the alleles present at the site in the sample set you should use a GT value of the form `0/1`, and if you don't know or aren't interested in trying to infer them you should use CN for total copy number and CNQ for the quality.

Can we take a look at some real-world examples?. -Same goes for the fact that homs will be unlikely. -Not sure about the dropouts. Might be worth running without SNPs as a confounding factor. -How flexible is SVGen? Might be worth putting together a more realistic simulated data set. Any chance @MartonKN might be able to use it to cook up some realistic tumor data?. -I don’t recall having a `CollectBaseCallCoverage` type tool in beta—which tool are you thinking of? On a related note, it seems there is some demand to port `DepthOfCoverage` from GATK3. However, I’d prefer that we roll a CNV-specific version of the tool even if it does get ported. In any case, I think along with findings from the other issue, we should issue a quick PR for `CollectReadCounts` and go ahead to change the `CollectCounts` WDL task to call it—it’s for this very reason that the task is named generically! @sooheelee note that we may have to update the tutorials, etc. at some point, but perhaps the right time will be until all evaluations are more complete. Speaking of which, this PR should not delay getting the first round of automated evaluations up and running. Again, the whole point of those is to have a reproducible baseline metric against which we can easily experiment with and adopt these sorts of changes.

Given this issue, and the unrelated but evolving requirement that we have more than a single conda yml (we need a separate one with the intel tensorflow version that supports acceleration on intel hardware), I'm going to make the following changes:. Add a single conda template and a gradle task that generates the two (nearly but not quite identical) yml files as part of the build. These will be stored in the build directory with the python package archive, so the yml file no longer has to specify a path to the zip (which we previously had to strip when we included the file in the zip/tar distribution). The zip and yml files will be copied into the tar/zip distributions as was previously done.; Add a gradle target that creates/updates the local conda dev.

The parentheses are confounding but not relevant - the failing case above that uses no parens references `MQRandSum` (sic); the succeeding case references `MQRankSum`. Separating the expression components into separate filter expression arguments **does** change the results because each expression is evaluated individually and serially, so a reference to a missing value in one expression results in a `PASS`, but the subsequent expression results in the filter being applied if it meets the criteria.

This seems to be occurring for haplotypes with long indels inside their assembly padding that don't have enough spanning sequence to resolve. Since the variation is inside the padding, it seems safe to ignore. Increasing padding resolves the issue, alhtough this is at the cost of runtime and should not be necessary. For example, suppose we have a ref haplotype ABCDD, where A, B, and C represent sequences of, say, 100 bases and D is a sequence of 50 bases. Suppose further that A and DD are the padding. Then the cigar of an alt haplotype ABCD gets aligned as a 350 base match that doesn't span the full padded reference region, leading to the error.

Deployability,It should also be noted that the current behavior of the HaplotypeCaller on low base quality reads could be better. Specifically in the PairHMM there is code that explicitly caps the base qualities for every base in every read to be at most the reads Mapping Quality. Empirically this doesn't seem to sufficiently penalize low MQ reads in the HMM scores which is part of the reason for the hard cuttoff. In the upcoming DRAGEN-GATK release code we disable this particular behavior and instead apply a secondary genotyping algorithm in the genotyper that attempts to partition the evidence by mapping quality and adjust the score if there is a significant difference in MQ between reads supporting the various alleles. No doubt there could be other approaches for capping MQ (possibly a reads HMM likelihoods contribution can be capped based on its MQ as well which is also a part of the DRAGEN-GATK).,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7034#issuecomment-758861915:432,release,release,432,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7034#issuecomment-758861915,1,['release'],['release']

In contrast, I kicked off CBS 45 minutes ago, and it's still running... @LeeTL1220 this is probably ready to hand off to you for some WDL writing and preliminary evaluation. ; Although I can't guarantee that there aren't bugs, I ran about ~80 exomes with no problem.

That tool fails early if the output directory is not writeable or does not exist, and although there is a code path later that suggests that output directories should be created, it is not reached due to this early fail. It might be that this inconsistency was introduced in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1208 and I did not catch it in my PR review. @yfarjoun any opinions what the intended behavior should be? Are there any conventions for Picard tools in general?. Perhaps we could enforce this at the engine level (maybe checks that are triggered by annotations such as suggested in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/141, if possible)? But this would only work for GATK tools and would still rely on the diligence of developers.

We've already updated enough exact-match expected results to make me a bit uncomfortable!. Someone else may want to tackle fixing the tests in a separate push, but I think it makes sense for me to focus on avoiding these sorts of issues when writing tests for the new tools. EDIT: For the record, I confirmed that the undesired behavior in this test that the RNG hack was trying to avoid was fixed (and hence, the test was ""broken"") in #6425. Probably wasn't noticed because this is the only non-exact-match test and the test isn't strict enough to check that attempts 1-3 fail, it only checks that we succeed by attempt 4.

As I understand, normally I should have added `@RG`s at the mapping step. Neither `MarkDuplicates` nor `SplitNCigarReads` gave any warning about it, so I only figured the problem at the final step. I have then added totally fake `@RG`s to my files just after SplitNCigarReads step, and it worked - then why HaplotypeCaller can't do something similar in case when RGs are not present?; Thanks! . > ; > ; > Got it.

We aim for all documentation to be complete by December 14. It's possible we will organize the forum tool documentation to mirror that of this categorization. There was talk today in a meeting with the engine team that we should propose multiple categorizations, for the (much later, not upcoming release) possibility for listing tools based on user preference, e.g. by functional category or by input file type. So any work you do towards categorization could be useful down the road. . Here are some questions that were raised during the meeting:; - GATK vs Picard should be separate. One reason is because the standard arguments are different.; - The categories within each program would mirror.; - Consistent categorization. Last I checked, CNV tools were listed in its own category while other tools appear organized by input file type. Because we need to also ensure every tool (excepting Spark and BWA) has a summary description and example command, it would be useful for documentation purposes at least, to have functional categories that take the same or related inputs, e.g. any type of interval list (BED, Picard style or GATK), so that we can group testing of the tool commands and there is minimal context switching.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1669#issuecomment-341247706:71,update,updated,71,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1669#issuecomment-341247706,2,"['release', 'update']","['release', 'updated']"

Deployability,"Let's discuss further before you get too far along. The design of the Collections code was intended to ensure that very strict file formats are adhered to within the CNV pipeline. Making it more flexible to accommodate TSVs with arbitrary column headers, relax requirements for sequence dictionaries, etc. undermines that goal. There are also two other issues to consider:. 1) It looks like @jonn-smith has also been putting considerable effort into building a TSV framework for Funcotator. Perhaps CombineSegmentBreakpoints should consider using that framework instead, if it is more appropriate. We can also discuss bringing the CNV pipeline over into that framework, but this should definitely wait until after release. The end goal is for CNV team to spend as little time as possible writing or maintaining any code related to TSV parsing. 2) @mbabadi has put together some python evaluation code for the new gCNV, which makes use of the IntervalTree python package and PyVCF to accomplish some things that are very similar to what CombineSegmentBreakpoints is doing. Perhaps we could implement a similar approach purely in Java by making use of the IntervalTree implementation in htsjdk. I think for now we should treat CombineSegmentBreakpoints as a one-off tool to be used for internal validations. After release, we should design a more generic evaluation tool. This tool could take as input multiple collections of annotated locatables, with a few rigidly defined formats allowed (e.g., VCF, CNV Collection TSVs, perhaps some TSVs from other tools, etc.), with one designated as ground truth. The regions for evaluation could also be specified via -L (since it is possible this might not completely specified by the ground-truth collection).

I guess this is supposed to ensure that the installs don't fail due to intermittent connection errors, etc., but each repo is only hit once and it's possible for the loop to exit with dependencies still missing. Could this have happened when the current base image was built and pushed? @jamesemery did you push this image?. Also, I learned that *reshape2* (as opposed to reshape) is actually a dependency of ggplot2 that is automatically installed along with ggplot2. So the original removal of reshape from the `install.packages` list was fine. However, the import statement that is removed in this PR fails whether or not ggplot2 successfully installs, and is extraneous in any case.

Deployability,"Looks like the problem occurs when the cram dictionary is ""compatible"" with the reference dictionary according to our validation routines, but the reference dictionary does not contain all contigs from the cram dictionary. We are going to make our dictionary validation stricter to prevent this (https://github.com/broadinstitute/hellbender/issues/802). We should also patch htsjdk to throw a nicer error than `NullPointerException` in this case -- ie., insert a check after `CRAMIterator` line 158 that throws a `RuntimeException` with a nice ""contig from cram header not found in reference"" message if refs == null.

Deployability,Looks like there was an R error in Carrot. Fortunately the actual meat of the Carrot test ran to completion (for the CHM) I have also checked that this matches for the exome and the NIST sample. I would say that these samples are exactly matching in terms of their VCFeval output and thus we can be confident that this branch did not break the standard pipeline path and we can call this 👍. ```; Type | Precision | Recall | F1_Score | TP_Eval | TP_Base | FP | FN | Stratifier | IGV_Session | UNK | Name | Truth_Set | Summary_Type | Comparison_Engine; -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --; SNP | 0.9706 | 0.9863 | 0.9784 | 3473278 | 3489284 | 105213 | 48308 | NA | gs://dsde-methods-carrot-prod-cromwell/BenchmarkVCFsHeadToHeadOrchestrated/7012fa81-18fd-4c9c-8722-22c9d7fa642d/call-CHMSampleHeadToHead/BenchmarkComparison/ae3dcac7-7105-4847-ac07-f9f64a43c4c8/call-BenchmarkVCFControlSample/Benchmark/67f50e9a-e7a3-4b31-9d14-d700b46ddfa5/call-VcfEvalWriteXMLfile/shard-0/CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002_CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222_vcfeval.xml | 539662 | CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002 | CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222 | summary | VcfEval; INDEL | 0.8814 | 0.8636 | 0.8724 | 485076 | 465627 | 65264 | 73548 | NA | gs://dsde-methods-carrot-prod-cromwell/BenchmarkVCFsHeadToHeadOrchestrated/7012fa81-18fd-4c9c-8722-22c9d7fa642d/call-CHMSampleHeadToHead/BenchmarkComparison/ae3dcac7-7105-4847-ac07-f9f64a43c4c8/call-BenchmarkVCFControlSample/Benchmark/67f50e9a-e7a3-4b31-9d14-d700b46ddfa5/call-VcfEvalWriteXMLfile/shard-0/CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002_CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222_vcfeval.xml | 429205 | CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002 | CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222 | summary | VcfEval; Type | Precision | Recall | F1_Score | TP_Eval | TP_Base | FP | FN | Stratifier | IGV_Session | UNK | Name | Truth_Set | Summary_Type | Comparison_Engine; SNP | 0.9743 | 0.99 | 0.9821 | 3384890 | 3391796 | 89358 | 34303 | HCR | gs://dsde-methods-carrot-prod-cromwell/BenchmarkVCFsHeadToHeadOrchestrated/7012fa81-18fd-,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8609#issuecomment-1850884297:353,pipeline,pipeline,353,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8609#issuecomment-1850884297,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Multiple causes can cause closed connections when reading from GCS, almost all of which are outside of our control. This will never be ""completely fixed"" in the sense that even if the code is perfect it's completely possible to send too many requests to GCS, and it'll respond by closing connections. The main factors that I know of are:. - number of concurrent accesses to the GCS bucket in question; - number of concurrent accesses to the GCP project in question; - storage class of the GCS bucket in question (the more expensive ones have more replicas, thus can handle a higher load). If you're running into those difficulties I would suggest trying to reduce the load (reduce the number of concurrent workers or threads) and making sure it's not a single-region storage bucket. If that fails, perhaps try using a different bucket that no one else is also using (to reduce other sources of load). If I understand correctly that you didn't change the version you're using but are suddenly seeing more issues than before, then perhaps the cause is a server-side change from GCS (outside of our control), a change in configuration (are you reading from a bucket of a different class from before), or perhaps just an increase of other activity on the same bucket/project. The current code is very persistent in its retries: as you can see from the messages it spent a whole half hour waiting. If it's an overload situation then you may get better performance by reducing the worker count (as they will have to retry less).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716:1118,configurat,configuration,1118,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"My first idea was to port it to ReadTools (that's why I asked to change it to the public code when GATK3 was divided into the non-free version and the plan was not to port indel-realignment). Nevertheless, someone showed interest into this and that's why I did this PRs; in addition, it is much better than the original authors (if still at Broad) can contribute to see if the port is correct. Anyway, I don't have any strong feeling about this, and I can always port the pipeline to ReadTools and maintain it there (actually, I had some ideas for other realignment methods and it will be interesting to compare with this). @cmnbroad - this was a long time ago, when even some of the standards (documentation and kebab-case arguments) were not even implemented. Regarding the tests, the last commit includes one using a BAM file in the repository, and the output was generated with GATK3 (if I remember correctly, although I can't remember the version). I think that the best way to go is to re-open a PR to have a cleaner history and proper standards. The idea will be:. 1. Copy of the GATK3 files (from the latest release); 2. Reformat (license and coding-style); 3. Port to the new framework.; 4. Convert documentation and arguments to the GATK4 format; 5. Add tests by running the latest GATK3 release on data in the repository and checking concordance. If a different dataset should be used for the tests, it will be nice if you can provide some. Otherwise, I will use data in the repository (b37_reference_20_21 and NA12878_20_21_WGS_bam)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-363745763:472,pipeline,pipeline,472,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-363745763,3,"['pipeline', 'release']","['pipeline', 'release']"

Changing SamAssertionUtils to use either SILENT or LENIENT does fix the integration test, and all the other tests pass, but it seems like a relaxing of the stringency, and I'm not sure it should be necessary to the BQSR test.

Deployability,"Next I set out to determine whether hellbender is slowing down on the larger interval simply because there is more data / a longer traversal, or because it's slower at processing the `1:1-10000000` interval than the `1:10000000-20000000` interval. And surprisingly, it appears that the latter is the case:. Time to process the `1:1-10000000` interval across two runs:. ```; GATK3: 5m25.983s 5m31.913s; HB: 6m2.156s 5m59.804s; ```. (Recall that HB was ~5% faster than GATK3 at processing the `1:10000000-20000000` interval). Moreover, our newly-installed progress meter shows that the rate at which we process records is unusually low at the start of the `1:1-10000000` interval, but is consistent throughout the processing of the `1:10000000-20000000` interval:.

Deployability,"No - you should use GenomicsDB as the input to GenotypeGVCFs. My suggestion to use SelectVariants was only a debugging step to check whether GenomicsDB included the expected input data. Also, I misread your original post -- your GVCFs have literally 109 sites? And the interval list/bed file has 109 sites, not 109 regions? I would strongly recommend using a single interval in that case. Having a subfolder for each site will lead to a lot of unnecessary overhead. Lastly, I would recommend upgrading to a newer GATK. 4.1.8.0 is exactly 2 years old it seems...there's been quite a few changes/updates since then. edit: and to resolve why the number of subfolders in the workspace don't match the lines in the bed file -- my guess is that some of the sites in the bed file are abutting each other.

I think it would be easiest for the reviewer to look at the 4 ""bubbled up..."" commits separately when reviewing the exposure of each parameter set, but then look at the overall commit when reviewing more superficial things or the tests.; 4) I'd appreciate it if the reviewer double checked that I did not switch anything up in parameter names, doc strings, default values, etc. when introducing the 12 explicit args in AssemblyBasedCallerArgumentCollection.

Deployability,"OK, I experimented a bit with removing the R install from the base image and adding the R dependencies to the conda environment in a branch and rebased on that. A few issues that I've run into or that came up in discussion with @jamesemery and @cmnbroad:. -I moved all tests that depend on R into the `python` test group (which should perhaps be renamed to `conda`). Note that some of these also fall into the `spark` test group---not sure if there is any special Spark setup done for that group, but we should make sure that they don't fail if they're not run with the conda environment. -@cmnbroad mentioned that some Picard tools that depend on R may break outside of the conda environment if the user does not have the R dependencies. -When we install R in the base image, we pull in a lot of basic dependencies (e.g., build-essential, various libraries and compilers, etc.) So when the R install is removed, it looks like many tests begin failing or hanging, perhaps because they are falling back on Java implementations (e.g., AVX PairHMM tests).

Deployability,"OK, I think things are looking good! Updated a bunch of things, including the following:. - conda 23.1.0 -> 23.10.0; in the base Docker, also disabled conda auto-updating and set the solver to the much faster libmamba (NOTE: before this PR went in, this change was actually made in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8610); - python 3.6.10 -> 3.10.13; - pymc 3.1 -> 5.10.0; - theano 1.0.4 -> pytensor 2.18.1; - added pytorch 2.1.0; - removed tensorflow 1.15.0 and other CNN dependencies; - added libblas-dev to the base Docker; I think MKL versions of all packages are being used, but we should verify!. These and other packages (numpy, scipy, etc.) are all pretty much at the latest available versions for python 3.10. I've also bumped version numbers for our internal python packages. I also made all of the changes to the gCNV code to accommodate any changes introduced by PyMC/Pytensor. For the most part, these were minor renamings of `theano`/`tt`/etc. to `pytensor`/`pt`/etc. However, there were some more nontrivial changes, including to 1) model priors (since some of the distributions previously used were removed or are now supported differently), 2) the implementation of posterior sampling, 3) some shape/dimshuffle operations, and other things along these lines. Using a single test shard of 20 1kGP WES samples x 1000 intervals, I have verified determinism/reproducibility for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy COHORT/CASE modes, GermlineCNVCaller COHORT/CASE modes, and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors).

Deployability,"OK, looks like you can get around the compiler lock issues by pointing each invocation of GermlineCNVCaller to a different compilation directory. For example, invoke `gatk` by. `THEANORC=PATH/TO/THEANORC_# gatk GermlineCNVCaller ...`. This uses the `THEANORC` environment variable to set the `.theanorc` configuration file to `PATH/TO/THEANORC_#` for this instance of GATK (where you should fill in `#` appropriately). Each `PATH/TO/THEANORC_#` should be a file containing the following:. ````; [global]; base_compiledir = PATH/TO/COMPILEDIR_#; ````. Where again, `#` is filled in appropriately. The goal is to point each GermlineCNVCaller instance to a different compilation directory. @xysj1989 can you let me know if this works for you?. This is a bit of a hack. We could probably avoid this by changing the GATK code to use a specified or temporary directory for the theano directory without too much effort. However, there is an upside to using a non-temporary directory to avoid recompilation of the model upon subsequent runs. In this case, we'd just want to let the user be able to specify the theano directory (rather than dump things in `~/.theano` unexpectedly). We should think about whether this should be opt-in, i.e., should we preserve the original behavior of using `~/.theano` by default?. @mwalker174 opinions? @droazen or engine team, thoughts on what the policy should be for python/R scripts doing this sort of thing? Is it generally true that the GATK leaves no trace, other than producing the expected output?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6235#issuecomment-548430809:304,configurat,configuration,304,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6235#issuecomment-548430809,1,['configurat'],['configuration']
Deployability,"OK, relaxed the exact match to a delta of 1E-6 (chosen because doubles are formatted in somatic CNV outputs as `""%.6f""`) and tests pass on Travis (modulo an unrelated intermittent timeout failure). Note also that I was also able to reproduce locally by switching between Java 8 and 11. Had to add some quick test code for doing the comparisons; not actually sure if we have other utility methods to do so somewhere in the codebase. Another interesting note: I tried to clean up the offending use of log10factorial in AlleleFractionLikelihoods, but this introduced numerical differences at the ~1E-3 level. I think all of the round tripping between log and log10 actually adds up. Some digging revealed that this was introduced way back in gatk-protected in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/commit/aeec297e104db9f5196cb8f8e6691133302474bc#diff-34bd76cb2a416a212e25cbfb11298207265fb9cced775918aefcdb6b91ebc247. Despite the fact that we could easily replace the use of log10factorial with a private logGamma cache, at this point I think it makes more sense to freeze the current behavior. But if similar numerical changes are introduced to ModelSegments in the future, then it might make sense to clean this up at that point as well.

Let me know how to make these changes, or else happy to punt and file an issue.; - [ ] Also not sure I've parsed the results of the Jenkins tests, at least in terms of comparing how many sites get hard filtered with/out the change. Where should I be looking at to see the baseline result for that step? Also looks like a lot of results for https://gotc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/job/warp-workflow-tests/11755/ were call-cached, is that to be expected? Haven't looked at these tests before, so maybe you can walk me through them at some point. But I guess we can be sure that the overall results don't change too much (at least for 50 samples), which is a good start.; - [x] Didn't quite get to making those plots of the change in decision boundary, will do that tomorrow or later this week. EDIT: Nevermind, took like 5 minutes to throw them together (albeit using the slow python implementation and some for loops...), see below.; - [x] Hmm, looks like my own PR #6885 might've introduced a few more exact match test failures...grr. Here are some plots for N = 50, 100, and 500 samples showing (in black) those counts that previously fell under the 3E-6 threshold with the mid-p correction but now pass without it.

Deployability,"OK. Our pipelines currently all use gatk like you say. Our upstream code splits an operation (set of processing steps) into intervals and scatter/gathers across our slurm cluster. Other code then merges the output, which is usually a vcf. VariantQC (which is basically a fancy variant eval), cannot currently be split so easily, since it aggregates data across the genome. Another option I've toyed with is making a mode in which one could execute it over a set of intervals, and have each job write some intermediate output with the pre-aggregated data. I would make another step that aggregates these outputs. If there are any facilities that exist in gatk to support this type of scenario I'd appreciate pointers. .

Deployability,"One proposal for moving forward would be to have a default properties file with a known name/location that is included in the gatk jar (say, ""gatk.default.properties""), which is always loaded and populates the initial configuration, and then use the classloader getResources method to also load all resources with some other known name (say, ""gatk.properties""). That way any properties files on the classpath with the known name would be automatically discovered and loaded.

Deployability,"Oof, that's a nasty problem. We can definitely do something about it. It feels more like a Microsoft bug than a GATK one though. It seems crazy that each layer pull has to be a separate web request and there's no batch api for it? Multi layer docker builds are pretty standard from what I understand. . It sounds like your suggestions are talking about 2 slightly different issues to me. 1. Too many layers:. We typically have squashed the GATK docker images, but we recently switched to building our release images with google cloud build. Since squash is *STILL* an experimental feature in docker we've had trouble getting it to work there. Since the size reduction was pretty minimal from squashing we figured it would be ok to not prioritize it. It's definitely possible for us to consolidate various layers in the build. Or manually squash the images. We can take a look for our next release. Wide workflows on azure are something we need to support. 2. Docker size reduction:; I've spend a lot of time looking at this in the past. Our docker image is huge, but it's mostly due to the massive size of our python and R dependencies. I've done a bunch of work reducing temporary files in independent layers and using multiple stages to reduce the size. There's not much low hanging fruit left there. Similarly, moving to alpine is tricky an has limited benefit. GATK packages a number of C libraries which do not work out of the box on alpine due to the different C runtime. (At least that was the case the last time I investigated it a few years ago. ) I suspect there's a way to port things so they work on it, but it's not something we can do now. It also wouldn't be much of a help, the base image is completely dwarfed by piles of python and R dependencies which are very difficult to safely trim. Anyway, that's the state of things. We've considered a java only image for a while which would be much smaller than the current one. (although still fat by most docker standards...).

Deployability,"Per discussions with @fleharty, we are looking to significantly revamp the automated somatic CNV evaluations in preparation for benchmarking the TH prototype. The existing evaluations use a few unsupported/experimental tools and idiosyncratic/redundant classes (e.g., the `src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/copynumber/utils/annotatedinterval` class this issue concerns), the functionality of which we can hopefully move to python-based validation code. . The aforementioned code was purposefully decoupled from supported CNV code, but since then it has been incorporated into `Funcotator` tools and `ValidateBasicSomaticShortMutations`, at least. @jonn-smith @davidbenjamin can we discuss a plan for cleaning this code up? Would it be easy to use an existing TSV/XSV class to handle the functionality needed for these tools?. @jonn-smith perhaps we should also discuss the plan for future `FuncotateSegments` development/integration with @fleharty.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3884#issuecomment-526226506:937,integrat,integration,937,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3884#issuecomment-526226506,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"Posting at the suggetion of shlee. There's discussion about what parts of VariantEval will be ported to GATK4 or whether Picard's partially overlapping tool CollectVariantCallingMetrics will take this over. I want to at least make you aware that we've developed a tool we're calling VariantQC, which is built in GATK3 and runs VariantEval internally to generate data stratified in various ways to make HTML QC reports, sorta like FASTQC or MultiQC (https://github.com/bbimber/gatk-protected/releases). An example report is here: https://prime-seq.ohsu.edu/_webdav/Internal/Bimber/Public/%40files/VariantQC_Example.html. Our goal was always to port this to GATK4, polish it up, and then make it more generally available. Much of what this tool does is take the pre-built tables/reports from VariantEval and put them into HTML, but we also wrote some custom stratifications to bin data by filter, etc. Like this thread notes, VariantEval has a lot of features not in picard, and honestly we dont use many of them. However, the extensibility of Stratifier/VariantEvaluator are pretty important for us. . We realize this is prioritized against all the GATK4 features; however, 1) how set are plans about migration of VariantEval/merge w/ picard and 2) if most of VariantEval isnt going to be ported, can we pick it up in our repo? We could also potentially offer some assistance in porting the tool because we have a vested interest; however, unless the task is defined as porting VariantEval as close as possible to as-is (not that this is critical, but it's the simplest thing for the outsider to do), it would need some discussion around exactly what's planned.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/616#issuecomment-320737252:491,release,releases,491,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/616#issuecomment-320737252,1,['release'],['releases']

Deployability,"Reads` from Mutect2 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/mutect/SomaticGenotypingEngine.java#L326); - separate consideration of overlapping reads when calculating genotype likelihoods, as used in UnifiedGenotyper (https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk-protected/blob/aa8764d6c3de146856b174a8674fa787a6311d7c/protected/gatk-tools-protected/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/tools/walkers/genotyper/DiploidSNPGenotypeLikelihoods.java#L183). As I see it, #4958, which seems to be more related to read likelihood calculation, is where a more involved solution, with more fundamental changes, might be warranted. From my perspective (not being especially familiar with the pairHMM model), an ideal solution would transition the pairHMM from read likelihood to a ""fragment likelihood"" or ""haplotype likelihood"" when information from read pairs is available, even if they aren't overlapping. The idea would be that a modified pairHMM model could produce a single fragment (or haplotype) likelihood for a given read pair. Such an approach would unify the issues of ""merging"" read pairs and phasing in a read-pair aware manner (and potentially also modeling PCR errors). In principle, a ""fragment likelihood""-type approach could even incorporate info from corresponding PCR duplicates to improve the results when sequencing error rates are high. This sort of approach could also flow into the genotype likelihood calculation by providing a single, merged fragment likelihood to consider rather than a separate read likelihood for each read. UPDATE: On further thought, it probably wasn't a good idea for me to use the terms fragment likelihood or haplotype likelihood to distinguish the proposed approach, since the read likelihood is effectively already calculating those. Probably a better term would be ""read set likelihood"", where the read set would consist of paired reads and potentially also any corresponding PCR duplicate reads.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5436#issuecomment-443558420:2682,UPDATE,UPDATE,2682,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5436#issuecomment-443558420,1,['UPDATE'],['UPDATE']

Deployability,"Same here, @jhl667 - good to get additional confirmation. May I ask whether you used the same gold-standard call set or another one, and whether yours was WGS or WES? . I’m linking @droazen here as well since he acted as the release manager of the affected releases. I think it would be good to get clarity soon, since probably tens of thousands of clinical samples have been processed with the affected versions in the last two years, and a reduction in precision of 10-20% (absolute) may have been relevant for clinical decisions in at least some of these cases. Also, I know how hard it is to avoid such things in what is essentially research software (and such a great one to boot), so this is not about blaming anyone but about fixing the root cause as soon as possible. If it turns out that the issue only affects this particular reference call set and no patients (for some arcane reason), then all the better in my view.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1171653305:225,release,release,225,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1171653305,2,['release'],"['release', 'releases']"

Deployability,"Since you asked, I have a couple of thoughts:. First, I don't know if allowing the SAMRecord header to be set to null ; something that was intended to be widely used, or whether it was an ; oversight in the API or done to solve some particular corner case. If ; many SAMRecord methods appear to be broken if the header is null, then ; perhaps this isn't something that was intended for wide use. Second, it sounds like the suggestion is that headerless SAMRecords ; would now be widely used, and thus a common thing that people writing ; code against htsjdk need to anticipate.; So if you go this way you should update the SAMRecord documentation to ; clearly indicate that SAMRecords can be in either a headerless or ; non-headerless (headerful?) state; and indicate how each API function is affected by this. If certain ; methods behave differently, then people writing code against SAMRecord ; need to anticipate this; and existing code may need to be updated. In other words, headerless ; SAMRecords should become ""part of the spec"". Third, although I don't know in detail about the different execution ; environments you are trying to support, there is a general strategy that ; I haven't seen discussed in these threads.; Perhaps it's impractical, but I'll mention it anyway. It seems like ; another approach would be to create (internal to the implementation) a ; ""header tag"" that could be efficiently serialized; and passed as part of the SAMRecord when you need to distribute it. The ; header tag could be used by the receiver to reattach the SAMRecord to ; its header (either proactively or on demand), but transparently to ; application code that is running against the SAMRecord API.; This would allow SAM headers to be transmitted out-of-band in a way that ; depends on the execution environment. Depending on the environment, ; this might be done by proactive broadcast, or you could think of the ; header tag as a promise to retrieve the header if/when it is needed. ; The size and com",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141451518:612,update,update,612,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141451518,2,['update'],"['update', 'updated']"

The previous commits updating the copy code were preserved when Louis reverted, so there were basically no changes I had to make to get this ""working."" That does leave us with one question now:. When looking into this a little with James and Louis earlier, we realized that the code for setting up the ActiveRegionGenotyper uses a weird partial copy of the standard CLI args method that has existed in the code for whoever knows how long. Conceptually this seems like a bad idea, but changing it now would possibly cause some older tests to fail, if they were based on this faulty method reasoning. Should we try to merge the PR as it is now, with all tests passing, and hopefully consistency with previous behavior, or try to update the logic around this genotyper as well at the same time?

I've indeed looked at that test and more---there's a lot of similar duct tape and inconsistent resetting of the RNG throughout the entire test suite. But since I think we can reasonably assume that there's enough duct tape to make things deterministic overall, I don't think it's worth cleaning up the duct tape just to get neater, but equally deterministic behavior. (Or perhaps can you point to instances of persisting non-determinism, e.g. random failures in Travis?). In any case, I think it makes more sense to focus effort on making cleaner tests for the new tools, rather than make an 11th hour effort to revamp these existing tests. Do you agree?.

Deployability,"Summary information about this bug:. This issue affects GATK versions 4.3.0.0 through 4.5.0.0, and is fixed in GATK 4.6.0.0. The PR with the fix is: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8900. This issue also affects Picard versions 2.27.3 through 3.1.1, and is fixed in Picard 3.2.0. This bug is triggered when writing a CRAM file using one of the affected GATK/Picard versions, and both of the following conditions are met:; ; * At least one read is mapped to the very first base of a reference contig; * The file contains more than one CRAM container (10,000 reads) with reads mapped to that same reference contig. When both of these conditions are met, the resulting CRAM file may have corrupt containers associated with that contig containing reads with an incorrect sequence. . Since many common references such as hg38 have N's at the very beginning of the autosomes and X/Y, many pipelines will not be affected by this bug. However, users of a telomere-to-telomere reference, users doing mitochondrial calling, and users with reads aligned to the alt sequences will want to scan their CRAM files for possible corruption. The other mitigating circumstance is that when a CRAM is affected, the signal will be overwhelmingly obvious, with the mismatch rate typically jumping from sub-1% to 80-90% for the affected regions, making it likely to be caught by standard QC processes. A CRAM scanning tool called `CRAMIssue8768Detector` that can detect whether a particular CRAM file is affected by this bug was added in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8819, and was released as part of GATK 4.6.0.0",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8768#issuecomment-2198315437:894,pipeline,pipelines,894,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8768#issuecomment-2198315437,2,"['pipeline', 'release']","['pipelines', 'released']"

Deployability,"Thank you @ddrichel! That's really helpful and seems to support my suspicion. The most relevant changes to Mutect2 between versions 4.1.8.1 and 4.1.9.0 are #6520, #6696, and #6821, which have in common the property that they are bug fixes restoring sensitivity in edge cases. I don't think that any of these are regressions because the job of Mutect2 is to output any candidate variant. Filtering is the responsibility of FilterMutectCalls. Because our panel of normals is generated by running Mutect2, a panel of normals generated before 4.1.9.0 is blind to artifacts that occur in these edge cases. I suspect that re-generating our panels of normals using a more recent release of Mutect2 will solve the problem. I'm going to need to see how long it will take to gather the samples to re-generate our hg38 panel of normals (it might not take long at all) and triage that against the timetable for Mutect3, which does away with the panel of normals entirely.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1203356531:672,release,release,672,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1203356531,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Thank you @kshakir. What I see there is that the code sets the default NIO option, and as part of this is creates a google cloud `StorageOptions` object. Sadly for us, when this object is created it determines which Google credentials to use, and if nothing was specified by the user it will send some network messages to try to figure out whether it's running on a Google Compute Engine machine. When we wrote the default-setting code we didn't realize that setting the number of retries was going to cause a network message to be sent, with the associated potential retries and delays. We can't change the way Google Compute Engine works, or how the Google authentication works either. Ideally we'd want some way to only search for credentials when we know NIO is going to be used. The point of these defaults is that they're used for anything that uses NIO, including third-party library code. We can't fully replicate this behavior in a different way from the outside. So I think the ""correct"" fix would be to go deep inside the Google NIO library and change it so that instead of providing a default configuration (that the user would have to put together, causing the problem you've seen), we can provide a *callback* that sets the configuration when the Google Cloud NIO provider is loaded. This is harder for future developers to wrap their heads around, but at least it would prevent this delay if NIO is not used. I'd like to think about this some more before doing something quite this drastic, though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504:1105,configurat,configuration,1105,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

Split BAM into paired and unpaired read BAMs; 4. Feed these back into `PathSeqScoreSpark`. PathSeq currently removes all read tags - I have received requests in the past to fix this.

Deployability,"Thanks @droazen & @ldgauthier. I can certainly run a bunch more iterations of the same HC run on the same data. I'm not super hopeful it will turn anything up though. I can also try selecting a bunch of the different PairHMM implementations. I can't share too much, but this issue turned up in a very high throughput (1000s of samples a day) clinical pipeline. We're going back and looking for other instances where we see an excess of that `Annotation will not be calculated, genotype is not called or alleleLikelihoodMap is null` message, and re-running those samples to see if, on re-run, they generate different outputs. I realize the AVX-specific hardware issue is perhaps a little far-fetched, though given the volume of the pipeline and the fact that it runs in a cloud environment, I think it's entirely reasonable to suspect we'll run into hardware/instance issues occasionally. And there are AVX or at least SIMD specific registers, so if one of those were to see problems that could cause the PairHMM issues, without causing issues in other software that doesn't leverage the SIMD/AVX instructions. My main question really is this: is anyone familiar enough with the Intel PairHMM implementation and interface that they could weigh in on whether or not unexpected hardware errors could result in the return of empty likelihoods from the PairHMM instead of some kind of error, exception or segfault?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6889#issuecomment-709555915:351,pipeline,pipeline,351,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6889#issuecomment-709555915,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Thanks @droazen. Because you assigned it to me, I would like to know a couple of details on how this should be implemented in GATK4:. * GATK3 use to have a the `MisencodedBaseQualityReadTransformer` always on, with a switch for checking/fixing the qualities. If we follow this approach in GATK, the only change for this is to include the checking step every n reads and then #2160 will do the rest. Nevertheles, I think that it's quite dangerous to allow an user to disable it with the plugin (because the name suggest that it is only fixing the qualities), so I suggest to integrate in the read data source an iterator for checking every x reads if the qualities are misencoded, independently on the transformer.; * GATK3 throws an UserException for ""putatively misencoded"" qualities, using 60 as maximum base quality for throwing. I think that in the case of GATK4 could be more useful to use a warning if it is over 60 (I do not know what is the reasoning behind this value), and use `SAMUtils.MAX_PHRED_SCORE` for throwing. I'd be happy to implement this if there is a consensus about what to do here, so I'll wait for your ideas...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2082#issuecomment-288760814:574,integrat,integrate,574,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2082#issuecomment-288760814,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

Deployability,"Thanks @kdatta. The branch builds now, but there are a couple of problems that cause several tests to fail, including some existing tests that used to pass. You can see the results [here](https://travis-ci.org/broadinstitute/gatk/jobs/221534229). - The main issue is that GenomicsDB fails to load. This causes the importer tests to fail, as well as the existing GenomicsDB integration tests. (Note that the importer tests fail with a null pointer exception, but that problem is secondary and only happens when the db fails to load, which is the root problem.) We can fix the NPE in code review, for now the main issue is fix the core problem of why genomics db fails to load. - The changes in OptionalVariantInputArgumentCollection and RequiredVariantInputArgumentCollection are causing argument name collisions in other tools, which is why ExampleIntervalWalkerIntegrationTest tests are failing in this branch. The simplest fix in the short term is to just revert the changes you made to those two classes, and remove the new VariantInputArgumentCollection class.

Deployability,"Thanks @lbergelson! I agree that it might be good to break into more layers—could be worth talking to SV team and seeing what lessons they learned in putting together their hierarchy of images. Also, note that I pushed the install of miniconda into the base, but I did not push down the setup of the GATK conda environment itself (which takes the bulk of the time during the main-image build, as it requires lots of downloading). I think I commented elsewhere that a good strategy might be to set up the conda environment with the non-GATK python dependencies in the base, and then update the environment via a pip install of the GATK python packages in the main image. This would let us make python code changes without having to rebuild the base, but might require a bit of scripting to create a final yml for non-Docker users.

Once I changed and used my personal account via `gcloud auth application-default login` GATK4 no longer gave that error.

So I went back to using the original file which has `foo.vcf.gz` as well as `foo.vcf.gz.tbi`. GATK SelectVariants ran successfully. Finally, I spun up a GCE-vm which is running with the service account I want, installed Java and GATK4 and was able to run the command successfully.

Deployability,"Thanks for the review and running those tests, @ldgauthier! Will restore the aforementioned GnarlyGenotyperIntegrationTests and update a few other exact matches in the rebase this afternoon. You also asked above if there was a theoretical reason to change the threshold. Since it seems the original was relatively arbitrary (at least from what I've been told, happy to be corrected), I think we can leave it. The new annotation is strictly larger, so we will then be slightly more conservative about keeping sites if we leave the threshold fixed. You can think of this as a slight change in the decision boundary in genotype-count space---perhaps I can add some plots to this thread this afternoon to demonstrate. In practice, what we care about is whether: 1) many sites flicker across the change in boundary after hard filtering, and/or 2) these sites result in discrepancies post-VQSR. I think the tests you ran suggest that we don't need to worry much about the second issue, and I can take a closer look later to check about the first (which will depend simply on the number of samples and the allele frequency spectrum).

Deployability,"Thanks for the thoughts. Singularity is definitely awesome and I'm hoping to support it as an alternative choice to Docker for local HPC clusters where we won't require equivalent root permissions to run. So it helps avoid some of the potential external permission errors by creating a potentially cleaner path to running. Unfortunately it doesn't deal with the underlying issue of needing to map users inside of the containers so that Spark is happy with them. Having something more lightweight than needing user updates in the internal `/etc/passwd` would also help with potential issues on other container enginer (Singularity, rkt).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4626#issuecomment-381642529:514,update,updates,514,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4626#issuecomment-381642529,1,['update'],['updates']

(Recall that the old pipeline required the sample name to be passed in as a separate input to each tool and that no validation that each input came from the same sample was performed.).

Nevertheless, this is just a convenience that I asked for here, but I can try to solve the issues with the `BaseTest` instead.

So to recap: I removed the installation of this unnecessary package, but failed to remove an unnecessary import statement since it was in an untested code path, which was then caught when users tried to run the tool. Investigation of this issue then revealed that `ggplot2` was not installed correctly in the current base image, due to a completely unrelated dependency issue.; - Good call on clearing the Travis cache.

Deployability,"Thanks, @gokalpcelik! That's unfortunate that the packages are no longer accessible. However, this old version of the environment was also somewhat problematic in that it included build strings, installed many packages using pip instead of conda, and was otherwise overly restrictive, see e.g. https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360061666671-Broken-conda-env-create-n-gatk-f-gatkcondaenv-yml. I would suggest, in the following order:. 1) Users upgrade to more recent versions of GATK; 2) Users use the 4.1.0.0 Docker; 3) Users edit the 4.1.0.0 environment to be less restrictive. For example, using Ubuntu 20.04.2 + conda 23.10.0, I was able to build something that is probably sufficiently close to the 4.1.0.0 conda environment by making the following changes:. ``` <- certifi=2016.2.28=py36_0; < - openssl=1.0.2l=0; < - pip=9.0.1=py36_1; < - python=3.6.2=0; < - readline=6.2=2; < - setuptools=36.4.0=py36_1; < - sqlite=3.13.0=0; < - tk=8.5.18=0; < - wheel=0.29.0=py36_0; < - xz=5.2.3=0; < - zlib=1.2.11=0; ---; > - openssl=1.0.2l; > - pip=9.0.1; > - python=3.6.2; > - setuptools=36.5.0; > - wheel=0.29.0; > - xz=5.2.3; > - zlib=1.2.11 ; ```. There is some clobbering that happens with the pip installs, but nothing major.

Deployability,"Thanks. This shows that bcast can go faster when given more RAM: going from; the earlier experimental envelope of 192GB of RAM to 256GB instead, the; bcast version can go from 19 min to 10min (sharded takes 7min with the; small amount of memory). This is consistent with my earlier experiments; that also showed that increasing the RAM-per-core sped up the bcast; computation. I wouldn't worry about having found a configuration where sharded performs; poorly. My experiments so far have shown that there are lots of; configuration points where one or the other performs poorly; the onus is on; finding the good configuration values that result in better performance, or; identifying which algorithms may be performant for a larger range of; parameter choices. To maximize understanding I would suggest that we not change too many; parameters at a time. For example it seems unnecessary to have multiple; variants of the 128Mbp input. I found there can be significant (>50%) variation between identical runs.; One way to reduce this is to set spark.task.maxFailures=1 which I strongly; recommend for all experiments going forward. One concern I have is that our cluster memory is already far larger than; the input size. In fact here each machine can fit the whole input; comfortably in RAM. This is not going to be the case for the full input.; Since it would take too long to iterate using the full input, it seems wise; instead to reduce both the input size and to keep a close eye on the amount; of memory we're using to make sure we're not going down a path that would; not be able to cope with the full input.

Deployability,"That is a separate matter altogether from both 1) unifying the allele-count collection tools, and 2) standardizing the format of tabular data. The most appropriate place for integration of Mutect2 SNV calls would be as input to the tumor-heterogeneity tool (along with the ModelSegments output) further downstream. This is because it is unlikely that including the SNVs as input to ModelSegments would significantly improve either segmentation or modeling there. If the allele-count collection tools are unified, I think that the only redundant work done across both pipelines would be the calling of hets from the pileups, which is extremely cheap. However, we should certainly also unify the code to do this (which I've spoken to @davidbenjamin about as well).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-386734926:174,integrat,integration,174,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-386734926,2,"['integrat', 'pipeline']","['integration', 'pipelines']"

Deployability,"The advantage of using SLF4J is that it is a general facade, so it makes simpler to change for one logging system to other if the bound is implemented. For the most common logging systems (log4j, jul, JLC, etc.), there are this implementation and even no-op logging. One of the nice things from slf4j is that it allows to use the logging format set by the software to every library dependency, controlling the verbosity of other libraries too. . After having a look to the gradle dependencies, it seems that ADAM and Spark use slf4j. This will allow better integration with the two libraries: now the `slf4-jdk` is completely removed, and I don't know if this will blow up at some point if some of the ADAM/Spark classes try to load them. In addition, it will make GATK4 more general. Regarding features, I'm not using more that what log4j is providing, but I'm quite familiar with logback and I have a bias to use it if possible, but the GATK framework as it is implemented now ""force"" to use log4j. But anyway, I'm happy also with using log4j and I was only suggesting this for make GATK4 more general (and to come back in my work to logback, but that is just personal taste). @lbergelson, feel free to close the issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2176#issuecomment-259211054:557,integrat,integration,557,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2176#issuecomment-259211054,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"The new pipeline is in a complete state. Nearly all tools and scripts were rewritten, many from scratch. I've tried to minimize interaction with old `tools/exome` code (notably, `ReadCountCollection` and `SegmentUtils`). There are still some improvements that can be made (especially in segment union and the subsequent modeling), but we should be ready to go for a first validation. Some notes:. WDL:; - I've moved the old pipeline to `somatic_old` folders.; - There is now just a matched-pair workflow and a panel workflow. We can add a single BAM case workflow or expand the matched-pair workflow to handle this, depending on the discussion at https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3657.; - WES/WGS is toggled by providing an optional target-file input.; - For all workflows, we always collect integer read counts; for WGS, these are output as both HDF5 and TSV and the HDF5 is used for subsequent input.; - For the case workflow, we always collect allelic counts at all sites and output as TSV.; - [x] We should output all data files as HDF5 by default and as TSV optionally. EDIT: This is done for `CollectFragmentCounts`.; - [x] We will need to update the workflows when @MartonKN and @asmirnov239 get `PreprocessIntervals` and `CollectReadCounts` merged, respectively. These tools will remove the awkwardness required by `PadTargets` and `CalculateTargetCoverage`/`SparkGenomeReadCounts`. Denoising:; - All parameters are exposed in the PoN creation tool (#3356).; - Without a PoN, standardization and optional GC correction are performed (#3570).; - Other than the minor point about sample mean/median being used inconsistently noted above, the denoising process is essentially exactly the same mathematically as before (""superficial"" differences include the vastly improved memory and I/O optimizations, the ability to adjust number of principal components used, the removal of redundant SVDs, the enforcement of consistent GC-bias correction).; - [ ] That said, I'll carry over this ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-333202828:8,pipeline,pipeline,8,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-333202828,3,"['pipeline', 'toggle']","['pipeline', 'toggled']"

Is there any reason we can't/shouldn't just pip install them on the generated docker right from source, or from a locally built archive ?

With separate repos, a change in the AVX repo wouldn't affect the PPC repo until the maintainer of the PPC repo updated it (after doing appropriate testing of their own), since the PPC repo would depend on a tagged version of the AVX repo. There could also still be some level of code sharing between the two implementations, since the PPC repo would pull in the AVX repo as a dependency.

Deployability,"These are count files containing counts simulated according to the gCNV model, and are used as the primary inputs to generate the rest of the test files downstream. The dictionary is fictional and immaterial, so long as it is carried forward consistently from the count files to downstream outputs (which the tools do automatically). You could pretend that we started with simulated BAMs that were all aligned w.r.t. this fictional reference/dictionary. (It's just more work to simulate at the BAM level, which is why we start with the counts; simulating BAMs would also not increase test coverage in any meaningful way.). There are already a number of checks to guarantee dictionary consistency, but as you can see from that issue, there are a few scenarios where dictionaries from intervals might not be available via the engine. I don't think there should be a need to provide or check against external references/dictionaries at downstream steps; see point 4 in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6924#issuecomment-719576249 about reverting the code change to allow external dictionaries in PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls.

Job needs to save the last line of output from `./gradlew install printVersion` in a `gatkPublicVersion` variable -- this is the version of the snapshot of public that was installed to maven local.; 4. Job checks out latest GATK protected/master and executes the command to build it and run the full test suite, but as part of that command it overrides the GATK public version to point to the snapshot version installed locally and saved in the `gatkPublicVersion` variable above.

Deployability,"Think it might be worth saving a VariantFiltration pass for the bit of code it'd take, but up to you!. ScoreVariantAnnotations will output both the raw ""VQSLOD"" score and the converted sensitivity, so we're free to specify thresholds on either. However, given that different types of models may have scores in different ranges (e.g., BGMM vs. IsolationForest, positive/negative vs. positive-only, etc.), I think it's better to restrict all command-line options to be expressed in terms of a sensitivity. Same thing goes if you decide to filter externally with VariantFiltration for now. Even though you have both quantities available to you, just use the sensitivity. This brings us to questions related to whether we want to keep the old VQSR requirements of having both training and truth sets specified. For example, we could instead drop the distinction between training and truth for the new tools, and always calibrate sensitivity to the training set (you can essentially force this behavior with the current code by specifying training=true,truth=true for all of your resources). And yes, all of the tools should have a variety of command lines in the tests to demonstrate behavior. If you want to explore positive/negative mode, take a look at the *Unlabeled tests.

Deployability,"This is an update of where I am at with this issue. It turns out that using --forceActive and --dontTrimActiveRegions only worked for picking up some of the het SNP calls with HaplotypeCaller. A fun side effect was that some calls that were made with the 'vanilla' best practices HC options were now being missed with the forceActive/dontTrim options. So our clinical team decided to use samtools/bcftools for a pileup approach in combination with HC. We call variants with samtools/bcftools then filter the 'samtools' vcf for VAF > 0.15 and pass that vcf to HC with the -L flag to force HC to make these calls. This is working, all of the calls we are trying to pick up are now being found with our combined method. We also run the vanilla best practices HC on our data and merge the vanilla and samtools vcfs after they go through HC for downstream hard filtering and annotation. Part of this hybrid vanilla/samtools method is for continuity, we're been running 'vanilla' HC for awhile now and didn't want to completely drop it for our new samtools/HC calling approach, so we are combining both to be extra conservative. We decided to keep HC around for 2 reasons, 1) it's not going to give us as many false positives as a 'pileup' method and 2) our downstream annotation software has been set up for dealing with HC vcf files and switching to another vcf INFO format would be painful. But it certainly has causes some alarm about the 'unknown unknowns' that we could be missing in a clinical context. All of these troublesome variants checked out with Sanger sequencing, so this is definitely a real issue and the problem is occurring in clinically-relevant genes, such as F5. I'm happy to provide additional info to help the GATK development team figure out why these variants are missed with HC in the 'vanilla' best practices mode.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3697#issuecomment-431985127:11,update,update,11,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3697#issuecomment-431985127,1,['update'],['update']

(Also, note that those tools take a sequence dictionary as an input to specify which contigs should be plotted; typically, this will be a subset of the full dictionary that excludes alt contigs, etc. Requiring this sequence-dictionary input is somewhat vestigial; previous versions of the pipeline did not include dictionaries in the headers of all CNV data files.

Right now, we essentially do a single iteration to determine negative data. This could perhaps be preceded by a round of refactoring to clean up model training and make it less procedural.; - [ ] Automatic threshold tuning could be built into the tool, see #7711.

He added ""--new-qual"" to his GenotypeGVCFs command and that solved the issue. It did for me as well! Using the same combined GVCF file as I was before, genotyping finished in less than half a minute after adding the new-qual parameter. Thought it would be useful to know that:. 1, this issue appears to affect non-diploids more than diploids. 2, using --new-qual solved the issue, at least for me.

Deployability,"Update on the gene list format discussion: We recently in added GFF3 support in HTSJDK and one possible path forwards for supporting more general gene list formate for DoC would be to leverage the existing implementation that was included in #6602 to allow a second source of gene objects. This could be trivially implemented if we wanted to follow the same approach as #6602 where we simply farm the decision about what feature type is important out to the user to specify. This would mean that if the user cares about genes they could specify a count for each gene object with its reported boundaries that would be output as a line. This is similar but not analogous to the current behavior for the existing gene lists where we take pains to exclude from the overlap counts bases that are intronic bases in the gene list. . Unfortunately, since the GFF3 format is hierarchical and supports a very large number of feature types it will be very difficult to extract the intron/exon boundaries without properly parsing the GFF3 format. The GFF3 format supports .obo files that lay out the feature hierarchy and through parsing of that format it would be possible to extract intron/exon boundaries but that is not currently supported by HTSJDK and would involve us merging https://github.com/kachulis/htsjdk/tree/ck_gff3_feature_evaluator first in order to support and then on top of that coming up with some rules for deciding what units exactly make up a gene that should be merged for coverage counting. . I see a few options going forwards:; - We could support GFF3 gene lists with hard coded genes/CDS features to be included. This is brittle given that there are a number of more specific names for CDS (coding sequence) exons in genes that might end up being excluded.; - We could support GFF3 format but ignore exon sequences which would mean that the behavior for counting the same genes will vary depending on which format the gene is provided.; - We could support GFF3 gene lists but allow th",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6491#issuecomment-683963413:0,Update,Update,0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6491#issuecomment-683963413,1,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"Update: I made a list of particularly bad intervals for the DREAM4 and 20-plex Hapmap bams by scattering 500 ways, choosing the 20 slowest jobs (weighting by an empirical 3x slowness factor for jobs on nodes that couldn't use AVX PairHMM acceleration), scattering again etc to obtain 100 or so intervals of roughly 200 bp that took long. Then I confirmed that the slowness had nothing to do with SGE or cromwell (it shouldn't, because I was getting runtime from the GATK output log, not the cromwell log, but just in case. . .) by re-running each interval on gsa5. In *every* case, the slow intervals had extremely deep coverage (2,000 - 30,000) due to mapping error. Even after filtering to MQ == 60, the high coverage usually remained, although it often decreased significantly. In addition to the extreme depth, the only other sign was a significant proportion of reads with multiple SNVs relative to the reference. Unfortunately, something cheap to compute, like CIGAR complexity, was often not a sign, because many CIGARs were eg 101M, with many of the M's coming from SNVs. One quick solution would be to completely skip calling on regions with extremely high depth. It's hard to imagine being able to trust any calls from them. Another option is MQ-based downsampling, for example downsampling to the 1000 reads with the best MQ. Some people might like the downsampling option for the secure feeling of not losing sensitivity, although realistically those regions are so terrible that this security is an illusion. The only real protection is a more complete reference.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2975#issuecomment-309565338:0,Update,Update,0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2975#issuecomment-309565338,1,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"Update: after some offline discussion, we found that this was a two-fold issue that has since been fixed.; 1. END was set to END2 in some older VCFs from GATK-SV, so it represented the breakpoint on the second chromosome rather than the first. This has been fixed - multiple more recent GATK-SV VCFs were found to have the correct values for END for CTX events; 2. Older versions of SVAnnotate annotated the interval CHROM:POS-END for CTX, expecting END to be very close to POS. This produced incorrect intervals when END was set to END2, which could be very large, resulting in long lists of genes under PREDICTED_LOF. This has been fixed in #8693 so SVAnnotate now independently annotates breakpoints at CHROM:POS and CHROM:END for CTX. For other users encountering this issue in their VCFs produced by older versions of GATK-SV, I recommend rerunning CleanVcf and AnnotateVcf with the latest versions of GATK-SV. A more manual alternative that requires less re-running of workflows would be: ; 1. Extract CTX SVs; 2. Set END to POS; 4. Strip out functional consequence annotations; 5.

Deployability,"We built a debug build of `google-cloud-java` and hooked it up to GATK, and I think we've identified the problem. The retry settings were not being correctly propagated to `google-cloud-java` for this particular tool (`GenomicsDBImport`), and so it was running with the default settings of `maxChannelReopens == 0 and maxRetries == 3`. This also explains why we resolved the issue with 503's (which are handled by the retries), but not the SSL errors (which are handled by the reopens). We are currently working on a patch to fix this. We could guard ourselves against this sort of issue in the future by implementing https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3120 (the ability to set retry settings globally for the `google-cloud-java` library, rather than per-Path).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2685#issuecomment-309098253:517,patch,patch,517,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2685#issuecomment-309098253,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"We can split the tests up into a bunch of build units, but we get rapidly diminishing returns since we spend minutes installing things and building the artifacts for every vm. Travis doesn't have any notion of a build pipeline, so we can't say ""build the artifact on 1 vm and then share it and run the tests on these 10 vms"". Since we have a hard limit of the number of VMs we can use at a time for DSDE ( currently 15) being less efficient is very bad news. ( We could of course pay for more... I recently asked travis support if we could switch to an unlimited pay for usage model and they said no. ) We could also try optimizing wasted vm time by prebuilding dockers to run in, but that's additional complication. (maybe not to much, might be worth it). We also would need a scheme for dividing tests evenly between VM's. I tried writing a testng test listener to distribute them between N nodes based on the hashcode of the test class, for use on circleci, but it fell over and exploded for some reason that I never debugged. We could either debug it, or possibly split the tests by splitting the list of test files and then passing those in specifically. (May run into character limits for command lines... ). Balancing it is going to be tricky though in any case since the tests are very unevenly expensive. (We could probably manually balance it since there are a small number of slow tests and the rest are so fast they don't really matter) . The easiest thing would be to set the test to run in parallel on their existing vm. I can try turning it on again. I remember it caused problems before though, which I assume we haven't addressed. Each vm has 2 cores, so we might see some speedup. I suspect we may be using both cores to some degree already, since performance nearly doubled when we switched from the 1 core to 2 core build machines. We could probably build a more efficient pipeline on jenkins if we wanted since it does have a notion of pipelines.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1769#issuecomment-214492346:117,install,installing,117,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1769#issuecomment-214492346,4,"['install', 'pipeline']","['installing', 'pipeline', 'pipelines']"

Deployability,"We recommend backing up data just because it is the ""cleanest"" way to roll back. If backing up data is really such a pain point, you could skip doing that. Just back up the callset.json file, and don't turn on `--consolidate` when you're doing incremental import. If a failure happens, just roll back the callset.json and re-do the import. The downside is that the failed import will hang around and take up disk space, but hopefully it is a rare enough occurrence that it doesn't matter - and you will have saved yourself backing up the data. In response to 2) - I guess you're implying that the overhead of cluster/job scheduling won't amortize any benefits from parallelism there? I suppose that could be true, but doesn't seem to be worth optimizing towards that. What I'm asking is whether split and merge are purely an instrument to allow you to choose the granularity of parallelism you want to use? Or is there something else? As I said before, we are considering enabling other ways to do distributed import which would work for the former. It might go something like:; - Create a workspace/initialize configuration+intervals to be imported; - Actually do the import by kicking off (multiple) import(s). User can pick the number of intervals each import is responsible for. User must ensure that no interval gets specified in multiple import processes. P.S: regarding 1000s of small contigs - the current GenomicsDBImport doesn't so so well with large number of contigs (unless you do concatenate the contigs into fewer groups).

Deployability,"Well, you're welcome to use gatk-launch as a launch script if you'd like (and feel free to rename to whatever you like...) A. There are a few reasons we have spark and non-spark versions of the tools. . 1. We wanted to port and validate certain tools as quickly as possible and doing a direct port from gatk3 -> gatk4 was easier than making them sparkified at the same time. 2. There's a tradeoff in using spark where you end up spending more total cpu hours in order to finish a job faster. Ideally this would be 1:1, double the number of cores and you halve the time to finish a job. It never scales perfectly though, there's always some overhead for being parallel. Our production pipelines are extremely sensitive to cost and not very sensitive to runtime, so they prefer we have a version that's optimized to use the least cpu hours even if that means a longer runtime. Other users prefer to be able to finish a job quickly and are willing to pay slightly more to do so, so we also have a spark version. . 3. Some tool are complicated to make work well spark. Spark works best when you can divide the input data into independent shards and then process them separately. This is complicated for things like the AssemblyRegion walker where you need context around each location of interest. We had to do things like add extra overlapping padding and things like that to avoid boundary issues where there are shard divisions. We don't yet fully understand spark performance and it's caveats, we're looking into that actively now. We hope that we'll be able to optimize our tools so that a spark pipeline of several tools in series is faster than running the individual non-spark versions, since it lets us avoid doing things like loading the bam file multiple times from disk. Whether or not we can achieve this is still and open question though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2345#issuecomment-273318100:684,pipeline,pipelines,684,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2345#issuecomment-273318100,2,['pipeline'],"['pipeline', 'pipelines']"
Deployability,"What @droazen says is correct. The `--numReducers` argument is not used when there is no shuffle. So `writeReadsSharded` should ignore it since it doesn't perform a shuffle (the output is already sharded either from the input partitioning, or from a shuffle in an earlier part of the the pipeline). Slightly counterintutively, `writeReadsSingle` does take the `--numReducers` argument since it does a shuffle to sort the reads in parallel, before stitching the files together.

Deployability,What is the source of the GTF file you are using? It look like the issue you are seeing has to do with the parsing of your new GTF file. The GTF codec in GATK4 is bespoke and designed to handle GencodeGTF files specifically and expects some specific fields to be present in all records which looks to be what is causing problems for you right here (this will be subject to change in the next release to some extent). It expects that gene feature object comes first in the order of family gene elements and it also requires that all of the gene transcript/exome families are and appear together as a group. . Its hard to say without seeing your GTF file but if it is coordinate sorted this could happen or it could also happen if its is mis-formatted and elements are not hierarchically organized into gene -> transcripts -> exons-> features.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8394#issuecomment-1613357793:392,release,release,392,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8394#issuecomment-1613357793,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Wow, thanks for the detailed comments so far, @davidbenjamin! But perhaps let's quickly chat before you go any further?. There are a lot of things you commented on---temporary integration tests using local files, lots of code/arguments/etc. intentionally copied verbatim over from VQSR/tranches, and entire tools (the ""monolithic"" GMMVariantTrain and ScikitLearnVariantTrain)---that are rather in flux or will be scrapped/cleaned up shortly. That said, the comments on the code inherited from VQSR will certainly be useful in this process!. But it might save you some time if we could chat so I can give you a rough orientation and perhaps point out where the vestigial VQSR code remains. I think focusing discussion on the high level design of the tools that are likely to stay would also be most useful at this stage. Feel free to throw something on my calendar!. In the end, I think we will probably just retain the BGMM backend + the versions of the tools in the ""scalable"" package. I left the ""monolithic"" GMMVariantTrain and ScikitLearnVariantTrain tools in this branch so I could do one round of tieout. That tieout came out OK, so I think we'll abandon the monolithic tools, along with all the associated code outside of the scalable package.

Deployability,"Yeah - this makes 2 assumptions: the data are evenly distributed and that progress is constant. This isn't the most accurate way to do this, but something is better than nothing. . There is another implementation that I considered - base the remaining time on the time it has taken for the last `N` updates. This would account for bursty processing times, but would also result in wildly fluctuating estimates (because it would still assume a uniform distribution of data). We cam also do something like this with a sliding window average to smooth it out. If you prefer another implementation I can change it, but again - something is better than nothing. . I don't want to have to scan the input data to make the progress bar work - that seems way too heavy-handed and would slow everything down. The tradeoff doesn't seem worth it. .

Deployability,"Yeah, the goofy name is just a placeholder, as is the separate tool itself. Unless there are any objections (@fleharty @mwalker174?) or I run into any unforeseen snafus or parameter ambiguities along the way, I am going to roll the multisample-segmentation functionality into ModelSegments. We can toggle this functionality by passing multiple `--denoised-copy-ratios` and `--allelic-counts` arguments, e.g.:. ```; gatk ModelSegments ; --normal-allelic-counts normal.allelicCounts.tsv (this is only used for het genotyping); --denoised-copy-ratios normal.denoisedCR.tsv; --denoised-copy-ratios tumor-1.denoisedCR.tsv; ...; --denoised-copy-ratios tumor-N.denoisedCR.tsv; --allelic-counts normal.allelicCounts.tsv; --allelic-counts tumor-1.allelicCounts.tsv; ...; --allelic-counts tumor-N.allelicCounts.tsv \; -O .; --output-prefix joint-segmentation; ```. This will perform both het genotyping and joint segmentation, but will yield a Picard interval-list `joint-segmentation.interval_list` as its sole output. (Although we could proceed to perform MCMC model inference on each sample in series, we'll stop at segmentation to enforce the scattering of inference across samples, which will be quicker.) We can also allow for copy-ratio-only and allelic-count-only modes. Users can use this joint segmentation in their own downstream tools, but we can also allow ModelSegments to ingest it via in a new `--segments` argument:. ```; gatk ModelSegments; --normal-allelic-counts normal.allelicCounts.tsv (equivalently, we could omit this and adjust minimum-total-allele-count-case, as is done in the WDL); --allelic-counts normal.allelicCounts.tsv; --denoised-copy-ratios normal.denoisedCR.tsv; --segments joint-segmentation.interval_list; -O .; --output-prefix normal. gatk ModelSegments; --normal-allelic-counts normal.allelicCounts.tsv; --allelic-counts tumor-1.allelicCounts.tsv; --denoised-copy-ratios tumor-1.denoisedCR.tsv; --segments joint-segmentation.interval_list; -O .; --output-prefix tumor-1.

Deployability,"Yep, right now that's what would happen. The previous behavior was that GenomicsDB would return likelihoods for up to 50 alts and then no likelihoods for more than 50 and GenotypeGVCFs I think would subset 7-49 ALTs down to 6 and drop sites with more than 50 ALTs, which is sort of the computational efficiency compromise. I personally don't trust a diploid site with 50 ALTs. I believe the old CombineGVCFs behavior capped the number of likelihoods, so ploidy 1 could have more than 50 ALTs, but higher ploidies would have fewer. So the current plan is to separate the max alts for GGVCFs and GenomicsDB so that the GenomicsDB max alts to combine can be greater and thus convey enough information for GGVCFs to subset down to its max alts, if desired. But if you want to be conservative with memory, you could set them to be equal and low. Should we filter sites with too many alts, which is the recommendation for the GnarlyGenotyper pipeline, rather than drop them, like GGVCFs used to do?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7639#issuecomment-1023521998:936,pipeline,pipeline,936,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7639#issuecomment-1023521998,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Yes, @magicDGS I have answered a continuous stream of questions on indel realignment in the forum and these questions are ongoing. Here's one I answered just last week: http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/comment/39359#Comment_39359. So it appears that it is a step that folks continue to use. . I would add that indel realignment is especially important for Mutect1 pipelines, which continues as the standard in somatic calling, pending performance of Mutect2. Even if Mutect2 were to outperform Mutect1 calling, because of the extreme difference in compute between the two, I conjecture folks will continue to use Mutect1. In fact, the only sane way to output a BAM for the entirety of a somatic sample set is via indel realignment. Somatic folks are keen on manual review and indel realignment is the cheapest way to get there. Here's another scenerio for which indel realignment is useful: the case of a low coverage site where multiple haplotypes are present. These cannot be resolved by HaplotypeCaller if the difference in allele depth between reads supporting either haplotype does not pass some threshold. In this case, sites receive `./.` no calls. Indel realignment using a known sites resource can aid in the resolution of haplotypes at sites that correspond to common population variants. One could argue that the cohort-level analysis could aid in resolution of these, but it may be that large cohorts are a luxury that cannot be afforded by many research groups. ### I vote yes please to porting the indel realignment pipeline.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3084#issuecomment-307895094:33,continuous,continuous,33,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3084#issuecomment-307895094,3,"['continuous', 'pipeline']","['continuous', 'pipeline', 'pipelines']"

It looks like there are a couple of things needed in GCS-NIO to use the NIO API for this.; 1. https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/issues/1450 so that we don't have to special-case `gs` URIs to remove everything except the scheme and host when looking up the filesystem (see https://github.com/HadoopGenomics/Hadoop-BAM/blob/master/src/main/java/org/seqdoop/hadoop_bam/util/NIOFileUtil.java#L40); 2. https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/issues/813 to support path matching (https://github.com/HadoopGenomics/Hadoop-BAM/blob/master/src/main/java/org/seqdoop/hadoop_bam/util/NIOFileUtil.java#L90).

Deployability,"Your interpretation sounds right, although I wish the language in the SAM spec were clearer - something like ""if 0x1 is unset, fields 0x2, 0x8, 0x20, 0x40, and 0x80 have no meaning and are ignored by the tools"". SAMRecord.IsValid() returns errors not only for 0x8(mate unmapped)/unpaired read, but also for the other four fields, so all of these errors would need to be removed. IsValid() also triggers an error when an unpaired read has RNEXT set, but the spec. ; doesn't appear to exclude this error. No error is triggered for the unpaired/PNEXT case. . So I agree that it looks like IsValid() should be changed to align with the spec. But I can also imagine potential pitfalls of leaving the GenomicsConverter code the way it is. The code adds spurious information to the bam that might cause problems with legacy versions of the tools. I don't know what the plans are for the state of the existing tool distribution once gatk4 is released. Is it possible that bam files produced in the cloud could make their way into gatk3 workflows, maybe via the sharing of bams between groups? If this happens, then unpaired reads processed in the cloud, with their mate unpaired flags set by the converter, could trigger validation errors when they are fed to the legacy tools. Is there a downside to altering the converter code as well as modifying the ; validator (I don't know what altering google packages entails...)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/569#issuecomment-114510392:934,release,released,934,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/569#issuecomment-114510392,1,['release'],['released']
Deployability,"Yup, as you might recall from some discussions with @bhanugandham and @mwalker174, getting automated pipeline-level CNV evaluations up and running was highest on my list before I handed over the role and went on paternity leave. I think these tests would be more useful than unit/integration tests for correctness, but they would almost certainly have to run on CARROT. That said, the current level of unit/integration test coverage is a bit different from that for the somatic tools, because 1) it's difficult to run gCNV in any useful way on Travis infrastructure, and 2) we hadn't decided on a framework/convention for python unit tests at the time the production code went in (although I think @ldgauthier has added some python unit tests by now). So we currently only have plumbing WDL/integration tests on very small data for gCNV---and these only test that the tools run, not for correctness. For somatic CNV, we have unit tests for correctness on small simulated data (e.g., for things like segmentation and modeling classes), but integration tests don't cover correctness (and it would be pretty redundant to use the same simulated data for integration, so I'd rather put effort towards pipeline-level tests on real data).

I wanted to run the validations here because it is the largest dataset and it is the AoU data (not just Anvil data) BUT it has no values for gvs_all_ac or gvs_all_an yet because that step wasn't implemented by the time of creation. (Validation #9 was added by Lee recently) The table vat_jul18 does have those values as it was created just last week, but may get cleaned up...so this might be a good best practices question for what we run this on in the future if there is ever an automated version?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7365#issuecomment-886085289:122,release,release,122,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7365#issuecomment-886085289,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"and likely to require some iteration so I'd be ok with starting with just the minimal ""porting"" changes to keep things simple, and then doing a code hygiene pass at the end. The ""porting"" changes should include things like updated javadoc, GATK4-style command line arguments, updating of outdated GATK3 terminology such as ""ROD"", Utils.nonNull assertions, etc. The finals and curly braces can wait for a separate pass (we will want to do those in this PR though). If you're not sure what to include or not just ask. I like the idea of keeping the GATK3 tests working as we go along. We should make a clear distinction between the old and new tests though. Ideally the GATK3 tests would be in a separate commit that we can just delete at the end, but that can get unwieldy if the files in the commit need to change as we go along. Alternatively you could isolate them into a separate directory. They should either be disabled or made dependent on a test method (see the `@Test` annotation properties `enabled` and `dependsOn`) that is easily toggled so they can be run locally, but don't run on the CI server. Otherwise the CI server build will always fail. In general, its really helpful to have the first commit in the PR contain the completely unmodified GATK3 source files. It makes it much easier for the reviewer to see what changed for the port. I noticed that you have 2 new plugins included in this. I'm not sure if that was suggested by someone on the GATK team (I'm wondering if we want to go down that path...) but I can tell you that the existing plugins required an enormous amount of test development and review iteration. If we do decide to make them plugins, I think it would be a good idea to do so in a separate PR. Also, if we choose to make an AbstractPlugin base class, we may want that to live in the Barclay repo.

Deployability,"aps pushing a fresh branch to this repo might make it a little easier for us to check it out for review---again, not a big deal, so I'll leave it up to you. 2) We try to adhere to the Google style guide https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html, so the review may yield a lot of seemingly minor and nitpicky change requests. Don't take these personally---the goal is just to make the code base as uniform and easy to maintain as possible! If you prefer, I'm sure we can find a GATK developer to take a quick once over of your branch and make these minor changes. 3) Since the new tool borrows so heavily from CollectAllelicCounts, I think it might be worth consolidating shared code and reducing code duplication---again, with the goal of making future maintenance more straightforward. I'll try to identify some places this can be done during my review. Again, we can make these changes on our end during the once over, or you can address them after the review (or we could also do this on our end in a separate PR after this one goes in). 4) In the near future, I think we should finally make the effort to replace both GetPileupSummaries and CollectAllelicCounts with this new tool. As mentioned in our email thread, @davidbenjamin and I discussed this long ago, e.g. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-386734926. From a methods perspective, we'd simply need expand the current functionality of your tool to also report the reference allele and do some quick sanity checks to make sure that the differences in count definition and read filtering don't have any undesired downstream effects. However, as we also discussed, this will come with some additional overhead---we'll need to update documentation, workshop slides, tutorials, WDLs, and make sure that any changes in output formats are clearly highlighted in the release notes. I'll leave this effort to @davidbenjamin and @mwalker174. Thanks again for doing this.

Hyperparameters changed were contained mostly only to `psi_t` parameter.; - We developed a clustering procedure that is based on coverage profile at the set of targets that are highly variable across different capture kits. ; - We found that filtering on a QS metric on a final callset significantly boosted the specificity while lowering sensitivity insignificantly.; - We developed a hyperparameter optimization framework prototype that could be used in a future for general optimizations of cost/performance parameters for all GATK pipelines.; - We resolved several memory issues that came up during validations. **A few issues were encountered along the way:**; - The sensitivity and specificity on multiallellic (common) sites was significantly lower than on rare events.; - Single target calling sensitivity was lower than 20%.; - Pipeline WDL required optimization in order to handle whole genome data, however these changes were not consolidated in the official WDL. **Currently the ongoing work is focused on the following:**; - Improving sensitivity/specificity of calls on common regions. One solution being tested involves setting a prior for common regions derived from a high quality callset. Second solution is to set a different filtering threshold for common regions.; - Consolidating validation scripts to process gCNV output and outputs of competing tools measure their performances against ground truth.; - Analyzing 1000 Genomes exomes, which could be potentially used for public facing automatic evaluations. **The following items are necessary done for automatic evaluation:** ; - Dataset + truth.

Mutect2 has been one of the best performing variant callers of the last years and is a major reason for the Broad's good reputation in the oncology bioinformatics field. GATK and Mutect2 are used by hundreds of institutions in clinical practice, affecting thousands of real patients' lives. Almost all of these institutions are likely to use clinical WES assays due to cost reasons and will thus have been directly affected by this issue _for the last three years_. Also, almost all of these institutions will never learn of this bug since they likely trusted in the developers to have proper functional regression tests in place. If this is indeed the best the Broad can do as an institution, then I will take your offer of providing a build of Mutect2 4.1.8.1 with the log4j vulnerability patched out - thank you. The one thing that I am asking for in addition (for the sake of the overall oncology bioinformatics community), however, is that you conduct a best effort to notify organizations (universities, hospitals, and biotechs/pharmaceuticals that you know are using Mutect2) and best-practise workflow owners (Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL, CWL etc. that include Mutect2) of the forced downgrade. Also, I think it makes sense to include a very prominent warning into the Mutect2 READMEs and GATK best practice documentations and guides. I know that this is work, too, but with success comes responsibility, and I can just hope that providing proper warnings uses less developer bandwidth than applying binary search to find out which of these [10 commits between 4.1.8.1 and 4.1.9.0 that are touching variant filtering (see below)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/4.1.8.1...4.1.9.0) broke your flagship product enough to abandon it.

Deployability,"c. to `pytensor`/`pt`/etc. However, there were some more nontrivial changes, including to 1) model priors (since some of the distributions previously used were removed or are now supported differently), 2) the implementation of posterior sampling, 3) some shape/dimshuffle operations, and other things along these lines. Using a single test shard of 20 1kGP WES samples x 1000 intervals, I have verified determinism/reproducibility for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy COHORT/CASE modes, GermlineCNVCaller COHORT/CASE modes, and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors). Some remaining TODOs:. - [x] Rebuild and push the base Docker. EDIT: Mostly covered by #8610, but this also includes an addition of `libblas-dev`.; - [x] Update expected results for integration tests, perhaps add any that might be missing. EDIT: These were generated on WSL Ubuntu 20.04.2, we'll see if things pass on 22.04. Note that changing the ARD priors does change the *names* of the expected files, since the transform is appended to the corresponding variable name. DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls are missing exact-match tests and should probably have some, but I'll leave that to someone else.; - [x] Update other python integration tests.; - [x] Clean up some of the changes to the priors.; - [x] Clean up some TODO comments that I left to track code changes that might result in changed numerics. I'll try to go through and convert these to PR comments in an initial review pass.; - [x] Test over multiple shards on WGS and WES. Probably some scientific tests on ~100 samples in both cohort and case mode would do the trick. We should also double check runtime/memory performance (I noted ~1.5x speedups, but didn't measure carefully; I also want to m",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561#issuecomment-1847549285:1927,Update,Update,1927,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561#issuecomment-1847549285,2,"['Update', 'integrat']","['Update', 'integration']"

Deployability,"consider combining this code (along with `AllelicCount`/`PileupSummary`) at some point.; - [x] Added option to use matched normal.; - [ ] Rather than port over the old modeling code, I would rather expand the allele-fraction model to allow for the modeling of hom sites. I wrote up such a model in some notes I sent around a few months back. This model allows for an allelic PoN that uses all sites to learn reference bias, not just hets. Depending on how our python development proceeds, I may try to implement this model using the old `GibbsSampler` code instead.; - [x] In the meantime, we can try to speed up the old allele-fraction model, which is now the main bottleneck. An easy (lazy) strategy might simply be to downsample and scale likelihoods when estimating global parameters. Addresses #2884.; - [x] Even though the simple copy-ratio model is much faster, it still takes ~15-20 minutes for 100 iterations on WGS, so we can downsample here too.; - [x] Integration tests are still needed; again, these might not test for correctness.; - I've added the ability to specify a prior for the minor-allele fraction, which alleviates the problem of residual bias in balanced segments.; - I've reduced the verbosity of the modeled-segments file. I only report posterior mode and 10%, 50%, and 90% deciles. Global parameters have the full deciles output in the .param files, but I removed the mode and highest density credible interval (because of the below item).; - [x] Some residual bias remains in the estimate of the minor-allele fraction posterior mode. This is simply because we are performing kernel density estimation of a bounded quantity. One possibility would be to logit transform to an unbounded support, perform the estimation, then transform back. EDIT: Just removed kernel density estimation for now, partly due to #3599 as well.; - Hmm, actually still a tiny bit of residual bias. This is apparent e.g. in WGS normals.

Deployability,"d from ApplyVQSR. See https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954#discussion_r933570228.; - [ ] Add behavior for dealing with mixed SNP/INDEL sites in separate passes (and note that the current WDL currently does this, to allow for the use of different annotations across SNPs and INDELs). This might include rescuing previously filtered sites, etc. (e.g., by using the option to ignore the first-pass filter in the second pass). Alternatively, one could use a different FILTER name in each pass, which downstream hard-filtering steps could utilize intelligently. Or one might just split multiallelics upstream. In any case, I would hope that we could move towards running both SNPs and INDELs in a single pass with the same annotations as the default mode of operation.; - [ ] Clean up borrowed code in the `VariantType` class for classifying sites as SNP or INDEL. We mostly retained the VQSR code and logic to make head-to-head comparisons easier. Note also that we converted some switch statements to conditionals, etc. (which I think was done properly, but maybe I missed an edge case). See https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954#discussion_r934776584.; - [ ] Think more about how to treat empty HDF5 arrays. It's possible we should handle this at the WDL level with optional inputs/outputs. Likely only relevant for atypical edge cases. See https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954#discussion_r934845337. Next steps:. - [ ] I'll update the BGMM branch and open a PR.; - [ ] I'll start looking at implementing a simple CARROT test. We can just replicate the Cromwell/WDL test for now.; - [ ] Update that initial implementation with non-trivial data and evaluation scripts. EDIT: I see that #7982 was just filed.; - [ ] Implement a CARROT test with malaria data. We already have some evaluation scripts.; - [x] Expand the WDL to enable additional workflow modes (positive-negative, etc.) and the tests to cover them. Right now only vanilla positive-only is enabled/covered.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1209555008:1989,update,update,1989,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7724#issuecomment-1209555008,2,"['Update', 'update']","['Update', 'update']"
Deployability,"d try to do it, as that is a relatively expensive resource to create. For example, some very naive hard filtering (red) of the histogram yields a peak that is easily fit by a negative binomial (green)---even a Poisson fit does not appear to bias the depth estimates, and certainly does not result in incorrect ploidy estimates:. ![masked_fit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/37863641-827a6e8a-2f37-11e8-83d5-cb4af32a898b.png). (Incidentally, it is helpful to plot on a log scale when checking the fit of these distributions.). This strategy also gives us a way to ignore low-level mosaicism or large germline events, which filtering on mappability may not address:. ![mosaic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/37863649-d0ac378c-2f37-11e8-8e98-45e1fa9a3d7a.png). So let's try to encapsulate changes to the ploidy tool. I agree that the histogram creation can be easily done on the Java side, to save on intermediate file writing. We can probably just cap the maximum bin to `k` and pass a samples x contig TSV where each entry is a vector with `k + 1` elements. I agree that there is still a lot of important work to be done in exploring our best practices for coverage collection, and I know that you have been interested in improving them for a while. Ultimately, we may want to consider incorporating mappability or other informative metadata, as we've discussed. However, this will require some non-trivial investment in method/tool development time. Since our preliminary evaluations show that even with the current, naive strategies the tool is performing reasonably well, I am prioritizing cutting a release and improving/automating the evaluations. As we discussed, this will both allow users to start using the tool (which will hopefully result in useful feedback) and establish a baseline for us. This will ultimately provide the necessary foundation for future exploratory work and method development---which always takes more time than we think it will!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4558#issuecomment-375881040:2209,release,release,2209,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4558#issuecomment-375881040,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"dian count is significantly away from the main peak (due to the abundance of low mappability bins with small counts). . Also, the second peak of chrX coverage in XY samples that you show above is not a large germline event -- it is simply a low mappable PAR-like region that borrows reads from chrY. Here's how the X coverage distribution looks like on an XY sample after mappability filtering (which removes most of all approximate homologies):; ![chrx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15305869/37867778-54e3d196-2f73-11e8-8345-d8964b39a17e.png). **The second spurious peak is gone and range of NB-like behavior is pretty much perfect. Without mappability filtering, all of the bins on the second mode _will_ show up as CN = 2 events (in fact, if you look at gCNV calls on a typical XY samples, there are tons of CN = 2 calls).**. Most, if not all, of the non-NB-like coverage before/after the main peak in your plots are reads from unmappable regions, many of which show up as real CNV events if we do not filter them (reads in these regions do not follow from the coverage model and we are at the mercy of BWA). I strongly believe Genome STRiP has achieved ~ 99% experimental validation accuracy because of aggressive filtering, not because of a superior model (it's an elementary Gaussian mixture mix). Garbage in, garbage out. Anyhow, I am not comfortable at all with cutting a non-Beta release without taking care of about:. 1. Mappability-based bin/read filtering (for WGS), and; 2. Trying out and evaluating a bait-based coverage collection (for WES), so that the raw coverage distribution is more NB-like to begin with. These are both perfectly achievable goals before May 15. I'd be happy to leave stuff such as different coverage collection strategies (e.g. base call coverage) and fragment-based per-sample GC content estimation for later. These are other areas where significant improvements come from.

Deployability,"e GATK/Picard (`IndexFeatureFile `), but they would print inconsistent logs with the rest of my toolkits and they aren't overridable because the classes are final; thus, I would use a decorator over this tools to print the proper startup messages. After a while, I might implement a `VariantWalker`, which will require that I implement another layer (`MyVariantWalker`). Thus, I end up with a lot of naive classes implemented on top of the base walkers and wrappers around bundled GATK/Picard tools. This is very difficult to maintain, because if a change is done at the `CommandLineProgram` abstract class for the logging output (a new method, for example), I will need to update every naive class and wrapper if I bump the GATK version. In addition, extensions of my own toolkit (if any) would need to do the same, making the class-dependency tree so deep that it is difficult to follow (with GATK3, this problem was really driving me crazy when I tried to implement custom tools). On the other hand, there is another use case for the GATK itself: once barclay has a common class for CLP, GATK would be able to run directly Picard tools without the decorator; nevertheless, they will still need it for the log output. This also gives me the impression that the configuration for the CLP output should be at the barclay level, to be shared between Picard/GATK/downstream toolkits to be able to combine them. I think that a way of managing that woul be a new field in the CLP consisting on an interface/abstract class, `CommandLineStartupFormatter`, with the same CLP methods for this kind of operations, that will be passed to the CLP on construction (in `Main`) and defaults to whatever base class is chosen. This will allow custom toolkits to override in their `Main` the formatter and thus make consistent the output of every tool. Another option is to use directly something like the Spring framework, but I think that it is quite complicated for API users without knowledge of Spring (like me).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646:2071,configurat,configuration,2071,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"endencies to the conda environment in a branch and rebased on that. A few issues that I've run into or that came up in discussion with @jamesemery and @cmnbroad:. -I moved all tests that depend on R into the `python` test group (which should perhaps be renamed to `conda`). Note that some of these also fall into the `spark` test group---not sure if there is any special Spark setup done for that group, but we should make sure that they don't fail if they're not run with the conda environment. -@cmnbroad mentioned that some Picard tools that depend on R may break outside of the conda environment if the user does not have the R dependencies. -When we install R in the base image, we pull in a lot of basic dependencies (e.g., build-essential, various libraries and compilers, etc.) So when the R install is removed, it looks like many tests begin failing or hanging, perhaps because they are falling back on Java implementations (e.g., AVX PairHMM tests). We need to determine the dependencies for these tests and install them separately. Here is the list of packages that get pulled in by the R install: ```autoconf automake autotools-dev binutils bsdmainutils build-essential; bzip2-doc cdbs cpp cpp-5 debhelper dh-strip-nondeterminism dh-translations; dpkg-dev fakeroot g++ g++-5 gcc gcc-5 gettext gettext-base gfortran; gfortran-5 groff-base ifupdown intltool intltool-debian iproute2; isc-dhcp-client isc-dhcp-common libalgorithm-diff-perl; libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl libalgorithm-merge-perl libarchive-zip-perl; libasan2 libasprintf-dev libasprintf0v5 libatm1 libatomic1; libauthen-sasl-perl libblas-common libblas-dev libblas3 libbz2-dev; libc-dev-bin libc6-dev libcc1-0 libcilkrts5 libcroco3 libcurl3; libdns-export162 libdpkg-perl libencode-locale-perl libfakeroot; libfile-basedir-perl libfile-desktopentry-perl libfile-fcntllock-perl; libfile-listing-perl libfile-mimeinfo-perl libfile-stripnondeterminism-perl; libfont-afm-perl libfontenc1 libgcc-5-dev libgdbm3 libgettextpo-dev; libget",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406373954:1111,install,install,1111,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406373954,1,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"entUtils`). There are still some improvements that can be made (especially in segment union and the subsequent modeling), but we should be ready to go for a first validation. Some notes:. WDL:; - I've moved the old pipeline to `somatic_old` folders.; - There is now just a matched-pair workflow and a panel workflow. We can add a single BAM case workflow or expand the matched-pair workflow to handle this, depending on the discussion at https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3657.; - WES/WGS is toggled by providing an optional target-file input.; - For all workflows, we always collect integer read counts; for WGS, these are output as both HDF5 and TSV and the HDF5 is used for subsequent input.; - For the case workflow, we always collect allelic counts at all sites and output as TSV.; - [x] We should output all data files as HDF5 by default and as TSV optionally.

Deployability,"er it's worth consolidating some of the parameter sets at this stage? I think there's an argument for having at least two sets (haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype), but I'm not sure how to justify having a separate set for dangling heads/tails. But also not sure which set the latter should be consolidated with---@jamesemery thoughts? Again, let me reiterate that it seems that many of these parameter values were chosen arbitrarily (or, if not, that the procedure for choosing them has been lost). As a start, you can see the results of some optimizations I did on the CHM mix on slide 15 at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zGuquAZWSUQ-wNxp8D6HhGNjIaFcV0_X9WAS4LODbEo/edit?usp=sharing Here, I optimized over haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype SW parameters on various metrics after variant normalization using vcfeval. These optimizations were done using the Bayesian optimization framework I prototyped long ago (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-evaluation/tree/master/pipeline-optimizer and https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t5WOAEOMp0xAzJgpKbP68BUnclNYfIVRrDSL9wl1-3A/edit?usp=sharing); this entailed running parameter scans using a local Cromwell on my desktop. Probably this optimization work could be redone relatively easily using the Neptune framework put together by @dalessioluca, which was still in development at the time I did this work. Happy to share the resources and scripts I used if we go down this route; they are pretty lightweight. See more discussion starting here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564#issuecomment-710107566. Alternatively, we could merge this branch to expose the parameters now and punt on consolidating/optimizing them. I'm not completely convinced we should even do the former unless we are going to follow through on the latter, but happy to defer to others. Finally, note also there is one code optimization that I removed, since it makes assumptions on the SW parameter values that might not be va",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-891907471:1974,pipeline,pipeline-optimizer,1974,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-891907471,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline-optimizer']

Deployability,"erent results by the first filtering step (on intervals by interval median). @LeeTL1220 @davidbenjamin what is the ""official ReCapSeg"" behavior, and do we want to keep the current behavior? In general, I think all of the standardization (i.e., filtering/imputation/truncation/transformation) steps could stand some revisiting. Evaluation:. - [ ] Revisit standardization procedure by checking with simulated data. We should make sure that the centering of the data does not rescale the true copy ratio.; - [x] <s>Investigate the effect of keeping duplicates. I am still not sure why we do this, and it may have a more drastic impact on WGS data.</s> Turns out we don't keep duplicates for WGS; see #3367.; - [ ] Check that GC-bias-correction+PCA and PCA-only perform comparably, even at small bin sizes (~300bp). From what I've seen, this is true for larger bin sizes (~3kbp), so explicit GC-bias correction may not be necessary. (That is, even at these (purportedly) large bin sizes, the effect of the read-based GC-bias correction is obvious for those samples where it is important. However, the end result is not very different from PCA-only denoising with no GC-bias correction performed.); - [x] <s>Check that changing CBS alpha parameter sufficiently reduces hypersegmentation.</s> <s>Looks like the hybrid p-value calculation in DNACopy is not accurate enough to handle WGS-size data. (Also, it's relatively slow, taking ~30 minutes on ~10M intervals.) Even if I set alpha to 0, I still get a ridiculous number of segments! So I think it's finally time to scrap CBS. I'll look into other R segmentation packages that might give us a quick drop-in solution, but we may want to roll our own simple algorithm (which we will scrap anyway once the coverage model is in for somatic).</s> I've implemented a fast kernel-segmentation method that seems very promising, see below.; - [ ] Investigate performance vs. CGA ReCapSeg pipeline on THCA samples.; - [ ] Investigate concordance with Genome STRiP.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351:5840,pipeline,pipeline,5840,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

One could imagine that smoothing could be disabled (so that all samples retain the common segmentation after modeling) or made more aggressive (so that private events don't get inadvertently introduced into other samples due to noise, perhaps), depending on the use case. It looks like the joint segmentation allows some additional events to be resolved, although I haven't done any rigorous evaluations. We could probably cook up some evaluations using simulated toy data or in silico mixtures, but there's really no reason why this shouldn't work decently well, especially if the kernel-segmentation method works well on a single sample for your data. It would also be interesting to understand at which point changing segmentation parameters on a single sample can no longer yield the same performance as joint segmentation on a fixed number of samples; however, this is probably a function of various S/N ratios, and it might not be easy to characterize this behavior outside of toy data. The segmentation parameter space is big enough to make this unwieldy even for toy data, too. Perhaps we can get some feedback from test users---not only on performance, but also on the structure of the new workflow. It might also be worth gauging whether a new WDL is warranted. Otherwise, we just need to add some unit tests for correctness of the multisample-segmentation backend class, integration tests for plumbing of the new tool, and perhaps address some of the issues mentioned above. Then I'd say this is good to go.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6499#issuecomment-598386823:2996,integrat,integration,2996,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6499#issuecomment-598386823,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Incidentally, VariantRecalibrator SNP and INDEL runs both fail to converge on these small training sets without the #7709 fix, but do converge with it. I still need to check if enough multiallelics are included here; if not, I'll choose a different snippet.

This will make the tests better encapsulated. However, it should be relatively easy to update the whole chain of test files, should one choose to do so. EDIT: Let's just provide the expected outputs directly. So it'll be even easier to update the whole chain---just set the flags for all three tools to overwrite the expected results.; ; We test the Cartesian product of the following options: 1) non-allele-specific vs. allele-specific, 2) SNP vs. indel vs. both, and 3) positive vs. positive-unlabeled. Downstream, we'll further subset to a subset of these options, since training/scoring functionality shouldn't really change across some of them.; ; I'm currently just using call outs to system commands to diff and h5diff the VCFs and HDF5s, respectively. I think the latter command should be available in the GATK Conda environment. This will be a bit awkward, in the sense that the tests for this tool will require the Conda environment, but the tool itself will not. But I think this is probably preferable to writing test code to compare HDF5s, minimal though that might be, since the schema might change in the future.; - [x] Tool-level docs.

Deployability,"he per-contig coverage histograms (unfiltered bins in blue, bins retained after filtering in red, and negative-binomial fit in green) and a heatmap of per-contig ploidy probabilities. Both the panel (first 20) and case (remaining) samples are shown:. ![prototype-result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/37938642-e9fbd804-312c-11e8-8a6c-02ea4e4fa704.png). Although the prototype model is clearly a good fit to the filtered data, some care in choosing the optimizer and its learning parameters is required to achieve convergence to the correct solution. This is because the problem is inherently multimodal and thus there are many local minima. I found that using AdaMax with a naive strategy of warm restarts (to help kick us out of local minima) worked decently; we can achieve convergence in <10 minutes for 60 samples x 24 contigs x 250 count bins:. ![elbo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/37938658-fc176f12-312c-11e8-89e2-40c68e0f9953.png). I expect that @mbabadi's annealing implementation in the gcnvkernel package will handle the local minima much better. The course of action needed to implement this model should be as follows:. 1) Alter Java code to emit per-contig histograms. Change python code to consume histograms, perform filtering, and fit using the above model (or some variation).; 2) Choose learning parameters appropriate with annealing and check that results are still good.; 3) Update gCNV model to consume the depth emitted by this model properly, if necessary, and rerun evaluations. Other improvements enabled by mappability filtering (as discussed in #4558) or coverage collection can follow this initial model revision. In the meantime, we will continue the first round of evaluations using the old ploidy model, spot checking genotype calls as necessary. This will allow us to tune gCNV parameters (which will hopefully be largely unaffected by any changes to the ploidy model).

Deployability,"ility). Costs for this branch ($10.92) and 4.5.0.0 ($10.96) were quite comparable. Note that a small portion of these costs derives from Pf7-specific genotyping steps, which I did not bother to remove from the workflow. Runtime for the ploidy modeling and postprocessing steps were comparable. Interestingly, **runtime for the gCNV was ~20-25% longer with this branch than with 4.5.0.0, but memory usage fell by a factor of ~3 (~6GB to ~2GB)!** I am not sure if we could recoup the runtime with some more tweaking of the environment (perhaps double checking that optimized BLAS/MKL/etc. packages are properly used, changing environment variables/flags, etc.), but I think the decrease in memory usage is quite nice. Concordance was checked for the following quantities (4.5.0.0 is on the x-axis and this branch is on the y-axis in all plots below):. 1) Variational posterior means (`mu_*`) and standard deviations (`std_*`) for all analogous variables in the ploidy and gCNV models. There were some slight changes to the gCNV model in this branch (e.g., the functional form of the ARD prior was changed), which means some variables are no longer directly comparable. Furthermore, some variables (such as the bias factors W) are degenerate and cannot be immediately compared. Otherwise, there is good concordance between the remaining variables, e.g.:. ![image](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/assets/11076296/614cf501-ca31-4199-badb-3194b7f78154); ![image](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/assets/11076296/f615084d-d0bf-44e9-bcf5-98abd26ceb06); ![image](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/assets/11076296/48570e53-024c-44b5-8835-3fd40b4c5866); ![image](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/assets/11076296/99100e5d-05e2-4a5c-9d68-57db1b734029); ![image](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/assets/11076296/abae09e1-70a5-4213-95a2-0cb10f9db192); ![image](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/assets/11076296/ef68d0da-90df-4c4b-9802-97988a498280). 2) ...

Deployability,"implementation is different from the one in `ReadWindowWalker`: first, the overlap between windows is only in one direction; second, `SlidingWindowWalker` is more like a reference/interval walker, from the beginning of the reference (or interval) till the end, it walks in overlapping windows. One example is the following (window-size 10, window-step 5, the - represent the window):. ```; Reference: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows1: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows2: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows3: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows4: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; Windows5: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _; ```. Of course, after having a look to `ReadWindowWalker` I think that several things could be improved in my implementation for a general `SlidingWindowWalker`:; - Apply function similar to the `ReadWindowWalker`, with `ReadWindow` being empty if reads are not provided.; - Three window options: `windowSize` (the actual size of the window), `windowStep` (how much advance for the following window) and `windowPadding` (how much extend the window in both directions). Using this abstraction, `ReadWindowWalker` could be implemented setting `windowSize=windowStep`, and the problem that I need to solve could be implemented setting `windowPadding=0`. The simplest way to acomplish this is to use the current implementation of `ReadWindowWalker` to develop a `SlidingWindowWalker` adding three abstract methods for the three parameters (`getWindowSize()`, `getWindowStep()` and `getWindowPadding()`, and implement `ReadWindowWalker` as a extension of this interface setting `getWindowStep()` to return `getWindowSize()` and `requiresReads()` to true. I can do this once the PR #1567 is accepted and generate the two interfaces (to be sure that the integration with the HC engine is working as expected with the changes), or just implement the `SlidingWindowWalker` and you can include it in the HC PR, or update afterwards to avoid redundancy in the code.

Deployability,"ire count file for all samples a determining factor? If we can drastically reduce this cost, then we can dedicate more to increasing resolution, etc. Here is a minimal set of fixes that could enable the querying of intervals for GermlineCNVCaller (and also for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy without too much extra work, since we also subset intervals there) *only in the gCNV WGS pipeline*, without disrupting other interfaces:. 1) Write a Tribble SimpleCountCodec for the `counts.tsv` extension. I've already done this in a branch.; 2) Change GermlineCNVCaller and DetermineGermlineContigPloidy tools to accept paths.; 3) If an index is present for each count path, create a FeatureDataSource, merge the requested -L/-XL intervals, and query to perform the subset. We will also need to stream the SAM header metadata. It should not require much code to extract all this to a temporary IndexedSimpleCountCollection class. (Caveat: for now, this will work with the current gCNV convention of providing bins via -L/-XL. Technically, it will also work with the more conventional use of -L/-XL to denote contiguous regions, but we may have to perform checks that bins are not duplicated in adjacent shards if they overlap both, since querying a FeatureDataSource will return any bins that overlap the interval---rather than only those that are completely contained within it.); 4) Index read-count TSVs in the gCNV WGS pipeline after collection and modify the DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and GermlineCNVCaller tasks to take read-count paths and indices, if necessary. These changes could be confined in the gCNV WGS WDL for now. I think that should do the trick. If this is high priority, I can implement now. In the future, we might be able to promote all Locatable CNV Records to Features and write code to automatically pass the columns/encoders/decoders (currently held in the Collection corresponding to each Record) to a single Tribble codec. This codec should not depend upon the file extension.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5716#issuecomment-468360082:1567,pipeline,pipeline,1567,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5716#issuecomment-468360082,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"just to clarify, the weird mosaic examples are the bottom two plots out of the four above---you can see the shifted (non-X, in one of the examples) single peaks. However, it's interesting that the PARs are still showing up in XY---I'm pretty sure I used the blacklist you provided, although I will double check. Did that only include the ""official"" PARs, or also the additional ones you found?. In any case, are we comfortable calling in those regions (here I'm talking about gCNV, not ploidy)? As I show above, I don't think we need mappability to nail the baseline ploidy. Can we then rely on the per-bin bias to account for these regions in gCNV (pinning them back to the correct CN) without mappability filtering? And with mappability filtering, how substantial is the hit to coverage in these regions? Should we blacklist them for the time being?. To summarize, I think the order of events I'd like to see is this:. 1. Cut an **initial Beta** release that incorporates CollectReadCounts, streamline evaluations for the AACR poster, do a bit of tuning, establish a baseline. Hopefully the current ploidy calls suffice, if not, maybe issue a quick PR that implements the naive bin filtering (or whatever is necessary to get good ploidy calls). At the same time, get preliminary feedback from some users running on *small test cohorts* after we have some parameter recommendations.; 2. Do a round of method/model improvement. Start with quick and dirty fixes (e.g., blacklisting PARs) and work our way to more non-trivial changes. This will include many of the suggestions you have brought up, but we should also review user feedback and prioritize accordingly---they may find something that is not even on our radar. Demonstrate improvement (hopefully substantial!) over baseline, cut **second Beta** release.; 3. Run on larger cohorts, iron out remaining minor issues, and then productionize. By this time, @asmirnov239 will have hopefully made some progress on the PoN clustering front as well. *",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4558#issuecomment-375923639:2352,release,release,2352,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4558#issuecomment-375923639,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"l clock 76 hours); Test 1 ran slower and required more memory 40-50% of 256GB (Wall Clock 94 hours); Test 3 ran initially faster with less memory than test 1 but by batch 65 it was using 75% of 384 GB. This job has not finished and appears stuck on importing batch 65. So the consolidate option appears to have a memory leak or using just requiring too much memory. The -consolidate option was the culprit. So rerunning chr1-3 with just the --bypass-feature-reader option (test2) ran fine without lots of memory being used. Below is the time output from chr1.

Deployability,"model-based filtering, etc). If Mutect would employ this naive approach to haplotype calling, I suppose it would end up looking like the ""Platypus"" caller, _which_ again might be suited for our needs, but potentially makes option 3 more appealing. > Option 3 ( i.e. Quick-and-dirty (""FreeBayes-ian"") assembly:. This is interesting and would seem to solve my problems (I believe?) by creating a Haplotype-based, somatic variant caller with the Mutect perks/processing steps/output formats. Again, though, I could see the generation of many candidate haplotypes if things are really messy; however, could you not use a simple ""supporting reads""-based approach for haplotype selection. That would make the likelihood calculations fairly straight-forward. It would undeniably be less-sophisticated than the current De Bruijn Graph/Smith Waterman realignment-based approach but could be better for folks that want more control of the expected behaviors of the tool. > Option 5 (Disable realignment portion of assembly):. I'm going to go out on a limb with this one (feel free to shut this line of thought down quick if I'm really off-base). I've never been able to fully understand the code in the `findBestPaths` method (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/9ff3f8b180c063a3fa67dae129b0cbd04012448e/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/haplotypecaller/readthreading/ReadThreadingAssembler.java#L307) and I've had troubles figuring out the details of realignment from the official docs. It could be this part of the assembly process that causes me the most troubles in my pipeline, since this is where the original alignment information can really get disregarded as Mutect2 looks for better understandings of the input alignments. Admittedly, I find this feature to be really neat (particularly for the big ugly INDELs), but again the lose of the original alignment information has been troubling in certain cases. Could there be a potential approach to disabling realignment?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7064#issuecomment-771060817:2159,pipeline,pipeline,2159,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7064#issuecomment-771060817,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"ntainer for locus/ref/alt is required. Some of the diffs are big but trivial. (In `AssemblyRegionTrimmer` I also deleted the unused `nonVariantTargetRegions` method).; - `AlleleAndContext` and `LocationAndAlleles` were deleted as the new `Event` class makes them obsolete.; - `AlleleFiltering` is a big diff but it's just a bunch of replacing `AlleleAndContext` with `Event`.; - `HaplotypeCallerGenotypingEngine`: some trivial renaming and use of `Event` instead of `VariantContext`.; - `PileupDetectionArgumentCollection`: fixed a typo.; - `LeftAlignAndTrimVariants`: just some optimized imports.; - `Event`: this is the new class at the heart of the PR.; - `EventMap`: lighter than it was. Storing a haplotype and other state were replaced by a static method to extract events from a haplotype. Using `Event` instead of `VariantContext` allowed several things to be written more concisely, but no big-picture changes. I didn't like how `buildEventMapForHaplotypes` both returned the set of event positions and filled in the haplotype's events as a side efffect, so I split it into a void method for filling events and another method for extracting start positions.; - `AlleleFilteringUnitTest`, `AssemblyBasedCallerUtilsUnitTest`, `HaplotypeCallerGenotypingEngineUnitTest.java`, `PartiallyDeterminedHaplotypeComputationEngineUnitTest`, `EventMapUnitTest`: everything that was tested before is still tested now. Lots of replacing `VariantContext` with `Event`. Deleted tests for a few unused methods here and there.; - The exact match expected VCF outputs in `HaplotypeCallerIntegrationTest`: no changes to the calls. Slight changes in QUALs and QD annotation due to arbitrariness of selecting which pileup haplotypes to retain in case of ties in the read kmer support score. I checked these all very carefully. A bunch of VCF didn't change but their .idx files did when I turned on the update exact match toggle. That's it for the trivially-changed classes. Now for the few substantive changes. . .",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8332#issuecomment-1574146393:2532,update,update,2532,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8332#issuecomment-1574146393,2,"['toggle', 'update']","['toggle', 'update']"

DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls are missing exact-match tests and should probably have some, but I'll leave that to someone else.; - [x] Update other python integration tests.; - [x] Clean up some of the changes to the priors.; - [x] Clean up some TODO comments that I left to track code changes that might result in changed numerics. I'll try to go through and convert these to PR comments in an initial review pass.; - [x] Test over multiple shards on WGS and WES. Probably some scientific tests on ~100 samples in both cohort and case mode would do the trick. We should also double check runtime/memory performance (I noted ~1.5x speedups, but didn't measure carefully; I also want to make sure the changes to posterior sampling didn't introduce any memory issues). @mwalker174 will ping you when a Docker is ready! Might be good to loop in Isaac and/or Jack as well.; - [x] Perhaps add back the fix for 2-interval shards in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8180, which I removed since the required functionality wasn't immediately available in Pytensor. Not sure if this actually broke things though---need to check. (However, I don't actually think this is a very important use case to support...); - [x] Delete/deprecate/etc. CNN tools/tests as appropriate. Note that this has to be done concurrently, since we remove Tensorflow. @droazen perhaps I can take a first stab at this in a subsequent commit to this PR once more of the gCNV dust settles and/or has undergone a preliminary review? EDIT: Disabled integration/WDL tests. We should add some deprecation messages to the tools---we can note that they should still work in previous environments but will be untested.

Deployability,"ontrast to genotyping in matched-normal mode, in which the normal determines the set of hets used in all samples). We will thus have to take the intersection of these hets before performing multisample segmentation. Unfortunately, we will not be able to re-perform this intersection in each scatter, since we will no longer have access to the hets from the other samples. However, we *will* ultimately intersect the hets from each sample with the joint segmentation before modeling, which may be a rough proxy for the intersection of hets from all samples. As always, tumor-only mode may yield suboptimal results in certain scenarios, e.g., high purity CNLOH. I think I'm OK with just documenting these wrinkles, rather than working too hard to iron them out. I think this structure sets us up nicely to accommodate germline tagging/filtering in the near future. We can still pass the Picard interval list containing the joint segmentation to the scatter for the normal, but can instead subsequently pass the *.modelBegin.seg result from the normal to the tumors. This modeled-segment file will have breakpoints identical to those from the joint segmentation (as opposed to the *.modelFinal.seg result, since that undergoes segment smoothing/merging), but will also contain the segment-level posteriors necessary for performing germline filtering. We will just need to add code to toggle on the type of `--segments` input (Picard interval list or modeled segments), add filtering arguments and code, perhaps output an additional seg file showing filter status for the *.modelBegin.seg segments, and modify the segment merging/smoothing code to properly account for filter status (so we don't incorrectly impute across filtered segments, which is currently done by the unsupported code, for whatever reason). I think this should clock in at well under ~5k lines of code, which is the count for the current unsupported code (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5450#issuecomment-461431199).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6499#issuecomment-607313549:4228,toggle,toggle,4228,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6499#issuecomment-607313549,1,['toggle'],['toggle']

Deployability,"orcement of consistent GC-bias correction).; - [ ] That said, I'll carry over this TODO from above: Revisit standardization procedure by checking with simulated data. We should make sure that the centering of the data does not rescale the true copy ratio.; - The only major difference is we no longer make a QC PoN or check for large events. This was performed awkwardly in the old pipeline, so I'd rather not port it over. Eventually we will do all denoising with the gCNV coverage model anyway.; - Pre/tangent-normalization copy ratio are now referred to as standardized/denoised copy ratio.; - [x] Old code is still used for GC-bias correction in `CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals`, and we still use the `AnnotateTargets` tool. We should port this over (possibly as part of `PreprocessIntervals`) at some point (actually, I think we will be forced to, since `PreprocessIntervals` will output a Picard interval list, and `AnnotateTargets` outputs a target file).; - [x] Integration tests are still needed for `CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals`. These might not test for correctness, but we could possibly compare to old PoNs. Segmentation/modeling:; - Instead of separate tools for copy-ratio segmentation (`PerformSegmentation`) and allele-fraction segmentation/union/modeling (`AllelicCNV`), there is now just a single segmentation/modeling tool (`ModelSegments`).; - Input is denoised copy ratio and/or allelic counts. If only one input is provided, then we only model only the corresponding quantity.; - There is no separate allele-fraction workflow. Unlike the old approach, we do not perform any genotyping or modeling before doing kernel segmentation.; - [x] Old code and classes are used for segment union. We should port or possibly replace this with a simple method that uses kernel segmentation. EDIT: Actually, just tried running a WGS sample and this is still a major bottleneck.

Deployability,"ot sure if that was already covered. @sooheelee - this is going to be an exact port of the indel-realignment pipeline, as it is in the GATK3 code, so that means that I won't modify the interval list format or anything (although I will use the HTSJDK/Picard classes as used on GATK3). Because this will be an experimental/beta feature, I think that I can have a look to the new format after acceptance of the original port. @cmnbroad - I understand that a fully functional tool is a requirement for acceptance, but what I mean is that some specific features might require more work than others. I am only concerned about the `NWaySAMFileWriter`, which is just an specific way of output the data but does not add anything to the real realignment process (actually, I think that I've never heard about anyone around me using it). That is a nice feature, but I don't think that it is a high-priority - I care more about having the algorithm implemented to test if the actual processing of the data works, and add support for some way of output the data in a different PR. In addition, if the people still using indel-realignment does not require the n-way output, then it is pointless to spend time on it. I was also thinking about the mate-fixing algorithm in the tool, because it can be performed afterwards with Picard, which is not constraining by any distance between reads or records in RAM - nevertheless, this is really a drop of functionality that will change results, and that's why I didn't propose that. About the target-creator, known indels are really easy to port because the code is within the tool and is simpler - the only problem might be code coverage if there is no data for known indels. I will propose very soon two PRs with fully functional tools (without the n-way out feature for indel-realignment), and trying to add simple integration tests with the data already available on the repository and running with GATK3.8-1. If that is OK for you, I will proceed with this approach.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-371515115:2181,integrat,integration,2181,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-371515115,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"re first, then split. Splitting the gapped alignments was introduced originally to have a centralized logic in inferring type and location of the events. . The tension is that AS is used in the scoring but becomes practically useless after that. >> Correct, but I am having thoughts about this now (not to pick only one—that; would be wrong—but to ditch them altogether probably under some condition; and redo the alignment step), exactly because of this behavior I observe.; Think about the case where one originating gapped (say insertion); alignment, after splitting, has one of the two children contained in; another alignment (not its sibling, that's impossible) in terms of their; read span. Now the originating gapped alignment probably should be filtered; out, or not, because if we keep it, an insertion would be called but; apparently there are alternative explanations due to the other alignment.; I'm not sure how to deal with this case, and if this scenario is common; enough. It probably is the case that such alignments happen mostly in STR; regions, so getting the exact alignments correct there is no easy task.; ; > Is that enough of a concern to worry about. In such a case I feel like we; should probably just pick the longer, gapped alignment, since it explains; more of the contig. But you have a better sense of how that fits in with; the rest of your scheme. The comments I put in the code/todo was not clear (my bad). ; What the code is currently doing is what's suggested, that is: ; skipping the alignment that is BEFORE the child alignment from the gap-split, IFF that alignment contains the child alignment in terms of their spans on the read/contig; (I've updated the doc in the code as well). If you are concerned about the first child alignment from the same gapped alignment being skipped, don't worry, that is impossible because child alignments of the same gapped alignment cannot overlap on the read. --------.

Deployability,"ry issue. These are running on reblocked gvcfs. . 1. Without --bypass-feature-reader and -consolidate; 2. With --bypass-feature-reader; 3. With --consolidate without --bypass-feature-reader (This ended up on a node with 384gb.) The other ran on 256GB nodes. . Test 2 ran the fastest with the lowest memory requirements (Wall clock 76 hours); Test 1 ran slower and required more memory 40-50% of 256GB (Wall Clock 94 hours); Test 3 ran initially faster with less memory than test 1 but by batch 65 it was using 75% of 384 GB. This job has not finished and appears stuck on importing batch 65. So the consolidate option appears to have a memory leak or using just requiring too much memory. The -consolidate option was the culprit. So rerunning chr1-3 with just the --bypass-feature-reader option (test2) ran fine without lots of memory being used. Below is the time output from chr1. The output shows the Maximum resident set size (kbytes): **2630440**.

Deployability,"s took ~30s (~10s of which was composing/writing results, as we are still forced to generate two ReadCountCollections). Resulting PTN and TN copy ratios were identical down to 1E-16 levels. Differences are only due to removing the unnecessary pseudoinverse computation. Results after filtering and before SVD are identical, despite the code being rewritten from scratch to be more memory efficient (e.g., filtering is performed in place)---phew!. If we stored read counts as HDF5 instead of as plain text, this would make things much faster. Perhaps it would be best to make TSV an optional output of the new coverage collection tool. As a bonus, it would then only take a little bit more code to allow previous PoNs to be provided via -I as an additional source of read counts. Remaining TODO's:. - [x] Allow DenoiseReadCounts to be run without a PoN. This will just perform standardization and optional GC correction. This gives us the ability to run the case sample pipeline without a PoN, which will give users more options and might be good enough if the data is not too noisy.; - [x] Actually, I'm not sure why we take perform SVD on the intervals x samples matrix and take the left-singular vectors. <s>Typically, SVD is performed on the samples x intervals matrix and the right-singular vectors are taken, which saves some extra computation that is necessary to calculate the left-singular vectors.</s> (EDIT: Actually, looks like Spark's SVD is faster on tall and skinny matrices, which might be due to the fact that the underlying implementation calls Fortran code. I still think that representing samples as row vectors has some benefits, so I've changed things to reflect this; I now just take a transpose before performing the SVD, so that we still operate on the same intervals x samples matrix.) This will also save us some transposing, which we do anyway to make HDF5 writes faster.; - [x] Change HDF5 matrix writing to allow matrices with NxM > MAX_INT, which can be done naively by c",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351:1656,pipeline,pipeline,1656,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Moreover while executing this tool in local mode with the same input sample took about 200 minutes, this time took 3606 minutes in cluster mode. Is it because I used --bam-partition-size 4000000? Or because HaplotypeCallerSpark doesn't get a good speed-up in cluster mode?. **EDIT**; I re-executed the tool in cluster mode without `--bam-partition-size 4000000` and this time I receive this error:; ```; org.a",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3066#issuecomment-368469233:1460,pipeline,pipeline,1460,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3066#issuecomment-368469233,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"t gCNV, not ploidy)? As I show above, I don't think we need mappability to nail the baseline ploidy. Can we then rely on the per-bin bias to account for these regions in gCNV (pinning them back to the correct CN) without mappability filtering? And with mappability filtering, how substantial is the hit to coverage in these regions? Should we blacklist them for the time being?. To summarize, I think the order of events I'd like to see is this:. 1. Cut an **initial Beta** release that incorporates CollectReadCounts, streamline evaluations for the AACR poster, do a bit of tuning, establish a baseline. Hopefully the current ploidy calls suffice, if not, maybe issue a quick PR that implements the naive bin filtering (or whatever is necessary to get good ploidy calls). At the same time, get preliminary feedback from some users running on *small test cohorts* after we have some parameter recommendations.; 2. Do a round of method/model improvement. Start with quick and dirty fixes (e.g., blacklisting PARs) and work our way to more non-trivial changes. This will include many of the suggestions you have brought up, but we should also review user feedback and prioritize accordingly---they may find something that is not even on our radar. Demonstrate improvement (hopefully substantial!) over baseline, cut **second Beta** release.; 3. Run on larger cohorts, iron out remaining minor issues, and then productionize. By this time, @asmirnov239 will have hopefully made some progress on the PoN clustering front as well. **When we are ready, then we will take gCNV out of Beta.** With our current staffing situation, I do not expect this to happen before May 15, but I do enjoy pleasant surprises. :); 4. Run on gnomAD, world domination, etc. Again, getting a **initial Beta** release and some reasonable parameters to users is a high priority, so thanks for kicking off the evaluations, and thanks for your willingness to discuss our options. Let me know if you agree with the rest of the plan!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4558#issuecomment-375923639:3208,release,release,3208,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4558#issuecomment-375923639,2,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"tarted to write a new toolkit that will use some walker classes from GATK (by now, `LocusWalker` or the `ReadSliderWalker` from #4682). With the current way of configuring the output, I will need to implement a layer for both walker classes (e.g., `MyLocusWalker` and `MyReadSliderWalker`) and use them in my implemented tools. In addition, I would like to bundle some tools from the GATK/Picard (`IndexFeatureFile `), but they would print inconsistent logs with the rest of my toolkits and they aren't overridable because the classes are final; thus, I would use a decorator over this tools to print the proper startup messages. After a while, I might implement a `VariantWalker`, which will require that I implement another layer (`MyVariantWalker`). Thus, I end up with a lot of naive classes implemented on top of the base walkers and wrappers around bundled GATK/Picard tools. This is very difficult to maintain, because if a change is done at the `CommandLineProgram` abstract class for the logging output (a new method, for example), I will need to update every naive class and wrapper if I bump the GATK version. In addition, extensions of my own toolkit (if any) would need to do the same, making the class-dependency tree so deep that it is difficult to follow (with GATK3, this problem was really driving me crazy when I tried to implement custom tools). On the other hand, there is another use case for the GATK itself: once barclay has a common class for CLP, GATK would be able to run directly Picard tools without the decorator; nevertheless, they will still need it for the log output. This also gives me the impression that the configuration for the CLP output should be at the barclay level, to be shared between Picard/GATK/downstream toolkits to be able to combine them. I think that a way of managing that woul be a new field in the CLP consisting on an interface/abstract class, `CommandLineStartupFormatter`, with the same CLP methods for this kind of operations, that will be p",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646:1482,update,update,1482,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,thanks for the review @kcibul. I made some changes accordingly. re: PrepareCallset file of sample names. That would be nice! It would make this workflow simpler and it also simplifies the access requirements for PrepareCallset. re: Dockstore. We actually ruled this out because Terra says that the definition of a method configuration can change automatically if its updated in dockstore. Which can be useful but it adds a security risk since a compromised Dockstore can change the definition of the production AoU extraction WDL which runs with highly elevated permissions. We already have a script that creates method configurations from github so I can probably add something a little hacky to resolve relative imports to the raw github file that it refers to.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7242#issuecomment-846494686:321,configurat,configuration,321,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7242#issuecomment-846494686,3,"['configurat', 'update']","['configuration', 'configurations', 'updated']"

Deployability,"the execution environment only supports a ; small finite number of headers, the header tag could be a small integer, ; or in a different execution environment it could be; a unique hash of the header or something like that. Memory footprint in ; the receiver is minimized because many SAMRecords can all share the same ; header object.; This requires more work to support in each execution environment, but it ; seems like it could be efficient and allows application code written to ; operate on SAMRecords to be portable; across different execution environments without having to contend with ; the possible presence of headerless SAMRecords. -Bob.

Deployability,"tually tried it, before putting in the above comment, and quickly ran into the problem of mixing Java serialization and Kryo serialization, so a larger re-structuring might be needed, and not just a inheritance structure). ------------; ### On the problem of having a confusing TODO for ; `boolean SimpleChimera.isCandidateInvertedDuplication()`. The todo message. > TODO: 5/5/18 Note that the use of the following predicate is currently obsoleted by; {@link AssemblyContigWithFineTunedAlignments#hasIncompletePictureFromTwoAlignments()}; because the contigs with this alignment signature is classified as ""incomplete"",; hence will NOT sent here for constructing SimpleChimera's.; But we may want to keep the code (and related code in BreakpointComplications) for future use. Comment by @cwhelan ; > I'm a bit confused by this comment: this method is still being called in several places, so how is it obsolete?. Reply by @SHUANG-Broad (also copied to update the ""TODO"" message; > this predicate is currently used in two places (excluding appearance in comments): `BreakpointComplications.IntraChrStrandSwitchBreakpointComplications`, where it is use to test if the input simple chimera indicates an inverse tandem duplication and trigger the logic for inferring duplicated region; and `BreakpointsInference.IntraChrStrandSwitchBreakpointInference`, where it is used for breakpoint inference. The problem is, the contig will not even be sent here, because `AssemblyContigWithFineTunedAlignments.hasIncompletePictureFromTwoAlignments()` defines a simple chimera that has strand switch and the two alignments overlaps on reference as ""incomplete"", so in practice the two uses are not going to be triggered. But when we come back later and see what can be extracted from such ""incomplete"" contigs, these code could be useful again. So it is kept. ------------; ### On the problem of writing out SAM records of ""Unknown"" contigs efficiently.

Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors). Some remaining TODOs:. - [x] Rebuild and push the base Docker. EDIT: Mostly covered by #8610, but this also includes an addition of `libblas-dev`.; - [x] Update expected results for integration tests, perhaps add any that might be missing. EDIT: These were generated on WSL Ubuntu 20.04.2, we'll see if things pass on 22.04. Note that changing the ARD priors does change the *names* of the expected files, since the transform is appended to the corresponding variable name. DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls are missing exact-match tests and should probably have some, but I'll leave that to someone else.; - [x] Update other python integration tests.; - [x] Clean up some of the changes to the priors.; - [x] Clean up some TODO comments that I left to track code changes that might result in changed numerics. I'll try to go through and convert these to PR comments in an initial review pass.; - [x] Test over multiple shards on WGS and WES. Probably some scientific tests on ~100 samples in both cohort and case mode would do the trick. We should also double check runtime/memory performance (I noted ~1.5x speedups, but didn't measure carefully; I also want to make sure the changes to posterior sampling didn't introduce any memory issues). @mwalker174 will ping you when a Docker is ready! Might be good to loop in Isaac and/or Jack as well.; - [x] Perhaps add back the fix for 2-interval shards in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8180, which I removed since the required functionality wasn't immediately available in Pytensor. Not sure if this actually broke things though---need to check.

Energy Efficiency," a better format. The requirements seem to be: (a) efficient serialization/deserialization, and (b) can easily convert to a SAMRecord for compatibility with existing code. We can make things extra efficient by only deserializing things if they are needed (if a phase doesn't need the CIGAR-related structures, no need to deserialize that). We can achieve this by having the deserialization be lazy. The LazyBAMRecord is a step in that direction since it looks up the reference name only if we ask for it, but we could go a lot further in this direction. But before we do that, having an efficient coder for SAMRecords (I vote for @tomwhite's approach of using the BAMEncoder) will get us 80% of the way for 20% of the effort. Then we can introduce our OptimizedSAMRecord incrementally. . on **headers**:. I agree with @tomwhite that adding the header back after a shuffle is the right thing to do. We know where that happens and we control that code.; @davidadamsphd, you worry about newcomers. But we've already decided that we were going to provide our own API for them (one that does the Dataflow copying for them so they don't have to worry about it). This same API will provide them with header-filled reads, so they don't have to worry about this detail. This falls into the general category of ""the 3rd party devs won't have to even know about Dataflow/Spark: they just need to know our nice, simple interface and use that"". If they know more and want to do fancier things then more power to them, but those users will surely be able to fill in headers, too. We have library functions to use the reads without the headers, but the problem is that (at least for the sort of code I'm writing), I'm handing off a SAMRecord to a big black box and I can't force it to use the library functions - it's going to work on the SAMRecord directly. So at least in this case it's important to fill in the header (unless I happen to know that the ""black box"" won't call any of the header-requiring methods).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141151451:1585,power,power,1585,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/900#issuecomment-141151451,1,['power'],['power']

Energy Efficiency," batch api for it? Multi layer docker builds are pretty standard from what I understand. . It sounds like your suggestions are talking about 2 slightly different issues to me. 1. Too many layers:. We typically have squashed the GATK docker images, but we recently switched to building our release images with google cloud build. Since squash is *STILL* an experimental feature in docker we've had trouble getting it to work there. Since the size reduction was pretty minimal from squashing we figured it would be ok to not prioritize it. It's definitely possible for us to consolidate various layers in the build. Or manually squash the images. We can take a look for our next release. Wide workflows on azure are something we need to support. 2. Docker size reduction:; I've spend a lot of time looking at this in the past. Our docker image is huge, but it's mostly due to the massive size of our python and R dependencies. I've done a bunch of work reducing temporary files in independent layers and using multiple stages to reduce the size. There's not much low hanging fruit left there. Similarly, moving to alpine is tricky an has limited benefit. GATK packages a number of C libraries which do not work out of the box on alpine due to the different C runtime. (At least that was the case the last time I investigated it a few years ago. ) I suspect there's a way to port things so they work on it, but it's not something we can do now. It also wouldn't be much of a help, the base image is completely dwarfed by piles of python and R dependencies which are very difficult to safely trim. Anyway, that's the state of things. We've considered a java only image for a while which would be much smaller than the current one. (although still fat by most docker standards...). We've never released one publicly because it seemed like it might cause confusion, but it's a reasonable possibility. . If you have any secret methods to reduce the size of python or R installations we're happy to take PRs!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8684#issuecomment-1934859427:2143,reduce,reduce,2143,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8684#issuecomment-1934859427,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Energy Efficiency," is a lot of complication to get the reader ID for each read. It will require to modify the `GATKRead` interface, the data source for reads, or find an *ad hoc* solution on `IndelRealignment` to set the procedence of the read. This requires going into the engine-level code, which in my experience is difficult to port from GATK3 and also slow on the reviewing/acceptance process.; 1. My idea for developing a new writer of general use as the n-way output (which can be used in other tools as well) is to factor out some code from `SplitReads` to have a custom `GATKReadWriter` for arbitrary splitting. i'm already using a similar solution on `ReadTools`, so backporting the code to GATK might be a solution. Nevertheless, this still requires that the `GATKRead` has somehow the identity store at the object level, which requires to address point 1.; 1. The use case of the tumor-normal pair can be resolved by an extra processing step (split by read group). I understand that it is quite convenient to add this argument, but I would suggest that until it can be develop.; 1. Last, bu quite important for me as a developer, I don't have time to spend looking at that engine-level features required to include that argument. I would definitely use some of my time on such a feature if it wasn't possible to workaround the use case of tumor-normal data, but my previous suggestion is enough until someone (even myself) can spend some time on developing the feature. All this said, I am really interested in getting the indel realignment pipeline out in GATK4, and that's why I am implementing it. If the only way is adding support for every extra-feature of the tools, I have no other chance than doing it, but I can't promise that my schedule allows me to do it soon. I already started porting `IndelRealigner` without some features, and thus I think that if the n-way out can wait a bit, I can have the tool sooner than if I need to spend some time on working around the problems at the engine level.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-373376231:2490,schedul,schedule,2490,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-373376231,1,['schedul'],['schedule']

Energy Efficiency," pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above. I would hope that with more variants or reliable training/truth (as in your data), things might stabilize or line up better. I'll try running with more malaria data, as well. The following trios x sites heatmap (top plot) for the validation set might better illustrate the arbitrariness in F1 (click to enlarge):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385585-1a0dfe8e-d4b7-4770-aed0-19ad81162c92.png). Here, yellow = het errors (since these are supposed to be clonal malaria samples), red = Mendelian errors, grey = no calls, green = Mendelian consistency, white = reference. The second plot shows the training/truth positives used to train the model and to calculate the LL score in the validation shard. The third plot shows the ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives used to calculate F1. So we can see that the difficulty in deriving F1 as a function of the score along the horizontal axis to give the third plot lies in collapsing the columns in the top plot into a single condition positive or condition negative status. Again, hard to do so without some arbitrariness; I simply came up with some rules to convert various amounts of red, yellow, green, etc. in each column to a red/white/green status. If you're using a single gold-standard sample, this should definitely be more straightforward. In any case, the optimal validation LL score at ~0.02 does appear to line up quite well visually with where one might manually set a threshold. It corresponds pretty well with the transition from the yellow/red/grey junk to the clean green/white sites in the top plot. Here's the same for the test set:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385662-6693a6c9-709c-482f-9a7e-5bb7030b3383.png).

Energy Efficiency," seems to be working fine and is much, much leaner. Building a small PoN with 4 simulated normals with 5M bins each, CombineReadCounts took ~1 min, CreatePanelOfNormals (with no QC) took ~4.5 minutes (although ~1 minute of this is writing target weights, which I haven't added to the new version yet) and generated a 2.7GB PoN, and NormalizeSomaticReadCounts took ~8 minutes (~7.5 minutes of which was spent composing/writing results, thanks to overhead from ReadCountCollection). In comparison, the new CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals took ~1 minute (which includes combining read-count files, which takes ~30s of I/O) and generated a 520MB PoN, and DenoiseReadCounts took ~30s (~10s of which was composing/writing results, as we are still forced to generate two ReadCountCollections). Resulting PTN and TN copy ratios were identical down to 1E-16 levels. Differences are only due to removing the unnecessary pseudoinverse computation. Results after filtering and before SVD are identical, despite the code being rewritten from scratch to be more memory efficient (e.g., filtering is performed in place)---phew!. If we stored read counts as HDF5 instead of as plain text, this would make things much faster. Perhaps it would be best to make TSV an optional output of the new coverage collection tool. As a bonus, it would then only take a little bit more code to allow previous PoNs to be provided via -I as an additional source of read counts. Remaining TODO's:. - [x] Allow DenoiseReadCounts to be run without a PoN. This will just perform standardization and optional GC correction. This gives us the ability to run the case sample pipeline without a PoN, which will give users more options and might be good enough if the data is not too noisy.; - [x] Actually, I'm not sure why we take perform SVD on the intervals x samples matrix and take the left-singular vectors. <s>Typically, SVD is performed on the samples x intervals matrix and the right-singular vectors are taken, which saves some extr",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351:1075,efficient,efficient,1075,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

Hi @Yyx2626, I'm Geraldine, you may remember me from the Beijing training. It was great visiting your team! I'm sorry it took me so long to follow up on this discussion, and I want to thank you again for reaching out to us about integrating the tool that you developed into GATK. We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. After examining your paper and the source code in Github, we think that the most efficient way to integrate the functionality you developed would be to adapt the filtering parts of your tool to run on the output of Mutect2. So this would be a standalone tool that you would run after Mutect2, much like the current FilterMutectCalls tool. If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations. David @davidbenjamin can provide some advice on how to implement this in GATK4; in brief you would need to write some code that applies the filters you developed to a variant context.

Energy Efficiency," unnecessary copies of the data (now fixed: https://github.com/cloudera/spark-dataflow/pull/60), which caused OOM errors when trying to broadcast the 3GB reference data. With this fixed, I ran a [pipeline called JoinReferencesDataflow](https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/blob/hadoop-references/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/dataflow/pipelines/JoinReferencesDataflow.java) on a small cluster that broadcasts the reference as a dataflow view. The code is a modified version of CountReadsDataflow that simply sends the view, and then doesn't use it, so we can see the cost of doing a broadcast (See the rest of the code in this branch: https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/tree/hadoop-references). JoinReferencesDataflow took 2 min 25s to run, of which 18s were for reading the reference from the local filesystem in the driver. For comparison, CountReadsDataflow took 17s on the same cluster. So broadcasting the reference takes less than 2 minutes. Note that this was just for one task, but Spark has [an efficient protocol for sending broadcast variables](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~agearh/cs267.sp10/files/mosharaf-spark-bc-report-spring10.pdf), which scales well with the number of nodes, so the approach looks feasible. Having said all that, we might still want to use the sharding approach, in order to share more code between the Google and Spark dataflow implementations. One way this could work would be to generalize `RefAPISource` and `RefAPIMetadata` to support reading reference data from a [ReferenceHadoopSource](https://github.com/tomwhite/hellbender/blob/hadoop-references/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/engine/dataflow/datasources/ReferenceHadoopSource.java), which is in line with @droazen's last comment.

Second, it sounds like the suggestion is that headerless SAMRecords ; would now be widely used, and thus a common thing that people writing ; code against htsjdk need to anticipate.; So if you go this way you should update the SAMRecord documentation to ; clearly indicate that SAMRecords can be in either a headerless or ; non-headerless (headerful?) state; and indicate how each API function is affected by this.

Third, although I don't know in detail about the different execution ; environments you are trying to support, there is a general strategy that ; I haven't seen discussed in these threads.; Perhaps it's impractical, but I'll mention it anyway.
