Note that the default flags for 'Debug' build are empty (on purpose, because compile flags are controlled by the package manager), and that this makes a string substitution command fail, likely because of lack of quoting some variable. I set `asserts` to `OFF` in the command line, though. Ideally, if something is exposed as an option to users, like `-Dasserts=ON` is, and it's set to `OFF` on the command line, it should not be altered by the build system, as that is surprising behavior. In any case, empty default flags (or even build type) is not something that should break configuration. Note that in multi-configuration generators, `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is *always* empty, so the build system cannot assume it has any value.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8193:5382,expose,exposed,5382,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8193,1,['expose'],['exposed']

Security,"of `cling::evaluate` (underlying) seems to proliferate b/c of RDataFrame, it is also directly relevant to ROOT usage. The issue is that although names such as `TCling::Calc()` and `cling::evaluate` suggest these can be used for dynamic evaluation of C++ code, they are in fact not insulated one-offs of evaluating the code in some context. They introduce code and leak (they even leak beyond the basic introduction of more code). There also does not appear any alternative that does provide the one-off behavior that the name `Calc` suggests. Start on the ROOT side, with `TCling::Calc` (and `ProcessLine` etc.). If the Cling evaluation returns something non-void, a `cling::Value` is stored in `fTemporaries`, which is destroyed on application shutdown. This behavior means that a developer using these functions will see their code leak (and application crash if it runs out of memory), but leak checkers will report nothing. Pretty bad in itself, in particular since the developer can't do anything about it (there is no reset or access to `pop_back` on `fTemporaries`). A better implementation would transfer ownership responsibilities to the caller, if so desired. Also, the code only checks for `valRef.isVoid()`, whereas integer types with sizes smaller than that of `long` can be returned without a need to store the `cling::Value`. (Aside, the final cast to `long` rather than to e.g. `intptr_t` means that this code breaks many applications on Win64.). Next, `cling::evaluate` leaves a transaction behind. This is a good chunk of the leak, albeit not all. Using `unload(1)` one can get rid of the transaction, but there appears to be no way to indicate that the transaction should not be committed in the first place. The code also does not work with transaction RAIIs and there is no way to tell `evaluate` that the caller-side wants to take over the transaction. Finally, beyond temporaries and left-behind leaks, there is still another leak (in fact, the major part) unaccounted for that",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7201:1165,access,access,1165,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7201,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"on scripts (faiing.sh): [mwe.tar.gz](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/5286101/mwe.tar.gz). The gist is that the event here is a simple class: ; ```. #ifndef _mwe_event_h; #define _mwe_event_h. #include ""TObject.h"" ; #include <array>. class MWEEvent ; {. public: ; MWEEvent() { iev =-1; bar=-1; foo[0] =-1; foo[1]=-1; } . // workaround for not being able to access foo directly ; double get_foo(int i) const { return foo[i]; } . int iev; ; double bar; ; double foo[2]; ; virtual ~MWEEvent() { ; } . ClassDef(MWEEvent,1);; }; ; ```. A tree of these objects can be read with PyROOT fine if only the scalar members are touched, or the getter is used:. ```; import ROOT . ROOT.gSystem.Load(""build/libmwe.so"") . f = ROOT.TFile(""out.root""); ; t = f.Get(""tree""); . ev = ROOT.MWEEvent() . t.SetBranchAddress(""event"",ev) . for i in range(10): ; t.GetEntry(i); ; print (ev.iev) ; print (ev.bar) ; print (ev.get_foo(0)); print (ev.get_foo(1)); ```.

To validate the performance, I ran the [Python tests in roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest/tree/master/python) and the [PyROOT pythonization tests](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/pyroot/pythonizations/test) and compared runtimes with and without the cppyy upgrade. The total runtime of these tests reduced by about 4 % from 208 s to 287 s, so the performance impact of this PR is marginal. The runtime comparison for each test can be found in [cppyy_upgrade_test_runtimes.txt](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/14623432/cppyy_upgrade_test_runtimes.txt).; The worst observed performance penalty is 24 %. However, significant speedups are observed in some of the longer tests.

Security,"other compression algorithms already do this,. Indeed. The diffs was made less obvious because:; ZLIB decompression is already doing the right thing.; ZLIB and LZMA use a struct to pass the configuration rather than function argument so the code pattern is slight different.; ; > it seems that all existing code paths in TKey.cxx, TBufferXML.cxx, TMessage.cxx, and TBasket.cxx allocate a buffer that is slightly larger, so it's probably not an as critical problem . Right, the allocations is done:; ```; Int_t buflen = TMath::Max(512,fKeylen + fObjlen + 9*nbuffers + 28); //add 28 bytes in case object is placed in a deleted gap; ```; and used via; ```; char *bufcur = &fBuffer[fKeylen];; ```; so the only extra is `9*nbuffers + 28` which reduces the risk of writing the end since the size is larger than `fObjlen + kHeaderSize` but that leaves 2 additional question:; * why are those added?; * why doesn't RNTuple need it?. 01bb6965557fcc63d5d2e535b89f57e025922731 hints that the compression engine were seen as writing past the end ... it is plausible since the prior delta was ``9*nbuffers + 8` with `nbuffers==0` is common case. (in hindsight, this commit was not investigated long enough and needed a test). The `9*nbuffers` is meant to be for the keys and is now inaccurate (most algorithms have a 9 bytes header but for lz4 we have seemingly 73. This part is missing from the `RNTuple` usage. The consequences is that on data set that is not compressible `TTree` might use a bit more space (header + barely compressed size) vs `RNTuple` (uncompressed size which might be less than header + barely compressed size).

Security,"place in the existing memory buffers). For example - primitives and lists of primitives are supported; anything needing references are not. Despite the fact many of ROOT's very useful deserialization features are not supported, the limited feature set covers a range of analysis use cases. In particular, the current version of CMS's proposed NanoAOD format can be read solely via bulk APIs. Where the bulk IO APIs are applicable, we see an order-magnitude improvement in event rates for some use cases (including CMS NanoAOD). The speedup becomes more noticeable as the data read from the event is smaller (meaning the traditional ROOT IO overheads are larger). Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5KB objects read per event is the point where bulk IO APIs should be noticeably faster. This PR provides three interfaces:. * A raw, low-level interface. The user can invoke the bulk IO APIs directly and get a buffer of primitive types, serialized or deserialized. It is not envisioned this is used by users, but by API writers.; * A TTreeReader-like interface, TTreeReaderFast. This is meant to be used by users; it utilizes the low-level interface to retrieve the serialized buffer and templated code will inline the deserializing as part of iterating through the tree. The speed here is gained by the fact only a single pass in memory is needed to deserialize and apply user code, rather than two.; * The intent is that this interface can be extended in the future and used by TDataFrame, provided we can make TDataFrame sufficiently fast.; * A Python-based numpy export interface. This exposes the (possibly serialized) memory directly as numpy arrays, allowing for efficient access to ROOT-serialized objects from the Python language.; * The numpy interface is low-level for Python; we intend to further explore the ideal high-level interface through projects such as https://github.com/diana-hep/plur.

Which is identical, except for the if statement `if (ProcessPendingEvents())`, which I have no clue what it does and why Unix is missing it...

Security,"ressions. I discarded that because of two reasons:; - They are more costly that simple string comparison.; - They complicate the registration of pythonizors per scope. In this new `@pythonization` decorator, the scope of the class is parsed (e.g. `NS1::NS2` for `NS1::NS2::C`) and the pythonizor is _registered for that scope_. This allows for more efficient lookup of the pythonizors to apply, because when a class is accessed for the first time, only the pythonizors registered for its scope will be attempted. This is nice for user classes, because if a user class belongs to `UserNamespace`, when the user script first accesses the class only the pythonizors for classes in `UserNamespace` will be tried, and not every single registered pythonizor (in particular, not all the pythonizors ROOT registers for its classes in the global namespace). So I prefer to have a clean static prefix that unambiguously tells me what the target scope is than something like `NS1::(.+)::C`. And if the user wants to do an additional complex matching with regular expressions, they can still do so in their pythonizor code via the `name` parameter. I'd like to hear the opinion of @pikacic and @daritter about this since we've discussed about this decorator in the past (no need to review the whole PR, giving your opinion on the programming examples is already more than enough!). EDIT: I have received some feedback from @eguiraud on the `name` parameter: he thinks it could be removed since some users won't need it (they won't do any further filtering inside the pythonizor). As an alternative, `name` could be injected in `klass` before the user pythonizor runs (so users would access it as `klass.name`), but that could cause a clash if `name` is already a static member of the class. There is also `klass.__cpp_name__` that is provided by cppyy with the fully qualified name of the class, so we could rely on that too. @vepadulano would rather keep `name` as a parameter. I'd like to hear more opinions :)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9128:3849,inject,injected,3849,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9128,2,"['access', 'inject']","['access', 'injected']"

Security,"rootcling performs an integrity check on the headers that are passed; via the command line and the ones we have in the modulemap. As this; check currently fails because we had to split up the Core and Thread,; we signal with a `use` directive that these other modules belong to; the current module. The `use` directive is usually only for signalling that we intend; to use this other module from our module, but as we anyway don't; use `-fmodules-decluse` in ROOT we can just reuse this for telling; rootcling that it should also check the split out submodules when; doing the integrity check for the headers. To give a concrete example: `ThreadLocalStorage` had to split; out of `Thread` to fix a cycle between `Core` and `Thread`.; However, rootcling now doesn't see the ThreadLocalStorage headers; in the `Thread` module but we pass them to the rootcling invocation; for `Thread`. This adds a `use ThreadLocalStorage` to Thread and; lets rootcling also iterate all `use`'d other modules when doing; this check, so we again have the full set of modules here.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1458:22,integrity,integrity,22,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1458,2,['integrity'],['integrity']

Expected behavior is for ROOT to realize the branch address has been changed to nullptr and create an internal buffer, not read from the freed memory area. Interestingly it doesn't seem to have a problem without calling `SetAddress` as it then realizes it points to nullptr and will create a new object and modify `f`. ### To Reproduce. Run the above with ROOT compiled with `-Dasan=ON`. ### Setup. * ROOT 6.24.0; * GCC 10.2; * Ubuntu 18.04. ### Additional context. We didn't see this with ROOT 6.20 but I also did not specifically test it with address sanitizer so it might have been there already and just not cause any problems. <!--; Add any other context about the problem here.; -->",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8027:5050,sanitiz,sanitizer,5050,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8027,1,['sanitiz'],['sanitizer']

Security,"s of problems does CodeQL find?; The CodeQL engine that powers GitHub code scanning is the exact same engine that powers LGTM.com. The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs) for you. #### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?; No need! New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version. #### The analysis doesn’t seem to be working; If you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn’t able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow) to debug the analysis. #### How do I disable LGTM.com?; If you have LGTM’s automatic pull request analysis enabled, then you can [follow these steps to disable the LGTM pull request analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/managing-automated-code-review#disabling-pr-integration). You don’t actually need to remove your repository from LGTM.com; it will automatically be removed in the next few months as part of the deprecation of LGTM.com ([more info here](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/)). #### Which source code hosting platforms does code scanning support?; GitHub code scanning is deeply integrated within GitHub itself. If you’d like to scan source code that is hosted elsewhere, we suggest that you create a mirror of that code on GitHub. #### How do I know this PR is legitimate?; This PR is filed by the official LGTM.com GitHub App, in line with the [deprecation timeline that was announ",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11808:3634,secur,security,3634,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11808,1,['secur'],['security']

To validate the performance, I ran the [Python tests in roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest/tree/master/python) and the [PyROOT pythonization tests](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/pyroot/pythonizations/test) and compared runtimes with and without the cppyy upgrade. The total runtime of these tests reduced by about 4 % from 208 s to 287 s, so the performance impact of this PR is marginal. The runtime comparison for each test can be found in [cppyy_upgrade_test_runtimes.txt](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/14623432/cppyy_upgrade_test_runtimes.txt).; The worst observed performance penalty is 24 %. However, significant speedups are observed in some of the longer tests. For convenience, the 20 tests with the longest runtime are listed here:; ```; title no_cppyy_upgrade cppyy_upgrade ratio; python-regression-regression 32.61 34.30 1.051825; pyroot-pyz-rdataframe-asnumpy 14.30 14.61 1.021678; pyroot-pyz-rdataframe-makenumpy 13",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14507:2724,validat,validation,2724,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14507,1,['validat'],['validation']

Security,"sted it before opening this pull request, so all should be working :heavy_check_mark:. In fact, you might already have seen some alerts appear on this pull request!. Where needed and if possible, we’ve adjusted the configuration to the needs of your particular repository. But of course, you should feel free to tweak it further! Check [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#editing-a-code-scanning-workflow) for detailed documentation. Questions? Check out the FAQ below!. ### FAQ; <details>; <summary>Click here to expand the FAQ section</summary>. #### How often will the code scanning analysis run?; By default, code scanning will trigger a scan with the CodeQL engine on the following events:; * On every pull request — to flag up potential security problems for you to investigate before merging a PR.; * On every push to your default branch and other protected branches — this keeps the analysis results on your repository’s *Security* tab up to date.; * Once a week at a fixed time — to make sure you benefit from the latest updated security analysis even when no code was committed or PRs were opened. #### What will this cost?; Nothing! The CodeQL engine will run inside GitHub Actions, making use of your [unlimited free compute minutes for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#about-billing-for-github-actions). #### What types of problems does CodeQL find?; The CodeQL engine that powers GitHub code scanning is the exact same engine that powers LGTM.com. The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-s",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11808:2216,Secur,Security,2216,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11808,1,['Secur'],['Security']

ROOT version: 6.28/02; 2. Operating system: MacOS (but the same happens on lxplus); 3. How you obtained ROOT: macports (but the same happens on lxplus). ### Additional context. I would be glad to learn if there is a more efficient way of saving RooDataSet into a TTree.

Security,"t you enable code scanning on your repository. Please take a look at our [blog post for more information](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/). This pull request enables code scanning by adding an auto-generated [`codeql.yml` workflow file for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-manually) to your repository — take a look! We tested it before opening this pull request, so all should be working :heavy_check_mark:. In fact, you might already have seen some alerts appear on this pull request!. Where needed and if possible, we’ve adjusted the configuration to the needs of your particular repository. But of course, you should feel free to tweak it further! Check [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#editing-a-code-scanning-workflow) for detailed documentation. Questions? Check out the FAQ below!. ### FAQ; <details>; <summary>Click here to expand the FAQ section</summary>. #### How often will the code scanning analysis run?; By default, code scanning will trigger a scan with the CodeQL engine on the following events:; * On every pull request — to flag up potential security problems for you to investigate before merging a PR.; * On every push to your default branch and other protected branches — this keeps the analysis results on your repository’s *Security* tab up to date.; * Once a week at a fixed time — to make sure you benefit from the latest updated security analysis even when no code was committed or PRs were opened. #### What will this cost?; Nothing!

Security,"ter (similar to how `TApplication` ignores `argc` and `argv` if `numOptions==-1`), but that is certainly not a design pattern leading to modern, readable code, so better not spread it more ;-). ; `failOnUnknownArgs` sounds like a great choice of name, it clarifies the intent clearly. . > It would be wonderful to have that as unit test in `core/rint/test` [...]. It seems this does already exist, and has a unit test checking that errors are producted by `TRint` if unrecognitzed options are encountered ;-). Still, it seems I lack sufficient experience with `gtest`, since I don't understand why (for example) `TRint` with unsupported arguments does not `Terminate()` the test — so it's unclear to me how to write a test checking that it does not actually try to `Terminate()` when provided with a to-be-added `failOnUnknownArgs = false`. . In pseudo-steps, I think possible changes / additions to the existing test in `core/rint/test/TRintTests.cxx` to cover the use case as completely as possible could be:; 1. The existing test should be changed to set `failOnUnknownArgs = true` (after that is implemented). ; 2. A second test could be added, not setting `failOnUnknownArgs` (i.e. the default of `false` is used). This test then needs to check that no `stderr` is produced, and `Terminate()` is not called (here I'm unsure how to do these with `gtest`). ; 3. A third test could try to do the following, for complete coverage of the use case:; i. Create a `TRint (let's name it `myApp for simplicity here)`, passing in supported and unsupported options. ; ii. Check the unsupported options are accessible via `myApp->Argv()`. ; iii. Call `myApp`->Run(kTRUE)`, inject `.q` via `stdin` and test that the execution flow returns to after that line. . Does that sound reasonable? ; Since I am slightly at a loss on how to solve these ideas within `gtest`, I would be fine with going the back and forth approach (learning more `gtest` along the way so I can better contribute tests in the future) ;-).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10090#issuecomment-1064634456:2044,access,accessible,2044,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10090#issuecomment-1064634456,2,"['access', 'inject']","['accessible', 'inject']"

Security,"the limited feature set covers a range of analysis use cases. In particular, the current version of CMS's proposed NanoAOD format can be read solely via bulk APIs. Where the bulk IO APIs are applicable, we see an order-magnitude improvement in event rates for some use cases (including CMS NanoAOD). The speedup becomes more noticeable as the data read from the event is smaller (meaning the traditional ROOT IO overheads are larger). Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5KB objects read per event is the point where bulk IO APIs should be noticeably faster. This PR provides three interfaces:; - A raw, low-level interface. The user can invoke the bulk IO APIs directly and get a buffer of primitive types, serialized or deserialized. It is not envisioned this is used by users, but by API writers.; - A `TTreeReader`-like interface, `TTreeReaderFast`. This is meant to be used by users; it utilizes the low-level interface to retrieve the serialized buffer and templated code will inline the deserializing as part of iterating through the tree. The speed here is gained by the fact only a single pass in memory is needed to deserialize *and* apply user code, rather than two.; - The intent is that this interface can be extended in the future and used by `TDataFrame`, provided we can make `TDataFrame` sufficiently fast.; - A Python-based `numpy` export interface. This exposes the (possibly serialized) memory directly as numpy arrays, allowing for efficient access to ROOT-serialized objects from the Python language.; - The `numpy` interface is low-level for Python; we intend to further explore the ideal high-level interface through projects such as https://github.com/diana-hep/plur. So indeed, lot's of experimental / internal interface work here - but we felt that (a) a sufficient amount depends on this and (b) we've demonstrated enough utility that it was time to start talking about merging. (With many thanks to @jpivarski for driving this work home with his work on a python interface!)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/943:1965,expose,exposes,1965,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/943,2,"['access', 'expose']","['access', 'exposes']"

Security,"ull request!. Where needed and if possible, we’ve adjusted the configuration to the needs of your particular repository. But of course, you should feel free to tweak it further! Check [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#editing-a-code-scanning-workflow) for detailed documentation. Questions? Check out the FAQ below!. ### FAQ; <details>; <summary>Click here to expand the FAQ section</summary>. #### How often will the code scanning analysis run?; By default, code scanning will trigger a scan with the CodeQL engine on the following events:; * On every pull request — to flag up potential security problems for you to investigate before merging a PR.; * On every push to your default branch and other protected branches — this keeps the analysis results on your repository’s *Security* tab up to date.; * Once a week at a fixed time — to make sure you benefit from the latest updated security analysis even when no code was committed or PRs were opened. #### What will this cost?; Nothing! The CodeQL engine will run inside GitHub Actions, making use of your [unlimited free compute minutes for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#about-billing-for-github-actions). #### What types of problems does CodeQL find?; The CodeQL engine that powers GitHub code scanning is the exact same engine that powers LGTM.com. The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs) for you. #### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?; No need!

Security,"ur issue. If you find one, you are very welcome to add to the existing report, for instance ""issue still exists in today's master"".; -->. ### Describe the bug; <!--; A clear and concise description of what the wrong behavior is.; -->; When changing the compression settings using hadd, using the same compression level used by the input file won't trigger a recompression of the branches in the output file, even with a different algorithm. ie. Passing -f301 with a 101 compressed input file results in a ""301"" compressed file but with 101 compressed branches. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->; I would expect the output file's branches to be recompressed with the provided compression algorithm. ie. Passing -f301 with a 101 compressed input file results in a genuine 301 compressed file with 301 compressed branches. ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves.; 2. Don't forget to attach the required input files!; 3. How to run your code and / or build it, e.g. `root myMacro.C`, ...; -->. 1. Get the compression settings of any .root file, for example the 101 compressed [dimuon dataset](http://opendata.web.cern.ch/record/12341).; 2. Run `hadd` and change the compression to a different algorithm of the same level, for example 101 -> 201 or 403 -> 303:; `hadd -f201 fake_dimuon_201.root orig_dimuon_101.root`; 3. You can validate the weird behaviour by performing an intermediate conversion:; `hadd -f202 real_202_out.root orig_dimuon_101.root` -> `hadd -f201 real_dimuon_201.root real_dimuon_202.root`. ### Setup; <!--; 1. ROOT version; 2. Operating system; 3. How you obtained ROOT, such as `dnf install` / binary download / you built it yourself.; -->; 1. ROOT Version 6.27/01; 2. Linux CentOS 8 + Linux Debian 11; 3.

Security,"ustrate the problem, I take a bin size of 5 GeV (else the problem will not appear, which appears to be normal due to the technical explanation given in the attachement). *The nll is computed by roofit, with two methods that give the same result (probably they use the same internal function). *The nll is computed ""by hand"" :; -I could reproduce exactly the value of nll of roofit if I ""forget"" to multiply the pdf by the bin size *only in the sum part* of the likelihood formula. -If I compute it in what I think is ""correct"", I could not find the value obtain by roofit. Hypothesis of explanation : createNLL does not anticipate the possibility of binned pdf. More details : pdf : 3 slides; [Minimum_Problem_NLL.pdf](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/6383379/Minimum_Problem_NLL.pdf). A minimum reproducible example is given here :; /afs/cern.ch/work/e/escalier/public/ForOthers/ForRootExperts/ProblemNLL. (github prevents to attach a .C file : it would be useful to authorize it if we wish to keep persistent minimum examples for the future). Remark : the anomaly would not have consequence for the result of a fit. But if the bin size would be variable, maybe there would be (I don't know). Anyway, there is incompatibility of treatment of the bin size for the total of the pdf and the value of pdf in a given bin. ### Expected behavior; the expected value is given in the example : roofit does not find the mathematical correct value because it forgets to multiply by the bin size for the ""sum part"" (while it does not forget to multiply by the bin size for the ""total prediction"" part. ### To Reproduce; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves. a) put : do_mistake_computation_find_official_roofit_value=1 for reproducing the result of roofit. b) put do_mistake_computation_find_official_roofit_value=0 for reproducing what I think is the correct value (different to the one of roofit). 3.

Security,"w singleton class Dyld part of the cling's DynamicLibraryManager. The new dyld is responsible for:; * Symlink resolution -- it implements a memory efficient representation of; the full path to shared objects allowing search at constant time O(1). This; also fixes issues when resolving symbols from OSX where the system libraries; contain multiple levels of symlinks.; * Bloom filter optimization -- it uses a stohastic data structure which gives; a definitive answer if a symbol is not in the set. The implementation checks; the .gnu.hash section in ELF which is the GNU implementation of a bloom; filter and uses it. If the symbol is not in the bloom filter, the; implementation builds its own and uses it. The measured performance of the; bloom filter is 30% speed up for 2mb more memory. The custom bloom filter on; top of the .gnu.hash filter gives 1-2% better performance.; The advantage for the custom bloom filter is that it works on all; implementations which do not support .gnu.hash (windows and osx). It is also; customizable if we want to further reduce the false positive rates; (currently at p=2%).; * Hash table optimization -- we build a hash table which contains all symbols; for a given library. This allows us to avoid the fallback symbol iteration; if multiple symbols from the same library are requested. The hash table; optimization targets to optimize the case where the bloom filter tells us; the symbol is *maybe* in the library. Patch by Alexander Penev (@alexander-penev) and me!.

Security,"zation -- it uses a stohastic data structure which gives; a definitive answer if a symbol is not in the set. The implementation checks; the .gnu.hash section in ELF which is the GNU implementation of a bloom; filter and uses it. If the symbol is not in the bloom filter, the; implementation builds its own and uses it. The measured performance of the; bloom filter is 30% speed up for 2mb more memory. The custom bloom filter on; top of the .gnu.hash filter gives 1-2% better performance.; The advantage for the custom bloom filter is that it works on all; implementations which do not support .gnu.hash (windows and osx). It is also; customizable if we want to further reduce the false positive rates; (currently at p=2%).; * Hash table optimization -- we build a hash table which contains all symbols; for a given library. This allows us to avoid the fallback symbol iteration; if multiple symbols from the same library are requested. The hash table; optimization targets to optimize the case where the bloom filter tells us; the symbol is *maybe* in the library. Patch by Alexander Penev (@alexander-penev) and me!.

That access itself happens in a fairly complicated way itself, in this helper code:. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/athena/-/blob/master/Control/xAODRootAccess/python/GenerateDVIterators.py.

The unique_ptr is used to automatically manage ownership.; - The key is not the name of the branch as known by the branch any more but rather the name the user inputs in the constructor of the TTreeReader{Array,Value}.; - An exception is thrown in debug mode if the system tries to push in the TTreeReader collection of proxy with a name held by a proxy in that collection.; - The methods of TTreeReader were adapted to use this new container as well as the code in TTreeReaderValue and TTreeReaderArray.

Security,"🤔 Just to understand, is it a known real leak or a false positive?. I initially thought it was something we in any case could not fix on our side and I also suppressed the sanitiser leak as described [here](https://gitlab.ep1.rub.de/fp311online/cern-root/-/tree/v6-22-08-ep1/core/sanitizer?ref_type=heads) (not sure this is an official documentation, but it's something google brought to my attention). In particular I added; ```; cd root_install/etc/; printf '\n#Full libCling for SMASH\nleak:libCling\n' >> lsan-root.supp; ```; together with; ```dockerfile; # This will let sanitizer suppress leaks according to suppressions file list of patterns; ENV LSAN_OPTIONS=""suppressions=${ROOTSYS}/etc/lsan-root.supp:print_suppressions=0""; ```; to my Dockerfile. Doing so, all the unit tests pass, but I then monitored memory usage over a long run of our application and a linear growth was evident (plot left below). Nothing extreme, sure, but I thought it was worth reporting, especially since in `v6.26.10` the problem does not occur (plot right below). 🤷‍♂️ . <div align=""center"">. <img src=""https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/13135070/ca744a83-51ca-4143-ba20-bf481e60c6b8"" width=""360"" />; <img src=""https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/13135070/a68a2ced-a04f-4698-a0e0-a72cf6dd9d1d"" width=""355"" />. </div>",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14055#issuecomment-1814642915:280,sanitiz,sanitizer,280,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14055#issuecomment-1814642915,2,['sanitiz'],['sanitizer']

I suggest enabling SIMD on at least one of the CI builds in Jenkins to cover that if that's not the case now. ; * The test `roottest-root-tree-cache-perfstattest-libevent-build` and some others fail because of a build type not being set (I just set `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` and not `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, which should be a valid configuration). It's fine to require setting a build type for testing, but having a fallback for when it's not set is probably better. In CI a build type is usually set, so you won't see these failures in Jenkins.; * Some of the other tests fail due to `unresolved while linking` errors from cling, which could be something related to the `-fPIE` fixes.; * The test loadAllLibs may fail if `Loading library libVMCLibrary.so [rc = -1]` shows in the output, which can happen if VMC is installed as a separate package somewhere. Having VMC installed can also make other tests fail as well, as it will try to load wrong ROOT libraries from another build. I had to uninstall both ROOT and VMC on my machine to be able to run the tests, which is not great. I think it is a good idea to have ROOT (and maybe VMC) installed with yum on at least one of the build nodes to ensure this sort of problem doesn't happ",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9436:2512,test,test,2512,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9436,1,['test'],['test']

Patch tested locally based on ROOT v6.26.10 under Debian 12 (as far as I can tell this part of the file was not changed since the initial commit so the ROOT version should not matter).; The one thing where I am unsure is whether the calculated size (`tsize`) should be printed in hexadecimal (as it is offseted by multiple bits) or as standard integer. **Effect:**; In our case it allowed to find out that the automatic calculation of the TextSize value provided to the call was getting haywire due to a too small canvas (1x1 pixel), leading to large or negative values for `tsize`, maybe due to slightly different floating point calculations in Debian12. ### ROOT version. At least `v6.22` to `v6.26.10` but corresponding block seems unchanged since the initial commit in 2003, local compilation test on `master` worked. ### Installation method. Build from Source within FairSoft (v6.22 and v6.26), Build from source standalone (master). ### Operating system.

When ROOT is compiled with python3.8/3.9, running the following (in both compiled code and interactively):; ; const char * b = (const char*) TPython::Eval(""'done'"");. leads to following error:. input_line_29:74:12: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers; TPyReturn isascii() {; ~~~~~~~~~ ^; /usr/include/ctype.h:234:22: note: expanded from macro 'isascii'; # define isascii(c) __isascii (c); ^; .; .; . ; (const char *) nullptr.

In the use case you show, there should be not practical difference as the filename should be strictly the same before and after the expand.

Why would that be?. Good question, and I'm not sure. This seems to be a problem with EOS (see below). @apeters1971 Do you know what could cause this? To reproduce, all you need is to copy a file with a different name, then call `getfattr` on it and it will return the wrong URL, at least the first time (but potentially several times):. ```bash; $ cp hsimple.root mytest.root; $ getfattr -n eos.url.xroot hsimple.root && getfattr -n eos.url.xroot mytest.root; # file: hsimple.root; eos.url.xroot=""root://eoshome-a.cern.ch//eos/user/a/amadio/hsimple.root"". # file: mytest.root; eos.url.xroot=""root://eoshome-a.cern.ch/""; ```. So I guess we *could* move the code after the expansion after all, as the problem is not coming from ROOT, but from EOS.

Testability," GPUs or in autograd enabled frameworks. The commit history also contains the proof of concept version, the benchmark results of which were presented at [ACAT19](https://indico.cern.ch/event/708041/contributions/3276177/) and [CHEP19](https://doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/202024506027) (and [preliminary results at the 2018 ROOT Users workshop in Sarajevo](https://indico.cern.ch/event/697389/contributions/3062028/)). That version was redesigned starting from 2019 to better integrate with the rest of the code and at the same time untangle the test statistics classes to conceptually bring them closer to the math, instead of the more implementation-detail oriented existing design (RooAbsTestStatistic et al.). The new packages include the following tests, which should probably still be added to the testing infrastructure somehow:. 1. MultiProcess:; 1. test_RooFitMultiProcess_Messenger; 2. test_RooFitMultiProcess_ProcessManager; 3. test_RooFitMultiProcess_Job; 2. TestStatistics:; 1. testLikelihoodGradientJob; 2. testLikelihoodSerial; 3. testRooRealL; 3. RooFitZMQ:; 1. test_RooFitZMQ; 2. test_RooFitZMQ_polling; 3. test_RooFitZMQ_HWM; 4. test_RooFitZMQ_load_balancing; 4. RooFitCore:; 1. testRooGradMinimizer; 2. testBidirMMapPipe; 3. testMPFEnll. From my side (and that of the NL eScience Center), the project has ended and time has run out to make any further major contributions to it, except, of course finishing this PR and providing help to get it working and to possibly hand over further development :). Here are some notes for possible future work:; - RooFitZMQ includes an extension of ZeroMQ itself: a ppoll function. This function should ideally be contributed to ZeroMQ, but I have had no time for this. The motivation behind ppoll is given in this [blog post](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/combining-zeromq-posix-signals-b754f6f29cd6).; - At the last moment, I decided to reimplement part of the Queue functionality.

Testability," This cause it to get stuck when one of them contains a huge amount of files and directories. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->; `TBrowser` is opened smoothly without being overwhelmed by the upstream folders. Possible solutions include:; * Provide an option not to follow the symlink; * Provide an option to specify the number of super-directory to show. These solution would require changes of User Interface or even the TBrowser API, but it might be useful when moving the files to somewhere with thinner directory tree is inconvenient/impossible. ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves.; 2. Don't forget to attach the required input files!; 3. How to run your code and / or build it, e.g. `root myMacro.C`, ...; -->; Easy:. 1. `cd` into a temporary directory (`/dev/shm` would be convenient); 2. ```bash; mkdir testdir; cd testdir; for i in {1..100000}; do mkdir $i; done; cd 50000; cp /path/to/root/tutorial/hsimple.root .; root; ```; 3. Inside the ROOT interpreter,; ```ROOT; TBrowser tb; ```. Practical:; 1. Install [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/) by executing the installation script, by setting up a NixOS, or by using the docker image.; 2. Fill `/nix/store` with packages by installing packages, `nix-shell` or `nix-build`; 2. Install ROOT by `nix-env -iA root`; 3. ```bash; cd ~/.nix-profile/tutorials; root; ```; 4. Inside the ROOT interpreter; ```ROOT; TBrowser tb; ```; 5. Since the `tutorials` is a symlink to `/nix/store/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-root-6.18.04/tutorials`, `TBrowser` will follow the symlink, try to expand `/nix/store` (where all the packages are stored), and get stuck there.; ### Setup; <!--; 1.

Testability," `hist2workspace` to try to identify the issues. I found out that the executable cannot read the XML files produced if it contains `&` and `<` or `>` as these are not valid XML characters and need to be escaped. So e.g. if the top level XML contains function like this:; ```; <Function Name=""morph_topWidth_0.700000"" Expression=""(0.+(((topWidth-0.700000)>=0)&&(fabs(topWidth-0.700000)<0.300000))*(1.-(fabs(topWidth-0.700000))/0.300000))"" Dependents=""topWidth[0.700000,0.700000,2.000000]"" />; ```; The `hist2workspace` executable will complain that it cannot parse the XML. I tried replacing the problematic characters with the XML replacements like `&gt;` etc. This makes the `hist2workspace` code run and it generates the workspace. However, if I try to replace the characters in the same way for the string passed to AddPrepropcessFunction, it doesnt parse the string and complains:; ```; input_line_48:2:89: error: use of undeclared identifier 'gt'; Double_t TFormula____id12625155560414669645(Double_t *x){ return (0.+(((x[0]-0.700000)&{gt;}=0)&#38;&#38;(fabs(x[0]-0.700000)&{lt;0.300000}))*(1.-(fabs(x[0]-0.700000))/0.300000)) ; }; ^; ```. I am not 100% sure these two issue - crash in the `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` code and the XML parsing are related, but I think they could be. . ### Expected behavior; The code should not crash when calling `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` as was the case in ROOT 6.24.06. The XML generated should be a valid XML that can be processed with histo2workspace. ### To Reproduce; Adding any Expression to the top level XML file that contains characters like `&`, `<` breaks histo2workpace and it seems that using formuale containing these characters in `AddPrepropcessFunction` crashes `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast`. ### Setup; 1. ROOT 6.26.04, but the histo2workspace issue not being able to read ther XML file is there also (at least) in 6.24.06; 2. CentOS7 (lxplus), tested with gcc8 and gcc11; 3.

Testability," a symbolic link without the dot ; ; 		$ make clean; 		$ make LIBDIR=.libs ; 		$ ln -s .libs libs; 		$ make test LIBDIR=libs; 	 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libs:<ROOTSYS>/lib root -l -b -q Test.C; 		 ; In all cases, ROOT complains as above. If the dot is _not_ at the; start of a path component (e.g., `LIBDIR=foo.libs`), then all is; fine. . So it seems that somewhere deep in the ROOT code, there is some; assumption about a dot (`.`) as the leading character of a; sub-directory name which shouldn't be there. As far as I can tell,; the dot makes the code think that the library loaded is the ROOT; executable (`<ROOTSYS>/bin/root.exe`) rather than the actual shared; library. The reason seems to be that, because of some bad stripping; of path components, the shared library isn't found by Cling and then; the binary image falls back to the executable binary image. . ## Why this is problematic . Many build tools (e.g., Autotools) uses temporary directories that; start with a dot (`.`), including for building examples and tests. The; current behaviour of ROOT prevents building production level packages; with these tools that has rigorous test suites and rich examples. . More than that, ROOT should not assume _anything_ given a path _name_.; Rather, it should use system tools to detect if a given path is a; directory, a file, or what not. File and directory names are; completely volatile and proper tools should be used to deduct what it; is the code is dealing with. ## Additional tests .

Testability," adapter classes in Minuit2.; 3. In RooFit:; 1. Most RooMinimizerFcn functionality was moved into an abstract base class RooAbsMinimizerFcn, which in turn forms the base class of the new RooMinimizerFcn, but also of the added RooGradMinimizerFcn (serial, but gradient external to Minuit2) and MinuitFcnGrad (with parallel MultiProcess back-end) classes.; 2. The RooRealMPFE based classes can make use of an added parameter `CPUAffinity`. In Unix systems (not macOS), this makes the MPFE based parallelization a lot faster by pinning processes to physical CPU cores.; 3. To accomodate the new minimization frameworks, RooMinimizer was changed quite a bit as well. It is still backwards compatible, but the new functionality can be accessed through a new `create` template factory function. This template function allows users to pass in their own calculation back-ends, e.g. for calculating on GPUs or in autograd enabled frameworks. The commit history also contains the proof of concept version, the benchmark results of which were presented at [ACAT19](https://indico.cern.ch/event/708041/contributions/3276177/) and [CHEP19](https://doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/202024506027) (and [preliminary results at the 2018 ROOT Users workshop in Sarajevo](https://indico.cern.ch/event/697389/contributions/3062028/)). That version was redesigned starting from 2019 to better integrate with the rest of the code and at the same time untangle the test statistics classes to conceptually bring them closer to the math, instead of the more implementation-detail oriented existing design (RooAbsTestStatistic et al.). The new packages include the following tests, which should probably still be added to the testing infrastructure somehow:. 1.

Testability," any supported C++ type, including `std::variant<Ts...>` and collections such as `std::vector<T>`. ## Changes or fixes:; - Allow for including the index of the first element in a column in the column description. This introduces the column flag `kFlagDeferredColumn` which specifies that the column has no on-disk data for elements preceding the given element index.; - `RPageSink::UpdateSchema()` now takes an additional argument (firstEntry) that specifies the first entry that stores an on-disk value for the fields in the changeset. The entry index is translated to column element index by `EntryToColumnElementIndex()`.; - `RPage::MakePageZero()`: this function returns a page that is comprised of `0x00` bytes only.; - Introduce locator type `kTypePageZero`. This locator type represents unmaterialized (i.e., in-memory only) zero pages for deferred columns.; - Add `RPageRange::ExtendToFitColumnRange()`: this function extends a RPageRange to fit the given RColumnRange, i.e. prepend as many synthetic `RPageInfo`s as needed to cover the entire range. `RPageInfo`s are constructed to contain as many elements given a page size limit in bytes; the locator for the referenced pages is `kPageZero`.; This function is used to make up `RPageRange`s for clusters that contain deferred columns.; - Add `RClusterDescriptorBuilder::AddDeferredColumnRanges()`, which makes up `RColumnRange` and `RPageRange`s that make sense for deferred columns that are otherwise missing in a cluster.; - RPageStorageFile: add ability to populate the zero page from `kTypePageZero` locators.; - RVariantField: allow reading values with dispatch `tag == 0`. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary); - [x] RPageStorageDaos: populate the zero page from `kTypePageZero` locators. (for a follow-up PR?); - [x] Possible optimization: `UnsealPage()` should be a no-op for zero pages; this is to be handled in PR https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12279.

Testability," as providing a finer grained control over the information deserialization. We see no observable benefits in generating RDICT files next to our pcm files. . ## Performance results. We have run several times all tests in `roottest/io` and `roottest/meta/MakeProject` folders and compared the results with and without generating RDICT (namely with ROOT master with `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` with and without this PR). They are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y_swct0USyX1DMp0tJOPdZzvmvIOTXOS9s7n08wCb2I/edit?usp=sharing) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s5LbPmhGBfhimirA0GH87nyEKcrGUfCX80H7-fOrjAU/edit?usp=sharing). ### Methodology. We have a forwarding `root.exe` which essentially calls `/usr/bin/time -v root.exe $@`. We have processed and stored this information in csv files. We have run in:; * (no)dict1-cold -- Tests are run immediately after restarting the physical test machine.; * (no)dict1a-cold -- Tests are run immediately after restarting the physical test machine. Second time.; * (no)dict2 -- Tests are run once again after running (no)dict1-cold;; * (no)dict3 -- Tests are run once again after running (no)dict2;; * (no)dict4 -- Tests are run once again after running (no)dict3;; * (no)dict5 -- Tests are run once again after running (no)dict4. The values of each column in (no)dict* are the sum of each value produced after running each test under roottest/io. The average values are computed in the columns under `dict` and `nodict`. The difference is shown in `diff`. There are two known test failures wrt to modules whose values are ignored. The machine specification is `Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-7100 CPU @ 3.90GHz` dual core, 8GB RAM and a **HDD**, run on Ubuntu 18.04. ### Results Interpretation. RDICT mostly intend to reduce the memory footprint during IO. We see no direct benefits in the memory footprint. The average of the max RSS of the sum of the max RSS of every test is higher. There is also a tendency towards faster execution.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3012:1428,Test,Tests,1428,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/3012,7,"['Test', 'test']","['Tests', 'test']"

Read the RNTuple (this will create a `cachedntuple.root` file); ```cpp; void read_ntuple(); {; std::string_view ntuplename{""myntuple""};; std::string_view filename{""myntuple.root""};; auto ntuple = RNTupleReader::Open(ntuplename, filename);. for (auto entryid: *ntuple){; ntuple->LoadEntry(entryid);; }; }; ```; ### 3.

Testability," benchmarking the change I discovered something fascinating.; This simple benchmark only tests retrieval of a custom column:; ```c++; TDataFrame d(1000000000ull);; d.Define(""ans"", [] { return 42; }); .Foreach([](int) {}, {""ans""});; ```. The relevant code path that changes between master and this PR is the following:; ```patch; T &TColumnValue<T>::Get(Long64_t entry); {; - if (!fReaderValues.empty()) {; - return *(fReaderValues.back()->Get());; - } else {; - fCustomColumns.back()->Update(fSlot, entry);; - return fIsDataSourceColumn ? **fDSValuePtrs.back() : *fCustomValuePtrs.back();; + switch (fColumnKind) {; + case EColumnKind::kTreeArray: /*dealt with in the other `Get` overload*/; + case EColumnKind::kTreeValue: return *(fReaderValues.back()->Get());; + case EColumnKind::kCustomColumn: fCustomColumns.back()->Update(fSlot, entry); return *fCustomValuePtrs.back();; + case EColumnKind::kDataSource: fCustomColumns.back()->Update(fSlot, entry); return **fDSValuePtrs.back();; }; +; ```; Looks _faster_ right?. On my workstation `perf stat` yields the following instruction counts and runtimes (single-thread executable compiled with `-g -O2`):; ```; # MASTER; 99,494,923,915 instructions:u; 9.844 seconds. # PR; 103,495,337,205 instructions:u; 11.049 seconds; ```. The `switch-case` is sensibly slower and results in more cpu instructions than the `if-else` over `std::vector::empty` on this artificial yet very representative benchmark. I thought this might have been a cache-friendliness issue and was almost ready to give up on this PR, but luckily plotting stacktraces showed that the culprit is inlining:. **MASTER**; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10999034/30910728-3b607ff4-a386-11e7-928e-6a404a485cf6.png). **PR**; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10999034/30910790-7f808562-a386-11e7-90f9-f1417c712f86.png).

I looked a little bit in the code with the gdb and found out, where the application crashes. In `IncrementalCUDADeviceCompiler::generatePTX()` the line `llvm::Module* module = m_PTX_interp->getLastTransaction()->getModule();` returns a `nullptr`. But this only happens, if I define a Cuda `__global__` kernel. If use a normal C++ statement, like `int i = 3;` or define a Cuda `__device__` function everything is fine.

Testability," code. Examples could be . - Input and output of HEPData data. For example, one may want to read in some table via JSON and visualize, or one has produced a result one wants to upload to HEPData ; - Interoperability with Python. Python has support for many data format - not least JSON. . The attached class `TJSON` allows for this in a relatively straight forward manner. For example, one can do . ```c++; TJSON null;; TJSON b(true);; TJSON s(""RawString"");; TJSON s2(std::string(""C++String""));; TJSON i(42);; TJSON f(3.14);; TJSON a = TJSON::Array();; TJSON o = TJSON::Object();; ```; for null, boolean, string, numbers (int and float), arrays or objects (associative container). . A more complex object can be created like . ```c++ ; TJSON o2 = std::map<std::string,TJSON>{; {""key1"",""value""},; {""key2"",true},; {""key3"",; {""key4"", TJSON::Array(""This"",""is"",""an"",""array""),; ""key5"",; {""boolean"", true}; }; }; };; ```. and elements are accessed via `operator[]` . ```c++; assert o2[""key1""] == ""value"";; assert o2[""key3""][""key4""][1] == ""is""; ```. One can loop over arrays or objects via `TJSON::ArrayRange` or `TJSON::ObjectRange` respectively. . ```c++; TJSON a = TJSON::Array();; TJSON o = TJSON::Object();. for (size_t i = 0; i < 4; i++); a[i] = ""Test""+std::to_string(i);. o[""key0""] = ""value1"";; o[""key1""] = a;; o[""key2""] = 123;. std::cout << ""Array: "" << std::endl;; for (auto& e : a.ArrayRange()); std::cout << e << std::endl;. std::cout << ""Object: "" << std::endl;; for (auto& kv : o.ObjectRange()); std::cout << ""o["" << kv.first << ""] = "" << kv.second << std::endl;; ```. JSON can be read and written to streams . ```c++; std::cout << ""=== Loading ==="" << std::endl;; std::string s(""{\""key1\"":\""string\"",""; 		"" \""key2\"": true,""; 		"" \""key3\"": 1234,""; 		"" \""key4\"":null}"");. std::stringstream str(s);. TJSON j;; str >> j;; std::cout << j << std::endl;; ; TJSON j2 = TJSON::Load(s);; std::cout << j2 << std::endl;; ```.

The reason for this is that we have QSysInfo both in the TQtClientWidget; and TGQt submodules and our current translation (which is supposed to; parse all header in the module) sees them both in one transaction. As we also don't recognize that this decl is from a module, the code; fires the assert even though duplictes are expected with modules. The reason why we don't recognize it as a declaration form an ASTFile; which disables the assert is that FromASTFile for the decls is; not set. This is because they haven't been loaded by the ASTFileReader; but are directly parsed as submodules in our special case where we; directly parse a module content from rootcling to generate it. We just workaround in this patch by checking that if the decl is from; the currently generated module, we are pretending it's as if it was; loaded from an AST file.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1236:2025,assert,assert,2025,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1236,2,['assert'],['assert']

Testability," modification. In the ROOT file, we have version 1 of the class (TVHit) while in the current software, we have version 2 of the class. We wrote in the LinkDef file a #pragma instruction on how to transform v1 into v2. When this #pragma line is omitted, we obviously read the wrong information from the input file, because the definition in the code does not correspond to the definition on file (as expected). But when using the #pragma line, we simply get a segfault while trying to read the TTree. I have prepared a self-contained minimal working example attached to this topic: [mwe.tgz|attachment](upload://34Fdg60DY7tGGh6cw40YICFFhLy.tgz) (224.3 KB) . The archive contains the following README.md with more details on how to reproduce the issue, and on the exact content of the archive:. Steps to reproduce issue on Minimal Working Example (MWE); =============================; - Set the ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH; `source env.sh`; - Compile the minimal persistency library; `make`; - Run test code on new persistency (opens pluto_newpers.root and reads the tree successfully); `root read_updated.C\(1\)`; or; `read_updated 1`; - Run test code on old persistency (opens pluto_oldpers.root and crashes when trying to read the tree); `root read_updated.C(\(0\)`; or; `read_updated 0`. The crash is traced back to line 109 of PersistencyDICT.cxx; `static Long_t offset_Onfile_TVHit_fMCTrackID = oldObj->GetClass()->GetDataMemberOffset(""fMCTrackID"");`; where GetClass returns a nullptr. Content of the archive; ======================; - The header files in include contain the current definition of the minimal persistency necessary to ; read the input files (TVHit version 2).; - The source files in src are there for the sake of compilation but should not; have an influence on reading the input file (right?). ; - The header files in include_oldpers are included for documentation and correspond to the difference; between the old persistency (TVHit version 1) and the new persistency",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7754:1326,test,test,1326,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7754,1,['test'],['test']

It works only if `TFile.cxx` is compiled with the C++17 standard, otherwise the relevant code is excluded by the means of the preprocessor. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary). ## Quick test; I prepared a small program in C++ (requires C++17) to quickly test the pull request (see at the bottom of the message).

Testability," not found; ```. From this I conclude that those tests (in particular `TMVA_SOFIE_RDataFrame.C` and `tutorials/tmva/TMVA_SOFIE_GNN_Application.C`) are missing a dependencies that failed in the first run. Note `tutorial-tmva-TMVA_SOFIE_Keras_HiggsModel` and `tutorial-tmva-TMVA_SOFIE_RDataFrame-py` are indeed needing `TMVA_Higgs_Classification.C` to run first (it says so in the output! :) ). `tutorial-tmva-TMVA_SOFIE_RSofieReader` is asking for `Higgs_trained_model.h5`. `gtest-tmva-pymva-test-TestRModelParserKeras` is missing the symbol `sgemm_` (see below). However when rerunning (where this time somehow there was no resource related failures), I still got several failures:; ```; 346:gtest-tmva-pymva-test-TestRModelParserPyTorch; 350:gtest-tmva-pymva-test-TestRModelParserKeras; 984:tutorial-tmva-TMVA_SOFIE_GNN_Application; 988:tutorial-tmva-TMVA_SOFIE_RDataFrame; 990:tutorial-tmva-TMVA_SOFIE_RSofieReader; ```; all due to:; ```; IncrementalExecutor::executeFunction: symbol 'sgemm_' unresolved while linking [cling interface function]!; ```; or both; ```; IncrementalExecutor::executeFunction: symbol 'saxpy_' unresolved while linking [cling interface function]!; IncrementalExecutor::executeFunction: symbol 'sgemm_' unresolved while linking [cling interface function]!; ```; Which may be due to either a badly formed result of the failing run (1) or due to an external package that does not have the correct version number?. ### Reproducer. ```; ctest -j 32 # and get lots of out of resource failures; ctest --rerun-failed; ctest -j 32; ```. ### ROOT version. master	. ### Installation method. hand build. ### Operating system.

Testability," of a split and clean-up of #8294. ## Changes or fixes:; - Adds `LikelihoodJob` and `LikelihoodGradientJob` under the `RooFit::TestStatistics` namespace.; - Adds the `LikelihoodGradientJob` test case, which also covers the rest of the `TestStatistics` framework, as promised in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8700#issue-947741252.; - Adds two `KahanSum` constructors that allow for initialization of the full internal state. This is necessary for serializing and rematerializing `KahanSum`s so they can be sent over ZeroMQ sockets.; - `RooMinimizer` templated constructors and create factory functions were removed. These are replaced with enum class flags that allow the user to choose the type of `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` (this was already in place) and the `Likelihood(Gradient)Wrapper` implementations to use, i.e. the classes introduced in this PR. Similar changes were made in `MinuitFcnGrad`, which is now also template-free.; - `RooMinimizer`'s (now) two constructors use two helper functions now to avoid code duplication.; - There were some mistakes in the build setup of `RooFitZMQ` and `RooFit::MultiProcess` that only came to light now when building these classes that depend on `RooFit::MultiProcess`. These are fixed.; - A few functions had to be added to `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` and `MinuitFcnGrad` for passing along previous gradient, second derivative and step size information from Minuit2 to RooFit and back, i.e. using the functionality introduced in #8694. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally; - [x] update the docs (if necessary); - [x] unify copyright/license headers with previous commits; - [x] includes: correct order (matching header, RooFit, ROOT, std) and ROOT includes in quotation marks; - [x] refactor member names: underscore suffix; - [x] remove commented out code and TODOs and other junk; - [x] clang-tidy up; - [ ] rebase into two commits (one for `KahanSum` and one for the rest); - [x] make Readme.md for developers with some examples to run",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9349:2055,test,tested,2055,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9349,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability," on lxplus. I have seen a hadd reaching 21 GB of memory used...**. **Here is a way to reproduce the issue and that shows the RAM consumption can be strongly reduced.**. I attach a `tar.gz` file which contains 2 scripts: ; [haddIssue.tar.gz](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/12429530/haddIssue.tar.gz). * `createFile.cxx` for creating the input file which will be used to illustrate the issue ; Compilation and execution (it takes ~10 min to create the file) ; ```bash; g++ createFile.cxx -o createFile.exe -Wall $(root-config --cflags --glibs); ./createFile.exe; ``` ; --> this will create the file `myFile.root` which contains 1000 directories, each directory containing `10k` histograms ; ; * `fasterCustomHadd.cxx` script which **allows doing a hadd but without a huge RAM consumption**; Compilation and execution ; ```bash; g++ fasterCustomHadd.cxx -o fasterCustomHadd.exe -Wall $(root-config --cflags --glibs); ./fasterCustomHadd.exe -j 1 -f myOtherFile2.root myFile.root ; ```; NB: please use the `-j 1` to request one thread as otherwise the script is creating partial hadded files ; ; A comparison with ; ```; hadd -f myOtherFile.root myFile.root ; ``` . Gives (see screen shots below): ; * `hadd`: at the very end the RAM used is **`4.4 GB`** (memory increasing during the whole processing of directories) ; * `fasterCustomHadd` the RAM used is only **`~205-210 MB`** and remains constant from the start to the end of the hadd. ; ; Many thanks in advance for the fix! . ### `hadd` RAM consumption ; ![hadd_RAM](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/29270790/6096548f-23c8-4de8-9445-43db76f5d95b). ### `fasterCustomHadd` RAM consumption ; ![fasterCustomHadd_RAM](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/29270790/7d45dbe5-5b46-40fc-a1e0-450d6df0c070). ### ROOT version.

Testability," owns the `...Wrappers` that calculate the likelihood components. ## Todo:. There are still a couple of things that require attention, which I hope the reviewers can help me with:. 1. I have a Kahan summation helper class. This should probably be replaced with the new Kahan summation class in ROOT itself, but I didn't get to this yet. Maybe it is not urgent to do now, up for discussion.; 2. `likelihood_builders.cxx` is still missing the top level entry point function. This should be quite a simple function: it should just check whether the pdf is binned, unbinned or sum and has subsidiary terms. All the building blocks are already present, so it is just a matter of building it, but didn't get to it yet.; 3. `optional_parameter_types.h`: maybe we could replace this with @guitargeek's new configuration structs.; 4. `testRooRealL.getValRooAddition` fails because it doesn't know `RooFormulaVar`... I'm not sure what this means, but I vaguely remember that (I think) @hageboeck and @cburgard were talking about this, so I was hoping you may be able to help me out with fixing that test. Finally, one thing that in an ideal world I would have liked to do is add a serial implementation of the `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` class. Probably, we can reuse a lot of `RooGradMinimizerFcn` for this and it should be rather straightforward. However, I'm rather short on time right now, and these things almost always tend to take longer than one expects, so I'm hesitant to build it now. The **advantage** would be that we could add a test to this PR that covers all that is added, basically by just running a minimization. Note that I do have such a full-coverage test, but only for the `MultiProcess` minimization, where I implemented `LikelihoodGradientWrapper` in the parallel `LikelihoodGradientJob` class. So this test will come in [""PR 7"" (see overview)](https://whimsical.com/roofit-multiprocess-teststatistics-pr-dependencies-QP47k9PyS24VuboQUP5W6P).
