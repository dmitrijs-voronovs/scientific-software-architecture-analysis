Alternate Implementations¶; Depending on the reference (RHF, UHF, ROHF) and the integral treatment; (conventional CONV, density-fitted DF, and Cholesky-decomposed CD),; computational methods are sometimes implemented by multiple coders or even; multiple times. Psi4 transparently selects the most efficient; implementation, so one generally needn’t consult this table. However, to; understand the details of what combinations are accessible or what; alternate implementations are available, read on.; Below, “Y” means method available in module, “D” means module is default; for that method, and “” means method not available. HF, DFT, and MP2; default to density-fitted integrals, while all higher methods default to; conventional integrals. Therefore, for a closed-shell molecule:. runs MP2 with default DF with default implementation DFMP2; energy('mp2'). runs MP2 with CONV with default implementation OCC; set mp2_type conv; energy('mp2'). runs MP2 with default DF with implementation OCC; set qc_module occ; energy('mp2').

Moreover, active space approximations can be readily incorporated into the CC methods; [Krylov:2000:vod]. Additionally, orbital-optimized coupled-cluster avoids spurious second-order; poles in its response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge invariant [Pedersen:1999:od].; Another advantage is that the orbital-optimized methods do not suffer from artifactual symmetry-breaking; instabilities [Crawford:1997:instability], [Sherrill:1998:od], [Bozkaya:2011:omp2], and [Bozkaya:2011:omp3].; Furthermore, Kurlancheek and Head-Gordon [Kurlancek:2009] demonstrated that first order properties such as; forces or dipole moments are discontinuous along nuclear coordinates when such a symmetry breaking occurs.; They also observed that although the energy appears well behaved, the MP2 method can have natural occupation; numbers greater than 2 or less than 0, hence may violate the N-representability condition.

Introduction¶; Orbital-optimized methods have several advantages over their non-optimized counterparts.; Once the orbitals are optimized, the wave function will obey the Hellmann-Feynman theorem; for orbital rotation parameters. Therefore, there is no need for orbital response terms; in the evaluation of analytic gradients. In other words, it is unnecessary to solve the; first order coupled-perturbed CC and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) equations.; Further, computation of one-electron properties is easier because there are no response contributions to the particle; density matrices (PDMs). Moreover, active space approximations can be readily incorporated into the CC methods; [Krylov:2000:vod]. Additionally, orbital-optimized coupled-cluster avoids spurious second-order; poles in its response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge invariant [Pedersen:1999:od].; Another advantage is that the orbital-optimized methods do not suffer from artifactual symmetry-breaking; instabilities [Crawford:1997:instability], [Sherrill:1998:od], [Bozkaya:2011:omp2], and [Bozkaya:2011:omp3].; Furthermore, Kurlancheek and Head-Gordon [Kurlancek:2009] demonstrated that first order properties such as; forces or dipole moments are discontinuous along nuclear coordinates when such a symmetry breaking occurs.; They also observed that although the energy appears well behaved, the MP2 method can have natural occupation; numbers greater than 2 or less than 0, hence may violate the N-representability condition. They further; discussed that the orbital response equations generally have a singularity problem at the unrestriction point; where spin-restricted orbitals become unstable to unrestriction. This singularity yields to extremely large or; small eigenvalues of the one-particl",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/occ-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/occ-1.html

Then the energy can be expanded up to second-order as follows. where is the MO gradient vector, is the MO rotation vector,; and is the MO Hessian matrix. Therefore, minimizing the energy with respect to ; yields. This final equation corresponds to the usual Newton-Raphson step.; Publications resulting from the use of the orbital-optimized code should cite the following publications:. OMP2 [Bozkaya:2011:omp2] and [Bozkaya:2013:omp2grad]; OMP3 [Bozkaya:2011:omp3] , [Bozkaya:2013:omp3], and [Bozkaya:2013:omp3grad]; OMP2.5 [Bozkaya:2011:omp3]; OLCCD [Bozkaya:2013:ocepa]; LCCD [Bozkaya:2013:ocepa]. Convergence Problems¶; For problematic open-shell systems, we recommend to use the ROHF or DFT orbitals as an initial guess for orbital-optimized methods. Both ROHF and; DFT orbitals may provide better initial guesses than UHF orbitals, hence convergence may be significantly speeded up with ROHF or DFT orbitals.; In order to use ROHF orbitals we can simply use “reference rohf” option. For DFT orbitals one should use “reference uks” and “dft_functional b3lyp” options. Of; course users can use any DFT functional available in Psi4.

In other words, it is unnecessary to solve the; first order coupled-perturbed CC and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) equations.; Further, computation of one-electron properties is easier because there are no response contributions to the particle; density matrices (PDMs). Moreover, active space approximations can be readily incorporated into the CC methods; [Krylov:2000:vod]. Additionally, orbital-optimized coupled-cluster avoids spurious second-order; poles in its response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge invariant [Pedersen:1999:od].; Another advantage is that the orbital-optimized methods do not suffer from artifactual symmetry-breaking; instabilities [Crawford:1997:instability], [Sherrill:1998:od], [Bozkaya:2011:omp2], and [Bozkaya:2011:omp3].; Furthermore, Kurlancheek and Head-Gordon [Kurlancek:2009] demonstrated that first order properties such as; forces or dipole moments are discontinuous along nuclear coordinates when such a symmetry breaking occurs.; They also observed that although the energy appears well behaved, the MP2 method can have natural occupation; numbers greater than 2 or less than 0, hence may violate the N-representability condition. They further; discussed that the orbital response equations generally have a singularity problem at the unrestriction point; where spin-restricted orbitals become unstable to unrestriction. This singularity yields to extremely large or; small eigenvalues of the one-particle density matrix (OPDM). These abnormal eigenvalues may lead to unphysical; molecular properties such as vibrational frequencies.

Introduction¶; Orbital-optimized methods have several advantages over their non-optimized counterparts.; Once the orbitals are optimized, the wave function will obey the Hellmann-Feynman theorem; for orbital rotation parameters. Therefore, there is no need for orbital response terms; in the evaluation of analytic gradients. In other words, it is unnecessary to solve the; first order coupled-perturbed CC and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) equations.; Further, computation of one-electron properties is easier because there are no response contributions to the particle; density matrices (PDMs). Moreover, active space approximations can be readily incorporated into the CC methods; [Krylov:2000:vod]. Additionally, orbital-optimized coupled-cluster avoids spurious second-order; poles in its response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge invariant [Pedersen:1999:od].; Another advantage is that the orbital-optimized methods do not suffer from artifactual symmetry-breaking; instabilities [Crawford:1997:instability], [Sherrill:1998:od], [Bozkaya:2011:omp2], and [Bozkaya:2011:omp3].; Furthermore, Kurlancheek and Head-Gordon [Kurlancek:2009] demonstrated that first order properties such as; forces or dipole moments are discontinuous along nuclear coordinates when such a symmetry breaking occurs.; They also observed that although the energy appears well behaved, the MP2 method can have natural occupation; numbers greater than 2 or less than 0, hence may violate the N-representability condition. They further; discussed that the orbital response equations generally have a singularity problem at the unrestriction point; where spin-restricted orbitals become unstable to unrestriction. This singularity yields to extremely large or; small eigenvalues of the one-particl",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/occ.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/occ.html

Then the energy can be expanded up to second-order as follows. where is the MO gradient vector, is the MO rotation vector,; and is the MO Hessian matrix. Therefore, minimizing the energy with respect to ; yields. This final equation corresponds to the usual Newton-Raphson step.; Publications resulting from the use of the orbital-optimized code should cite the following publications:. OMP2 [Bozkaya:2011:omp2] and [Bozkaya:2013:omp2grad]; OMP3 [Bozkaya:2011:omp3] , [Bozkaya:2013:omp3], and [Bozkaya:2013:omp3grad]; OMP2.5 [Bozkaya:2011:omp3]; OLCCD [Bozkaya:2013:ocepa]; LCCD [Bozkaya:2013:ocepa]. Convergence Problems¶; For problematic open-shell systems, we recommend to use the ROHF or DFT orbitals as an initial guess for orbital-optimized methods. Both ROHF and; DFT orbitals may provide better initial guesses than UHF orbitals, hence convergence may be significantly speeded up with ROHF or DFT orbitals.; In order to use ROHF orbitals we can simply use “reference rohf” option. For DFT orbitals one should use “reference uks” and “dft_functional b3lyp” options. Of; course users can use any DFT functional available in Psi4. Methods¶; The orbital-optimized MPn and OLCCD methods currently supported in; Psi4 are outlined in Table Orbital-Optimzed OCC/DFOCC; Methods. The following methods are available; and can be controlled through OCC (conventional integrals CONV); and DFOCC (density-fitted DF and Cholesky-decomposed CD); keywords.

There are two ways the computation of one-electron properties can be requested.; Firstly, the properties can be evaluated from the last; computed one-particle density, using the following syntax:; oeprop(""MO_EXTENTS"", ""MULTIPOLE(4)"", title = ""hello!""). Note that it is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the relaxed density; matrix is computed using the method of interest, which may require setting; additional keywords (see the method’s manual section for details). The named; argument, title, is completely optional and is prepended to any; globals variables set during the computation. The unnamed arguments are the; properties to be computed. These can appear in any order, and multiple; properties may be requested, as in the example above. Note that, due to Python; syntax restrictions, the title argument must appear after the list of; properties to compute. The available properties are shown in the table above.; The syntax above works well for computing properties using the SCF; wavefunction, however, may be difficult (or impossible) to use for some of the; correlated levels of theory. Alternatively, one-electron properties can be; computed using the built-in property() function, e.g.:; property('ccsd', properties=['dipole']).

The available properties are shown in the table above.; The syntax above works well for computing properties using the SCF; wavefunction, however, may be difficult (or impossible) to use for some of the; correlated levels of theory. Alternatively, one-electron properties can be; computed using the built-in property() function, e.g.:; property('ccsd', properties=['dipole']). The property() function provides limited functionality, but is a lot easier to; use for correlated methods. For capabilities of property() see the; corresponding section of the manual. Basic Keywords¶; Multipole moments may be computed at any origin, which is controlled by the; global PROPERTIES_ORIGIN keyword. The keyword takes an array with; the following possible values:. Allowed origin specifications¶. Keyword; Interpretation. [x, y, z]; Origin is at the coordinates, in the same units as the geometry specification. [“COM”]; Origin is at the center of mass. [“NUCLEAR_CHARGE”]; Origin is at the center of nuclear charge. Properties evaluated on a grid¶; Certain properties may be evaluated a user-specified grid points. The grid; points are completely arbitrary and are specified by providing a file called; grid.dat containing the x,y,z values seperated with spaces for each point in order:; x1 y1 z1; x2 y2 z2; ..........; xn yn zn. The grid.dat file is completely free form; any number of spaces and/or newlines; between entries is permitted. The units of the coordinates in grid.dat are the; same as those used to specify the molecule’s geometry, and the output; quantities are always in atomic units. The requested properties will be; written out in the same order as the grid point specification in grid.dat; see; the above table for the format and file name of the output.

Navigation. index. modules    . toc    . next    . previous    ; Psi4 [1.0.0 6a9a71b] » ; Programming: Using the Core Libraries ». LibOptions: globals, locals, has_changed and all that¶; To simplify parsing of options and handling of defaults, the Options class; was created. It functions in the following way:. Each module (or plugin) declares which options it will look for in the; input: their name, type (string, int, double, array, etc.), and any; default value they take.; The input is parsed for these options, and defaults are assigned for; those keywords not specified by the user.; The c-side module or plugin can then query the Options object for the; values associated with each keyword.; The options will also be accessible py-side to the procedures that drive; the modules. Array-type options are not available in python. Declaring Options¶; Each module needs to make itself known to the Options object, via a; read_options function. For plugins, this routine is provided by the user; in the plugin code. For native Psi4 modules, the entries need to; be appended to the read_options code in psi4/src/bin/psi4/read_options.cc.; An example of such a routine is; if (name == ""MYMODULE""|| options.read_globals()) {; /*- The amount of information printed; to the output file -*/; options.add_int(""PRINT"", 1);; /*- Do save information to |mymodule__data_file| at the end of the computation? -*/; options.add_bool(""SAVE_INFO"", true);; /*- An array containing the number of doubly occupied orbitals per irrep; (in :ref:`Cotton order <table:irrepOrdering>`) -*/; options.add(""DOCC"", new ArrayType());; /*- The factor by which the harmonic vibrational frequencies are multiplied to; obtain an approximation to the fundamental vibrational frequencies -*/; options.add_double(""FREQUENCY_SCALE_FACTOR"", 1.0);; /*- The filename to which data is dumped. !expert -*/; options.add_str(""DATA_FILE"", ""data.dat"");; /*- Th",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/optionshandling-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/optionshandling-1.html

The python function; then makes its changes to the option and runs any c-side modules with; those changes. Finally, just before the function returns, the options are; reset to the user’s value and has_changed status (which should now again; reflect only whether the user has changed the value). Warning; PUREAM is an exception in that its value and; has_changed() value only reflect what the user has explicitly set.; This keyword should not be queried to find out the current; PUREAM state for the active basis; use instead,; psi4.MintsHelper().basisset().has_puream(). Reading Options in Module¶. Handling Options in Driver¶; This section is about the scopes of options and how best to handle them in; the python driver. There are four groups of commands available.; Options from the c-side Options object are accessible in the Python driver through four sets of commands. get; get_global_option(); get_local_option(); get_option(). set; set_global_option(); set_local_option(). has_changed; has_global_option_changed(); has_local_option_changed(); has_option_changed(). revoke_changed; revoke_global_option_changed(); revoke_local_option_changed(). There’s a pattern here. Setting something, either a value (set) or a; negative changed status (revoke_changed), can only be done for a specific; scope, either global or local to the specified module. Querying, either a; value (get) or a changed status (has_changed), can be done in the global; scope, in a specified local scope, or in the context of “What will the; specified module use?”.

Array-type options are not available in python. Declaring Options¶; Each module needs to make itself known to the Options object, via a; read_options function. For plugins, this routine is provided by the user; in the plugin code.

The purpose of the “if” statement in the above read_options function is; the following.

The first thing to happen is a call to read_options with name set; to “MYMODULE”. (Note that all user input is converted to upper case.)

Reading Options in Module¶. Handling Options in Driver¶; This section is about the scopes of options and how best to handle them in; the python driver.

There’s a pattern here. Setting something, either a value (set) or a; negative changed status (revoke_changed), can only be done for a specific; scope, either global or local to the specified module. Querying, either a; value (get) or a changed status (has_changed), can be done in the global; scope, in a specified local scope, or in the context of “What will the; specified module use?”.

(Previously, this command used the; “active module”, which isn’t well-defined in the context of the python; driver, and consequently, the command gave variable results, depending; on whether a get_local/set_local command had been previously executed to; define the active module.); if (psi4.get_option('SCF', 'REFERENCE') == 'RHF'):; psi4.set_local_option('SCF', 'REFERENCE', 'RKS'). Setting of options in python should use the; set_local_option() command. Using the local, rather; than global, scope will ensure that the newly set option will be used by; the module. Otherwise, if the python procedure set in the global scope; and the user had happened to set that option in local scope, the local; user option will take precedence against the programmer’s intent.; (Anyone who has heard advice to “query local, set global” should forget; that and follow the new scheme outlined here.).

Note; “Global” in the sense of the discussion has nothing; to do with the globals section at the top of read_options.cc . That; section is just a convenient place for options and associated values; that are used by most, if not all, modules. There are two primary purposes for interacting with options in the python driver. Preserving User Options (Enforcing definition [a] of has_changed); The first, less-interesting, use of retrieving user option values has; been to preserve them so that they may be restored at the end after the; procedure itself has clobbered them. By decoupling global_option and; local_option commands, this can now be performed neatly by saving at the; beginning the global and local values and the global and local; has_changed values, then restoring them at the end.

Reading Options in Module¶. Handling Options in Driver¶; This section is about the scopes of options and how best to handle them in; the python driver.

Convergence Criteria¶; Optking monitors five quantities to evaluate the progress of a geometry; optimization. These are (with their keywords) the change in energy; (MAX_ENERGY_G_CONVERGENCE), the maximum element of; the gradient (MAX_FORCE_G_CONVERGENCE), the root-mean-square; of the gradient (RMS_FORCE_G_CONVERGENCE), the maximum element; of displacement (MAX_DISP_G_CONVERGENCE), and the; root-mean-square of displacement (RMS_DISP_G_CONVERGENCE),; all in internal coordinates and atomic units. Usually, these options will not; be set directly. Primary control for geometry convergence lies with the keyword; G_CONVERGENCE which sets the aforementioned in accordance; with Table Geometry Convergence.

King; Section author: Rollin A. King and Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, OPTKING; Psi4 carries out molecular optimizations using a module called; optking. The optking program takes as input nuclear gradients and,; optionally, nuclear second derivatives — both in Cartesian coordinates.; The default minimization algorithm employs an empirical model Hessian,; redundant internal coordinates, an RFO step, and the BFGS Hessian update.; The principal literature references include the introduction of redundant; internal coordinates by Peng et al. [Peng:1996:49].; The general approach employed in this code; is similar to the “model Hessian plus RF method” described and tested by Bakken and; Helgaker [Bakken:2002:9160]. (However, for separated; fragments, we have chosen not to employ by default their “extra-redundant”; coordinates defined by their “auxiliary interfragment” bonds. These can be; included via the option ADD_AUXILIARY_BONDS).; The internal coordinates are generated automatically based on an assumed bond; connectivity. The connectivity is determined by testing if the interatomic; distance is less than the sum of atomic radii times the value of; COVALENT_CONNECT. If the user finds that some; connectivity is lacking by default, then this value may be increased.; Otherwise, the internal coordinate definitions may be modified directly. If one; desires to see or modify the internal coordinates being used, then one can set; INTCOS_GENERATE_EXIT to true. The internal coordinate; definitions are provided in the file with extension ”.intco”. See the Optimizing Minima; section for more detail.

Convergence Criteria¶; Optking monitors five quantities to evaluate the progress of a geometry; optimization. These are (with their keywords) the change in energy; (MAX_ENERGY_G_CONVERGENCE), the maximum element of; the gradient (MAX_FORCE_G_CONVERGENCE), the root-mean-square; of the gradient (RMS_FORCE_G_CONVERGENCE), the maximum element; of displacement (MAX_DISP_G_CONVERGENCE), and the; root-mean-square of displacement (RMS_DISP_G_CONVERGENCE),; all in internal coordinates and atomic units. Usually, these options will not; be set directly. Primary control for geometry convergence lies with the keyword; G_CONVERGENCE which sets the aforementioned in accordance; with Table Geometry Convergence.

The optking program takes as input nuclear gradients and,; optionally, nuclear second derivatives — both in Cartesian coordinates.; The default minimization algorithm employs an empirical model Hessian,; redundant internal coordinates, an RFO step, and the BFGS Hessian update.; The principal literature references include the introduction of redundant; internal coordinates by Peng et al.

After any change to; the plugin C++ code, make must be run in the plugin directory to; recompile the myplugin.so executable, but recompiling the main; Psi4 code is not necessary.; input.dat — Sample input file for the plugin.; Since the __init__.py file makes the plugin directory look like a; Python module, the plugin can be treated as such in an input file. The; location of the plugin directory must be included in PYTHONPATH,; either externally in the calling shell or defined in the input file.; This is usually done by manipulating PSIPATH. Then,; the plugin can be loaded as import myplugin and executed as; energy('myplugin'). Any other Python functions are also available from; the input file, e.g. myplugin.testfunction(), note the namespace; protection.; pymodule.py — Python component of the plugin. The procedure; for calling plugin code shown in input.dat sounds very simple, but it; can be made simpler still. By encoding the sequence of Psi4 module; calls needed to run the plugin in the run_myplugin() function in this; file, the plugin is hooked into the main Psi4 driver function; energy() and so can be accessed through; energy('myplugin') in an input file. Any other Python functions can; also be placed in this file.; __init__.py — Init script for the plugin (in the sense that; the whole plugin directory is a Python module).

Remove the .. comment; text and build Sphinx documentation for samples of linking keywords,; sections, and math. This file is absorbed into the Psi4; documentation, along with any docstrings to Python functions, and the C++; keywords block in the myplugin.cc file. See Documentation; for building documentation and Available Plugins; for this file’s final destination. Please note that pure virtual functions in a plugin may cause undefined symbols errors when; the plugin is loaded.; To create a purely Python plugin, create a new plugin directory, then; remove the Makefile and myplugin.cc files and; erase the shared object loading portion of __init__.py. Create as many .py; files as necessary (registering each one in __init__.py), use; input.dat as a model for loading the plugin, no recompile ever; necessary. Table Of Contents.

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/plugins-1.html:1166,Integrability,wrap,wrapped,1166,"s: Adding New Functionality to Psi4¶. Modular Approach to Development¶; The redesign of Psi4 into a single-executable changed the way that; code development is done. The standalone nature of modules in previous; versions of Psi made their development very easy, as new functionality; could be implemented almost as a standalone executable, which could easily; be ported into the Psi code when completed. The new design specifies that; these modules are now libraries, not separate executables, which are; linked into the main Psi executable. The single-executable design is; conducive to code reuse, as it allows common tasks to be implemented as a; class instead of a module; the functionality can then be easily obtained; throughout the code by creating objects as required. Examples of this are; the LibMints class, which provides similar functionality to the old cints; module, and LibTrans, which replaces the old transqt code. When codes are; wrapped in a library, they should be placed into psi4/src/lib, and; codes that resemble modules belong in psi4/src/bin.; The single-executable design leads to a somewhat cumbersome development; cycle, since every time a change is made, one must compile the code,; archive it into a library, and then re-link the code into the main; executable. It’s also daunting to new developers if they’re required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with previous versions due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, Psi4 now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi’s vast library.

When codes are; wrapped in a library, they should be placed into psi4/src/lib, and; codes that resemble modules belong in psi4/src/bin.; The single-executable design leads to a somewhat cumbersome development; cycle, since every time a change is made, one must compile the code,; archive it into a library, and then re-link the code into the main; executable. It’s also daunting to new developers if they’re required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with previous versions due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, Psi4 now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi’s vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. Creating a New Plugin¶; Psi4 can create basic plugins for you and automatically tailor them; to your compilation environment. To create a basic plugin, run the; following while replacing myplugin with the name of your great code.; If the name you provide is not valid, Psi4 will complain.; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin. Psi4 will create a new directory with the name you specify for the; plugin. In this example, a directory named myplugin will be created.; All you need to do is cd into the directory and type make. Then execute; psi4 in the directory on the default input file.; Psi4 comes with a few templates that provide an excellent starting; point. These include code that demonstrates AO, MO, and SO integrals. Use; one of the following commands that meets your needs:; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin +aointegrals; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin +mointegrals; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin +sointegrals; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin +wavefunction; >>> psi4 ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/plugins-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/plugins-1.html

Files in a Plugin Directory¶; In addition to the main myplugin.cc file, a fresh plugin directory contains the following files. Makefile — Makefile for the directory. As long as you are the; only user of the plugin, this should not need editing. After any change to; the plugin C++ code, make must be run in the plugin directory to; recompile the myplugin.so executable, but recompiling the main; Psi4 code is not necessary.; input.dat — Sample input file for the plugin.; Since the __init__.py file makes the plugin directory look like a; Python module, the plugin can be treated as such in an input file. The; location of the plugin directory must be included in PYTHONPATH,; either externally in the calling shell or defined in the input file.; This is usually done by manipulating PSIPATH. Then,; the plugin can be loaded as import myplugin and executed as; energy('myplugin'). Any other Python functions are also available from; the input file, e.g. myplugin.testfunction(), note the namespace; protection.; pymodule.py — Python component of the plugin.

The single-executable design is; conducive to code reuse, as it allows common tasks to be implemented as a; class instead of a module; the functionality can then be easily obtained; throughout the code by creating objects as required. Examples of this are; the LibMints class, which provides similar functionality to the old cints; module, and LibTrans, which replaces the old transqt code. When codes are; wrapped in a library, they should be placed into psi4/src/lib, and; codes that resemble modules belong in psi4/src/bin.; The single-executable design leads to a somewhat cumbersome development; cycle, since every time a change is made, one must compile the code,; archive it into a library, and then re-link the code into the main; executable. It’s also daunting to new developers if they’re required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with previous versions due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, Psi4 now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi’s vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. Creating a New Plugin¶; Psi4 can create basic plugins for you and automatically tailor them; to your compilation environment. To create a basic plugin, run the; following while replacing myplugin with the name of your great code.; If the name you provide is not valid, Psi4 will complain.; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin.

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/plugins.html:1166,Integrability,wrap,wrapped,1166,"s: Adding New Functionality to Psi4¶. Modular Approach to Development¶; The redesign of Psi4 into a single-executable changed the way that; code development is done. The standalone nature of modules in previous; versions of Psi made their development very easy, as new functionality; could be implemented almost as a standalone executable, which could easily; be ported into the Psi code when completed. The new design specifies that; these modules are now libraries, not separate executables, which are; linked into the main Psi executable. The single-executable design is; conducive to code reuse, as it allows common tasks to be implemented as a; class instead of a module; the functionality can then be easily obtained; throughout the code by creating objects as required. Examples of this are; the LibMints class, which provides similar functionality to the old cints; module, and LibTrans, which replaces the old transqt code. When codes are; wrapped in a library, they should be placed into psi4/src/lib, and; codes that resemble modules belong in psi4/src/bin.; The single-executable design leads to a somewhat cumbersome development; cycle, since every time a change is made, one must compile the code,; archive it into a library, and then re-link the code into the main; executable. It’s also daunting to new developers if they’re required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with previous versions due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, Psi4 now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi’s vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location.

When codes are; wrapped in a library, they should be placed into psi4/src/lib, and; codes that resemble modules belong in psi4/src/bin.; The single-executable design leads to a somewhat cumbersome development; cycle, since every time a change is made, one must compile the code,; archive it into a library, and then re-link the code into the main; executable. It’s also daunting to new developers if they’re required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with previous versions due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, Psi4 now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi’s vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. Creating a New Plugin¶; Psi4 can create basic plugins for you and automatically tailor them; to your compilation environment. To create a basic plugin, run the; following while replacing myplugin with the name of your great code.; If the name you provide is not valid, Psi4 will complain.; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin. Psi4 will create a new directory with the name you specify for the; plugin. In this example, a directory named myplugin will be created.; All you need to do is cd into the directory and type make. Then execute; psi4 in the directory on the default input file.; Psi4 comes with a few templates that provide an excellent starting; point. These include code that demonstrates AO, MO, and SO integrals. Use; one of the following commands that meets your needs:; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin +aointegrals; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin +mointegrals; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin +sointegrals; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin +wavefunction; >>> psi4 ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/plugins.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/plugins.html

Files in a Plugin Directory¶; In addition to the main myplugin.cc file, a fresh plugin directory contains the following files. Makefile — Makefile for the directory. As long as you are the; only user of the plugin, this should not need editing. After any change to; the plugin C++ code, make must be run in the plugin directory to; recompile the myplugin.so executable, but recompiling the main; Psi4 code is not necessary.; input.dat — Sample input file for the plugin.; Since the __init__.py file makes the plugin directory look like a; Python module, the plugin can be treated as such in an input file. The; location of the plugin directory must be included in PYTHONPATH,; either externally in the calling shell or defined in the input file.; This is usually done by manipulating PSIPATH. Then,; the plugin can be loaded as import myplugin and executed as; energy('myplugin'). Any other Python functions are also available from; the input file, e.g. myplugin.testfunction(), note the namespace; protection.; pymodule.py — Python component of the plugin. The procedure; for calling plugin code shown in input.dat sounds very simple, but it; can be made simpler still. By encoding the sequence of Psi4 module; calls needed to run the plugin in the run_myplugin() function in this; file, the plugin is hooked into the main Psi4 driver function; energy() and so can be accessed through; energy('myplugin') in an input file.

The single-executable design is; conducive to code reuse, as it allows common tasks to be implemented as a; class instead of a module; the functionality can then be easily obtained; throughout the code by creating objects as required. Examples of this are; the LibMints class, which provides similar functionality to the old cints; module, and LibTrans, which replaces the old transqt code. When codes are; wrapped in a library, they should be placed into psi4/src/lib, and; codes that resemble modules belong in psi4/src/bin.; The single-executable design leads to a somewhat cumbersome development; cycle, since every time a change is made, one must compile the code,; archive it into a library, and then re-link the code into the main; executable. It’s also daunting to new developers if they’re required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with previous versions due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, Psi4 now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi’s vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. Creating a New Plugin¶; Psi4 can create basic plugins for you and automatically tailor them; to your compilation environment. To create a basic plugin, run the; following while replacing myplugin with the name of your great code.; If the name you provide is not valid, Psi4 will complain.; >>> psi4 --new-plugin myplugin.

Advantages to New Scheme (aka Why)¶. Defaults for fitting basis sets set on a per-atom basis (e.g., DF-SCF; on metal-organic with cc-pVDZ uses cc-pVDZ-JKFIT for the organic and; Def2-tzvpp (or something) for the metal) so that the user shouldn’t; experience a failed job on account of incomplete fitting basis sets.; All default info for auxiliary basis sets in one place. Programmer when; calling for a new auxiliary BasisSet gives the fitting role if defaults; need to be computed (e.g., JKFIT) and the orbital basis to compute; defaults off of (e.g., get_option(BASIS)). This eliminates all the; “corresponding_jkfit” boilerplate in proc.py and also means defaults; can be assigned for non-uniform orbital basis sets.; Assignment of basis sets to atoms proceeds through “all”, “by_symbol”; (e.g., “Co”), or “by_label” (e.g., H1 or Co_mine). There is no; assignment to atoms by number (except a bit internally where it’s safe); which can be ambiguous when the Molecule has been fragmented as for SAPT.; Users don’t need to “set basis basisname” after every molecule {...}; definition or activation because basis sets are not attached to the; molecule at time option is set but at time BasisSet is built. Similarly,; once can define a basis basisname {...} block and use it for multiple; molecules. BasisSet gives the option name where any user intentions as to proper; value may be found (DF_BASIS_SCF), the name by which the new basis can be; recalled (get_str(‘DF_BASIS_SCF’)), the fitting role if defaults need to; be computed (JKFIT), the.

Basis Sets¶. Basis Sets; Built-In Basis Sets; Mixing Basis Sets; Decontracted Basis Sets; User-Defined Basis Sets.

However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed. See scf4 for analogous Z-matrix; and Cartiesian scans. Tables of Results¶; The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the Table() Psithon; function. For example, in the following potential energy surface scan for water; molecule h2o {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }.

The relative energies are reported with; respect to the lowest value in each column. More examples of how to control the; formatting of the tables can be found in the sample input files provided; see; Appendix Test Suite and Sample Inputs for a complete listing. Python Wrappers¶; The Python foundations of the Psi4 driver and Psithon syntax permit; many commonly performed post-processing procedures to be integrated into; the Psi4 suite.; As seen in the neon dimer example from the A Psi4 Tutorial section,; the _nbody_gufunc() wrapper provides automatic computation of; counterpoise-corrected interaction energies between two molecules. For; example,:; cp('mp2'). will compute the counterpoise-corrected density-fitted MP2 interaction energy; between two molecules.; Psi4 also provides the complete_basis_set() wrapper,; which automatically computes a complete-basis-set extrapolation (and; automatically sets up the computations with different basis sets required to; do the extrapolation). For example,:; cbs('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2), and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc-pVTZ).; Another very useful and powerf",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/psithoninput-1.html

For example,:; cbs('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2), and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc-pVTZ).; Another very useful and powerful feature of Psi4 is the ability; to compute results on entire databases of molecules at a time,; as provided by the database() wrapper. For example,:; database('mp2','S22',cp=1,benchmark='S22B'). will perform DF-MP2 counterpoise-corrected interaction energies; (cp=1) on all members of Hobza’s S22 database set of van der Waals; dimers, and then compare the results against the S22B benchmark energies.; Built-in databases include S22, A24, HTBH, HBC6, HSG, S22by5, S66, JSCH,; NCB31, S66by8, and NBC10, among others.; These wrapper functions are discussed separately in; Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation.

To add EFP fragments to a molecule, see Molecule Specification. Job Control Keywords¶; Psi4 comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, viz.:; set {; docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]; }. List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening [ is; on the same line as the name of the keyword.; Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the set keyword. Omitting the module; name, or using the name global or globals will result in the keyword being; applied to all modules. For example, in the following input; molecule{; o; h 1 roh; h 1 roh 2 ahoh. roh = 0.957; ahoh = 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1; energy('ccsd'). the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print; level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs cou",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/psithoninput-1.html

Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, any of which can be used within Psi4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets = [""cc-pVDZ"", ""cc-pVTZ"", ""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of basis_sets is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed.

Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, Psi4 was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; Psi4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level Psi4 source directory, and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all Psi4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the Psi4 code (which; are obtained from the 3rd edition of the IUPAC Green; book [Cohen:GreenBook:2008]) are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that the user’s ~/.psi4rc values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).; The physical constants used within Psi4, which are automatically; made available within all Psi4 input files.; # @END LICENSE; #. # Do not modify this file!

In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; Psi4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level Psi4 source directory, and should; serve as useful examples.

The psi_ prefix is to prevent clashes with user-defined variables in; Psi4 input files. Memory Specification¶; By default, Psi4 assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available; to Psi4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 Gb. memory 2000 Mb. memory 2000000 Kb. One convenient way to override the Psi4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. ~/.psi4rc File). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 Gb.; set_memory(2000000000). However, unless you’re assured of having only one job running on a node at; a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with ~/.psi4rc have similar memory; capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a; per-calculation basis.

Basis Sets¶. Basis Sets; Built-In Basis Sets; Mixing Basis Sets; Decontracted Basis Sets; User-Defined Basis Sets.

The psi_ prefix is to prevent clashes with user-defined variables in; Psi4 input files. Memory Specification¶; By default, Psi4 assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available; to Psi4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 Gb. memory 2000 Mb. memory 2000000 Kb. One convenient way to override the Psi4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. ~/.psi4rc File). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 Gb.; set_memory(2000000000). However, unless you’re assured of having only one job running on a node at; a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with ~/.psi4rc have similar memory; capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a; per-calculation basis.

To add EFP fragments to a molecule, see Molecule Specification. Job Control Keywords¶; Psi4 comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings.

PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, Psi4 makes the most pertinent results; of each computation available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of; H2 and H atom:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol * (2*h_energy - h2_energy); print ""De=%f"" % D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command print_variables(). Note that PSI variables; are cleared at the start of each energy(), etc. in an input; file by clean_variables().; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables() command, the; last will include SCF TOTAL ENERGY but not; FCI TOTAL ENERGY.; The entire dictionary of PSI variables can be obtained through; get_variables().

Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, Psi4 was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; Psi4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level Psi4 source directory, and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file.

In this example a full CCSD computation is; performed by running the SCF code first, then the coupled cluster modules;; the energy() Python helper function ensures that this is performed correctly.; Note that the Python interpreter executes commands in the order they appear in; the input file, so if the last four commands in the above example were to read; set basis cc-pVDZ; energy('ccsd'); set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1. the commands that set the print level would be ineffective, as they would be; processed after the CCSD computation completes. Basis Sets¶. Basis Sets; Built-In Basis Sets; Mixing Basis Sets; Decontracted Basis Sets; User-Defined Basis Sets. PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, Psi4 makes the most pertinent results; of each computation available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing.

However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed. See scf4 for analogous Z-matrix; and Cartiesian scans. Tables of Results¶; The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the Table() Psithon; function. For example, in the following potential energy surface scan for water; molecule h2o {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]; Avals=range(100,102,2). table=Table(rows=[""R"",""A""], cols=[""E(SCF)"",""E(SCS)"",""E(DFMP2)""]). set basis cc-pvdz. for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('mp2'); escf = get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY'); edfmp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); escsmp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); table[R][A] = [escf, escsmp2, edfmp2]. print table; relative=table.copy(); relative.absolute_to_relative(); print relative. we first define a table (on line 10) with two row indices and three column; indices.

The relative energies are reported with; respect to the lowest value in each column. More examples of how to control the; formatting of the tables can be found in the sample input files provided; see; Appendix Test Suite and Sample Inputs for a complete listing. Python Wrappers¶; The Python foundations of the Psi4 driver and Psithon syntax permit; many commonly performed post-processing procedures to be integrated into; the Psi4 suite.; As seen in the neon dimer example from the A Psi4 Tutorial section,; the _nbody_gufunc() wrapper provides automatic computation of; counterpoise-corrected interaction energies between two molecules. For; example,:; cp('mp2'). will compute the counterpoise-corrected density-fitted MP2 interaction energy; between two molecules.; Psi4 also provides the complete_basis_set() wrapper,; which automatically computes a complete-basis-set extrapolation (and; automatically sets up the computations with different basis sets required to; do the extrapolation). For example,:; cbs('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2), and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc-pVTZ).; Another very useful and powerf",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/psithoninput.html

To add EFP fragments to a molecule, see Molecule Specification. Job Control Keywords¶; Psi4 comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, viz.:; set {; docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]; }. List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening [ is; on the same line as the name of the keyword.; Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the set keyword. Omitting the module; name, or using the name global or globals will result in the keyword being; applied to all modules. For example, in the following input; molecule{; o; h 1 roh; h 1 roh 2 ahoh. roh = 0.957; ahoh = 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1; energy('ccsd'). the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print; level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs cou",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/psithoninput.html

Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, any of which can be used within Psi4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets = [""cc-pVDZ"", ""cc-pVTZ"", ""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of basis_sets is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed.

Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, Psi4 was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; Psi4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level Psi4 source directory, and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all Psi4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the Psi4 code (which; are obtained from the 3rd edition of the IUPAC Green; book [Cohen:GreenBook:2008]) are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that the user’s ~/.psi4rc values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).; The physical constants used within Psi4, which are automatically; made available within all Psi4 input files.; # @END LICENSE; #. # Do not modify this file!

Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all Psi4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the Psi4 code (which; are obtained from the 3rd edition of the IUPAC Green; book [Cohen:GreenBook:2008]) are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that the user’s ~/.psi4rc values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).; The physical constants used within Psi4, which are automatically; made available within all Psi4 input files.; # @END LICENSE; #. # Do not modify this file!

The psi_ prefix is to prevent clashes with user-defined variables in; Psi4 input files. Memory Specification¶; By default, Psi4 assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available; to Psi4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 Gb. memory 2000 Mb. memory 2000000 Kb. One convenient way to override the Psi4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. ~/.psi4rc File). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 Gb.; set_memory(2000000000). However, unless you’re assured of having only one job running on a node at; a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with ~/.psi4rc have similar memory; capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a; per-calculation basis. Note; For parallel jobs, the memory keyword represents the total memory; availabl",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/psithoninput.html

Basis Sets¶. Basis Sets; Built-In Basis Sets; Mixing Basis Sets; Decontracted Basis Sets; User-Defined Basis Sets. PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, Psi4 makes the most pertinent results; of each computation available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of; H2 and H atom:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf').

Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, Psi4 was built; upon the Python interpreter.

The psi_ prefix is to prevent clashes with user-defined variables in; Psi4 input files. Memory Specification¶; By default, Psi4 assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available; to Psi4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 Gb. memory 2000 Mb. memory 2000000 Kb. One convenient way to override the Psi4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. ~/.psi4rc File).

However, unless you’re assured of having only one job running on a node at; a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with ~/.psi4rc have similar memory; capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a; per-calculation basis.

To add EFP fragments to a molecule, see Molecule Specification. Job Control Keywords¶; Psi4 comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }.

PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, Psi4 makes the most pertinent results; of each computation available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of; H2 and H atom:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol * (2*h_energy - h2_energy); print ""De=%f"" % D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command print_variables(). Note that PSI variables; are cleared at the start of each energy(), etc. in an input; file by clean_variables().; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables() command, the; last will include SCF TOTAL ENERGY but not; FCI TOTAL ENERGY.; The entire dictionary of PSI variables can be obtained through; get_variables().

Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, Psi4 was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; Psi4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level Psi4 source directory, and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all Psi4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the Psi4 code (which; are obtained from the 3rd edition of the IUPAC Green; book [Cohen:GreenBook:2008]) are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that the user’s ~/.psi4rc values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).; The physical constants used within Psi4, which are automatically; made available within all Psi4 input files.; # @END LICENSE; #. # Do not modify this file!

The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY').

SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]; in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; Psi4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods.

Symmetry¶; For efficiency, Psi4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the ; state of water cation, we can specify. SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]; in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse.

Charge & Multiplicity; If two integers charge multiplicity are encountered on any; line of the molecule block, they are interpreted as the molecular charge; and multiplicity (), respectively.

In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice for symbol.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier.

If no unique axis is specified, Psi4 will choose an appropriate; subgroup.; Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational; frequencies, might lower the symmetry of the molecule. When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the ; state of water cation, we can specify. SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]; in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state.

The use of fixed values and variables are supported for both. For; example, the geometry for H2 can be specified a number of ways, using the; molecule optional_molecule_name {...} block.; molecule {; H; H 1 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H; H 1 r; r = 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H1; H2 H1 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 -r; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.45; }. Blank lines are ignored and, unlike regular Python syntax, indentation within; the molecule block does not matter, although the molecule keyword itself must; be aligned within the input according to standard Python syntax.

For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; Psi4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. Psi4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragements. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }.

See freq-isotope for about; the only use to which isotopologs can presently be put in Psi4. PubChem Database¶; Obtaining rough starting guess geometries can be burdensome. The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, Psi4 can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem] database.; For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; Psi4 to search PubChem for a starting structure. The search is actually; performed for compounds whose name contains “benzene”, so multiple; entries will be returned. If the name provided (“benzene” in the above; example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used. If no; exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier; (CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more; specific name. For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a; compound whose name(s) contain “benzene”, but we’re not sure of the exact IUPAC; name, the following input can be used:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene*; }. Appending the “*” prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time; of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file:; Chemical ID IUPAC Name; 241 benzene; 7371 benzenesulfonic acid; 91526 benzenesulfonate; 244 phenylmethanol; 727 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane; 240 benzaldehyde; 65723 benzenesulfonohydrazide; 74296 N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide; 289 benzene-1,2-diol; 243 benzoic acid; 7370 ben",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/psithonmol-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/psithonmol-1.html

Note that some of these results do not contain the string “benzene”; these; compounds have synonyms containing that text. We can now replace the; “benzene*” in the input file with one of the above compounds using either the; IUPAC name or the CID provided in the list, viz:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:637563; }. or; molecule benzene {; pubchem:1-methoxy-4-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]benzene; }. Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, Psi4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjuction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, Psi4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

In this case, the charge and multiplicity of each interacting fragment is; explicitly specified. If the charge and multiplicity are specified for the; first fragment, it is assumed to be the same for all fragments. When; considering interacting fragments, the overall charge is simply the sum of all; fragment charges, and any unpaired electrons are assumed to be coupled to; yield the highest possible value.; Having defined a molecule containing fragments like eneyne above, it; is a simple matter to perform calculations on only a subset of the; fragments. For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene; fragment alone (extract_subsets(1) pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms; and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the; ethyne fragment ghosted (extract_subsets(1,2) pulls out fragment 1 as; Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. extract_subsets(2,[1,3]):; mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'). clean(). mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf'). If the molecule contains fragments but is not conveniently ordered for the; -- marker, the auto_fragments() function can be applied, as shown in; pywrap-basis, to return as active molecule the previous; active molecule, only fragmented.

Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

Note that some of these results do not contain the string “benzene”; these; compounds have synonyms containing that text.

Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, Psi4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjuction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, Psi4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the ; state of water cation, we can specify. SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]; in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse.

For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; Psi4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. Psi4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragements. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }.

See Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments for details. Multiple Molecules¶; To facilitate more elaborate computations, it is possible to provide a name for; each molecule and tell Psi4 which one should be used in a given; calculation. For example, consider the following input file:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; energy('scf') # on H2. clean(). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; energy('scf') # on H.

See freq-isotope for about; the only use to which isotopologs can presently be put in Psi4. PubChem Database¶; Obtaining rough starting guess geometries can be burdensome. The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, Psi4 can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem] database.; For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; Psi4 to search PubChem for a starting structure. The search is actually; performed for compounds whose name contains “benzene”, so multiple; entries will be returned. If the name provided (“benzene” in the above; example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used. If no; exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier; (CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more; specific name. For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a; compound whose name(s) contain “benzene”, but we’re not sure of the exact IUPAC; name, the following input can be used:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene*; }. Appending the “*” prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time; of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file:; Chemical ID IUPAC Name; 241 benzene; 7371 benzenesulfonic acid; 91526 benzenesulfonate; 244 phenylmethanol; 727 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane; 240 benzaldehyde; 65723 benzenesulfonohydrazide; 74296 N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide; 289 benzene-1,2-diol; 243 benzoic acid; 7370 ben",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.0.0/psithonmol.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.0.0/psithonmol.html

Note that some of these results do not contain the string “benzene”; these; compounds have synonyms containing that text. We can now replace the; “benzene*” in the input file with one of the above compounds using either the; IUPAC name or the CID provided in the list, viz:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:637563; }. or; molecule benzene {; pubchem:1-methoxy-4-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]benzene; }. Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, Psi4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjuction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, Psi4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }. In this case, the charge and multiplicity of each interacting fragment is; explicitly specified. If the charge and multiplicity are specified for the; first fragment, it is assumed to be the same for all fragments. When; considering interacting fragments, the overall charge is simply the sum of all; fragment charges, and any unpaired electrons are assumed to be coupled to; yield the highest possible value.; Having defined a molecule containing fragments like eneyne above, it; is a simple matter to perform calculations on only a subset of the; fragments. For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene; fragment alone (extract_subsets(1) pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms; and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the; ethyne fragment ghosted (extract_subsets(1,2) pulls out fragment 1 as; Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. extract_subsets(2,[1,3]):; mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'). clean(). mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf'). If the molecule contains fragments but is not conveniently ordered for the; -- marker, the auto_fragments() function can be applied, as shown in; pywrap-basis, to return as active molecule the previous; active molecule, only fragmented.

Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic.

One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; Psi4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods.

This can be done simply in the input by adding “-decontract” to the; name of the primary basis you want to use for the calculation as detailed in; Decontracted Basis Sets. Publications resulting from the use; of X2C should cite the following publication: [Verma:2015]. Theory¶; X2C is based on exact decoupling of; positive-energy ( ; ) and negative-energy ( ); blocks of the Dirac Hamiltonian (). The transformation ( ) is obtained from the solutions of the Dirac equation in kinetically balanced basis [Kutzelnigg:1984] treatment.; In the X2C treatment, the positive-energy block of the Hamiltonian ( ); is given by the sum; of a transformed kinetic () and potential energy ( ) contribution.; Relativistic kinetic energy ( ) and nuclear-electron interaction potential ( ) is given interms of non-relativisitc kinetic () energy and nuclear-electron interaction potential (), coupling matrix ( ) and renormalization matrix ( ).

These options will perform the SAPT computation with DF-HF and a; superposition-of-atomic-densities guess. This is the preferred method of; running the SAPT module. SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions.

Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the ; approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron; pair between monomers.; The approximation is usually pretty good, but may; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate these deviations, Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommend to scale all approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. where the recommended exponent is .

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions.

MP2 Natural Orbitals¶; One of the unique features of the SAPT module is its ability to use; MP2 natural orbitals (NOs) to speed up the evaluation of the triples; contribution to dispersion. By transforming to the MP2 NO basis, we can; throw away virtual orbitals that are expected to contribute little to the; dispersion energy. Speedups in excess of are possible.

Charge-Transfer in SAPT¶; It is possible to obtain the stabilization energy of a complex due to; charge-transfer effects from a SAPT computation. The charge-transfer energy; can be computed with the SAPT module as described by Stone; and Misquitta [Misquitta:2009:201].; Charge-transfer energies can be obtained from the following calls to the; energy function.; energy('sapt0-ct'); energy('sapt2-ct'); energy('sapt2+-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3-ct'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)-ct'). A SAPT charge-transfer analysis will perform 5 HF computations: the dimer; in the dimer basis, monomer A in the dimer basis, monomer B in the dimer; basis, monomer A in the monomer A basis, and monomer B in the monomer B; basis.
