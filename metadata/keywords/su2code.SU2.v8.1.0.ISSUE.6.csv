At any boundary that is not a Neumann-zero boundary ($\nabla \vec{V} \cdot \hat{n} = 0$) the gradients computed are incorrect, as they are all computed assuming that at boundaries $\vec{q}_i = \vec{q}_j$. . For example, for a Riemann boundary condition we have a certain imposed external state $\vec{q}_e$ but this is not considered in the computation of gradients. In my experience, this issue is exacerbated when using MUSCL reconstruction at corners shared by walls and Riemann boundaries, particularly in NICFD cases, as it can cause divergence of the solver and/or unphysical solutions. . **Describe the solution you'd like**. The solution is not easy as ideally it would require storing all ""external"" states for the computation of gradients. One may need to choose if swapping the order of the computation of boundary residuals and of gradients to avoid double computations, but it may be inefficient for MPI. **Describe alternatives you've considered**. One could also disable MUSCL at corner/boundary nodes which would require saving which points are corners. This is a 1st order approximation locally, but my opinion is that the current assumption that $\vec{q}_i = \vec{q}_j$ is also lower order. Another possibility is correcting boundaries after they have been computed by summation/subtraction, before the upwind residual computations. **Additional context**",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2285

The problem is that the sliding plane in SU2 works only for absolute frame. In relative frame, the grid is not rotating, so the interpolation at sliding interface is not changed as time step is marching. The proposed changes rotate the sliding interface in accordance with physical time steps to perform interpolation. This function is activated only for relative frame. The grid itself is not rotating.; Currently, this is only implemented in CNearestneighbor class, other interpolation method should be changed as well in the near future. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

There is a problem in the `pysu2_nastran.py` script when reading the SET1 section from Nastran .f06 output files. The current implementation of the function that reads the SET1 section is insufficient for more complex, such as 3D, mesh structures. In the tutorial, a simple airfoil case is used with a mesh consisting of 123 surface nodes, which works fine. However, for more complex mesh structures, the SET1 section in the Nastran .f06 file includes additional lines with dates, headers, and the Nastran program's name. These extra lines cause issues while reading the SET1 section, leading to errors in processing the file. https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials/blob/master/multiphysics/unsteady_fsi_python/Ma01/modal.f06. line 376 starts with SET1. There is no additional line between the SET1 ID's. But for more complex mesh, additional lines look like this:.

There is a problem in the `pysu2_nastran.py` script when reading the SET1 section from Nastran .f06 output files. The current implementation of the function that reads the SET1 section is insufficient for more complex, such as 3D, mesh structures. In the tutorial, a simple airfoil case is used with a mesh consisting of 123 surface nodes, which works fine. However, for more complex mesh structures, the SET1 section in the Nastran .f06 file includes additional lines with dates, headers, and the Nastran program's name. These extra lines cause issues while reading the SET1 section, leading to errors in processing the file. https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials/blob/master/multiphysics/unsteady_fsi_python/Ma01/modal.f06. line 376 starts with SET1. There is no additional line between the SET1 ID's. But for more complex mesh, additional lines look like this:.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323:32,Availability,robust,robustness,32,"## Proposed Changes; To improve robustness of the SU2 code, specifically when using the SST (1994/2003) model, we would like to suggest a slight modification to the lower limits of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and the specific turbulent dissipation rate (Omega). Presently, the lower limits are given as follows:; TKE_LoweLimit = 1E-10; Omega_LowerLimit = 1E-4. Estimating if these lower limits are sufficiently low is very difficult.; They may be too high. This is certainly the case whether one runs in a dimensional or non-dimensional mode. It may be sufficiently low for one mode but marginally low for the second mode. Therefore, we suggest clipping the solution relative to the TKE and Omega freestream values such that:. TKE_LowerLimit = C_k * TKE_infinity; Omega _LowerLimit = C_w * Omega_infinity. Where C_k and C_w are constants. . The control over these constants is given to the user, However based on our 20 years of experience with the k-w models, Omega will not drop below 1E-3 * Omega_infinity (converged solution). However, in the process of convergence, it may reach lower values. Therefore, a value of . C_w = 1E-6. is reasonable. The solution of TKE is not very sensitive to C_K (assume it is sufficiently low). We recommended:. C_K = 1E-20. setting these as default values. . ## Related Work; Results of the change on convergence of VFE2 test case are presented. Two configurations of CFL adaptation were tested on both the original and modified lower limit code, ; 1. CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.99, 1.005, 5.0, 50.0, 0.0001 ) named max CFL 50 ; 2.

Presently, the lower limits are given as follows:; TKE_LoweLimit = 1E-10; Omega_LowerLimit = 1E-4. Estimating if these lower limits are sufficiently low is very difficult.; They may be too high. This is certainly the case whether one runs in a dimensional or non-dimensional mode. It may be sufficiently low for one mode but marginally low for the second mode. Therefore, we suggest clipping the solution relative to the TKE and Omega freestream values such that:. TKE_LowerLimit = C_k * TKE_infinity; Omega _LowerLimit = C_w * Omega_infinity. Where C_k and C_w are constants. . The control over these constants is given to the user, However based on our 20 years of experience with the k-w models, Omega will not drop below 1E-3 * Omega_infinity (converged solution). However, in the process of convergence, it may reach lower values. Therefore, a value of . C_w = 1E-6. is reasonable. The solution of TKE is not very sensitive to C_K (assume it is sufficiently low). We recommended:. C_K = 1E-20. setting these as default values. . ## Related Work; Results of the change on convergence of VFE2 test case are presented.

Hi all,. I posted this on the CFD forum, and one of the members mentioned it may be a bug and post it here. . I am simulating flow over an inlet at hypersonic speeds (Mach 7) in 2D using the JST scheme. I have done a mesh convergence study with an inviscid simulation and the residuals go to machine accuracy for all the meshes and works fine. I am using the Navier-Stokes solver for the viscous simulations. I have 5 meshes (very_coarse, coarse, medium, fine, very_fine) to do a mesh convergence study. The very_coarse (VC) and coarse (C) meshes converge to a residual rho of -8.5 and -9 with Cauchy on drag = -10 orders of magnitude. The finer meshes barely converge to -4 to -5, before increasing -2 where they plateau. For all of the meshes (including the converged VC and C), there is an abnormal region with a higher Mach number at the leading edge (11 for VC and 9 for C). Following one of the discussion on the CFD forum (https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2/142261-anomalous-mach-number.html), I extended the domain around the leading edge, but that had no effect on this region. I played around with the 2nd and 4th coefficients in the scheme; the 4th coefficient has not effect on this region. Increasing 2nd coefficient smooths discontinuities, so it decreases the Mach number in those regions but its still higher than freestream.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2336:175,Usability,simpl,simple,175,"Hello Everyone,. I’m having an issue implementing internal surfaces in SU2. It appears there is a bug in the software that is causing this to not function correctly. I have a simple channel geometry that runs with no issues as expected. However, when I define two internal boundaries, “internal1” and “internal2”, without changing anything else in the simulation, the simulation mysteriously crashes after about 20 or so iterations. This is the marker that I’m using:. MARKER_INTERNAL= ( internal1, internal2 ). Both meshes, and the .cfg file I’m using along with a few images for reference can be found using the following Dropbox link:. https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/3zu5myyz7v1cuj7m9zlk6/AJKklmqLz18EWubfYeAK_qk?rlkey=g9tyoo6oi5i03e26wabrdftyc&dl=0.

This is the modified version of SU2 code that supports CUDA usage for the FGMRES solver and the use of NVBLAS. The main focus is the offloading of the Matrix Vector Product in the FGMRES solver to the GPU using CUDA Kernels. This implementation shows promise with marginally better run times (all benchmarks were carried out with the GPU Error Checking switched off and in debug mode to check if the correct functions were being called). The use of NVBLAS is secondary and while functionality has been added to make it usable, it is not activated as it doesn't cause an appreciative increase in performance. ## Compilation and Usage. Compile using the following MESON Flag; ```; -Denable-cuda=true; ```; And activate the functions using the following Config File Option; ```; ENABLE_CUDA=YES; ```. ## NOTE ON IMPLEMENTATION. I've decided to go with a single version of the code where the CPU and GPU implementations co-exist in the same linear solver and can be disabled or switched using a combination of Meson and Config File options. This is why I have defined three classes - one over-arching class that is named CExecutionPath that has two child classes - CCpuExecution and CGpuExecution. These child classes contain the correct member function for each path - CPU or GPU functioning. . All of this could also be easily achieved with an if statement that switches between the two - but that particular implementation will access and run the statement for each call. In our case once a Matrix Vector Product object is created, it will immediately know whether to use CPU or GPU mode of execution. .

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2347:1117,Availability,recover,recover,1117,"We have used SU2 and SU2-NEMO to predict the heat flux for various shapes in a high-speed flow. Something we have observed is that SU2 requires an extremely small first cell spacing to get an accurate and grid-independent prediction for heat flux.

When no restart file is provided, the first inner iterations have Time_Iter=0 and Cur_Time=0 (the state **before** these inner iterations). After completion of this time iteration, a file `flow_00000.vtu` and all others are outputted. These files are _not_ the initial condition as specified by the configuration file -- they seem to actually be the solution after the first time step. This can be reproduced easily in the config file I have attached to this issue (an updated version of TestCases/plunging_naca0012 for SU2 v8).
