Note that both contents and errors(if any) are scaled.; This function uses the services of TH1::Add. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you intend to use the errors of this histogram later; you should call Sumw2 before making this operation.; This is particularly important if you fit the histogram after TH1::Scale. One can scale an histogram such that the bins integral is equal to; the normalization parameter via TH1::Scale(Double_t norm), where norm; is the desired normalization divided by the integral of the histogram. If option contains ""width"" the bin contents and errors are divided; by the bin width. Bool_t CanExtendAllAxes() const; returns true if all axes are extendable. UInt_t SetCanExtend(UInt_t extendBitMask); make the histogram axes extendable / not extendable according to the bit mask; returns the previous bit mask specifying which axes are extendable. void SetDefaultBufferSize(Int_t buffersize = 1000); static function to set the default buffer size for automatic histograms.; When an histogram is created with one of its axis lower limit greater; or equal to its upper limit, the function SetBuffer is automatically; called with the default buffer size

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content describes the ability of histograms to be extended in terms of their axes limits, ensuring that they can grow as needed. This relates directly to the concept of availability in software systems where systems must be able to handle growth and expansion without failing. The algorithm discussed scales histograms correctly and handles errors (Sumw2) which are important for maintaining reliability. The focus on making histograms extendable aligns with the idea of a system being ready to perform its functions when required through fault tolerance and recovery.","

",True,"The content includes several function declarations and definitions related to object operations such as printing, saving, resetting, setting bits, streaming, error handling, testing bits, using styles, issuing warnings, writing objects, and managing classes. These functions are typical in software systems for ensuring correct operation and reliability, contributing to availability by minimizing downtime through efficient operations and proper error management. The presence of methods like 'TestBit' and 'SetDrawOption' indicate features that maintain system functionality, aligning with the description of availability. Additionally, functions such as 'SysError' and 'Warning' handle issues without causing permanent outages, which is in line with maintaining readiness. Overall, these functions support the quality attribute of Availability by ensuring the system remains operational and responsive.","

",True,"The content provided appears to be a series of code statements related to writing various histograms and distributions in a ROOT file. This involves checking conditions based on usage flags ('Use'), which then write different histograms depending on their availability. The lines show conditional checks for each histogram type, indicating that the system is ready to perform its function (writing histograms) when required. This suggests that the system's readiness is ensured through these writes, contributing to availability by ensuring necessary functionalities are accessible and properly written. Additionally, error and significance histograms, as well as probability ones, are also being written, further supporting the aspect of fault handling and recovery. Therefore, this content aligns with the quality attribute of Availability as it demonstrates the system's ability to perform its required functions reliably.","
