",True,"The provided content discusses an issue in the scanpy library where setting figure parameters causes an infinite loop when run from IPython due to an interaction between matplotlib and IPython's display settings. The problem arises because IPython is trying to set matplotlib formats, leading to a loop that can only be exited by pressing Ctrl+D. By adding a conditional check to only execute this code if running from IPython, the infinite loop can be avoided. This situation directly relates to the integrability of the system components, as it involves integrating scanpy with other tools like IPython and matplotlib. The problem highlights compatibility issues between different libraries, which is a key aspect of what Integrability measures. Additionally, this issue could hinder the ability to integrate scanpy with other scripts or environments, further supporting its relevance to Integrability.","

4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided is a log describing an error encountered when running the `sc.tl.ingest()` function in Scanpy. The user mentions that they are attempting to transfer labels from a reference dataset (adata_ref) to a query dataset (adata). They have subsetted both datasets to the same features and performed basic processing, including PCA, UMAP, and generating neighbor graphs. However, when running `sc.tl.ingest()`, they receive a ValueError stating that all input arrays must have the same shape. The minimal code sample provided includes steps where both datasets are processed similarly, but there might be an issue with how they're being combined or formatted for ingestion. This suggests that there's an integration problem between the two datasets, specifically related to the shapes of their data matrices. Since `ingest` is a functionality used for integrating datasets (as per Scanpy documentation), this log relates directly to the 'Integrability' quality attribute because it involves combining systems/components, in this case, datasets. The error points to a shape mismatch, which touches on interface compatibility and data structure alignment—key aspects of integrability. Therefore, the content accurately reflects issues related to integrating the two datasets, thus aligning with the Integrability quality attribute.","

There is a chance that this can also be solved with an import from UMAP.; https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/07606455c524b38c4efec475a0d7ba87251754bb/scanpy/tools/_umap.py#L107. As just discussed, @Koncopd, can you look into this and make a PR that gets rid of the umap legacy code?. Thank you so much!; Alex. PS: Just wrote an explanation for the reasons why I intorduced the duplicated code in the first place.; > The duplicated code in Scanpy came about as I wanted to very quickly move forward with a version 1.0 of Scanpy about a year ago. UMAP was just becoming available on GitHub and there wasn’t even a preprint, I think. It changed very quickly and there were dramatic bugs every now and then. Nonetheless it was clear that it’s a major improvement over existing solutions, both in terms of computational performance, quality of the result and ease of installation and use. I wanted to achieve two things: (i) I had to rewrite some parts of UMAP so that I could decompose it a neighbors computing and a dedicated embedding step; you know that in Scanpy, the neighborhood graph is used for many other things other than for the embedding (clustering and trajectory inference). I also added the Gaussian kernel solution that I had before switching to a “UMAP backend” for `pp.neighbors`; which was needed so that results for DPT could be reproduced. All of this would have been quite a discussion with Leland. Until we would have had settled on the “Scanpy needs” that certainly weren’t aligned with the development of an independent young package, PRs would have been integrated to much time would have been lost. Finally, I wanted absolute reproducibility for Scanpy users, which could only be achieved by “freezing the code”. So, I asked Leland whether he is OK if I add a frozen version of umap as an intermediate solution.",integrat,MatchSource.ISSUE,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/522:2076,integrated,2076,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/522,1,['integrat'],['integrated'],"The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks.

It seems very straightforward and would be the most simple way to integrate two modalities on the graph. We would make great use of it in Squidpy (rna counts+image), but I think it should live in Scanpy becasue it could be useful for other multi-modal data. This is a duplicate of #1107 and it has been extensively discussed in #1117 . In the latter however, lots of thought went into normalization/processing which is superfluous for this case as it is only specific for CITE-seq data. Here we'd just want to allow users to get partitions out of multiple graphs. This could be done in two ways:; - adding arguments to existing `tl.leiden`, so that it accepts multiple graphs and multiple resolutions params per graph.; - creating a separate function `sc.tl.leiden_multiplex`.; Any thoughts on this @ivirshup @Koncopd ?. I think @WeilerP also had some thoughts along these lines. Have you ever tried this out? is there any other analysis tool you explored with a simlar purpose? Would be interested to hear your thoughts!; worth mentioning that another approach, the WNN from seurat, was also mentioned here: https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/pull/1117#issuecomment-777020580; although am not sure how much work that requries.

But if we want to compare gene expression in control-treat experiment in single-cell level, sometimes this happens. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30337666/89102998-08927480-d441-11ea-9068-3d7f09ab26a3.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30337666/89103003-1942ea80-d441-11ea-8a6f-091a6cd2f19b.png). It's hard for us to estimate up or down regulation of this gene in different group of cells because colors with same value in the two figures are not consistent. Plotting the two figures with same colorbar range can solve it. So, I want to know that are there parameters solving it in scanpy.pl.umap or some matplotlib methods that can be integrated with Scanpy?. Thank you very much!

Data:

Content: @fidelram . As noted in #1632, dotplot labels can often extend outside of the plotted area. Whether the full labels can be seen is dependent on how the plots are being output. It would be great if this always worked. <details>; <summary> Example from the docs: </summary>. ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8238804/107312688-122e2080-6ae5-11eb-8a7e-f61c51a8392c.png). </details>. Could possibly be solved by using `matplotlib`'s `constrained_layout` or `tight_layout`. I think these would require modifying how the grid spec and axes are created.

Integrability,"Can we use Dask to speed up the preprocessing phase of Scanpy by taking advantage of multiple CPUs (or GPUs)?. **TLDR**: Dask can speed up Zheng17, but it needs lots of cores and a rewritten implementation. CuPy (for GPUs) has missing operations required by Zheng17, so more work is needed for Dask with GPUs. ### Investigation. Dask is mainly used with dense arrays, however the arrays in Scanpy are sparse (for most of the preprocessing phase at least). I tried looking at [pydata sparse](https://sparse.pydata.org/en/latest/) with Dask, but it ran a lot slower than regular [`scipy.sparse`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html) (which is what Scanpy uses). So I wrote a [wrapper](https://github.com/tomwhite/scanpy/blob/sparse-dask/scanpy/sparsearray/_scipy_sparse.py) around `scipy.sparse` to implement NumPy's `__array_function__` protocol. This allows sparse arrays to be chunks in a Dask array. This approach seemed promising, with basic operations able to take take advantage of multiple cores and run faster than regular `scipy.sparse`. However, when I first tried running the whole Zheng17 recipe, `scipy.sparse` was always faster than Dask with `scipy.sparse`, even with many cores (e.g. 64). It turned out that by using Anndata arrays, Dask has to materialize intermediate data more than is necessary in order to populate the Anndata metadata. This is because the way Anndata works means that its metadata must be computed eagerly after each operation in the Zheng17 recipe, rather than lazily for the whole computation (which is the way Dask works). To avoid this complication I rewrote the Zheng17 recipe to do all the NumPy array computations and then construct an Anndata representation at the end,; to take advantage of Dask's deferred processing of lazy values.

Content: Can we use Dask to speed up the preprocessing phase of Scanpy by taking advantage of multiple CPUs (or GPUs)?. **TLDR**: Dask can speed up Zheng17, but it needs lots of cores and a rewritten implementation. CuPy (for GPUs) has missing operations required by Zheng17, so more work is needed for Dask with GPUs. ### Investigation. Dask is mainly used with dense arrays, however the arrays in Scanpy are sparse (for most of the preprocessing phase at least). I tried looking at [pydata sparse](https://sparse.pydata.org/en/latest/) with Dask, but it ran a lot slower than regular [`scipy.sparse`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html) (which is what Scanpy uses). So I wrote a [wrapper](https://github.com/tomwhite/scanpy/blob/sparse-dask/scanpy/sparsearray/_scipy_sparse.py) around `scipy.sparse` to implement NumPy's `__array_function__` protocol. This allows sparse arrays to be chunks in a Dask array. This approach seemed promising, with basic operations able to take take advantage of multiple cores and run faster than regular `scipy.sparse`. However, when I first tried running the whole Zheng17 recipe, `scipy.sparse` was always faster than Dask with `scipy.sparse`, even with many cores (e.g. 64). It turned out that by using Anndata arrays, Dask has to materialize intermediate data more than is necessary in order to populate the Anndata metadata. This is because the way Anndata works means that its metadata must be computed eagerly after each operation in the Zheng17 recipe, rather than lazily for the whole computation (which is the way Dask works). To avoid this complication I rewrote the Zheng17 recipe to do all the NumPy array computations and then construct an Anndata representation at the end,; to take advantage of Dask's deferred processing of lazy values. (See https://github.com/tomwhite/scanpy/blob/sparse-dask/scanpy/preprocessing/_dask_optimized.py#L115 for the code.). With this change, running on the 1M neurons dataset with 64 cores `scipy.sparse` tak

Data:

Content: Currently, `sc.tl.louvain` etc return cluster assignments as a Categorical with dtype `str` resulting in incompatibility with matplotlib color sequences. For example, the following code raises a ValueError:. ```python; import numpy as np; import scanpy as sc; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. adata = sc.AnnData(np.random.normal(size=(100,2))); sc.pp.neighbors(adata); sc.tl.louvain(adata); plt.scatter(adata.X[:,0], adata.X[:,1], c=adata.obs['louvain']); ```. The error is: `ValueError: RGBA values should be within 0-1 range`. Funnily enough, this used to work due to a bug in matplotlib that was fixed in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/13913. Note, the following code works as intended:. ```python; plt.scatter(adata.X[:,0], adata.X[:,1], c=adata.obs['louvain'].astype(int)); ```. I would have submitted a PR changing this behavior had I not noticed that returning cluster assignments as `str` is explicitly checked here:. https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/78125e6355c0cd2c4ae930495829282eea6f4a52/scanpy/tools/_utils_clustering.py#L11-L23. This brings up a larger design question in scanpy / anndata: *Why are arrays of numerics routinely converted to strings representing numbers?*. In `https://github.com/theislab/anndata/issues/311` I found a case where converting arrays of numerics to strings creates a bug when assigning to AnnData `obsm` with DataFrames with a RangeIndex. In that case, I understand there's a desire to avoid ambiguity in positional vs label indexing, but that issue was solved in pandas with the `.loc` and `.iloc` conventions. Why not carry that forward?. In this case, why not just return cluster assignments as arrays of numerics as is done in `sklearn.cluster`? . I think following these conventions will make both tools much more accessible to the general Python data science community.

Content: Hey,; while writing tests for #1715 I noted the following behavior:. `output = sc.pp.highly_variable(adata,inplace=True,subset=False,n_top_genes=100)`; --> Returns nothing :heavy_check_mark: ; --> `adata.var` fields are updated but shape stays the same :heavy_check_mark: . `output = sc.pp.highly_variable(adata,inplace=True,subset=True,n_top_genes=100)`; --> Returns nothing :heavy_check_mark: ; --> `adata.var` fields are updated and shape is subsetted correctly :heavy_check_mark: . `output = sc.pp.highly_variable(adata,inplace=False,subset=False,n_top_genes=100)`; --> output is a dataframe with the original number of genes as rows :heavy_check_mark: ; --> `adata` is unchanged :heavy_check_mark: . `output = sc.pp.highly_variable(adata,inplace=False,subset=True,n_top_genes=100)`; --> Returns nothing :x: ; --> `adata` shape is changed an `var` fields are updated :x: . I think the last case is unexpected, assuming that `inplace=False` should protect `adata` from changes and results in an output. I think these parts of code are the cause (depending on the flavor):. https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/4dd8de9e355ce8d59009c15522670a3d0970462c/scanpy/preprocessing/_highly_variable_genes.py#L148-L174. https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/4dd8de9e355ce8d59009c15522670a3d0970462c/scanpy/preprocessing/_highly_variable_genes.py#L528-L553. To fix this, one could change `if subset or inplace:` to `if inplace:`. Then one would need to add another `if subet:` in the `else` block, like so (half-pseudocode):. ```; if inplace: ; ; #update adata; ; if batch_key is not None:; #drop batch related keys; if subset:; adata._inplace_subset_var(df['highly_variable'].values); else:; if batch_key is None:; #drop batch related keys; if subset: ; df=df.iloc[df.highly_variable.values,:]; ; return df; ```. I can make a quick PR if this is the intended behavior. :slightly_smiling_face: ; best, jan.

Integrability,"Hi all,. I am trying to use `ingest` to integrate different datasets.; I found a couple of issues. - `ingest` requires that the `var_names` are the same in the reference and the new object. I can select the intersection between the datasets; however, it requires that the genes are in the same order `if not ref_var_names.equals(new_var_names)`.

Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: I can't install MulticoreTSNE, and it may not even work on python >3.6. Since we want to drop 3.6 support (#1697), it would be good to stop recommending it, and pass the n_jobs parameter to sklearn's tsne. This PR attempts to do that, along with a bunch of deprecation warnings. I've also bumped the sklearn dependency to make sure TSNE is multithreaded. Metric was added to test if n_jobs was working. Either way, it seems to be using all the cpu on my laptop. Not sure what's up with that. ## TODO:. - ~~[ ] Figure out how to get n_jobs to actually limit cpu usage~~ Leaving this up to sklearn; - [x] Test metric; - [x] Test deprecations

",True,"The content describes an error encountered while using a specific plotting function in scanpy, which leads to an AttributeError related to categorical variables during data sanitization.

This indicates potential problems in integrating different components or data structures, such as how subsets are handled and whether all necessary variables are appropriately categorized or formatted for plotting. The error points to a problem during integration of the dataset, either with data transformation steps (sanitize_anndata) or variable handling in the plotting function.

You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: I'd like to start using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) with scanpy and anndata. Pre-commit is essentially a tool that manages scripts we'd like to run before each commit, e.g. linting and formatting, so it becomes essentially impossible to forget these. I think this can allow PRs to progress faster since it gives us a way to codify formatting requirements – so we don't have to remember them – and have these checks happen locally – so we don't have to wait on CI. Of course, having these checks run depends on developers installing pre-commit, so we can also run these checks on CI ([example ci script](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml), [example run](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/38745/checks?check_run_id=1624558250)). There is a question of what things we'd like to add here. For sure: `black`. I think import checks (e.g. no unused imports) and `flake8` would be good too. We can also add custom checks for things like slow imports. I think this would be a good time to run `black` over the whole codebase so we don't have exempted files any more. My questions for the dev team:. * Does this sound good?; * Do you have more ideas for checks/ tools?. @michalk8, I saw you added this to [`squidpy`](https://github.com/theislab/squidpy/pull/203). How's the experience been there – that is, any major foot guns we should look out for? Also, are there any tools you're using (beyond the basic `black`, `isort`, `flake8`) you'd especially recommend?
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content discusses using pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting, which are tools that help enforce coding standards but do not touch on architectural concepts. It mentions specific tools like Black, Flake8, and Isort, which are code style tools rather than architectural decisions or patterns."
Integrability,"I'm not sure what t-SNE implementation is currently used in scanpy, but would it make sense to switch it to openTSNE? It's a Cython re-implementation of FIt-SNE, it's available on conda and should be very easy to depend on. As far as I understand the scanpy architecture, it builds a kNN graph and then runs downstream analysis (like UMAP or Louvain) on this kNN graph. Is that right? I suppose this is currently not implemented for t-SNE? With openTSNE it'd be easy to use the pre-built kNN graph and run t-SNE directly on that. Also, the default parameters of t-SNE in scanpy could IMHO be improved, see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x.

We had a brief discussion of this at openTSNE here https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/102. I can see four somewhat separate suggestions:. 1. switch scanpy to using openTSNE for tSNE, using already constructed kNN graph; 2. add tSNE support for `ingest` using openTSNE functionality.; 3. change default tSNE parameters (n_iter, learning rate, initialization) following openTSNE defaults.; 4. add some tSNE ""recipes"" based on https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x.

We've largely worked around this in #2063, by making louvain dependent tests optional. However, the paul15 PAGA test is difficult to extract louvian from. It checks hardcoded values based on the results of a louvain clustering. To adapt this test to use leiden, we would have to redo the tutorial and create new results. Or louvain building could be fixed, but the package is deprecated anyways.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.

Content: This PR addresses #646 by adding the option to pass a dict to the plotting functions heatmap, dotplot, matrixplot, tracksplot and stacked_violin. . Now, when `var_names` is a dictionary the `var_group_labels` and `var_group_positions` are set such that the dictionary key is a label and the group is the dict values.

Integrability,"This PR addresses issues from #979 and #1103 related to `sc.pl.dotplot` and replaces PR #1127. Furthermore, the current PR attempts to unify common code between `dotplot`, `matrixplot` and `stacked_violin` plots while at the same time adding more flexibility to the plots. . This PR also makes possible to plot fold changes, log fold changes and p-values from `sc.tl.rank_genes_groups` as suggested in #562. To achieve this the `sc.pl.dotplot`, `sc.pl.matrixplot` and `sc.pl.stacked_violin` method had been transformed into wrappers for the new `DotPlot`, `MatrixPlot` and `StackedVioling` classes. Accessing the new classes directly allows further fine tuning of the plots.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: This PR addresses issues from #979 and #1103 related to `sc.pl.dotplot` and replaces PR #1127. Furthermore, the current PR attempts to unify common code between `dotplot`, `matrixplot` and `stacked_violin` plots while at the same time adding more flexibility to the plots. . This PR also makes possible to plot fold changes, log fold changes and p-values from `sc.tl.rank_genes_groups` as suggested in #562. To achieve this the `sc.pl.dotplot`, `sc.pl.matrixplot` and `sc.pl.stacked_violin` method had been transformed into wrappers for the new `DotPlot`, `MatrixPlot` and `StackedVioling` classes. Accessing the new classes directly allows further fine tuning of the plots. The use of the `sc.pl.dotplot`, `sc.pl.matrixplot` and `sc.pl.stacked_violin` didn't change, only the new parameter `return_fig` was added.

The code changes involve moving common code to a shared location and allowing independent additions of features via new methods, which reduces redundancy and improves compatibility across different plot types.","

Data:

Content: Update to `downsample_counts` to allow downsampling total counts, similar to normalization by `cellranger aggr` (I'm pretty sure on this, there's a lot going on in their code). Additionally, enabled caching for the `numba`'d function, which cuts down on test time. As adding this feature meant renaming `target_counts` to `counts_per_cell`, this becomes a breaking change. Since it's breaking, I've also gone ahead and set `replace=False` by default as mentioned before (#340). Definitely willing to make changes. I've implemented this since I'm doing some integration work and figured it'd be nice to be able to try the basic `cellranger` strategy. Edit: The failing PAGA test occurs locally on master as well, but I don't think I broke that.

With that said, I find myself wanting to do things with scanpy that aren't currently supported. . (1) Clustering cells based on a restricted set of genes as opposed to principle components: I understand that this is a biased approach, but I find myself wanting to do this to explore datasets and how genes vary together. I believe it would aid in understanding data topology to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by looking at a subset of key genes that are picked by an expert who has domain knowledge. I think this is best integrated with a separate sc.pp.neighbors-like function that uses a gene list, as opposed to PCs. Integration into downstream plotting can be done with separate functions that have a similar name (sc.tl.umap_genelist or sc.tl.umap_sparse; sc.tl.paga_genelist or sc.tl.paga_sparse). . I envision that this would also be a nice stepping stone towards multi-modal analysis with CITE-seq. . (2) I want to use PAGA and UMAP to display my CytOF data as well as integrate scRNA-seq/CytOF data together. I saw a pre-print on bioRxiv that indicated that you are working on this aspect of PAGA/scanpy. This was very exciting to me and I am glad that this is being developed. Is it possible to access the current version of this software? . I think that major partitions identified with CytOF or scRNA-seq can be linked together providing a coarse-grained mechanism to demonstrate how heterogeneity identified with each technique relates to each other based on a given experimental time point. . (3) Histogram integration in the plotting api for QC metrics would be helpful.

",True,"The content provided describes an issue encountered when trying to read a 10x Genomics H5 file in Scanpy. The error message indicates that the file contains more than one genome, which conflicts with how legacy h5 files are structured. However, the user clarifies that this is not a legacy file but output from CR v6.0.0. This suggests that there's an issue with how the H5 file is structured or formatted for newer versions of 10x Genomics tools, possibly in terms of data organization and integration compatibility. The user also questions whether only one genome can be selected despite multiple being available, which points to a potential problem in how integrability is handled between different versions or components. The error messages and troubleshooting steps relate directly to the difficulties in integrating the dataset into the system, highlighting issues with how the data is combined or processed, aligning with the quality attribute of Integrability.","

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The code snippet provided demonstrates the integration of processed data from two sources (adata_ref and adata) by aligning their variable names and processing them together. The steps involve setting parameters for visualization, loading datasets, aligning variables, removing certain observations, and performing data integration using specific scikit-learn tools like umap and ingest. This shows how the system can be integrated with different components without violating interfaces or introducing excessive complexity. Therefore, this content accurately reflects the quality attribute of integrability by showcasing successful integration practices.","

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The provided code snippet consists of data processing steps, including the import and use of libraries like scpytoools, data manipulation using pandas-like syntax, function calls, and error handling. It appears to be example code for an ingest function in a scientific computing framework. The content focuses on how data is being prepared, manipulated, and processed, which are implementation-level details rather than discussions about software architecture. There's no mention of architectural patterns, system design, scalability, or other architectural concepts."
