",False,"The provided code snippet appears to be a C++ implementation using RooFit and ROOT. It defines a function that creates an interpolating PDF by combining Gaussian and Polynomial shapes using an algorithm called 'Alex Read'. The code includes include directives for various ROOT libraries, sets up variables for data analysis, constructs an IntegralMorph object, and plots the resulting functions. While this involves creating and analyzing mathematical models, it does not discuss any software architecture concepts such as patterns, design decisions, or system structure. Instead, it focuses on the implementation of a specific data analysis technique in particle physics.

",True,"The provided code snippet includes several variable and enum declarations related to widget management in a GUI framework. It discusses features like fSignalsBlocked, command execution, window handling, widget flags, and status bits. These elements relate to how components can be modified or adapted, such as enabling/disabling certain functionalities. The presence of modifiable flags (e.g., EEditMode) and the ability to alter widget behaviors indicate that changes can be made without significant impact, which aligns with Modifiability. Additionally, the code references inherited members and types from TGWindow and TGMdiMainFrame, suggesting a structured and adaptable system design. However, some of the content seems like debug or meta information (e.g., 'fSignalsBlocked' and status bits), which might not directly contribute to modifiable features but are part of the overall system's internal state management.

",True,"The code snippet provided appears to be part of a function that sets up configuration values for displaying web-based displays in a system. The lines show conditional logic based on command-line arguments, where if the argument is 'off', it disables certain display features. This relates to modifiability because it allows the system to adapt its behavior based on external inputs (command-line arguments) and potentially modify how different environments or configurations are handled. By changing parameters like 'Browser.Name' or 'TreeViewer.Name', the system can dynamically adjust which classes or components are used, thus showing adaptability. The code also includes checks for ports or sockets when in server mode, further indicating that modifications can be made to suit specific needs. Therefore, this content aligns with modifiability as it demonstrates how different configurations can be set and modified based on runtime conditions.","

When a coordinate in the histogram is to be filled; the method (quickly) finds which cell the coordinate belongs. It then only loops over the bins intersecting that cell to find the bin the input coordinate corresponds to. The partitioning of the histogram is updated continuously as each bin is added.

Data:

Content: am is a TH2PolyBin object. TH2PolyBin is a very simple class containing the vertices (stored as TGraphs or TMultiGraphs ) and contents of the polygonal bin as well as several related functions.; Essentially, a TH2Poly is a TList of TH2PolyBin objects with methods to manipulate them.; Bins are defined using one of the AddBin() methods. The bin definition should be done before filling.; The histogram can be filled with Fill(Double_t x, Double_t y, Double_t w) . w is the weight. If no weight is specified, it is assumed to be 1.; Not all histogram's area need to be binned. Filling an area without bins, will falls into the overflows. Adding a bin is not retroactive; it doesn't affect previous fillings. A Fill() call, that was previously ignored due to the lack of a bin at the specified location, is not reconsidered when that location is binned later.; If there are two overlapping bins, the first one in the list will be incremented by Fill().; The histogram may automatically extends its limits if a bin outside the histogram limits is added. This is done when the default constructor (with no arguments) is used. It generates a histogram with no limits along the X and Y axis.

",True,"The provided content seems to be documentation for a class related to statistical analysis, specifically handling MVA efficiencies. The methods and functions listed, such as `void SetNSignal()` and `void SetNBackground()`, appear to be about configuring aspects of the system. The data members include variables like `fBkgInput` and `fSigInput`, which likely represent inputs for background and signal calculations. This aligns with modifiability because it suggests that these components can be configured or modified to adapt to different environments or requirements. Additionally, the ability to adjust parameters like `maxLenTitle` indicates flexibility in system modification. The presence of methods such as `void UpdateCanvases()` and `void UpdateSignificanceHists()` implies that the system can dynamically update its display based on changes, further supporting modifiability.","
