Modifiability,"s. ### Describe the bug; Using pyRoot, preparing a selection string to use in TTree.GetEntries(const string * selection), it seems that a string of the type: `_value1_ <= _variable_ <= _value2_""`. should be working but insteads it returns an error: `TTreeFormula bad expression ""=_value2_""`. when other operators work just fine (no error), e.g.:. - `_value1_ < _variable_ < _value2_""`; - `_value1_ <= _variable_ < _value2_""`; - etc. I have tried with and without parentheses around the conditions. The only working solution (for now) to write: `_value1_ <= _variable_ && _variable_ <= _value2_""`. but this sensibly slows the code. ### Expected behavior; Using `_value1_ <= _variable_ <= _value2_""` should not return an error when trying to limit a variable to a closed interval, in the same way it works when limiting a variable to an open interval. ### To Reproduce; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1.

I cannot really join a .root file here, but it is just a matter of changing _Variable_1_ and _Variable_2_ of _paramList_ for 2 variables of a TTree. Also, I start the selection string with a selection of dmID but that can be removed, you just need to modify the string so that it doesn't start with _&&_. 3.

",True,"The content describes an issue where using a specific string format in PyRoot to create conditions for TTree variables is causing errors when using <= operators. The user mentions that using parentheses doesn't help and only by changing the condition to use && does it work, albeit slowly. This indicates that the system's modifiability is affected because adjusting the code to work correctly requires changes that slow down the process. The modifiability attribute deals with how easily the system can be modified, which in this case is hindered by the way expressions are parsed in PyRoot. Therefore, the content relates to modifiability as it discusses modifications needed to fix the issue.","

I propose to place additional calls into the compiled code for everyone, but these calls are not executed unless the user picks a high print level. For a low print level, there is just the minor additional cost of a branch, which moreover can be predicted very well by the CPU, so the added cost should be almost zero. Furthermore, these branches do not happen in hot code paths. Hot paths are inside the cost function (which are unaffected) and in the linear algebra routines that Minuit2 uses (which are not instrumented with debug messages). ### Positive side-effects for wrappers and frontends. An important positive side effect for wrappers like iminuit is that we could show our users debug messages, too. Right now, we cannot, because DEBUG messages can only be enabled at compile-time, not at run-time. The DEBUG messages are also problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). For wrappers like iminuit, it is important to redirect the log to its own streams that can be readout and displayed in Python, for example in a Jupyter notebook session (std::cerr and std::cout always go to the terminal and are invisible in a Jupyter notebook).

The speed here is gained by the fact only a single pass in memory is needed to deserialize *and* apply user code, rather than two.; - The intent is that this interface can be extended in the future and used by `TDataFrame`, provided we can make `TDataFrame` sufficiently fast.; - A Python-based `numpy` export interface. This exposes the (possibly serialized) memory directly as numpy arrays, allowing for efficient access to ROOT-serialized objects from the Python language.; - The `numpy` interface is low-level for Python; we intend to further explore the ideal high-level interface through projects such as https://github.com/diana-hep/plur. So indeed, lot's of experimental / internal interface work here - but we felt that (a) a sufficient amount depends on this and (b) we've demonstrated enough utility that it was time to start talking about merging. (With many thanks to @jpivarski for driving this work home with his work on a python interface!)

",True,"The content provided appears to be code snippets from a statistical analysis framework, likely using ROOT as the language. It demonstrates the creation of Gaussian PDFs and Chebyshev polynomials for background modeling in particle physics data analysis. The use of classes like RooGaussian, RooRealVar, and RooAddPdf suggests that the system is being modified to fit specific analysis needs. This involves creating, configuring, and combining different components (signals and backgrounds) with configurable fractions, which aligns with modifiability as it allows for easy adjustment of parameters and components. The code shows how systems can be extended by adding new classes or modifying existing ones to achieve different models, indicating that changes can be made without significantly altering the core system, hence supporting modifiability.","

",True,"The term 'webgui' refers to a web-based graphical user interface, which relates to system architecture and how features are presented to users. The instruction about using '--web' arguments to configure the web window output suggests that changes can be made by modifying these configurations, potentially affecting how the web interface is displayed or functions. This aligns with modifiability as it allows for adjustments in the user interface without significant rework or cost. However, this specific instruction might not cover broader modifications like adding new features but rather focuses on configuration adjustments. While related to modifiability, it's a narrow application.","

2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided content appears to be a stack trace from a debugging context in C++. It lists function calls and line numbers where errors or issues occurred during execution. This is typical of performance-related issues, such as delays or resource contention, which would affect how the system meets its timing requirements. Since performance focuses on managing event handling and response times effectively, the presence of such debug information aligns with this quality attribute. The logs indicate specific code paths that may contribute to performance bottlenecks, thereby supporting the assessment of performance metrics.","

Data:

Content:  every computer; program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary; arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.); and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain; rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can; be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at; most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original; program. AD is an alternative technique to symbolic and numerical differentiation.; These classical methods run into problems: symbolic differentiation leads; to inefficient code (unless done carefully) and faces the difficulty of; converting a computer program into a single expression, while numerical; differentiation can introduce round-off errors in the discretization; process and cancellation. Both classical methods have problems with; calculating higher derivatives, where the complexity and errors increase.; Finally, both classical methods are slow at computing the partial; derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for; gradient-based optimization algorithms.

",True,"The content provided discusses a failed test related to whitelisting a library called libtbbmalloc. This failure occurred after an update in Fedora 41 with a newer version of tbb. The issue seems to be that the test expects certain libraries to be loaded after importing ROOT, but when the system is updated, some required libraries are no longer being whitelisted correctly, leading to test failures. This aligns with performance aspects because if the necessary libraries aren't properly whitelisted, the system might not function as expected under varying loads, potentially causing performance issues or resource contention delays. The test failure could be a result of improper handling during library imports, which falls under performance since it affects how resources are managed and utilized by the system.","

Performance,"# This Pull request:; Many years ago, when I originially wrote the CholeskyDecompGenDim class, I argued that the class does not need copy constructor or assignment operator implementations because nobody would ever want to copy a decomposition. Well, it turns out that in today's world, one wants to be able to move (and potentially also copy) CholeskyDecompGenDim, so you can put it into an std::optional, for example, so you can return a std::nullopt if the decomposition state is not okay, and a decomposition otherwise. The code as it was up to this MR does not behave correctly if a CholeskyDecompGenDim is copied, moved or assigned. In the old code, if you copy or move a CholeskyDecompGenDim, you're likely to read garbage from the decomposition because of a potential for use-after-free, and/or get a double free on destruction of the object that goes out of scope later. ## Changes or fixes:; This patch fixes this shortcoming by using a std::unique_ptr<F[]> to hold the allocated memory. As a result, we can use defaulted destructor, move assignment operators and constructors, and default constructors, and just need to implement a specialized copy constructor and assignment operator. This change should be transparent to existing code, and enable new use cases, without sacrificing performance.

Content: # This Pull request:; The `RooLagrangianMorphFunc` loads its input objects from a nested set of `TFolders` stored in a `TFile`. ; This MR adds protection (inspired by [ROOT-9275](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-9275) to avoid memory leaks in the initialisation of the `RooLagrangianMorphFunc`, which for large `RooFit` workspaces with many morphing functions can otherwise become unfeasible to use. . ## Changes or fixes:; - add a `cleanUpFolder` helper method to an existing anoymous namespace to `RooLagrangianMorphFunc.cxx`, which ensures ownership is enabled for `TFolder`s loaded from `TFile`s and optionally deletes the folders after setting them up ; - add a templated `loadFromFileResidentFolder` method to the same anonymous namespace in `RooLagrangianMorphFunc.cxx`, refactoring the procedure of loading an object from a nested `TFolder` structure that was previously performed in various locations in the class. The method exploits the `cleanUpFolder` method to prevent memory leaks in the access procedure. . ## Checklist:. - [ x ] tested changes locally - confirmed leak rate massively reduced in local testing. Draft test script (not yet merged) provided by @rahulgrit retains same output as before the changes; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary) - no changes to user-accessible code. Inline doxygen documentation of new methods. . Tagging @rahulgrit @guitargeek

Content: ## Overview. RDICT files store some useful information (in particular about class offsets) in ROOT files to avoid the potentially expensive call to the interpreter if the information is not the PCH. For example, ROOT's `libGeom` and other third-party code. This is done to circumvent the costly call to `ShowMembers` which will require parsing. CxxModules diminish that benefit as providing a finer grained control over the information deserialization. We see no observable benefits in generating RDICT files next to our pcm files. . ## Performance results.

",False,"The content discusses performance optimization techniques, specifically around ROOT's RDICT files and CxxModules. It describes how these mechanisms reduce costly interpreter calls and improve deserialization efficiency. While this touches on software design decisions (e.g., when to generate RDICT files) and could relate to higher-level concerns like performance and scalability, it is primarily focused on implementation-specific optimizations rather than broader architectural principles or patterns. The discussion centers more on code-level optimizations and their impact on runtime performance, which falls under software engineering practices rather than architecture."

The showstopper issue appears to be that when looking for information about `gallery::Event` (defined in an ""old-style"" dictionary rather than a C++ module), it mistakenly identifies the TMVA module as providing `Event` and never loads the dictionary containing the definition for `gallery::Event`. This issue does not occur if we look for the aliased `gallery::GalleryEvent` instead, nor if `runtime_cxxmodules=OFF`. In addition, when `runtime_cxxmodules=ON`—even for the ""good"" case—I get many messages of the form:; ```Console; Error in <TCling::RegisterRdictForLoadPCM>: Rdict '/scratch/greenc/products/root/v6_25_02/Linux64bit+3.10-2.17-e20-p399-debug/lib/libNet_rdict.pcm' is both in Module extension and in File system.; ```.

This makes it load all the pcms which it can find, regardless of weather they are needed to read the file or not (in our case we only have branches with basic types, e.g. floats or ints or vector of thereof). ; This has the net result of adding 70MB of RSS for no particular reason to any process which uses ROOT. You can find more details in the attached instruments screenshot.; Moreover, single stepping with the debugger and printing out the LoadModule argument, it seems that the pcms for Sofie, Proof and 3D graphics are particularly honours, all of which we do not need and we do not link. ![image](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/10544/c1ee3a82-a5cc-4f64-a131-ea4fce1453c3). ### What is the expected behaviour?. The best would be for ROOT to be smart enough to lazily load the pcms when they are actually needed, not upfront. A second best option would be to be able to start the interpreter in a clean slate state and load by hand only the pcms which are needed to read a file. ### How to reproduce?. On macOS using Instruments one can do:; ; ```bash; xcrun xctrace record --output root.trace --time-limit 30s --template Allocations --launch -- /Users/ktf/src/sw/osx_arm64/ROOT/alice-v6-28-04-local2/bin/root.exe -q -b http://alimonitor.cern.ch/train-workdir/testdata/LFN/alice/data/2015/LHC15o/000246392/pass2/PWGZZ/Run3_Conversion/320_20220701-0813/AOD/019/AO2D.root; open root.trace; ```. and get the report in question. Using the alice environment should not matter, but in principle you should be able to load it from CVMFS. ### ROOT version. 6.28.04, but it's a while we see it. ### How did you install ROOT?. ALICE build environment. ### Which operating system are you using?. macOS, linux. ### Additional context. _No response_

Content: ### Check duplicate issues. - [X] Checked for duplicates. ### Description. Firstly, I realize that root 5.x is now ancient and there may be little anyone can/wants to do about this. But for the record.. NixOS now builds all packages with [`-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3`](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/09/17/gccs-new-fortification-level), and this has caused the build for our `root5` package to fail with `*** buffer overflow detected ***: terminated`. This is around the section where `loadfile.cxx` is being built and the compiler's static checks are complaining extensively about e.g. `'__builtin___snprintf_chk' output 8 or more bytes (assuming 1054) into a destination of size 1024`.

",True,"The content discusses an issue where a specific data member (fChainOffset) in a sub-tree isn't being set properly by TChain::LoadTree, which only sets its own chain offset. This affects how tree offsets are reported, causing them to incorrectly show as 0. The problem is related to resource management and how resources are utilized during the loading of trees in a chain. This issue directly impacts performance because it involves incorrect handling of offsets which can lead to misallocation of resources and timing inefficiencies when accessing data from different trees in a chain.

Using `np.asarray()` to convert an existing `RVec` object into the numpy array as suggested in the Documentation [here](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1VecOps_1_1RVec.html#RVecdoxyref) takes memory which is never freed. Created `RVec` objects inside pyROOT are also not cleaned up by the garbage collector. ### Reproducer. ```bash; python --version; Python 3.9.12; # Run as; python3 reproducer.py; ```. ```python; #reproducer.py; import ROOT; import os, psutil; import gc; import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; import tqdm; process = psutil.Process(). # to cache a lot of things; ROOT.RVec('double')(). def get_mem_usage():; gc.collect(); return process.memory_info().rss # in kbytes .

From https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-release-master/BUILDTYPE=Release,LABEL=ROOT-fedora29,V=master/353/parsed_console/; ```; CMakeFiles/RooFitCore.dir/src/InitUtils.cxx.o:InitUtils.cxx:function RooFit::InitUtils::loadComputeLibrary(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >): error: undefined reference to '__cpu_indicator_init'.

No linker error. ### To Reproduce. Build ROOT on Fedora 29. Consider adding `-lgcc` *if* needed, i.e. in the case 'yes we want / can build arch-specific compute libraries we should check whether linking calls to `__cpu_indicator_init` and `__cpu_model` need `-lgcc`, and if so, provide it to the linker invocation of `libRooFitCore`.

I am tentatively calling it a bug - because the behavior is inconsistent, but it's also possible we are missing something in selection.xml files?. ### Expected behavior; Hopefully it would work at the first try! 😄 . ### To Reproduce; For ROOT 6.26.8 ATLAS setup, on lxplus:; % source /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase/x86_64/AtlasSetup/V02-01-05/AtlasSetup/scripts/asetup.sh master,latest,Athena; % root. For ROOT master ATLAS setup (using LCG DEV3 nightly):; source /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase/x86_64/AtlasSetup/V02-01-05/AtlasSetup/scripts/asetup.sh master--dev3LCG,latest,Athena. ### Additional context; The typedef is defined in a different library than the actual class - I suspect the first call to GetClass() only loads the first library, gets the typedef definition but stops at this point. Only the second call loads the other library with the real class definition. This is not a stopper for us, but kind of annoying. ""Typedef package"" includes and selection.xml:; https://acode-browser1.usatlas.bnl.gov/lxr/source/athena/Event/xAOD/xAODMissingET/xAODMissingET/; ""Class package"" includes:; https://acode-browser1.usatlas.bnl.gov/lxr/source/athena/Event/xAOD/xAODJet/xAODJet/.

Many times the auto parsing works (but is not desirable), in some cases it fails with an unhelpful error message (in most cases so far this has been in conjunction with CUDA, by rootcling being unable to write to the `cuda.pcm` that is in cvmfs). With auto parsing disabled, we'd be able to emit an error message pointing to the class whose dictionary is missing. I gave a try on `TInterpreter::SetClassAutoparsing(false)` in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41344, and while in specific cases I got the desired behavior (of CMSSW framework emitting a descriptive error message for a missing dictionary instead of ROOT trying to auto-parse the corresponding header), the fact that the `SetClassAutoparsing()` is a global setting makes it difficult to disable the auto parsing in a useful way in the concurrent setup of CMSSW. There are a few cases (like open ROOT file, set up a string cut parser that uses ROOT reflection underneath) where the auto-parsing needs to be enabled, and these activities may be running concurrently to activities where I'd like to have the auto-parsing disabled. ### Share how it could be improved. Make the auto parsing setting more fine grained, e.g. explicitly in the relevant API calls or as a `thread_local`. Being able to query the value of the setting could be useful as well. ### How to reproduce?. A recipe to reproduce can be cooked up if necessary based on https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41344. ### ROOT version. 6.26. ### How did you install ROOT?. Part of CMSSW stack. ### Which operating system are you using?. Linux. ### Additional context. _No response_

Content: - [x] Checked for duplicates. ### Describe the bug; I have a PDF class implemented in C++ that I want to use in a python script through `ROOT.gSystem.CompileMacro()`. It is unreasonably slow to load each time, O(minutes). When running with `""kO""` option it is better, but still long - too long for normal usage - whereas it should be instantaneous, if I understand correctly. I have tested ROOT 6.22 and with nightlies, and nightlies are even slower. The time for a first compilation, so how long it's processing the line `Info in <TUnixSystem::ACLiC>: creating shared library /afs/cern.ch/user/t/tnanut/public/Stephan/RooThreshold_cpp.so`, for running a script and directly the CompileMacro command in ipython:; | Version | py file | ipython |; | --- | --- | --- |; |Nightlies | 3m25s | 1m55s |; |6.22 | 1m35s | 1m05s|. The run time with `""kO""` option for the 2nd iteration of running, once binaries are created:; | Version | py file |; | --- | --- | ; |Nightlies | 1m15s | ; |6.22 | 0m30s | . All above times are on same lxplus machine. Between different lxplus machines the timing changes, but at best e.g from 30s down to 20s. Another test for how much time has elapsed e.g.:; ```sh; for version in /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_99/x86_64-centos7-gcc10-opt/setup.sh /cvmfs/sft-nightlies.cern.ch/lcg/views/dev3/latest/x86_64-centos7-gcc9-opt/setup.sh ; do (; source $version;; echo $version;; root --version -q; /usr/bin/time python3 -c ""import ROOT; ROOT.gSystem.CompileMacro('~tnanut/public/Stephan/RooThreshold.cpp', 'fO')"" 2>&1 | grep user.*system;; /usr/bin/time python3 -c ""import ROOT; ROOT.gSystem.CompileMacro('~tnanut/public/Stephan/RooThreshold.cpp', 'fO')"" 2>&1 | grep user.*system;; /usr/bin/time python3 -c ""import ROOT; ROOT.gSystem.CompileMacro('~tnanut/public/Stephan/RooThreshold.cpp', 'O')"" 2>&1 | grep user.*system); done; ```.

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: 1. Get information for client (`Browsable::RItem` instance) directly from `Browsable::RElement`. This unifies handling of different classes in browser; before one uses extra logic to guess class functionality without creating of dedicated `Browsable::RElement` instance; 2. Fix problem with `TObject`-derived classes where `TObject` is not direct parent - like `TQClass`. Improve browsing of top ROOT folder.; 3. Provide in `RBrowser` size/modification time information for `TKey`/`TFile` instances; 4. Significantly improve `RTreeViewer` functionality. Better handle special branches like `@size`. Double-click on branch element either involves `TTree::Draw` or add proposed expression to tree viewer. Handle special symbols in branch names like `\` or `#`.; 5. Fix several bugs in usage of `GED` inside canvas. After JSROOT v7 loading of custom code is more tricky, therefore it is better to load it directly from JSROOT components - not try to select some parts from outside.; 6.

",True,"The content provided appears to be stack traces or debugging information from Python's internal execution. This type of output typically relates to how the system is handling function calls and event processing, which ties into performance aspects such as resource utilization and response times. The stack trace includes references to Python's internal functions (e.g., `_PyObject_Vectorcall`, `call_function`) and low-level details about the interpreter's operation. These elements are indicative of the system performing efficiently under various loads, aligning with performance optimization goals. Additionally, the presence of specific function call data suggests that the system is handling these operations without significant delays or bottlenecks, which supports the idea of strong performance attributes. Therefore, this content accurately reflects performance considerations within the context of software execution.","

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided is a stack trace from a debugger (gdb), which shows the point where an error occurred during execution. This indicates that there was an issue with thread locking, specifically in the pthread_rwlock_rdlock function, leading to a crash or hang. This relates to performance because it demonstrates a situation where the system's resources are being contended, affecting its ability to handle events efficiently. The stack trace analysis is part of the debugging process aimed at identifying and resolving performance issues in the system.","
