This is the same one but moved around to match the concept of efficiencies:; auto myErf1Lambda = [](double* x, double* p) ; { return (TMath::Erf((x[0]-5)/3) + 1)/2 * 0.8; };; TF1* myErf1 = new TF1(""myErf1"", myErf1Lambda, -10, 10);; myErf1->Draw();. We can re-write this using parameter notation:; auto myErf2Lambda = [](double* x, double* p) { ; return (TMath::Erf((x[0]-p[0])/p[1]) + 1)/2 * p[2]; };; TF1* myErf2 = new TF1(""myErf2"", myErf2Lambda, ; -10, 10, 3 /*number of parameters*/);; myErf2->SetParameter(0, 5.);; myErf2->SetParameter(1, 3.);; myErf2->SetParameter(2, 0.8);; myErf2->Draw();. Try out what happens when you change the values for 5, 3 and 0.8 (simply by calling myErf2->SetParameter(...);)!; Fitting a TF1; Now that we have a nice TF1 we can fit it to the TEfficiency object by calling eff->Fit(). Here is the complete code you need to add to the end of effX():; ...; void effX() {; ...; auto effErf = [](double* x, double* p) {; return (TMath::Erf((x[0] - p[0]) / p[1]) + 1) / 2. * p[2];; };. TF1* myErf = new TF1(""myErf"", effErf, 0., 10., 3);; myErf->SetParameter(0, 5.);; myErf->SetParameter(1, 5.);; myErf->SetParameter(2, 1.);. eff->Fit(myErf);; }. Parameter Initialization and Fitting; You must initialize the parameters to sensible values - this is especially important for higher dimensional fits, e.g. with a TF2. Fitting is magic, but only within limits. Try with completely bogus parameters and you'll see how the fit fails!; . ‹ 8. Efficiency Calculation; up; 10. Go Parallel! ›. Navigate through this book; 0.

Data:

Content: tEvent. Reads both from CmdTree and GuiTree and chooses that event that becomes; earlier; - fCmdTreeCounter determines actual position in fCmdTree; - fGuiTreeCounter determines actual position in fCmdTree. If GUI event should be replayed, we must first make sure that there is; appropriate mapping for this event. RETURN VALUE:; kFALSE = there is no event to be replayed; kTRUE = there is still at least one event to be replayed. Cases:; - fNextEvent = 0 => We are waiting for the appropriate; window to be registered; - fNextEvent != 0 => fNextEvent can be replayed (windows are; ready). Bool_t CanOverlap(); ButtonPress and ButtonRelease must be sometimes replayed more times; Example: pressing of a button opens small window and user chooses; something from that window (color); Window must be opened while user is choosing. void ReplayRealtime(); Replays the next event. It is called when fTimer times out.; Every time fTimer is set again to time equal to time difference between; current two events being replayed. It can happen that execution of an event lasts different time during the; recording and during the replaying.; If fTimer times out too early and the previous event has not been yet; replayed, it is usually postponed in order; to keep events execution in the right order.; The excpetions are determined by TRecorderReplaying::CanOverlap(). void Pause(TRecorder* r); Pauses replaying. void ReplayStop(TRecorder* r); Cancels replaying. void Continue(); Continues previously paused replaying. TRecorder & operator=(const TRecorderReplaying& ). TRecorder::ERecorderState GetState() const; Gets current state of recorder.

",True,"The provided code snippet discusses functions related to sorting and searching operations in a table. The functions mentioned include TTableSorter's constructors for different data types, methods like SetSimpleArray, ~TTableSorter(), BSearch, SelectSearch, GetIndex, and CountKey. These functions appear to be part of a table manipulation utility, possibly used in data processing or analysis. While the code itself is not directly discussing user interfaces, it is a fundamental component that could impact how users interact with data (e.g., by organizing and retrieving information efficiently). The connection to usability lies in ensuring that these sorting functions are easy to use, efficient, and provide features that support error recovery and user satisfaction. For instance, the presence of multiple search methods (BSearch and SelectSearch) suggests an effort towards making the tool accessible and effective for users. Additionally, the CountKey method allows for efficient key-based searches, which can enhance user productivity. The code also includes a destructor and getter methods, indicating a robust implementation that could support error recovery by properly handling memory and resources. Therefore, despite not directly discussing user interface elements, the underlying functionality contributes to usability by improving how users interact with and utilize the system's capabilities.","

Data:

Content: tions; A few assumptions need to be made for the fit procedure to be carried out: 1 The total number of events in each template is not too small (so that its Poisson uncertainty can be neglected). 2 The number of events in each bin is much smaller than the total number of events in each template (so that multinomial uncertainties can be replaced with Poisson uncertainties).; Biased fit uncertainties may result if these conditions are not fulfilled (see e.g. arXiv:0803.2711). Instantiation; A fit object is instantiated through TFractionFitter* fit = new TFractionFitter(data, mc); A number of basic checks (intended to ensure that the template histograms represent the same ""kind"" of distribution as the data one) are carried out. The TVirtualFitter object is then addressed and all fit parameters (the template fractions) declared (initially unbounded). Applying constraints; Fit parameters can be constrained through; fit->Constrain(parameter #, lower bound, upper bound);; Setting lower bound = upper bound = 0 removes the constraint (a la Minuit); however, a function fit->Unconstrain(parameter #); is also provided to simplify this. Setting parameter values; The function ROOT::Fit::Fitter* fitter = fit->GetFitter();; is provided for direct access to the ROOT::Fit::Fitter object. This allows to set and fix parameter values, limits and set step sizes directly via fitter->Config().ParSettings(parameter #).Set(const std::string &name, double value, double step, double lower, double upper);; ; Restricting the fit range; The fit range can be restricted through fit->SetRangeX(first bin #, last bin #);; and freed using fit->ReleaseRangeX();; For 2D histograms the Y range can be similarly restricted using fit->SetRangeY(first bin #, last bin #);; fit->ReleaseRangeY();; and for 3D histograms also fit->SetRangeZ(first bin #, last bin #);; fit->ReleaseRangeZ();; It is also possible to exclude individual bins from the fit through fit->ExcludeBin(bin #);; where the given bin number is ass

",True,"The provided code snippet shows functions related to monitoring and plotting data. These functions include adding points, plotting, clearing data, and checking if data exists for monitoring purposes. Additionally, variables like m_convergenceCount, m_maxConvergenceCount, and m_minError are present, which seem to track progress or convergence metrics. There are also parameters such as fLearningRate, fMomentum, fRepetitions, and MinimizerType, which are related to optimization settings in a neural network context. These elements suggest that the code is part of an optimization routine, possibly for training a DNN (Deep Neural Network). The presence of monitoring functions and convergence counters indicates that this system includes mechanisms to track and visualize the training process, ensuring effective learning and adaptability.

Usability,"variables. We assign px and py a Gaussian with mean = 0 and sigma = 1 by calling gRandom->Rannor(px,py), and calculatepz. Then we call the TTree::Fill() method. The call t1.Fill() fills all branches in the tree because we have already organized the tree into branches and told each branch where to get the value from. After this script is executed we have a ROOT file called tree1.root with a tree called t1. There is a possibility to fill branches one by one using the method TBranch::Fill(). In this case you do not need to call TTree::Fill() method. The entries can be set by TTree::SetEntries(Double_t n). Calling this method makes sense only if the number of existing entries is null.; 12.14.2 Viewing the Tree. The tree1.root file and its tree in the browser and a leaf histogram. In the right panel of the ROOT object browse are the branches: ev, px, py, pz, and random. Note that these are shown as leaves because they are “end” branches with only one leaf. To histogram a leaf, we can simply double click on it in the browser. This is how the tree t1 looks in the Tree Viewer. Here we can add a cut and add other operations for histogramming the leaves. See “The Tree Viewer”. For example, we can plot a two dimensional histogram. The tree viewer. 12.14.3 Reading the Tree; The tree1r function shows how to read the tree and access each entry and each leaf. We first define the variables to hold the read values.; Float_t px, py, pz;; Then we tell the tree to populate these variables when reading an entry.

Content: variables. We assign px and py a Gaussian with mean = 0 and sigma = 1 by calling gRandom->Rannor(px,py), and calculatepz. Then we call the TTree::Fill() method. The call t1.Fill() fills all branches in the tree because we have already organized the tree into branches and told each branch where to get the value from. After this script is executed we have a ROOT file called tree1.root with a tree called t1. There is a possibility to fill branches one by one using the method TBranch::Fill(). In this case you do not need to call TTree::Fill() method. The entries can be set by TTree::SetEntries(Double_t n). Calling this method makes sense only if the number of existing entries is null.; 12.14.2 Viewing the Tree. The tree1.root file and its tree in the browser and a leaf histogram. In the right panel of the ROOT object browse are the branches: ev, px, py, pz, and random. Note that these are shown as leaves because they are “end” branches with only one leaf. To histogram a leaf, we can simply double click on it in the browser. This is how the tree t1 looks in the Tree Viewer. Here we can add a cut and add other operations for histogramming the leaves. See “The Tree Viewer”. For example, we can plot a two dimensional histogram.

",True,"The content provided appears to be code from a method called Copy in a class related to TFormula. The code is about deep copying various properties and parameters of an object, which includes cloning and setting up dependent objects correctly. This process ensures that any changes made to the copy do not affect the original object, which directly relates to maintainability and error recovery in software. The steps involve creating new instances for linear parts by iterating through each element and performing a deep copy on them. Additionally, there are checks to delete old elements before adding new ones, ensuring memory management is efficient. Overall, this code contributes to the overall usability of the system because it ensures that operations are reliable and functions correctly even after modifications or failures. The attention to detail in copying all relevant parts prevents errors from propagating through the application.","
