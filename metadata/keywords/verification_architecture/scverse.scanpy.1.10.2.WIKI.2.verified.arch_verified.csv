1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content provided consists of configuration settings, dataset references, and function calls within a software package (Scanpy). These entries are more related to the implementation details and functional aspects of the software rather than the architectural structure. Configuration parameters like logpath, max_memory, and verbosity pertain to how the software is set up and run but do not reflect high-level design choices or architectural patterns. The presence of functions such as print_header and print_versions indicate utility functions for outputting logs or information, which are operational aspects rather than architectural. Deprecated functions and external processing tools (e.g., Bbknn, Harmony_integrate) suggest specific implementation strategies but do not discuss the overall system architecture. Plotting and exporting functionalities are about visualizing data and exporting results, again focusing on the functional side rather than architecture. The ecosystem section and documentation references point to the package's structure and usage guides, which are more about how the software is used and maintained, not its design structure. Therefore, this content does not explicitly discuss or relate to software architecture concepts."

",True,"The content provided includes references to various scanpy configuration settings and functions related to preprocessing, tools, plotting, and exporting. These settings include log paths, maximum memory usage, number of jobs, plot suffixes, verbosity levels, write directories, PCA components, and figure parameters. The deprecated functions listed (filter_genes_dispersion and normalize_per_cell) indicate that the system maintains a record of outdated or removed features. Additionally, external preprocessing pipelines like bbknn, harmony_integrate, mnn_correct, scanorama_integrate, hash solo, dca, and magic are included, which are related to data processing and integration. Tools such as phate, palantir, trimap, sam, phenograph, harmony_timeseries, wishbone, and sandbag further relate to analysis and visualization tools within the system. The presence of plotting functions like phate, trimap, sam, and wishbone_marker_trajectory suggests that the system includes capabilities for generating visualizations. Exporting features include creating project files and cell browsers, indicating functionality for outputting results. The ecosystem section refers to the broader environment and community aspects. The release notes, community news, contributing information, code practices, testing, documentation, continuous integration settings, version control, and references are part of the system's structure and support processes. Overall, while some content appears to be logs or configuration details, there is also additional descriptive text about features, tools, and functionalities that align with aspects of security such as maintaining data integrity (configuration settings), protecting against unauthorized access (deprecated features and log management), and ensuring availability through proper data processing and visualization tools.

Using other kNN libraries in Scanpy. Using other kNN libraries in Scanpy#; Since Scanpy was released, there has been quite some development in the space of approximate nearest neighbor detection.; In our example, we’re going to use Annoy:. %pip install -qU ""pip""; %pip install -q ""scanpy"" ""sklearn-ann[annoy]"". Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.; Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages. import scanpy as sc; from sklearn_ann.kneighbors.annoy import AnnoyTransformer # noqa: F401. sc.logging.print_header(). scanpy==1.10.0rc2.dev0+g48b495d9.d20240222 anndata==0.10.5.post1 umap==0.5.5 numpy==1.26.4 scipy==1.12.0 pandas==2.2.0 scikit-learn==1.4.1.post1 statsmodels==0.14.1 igraph==0.11.4 pynndescent==0.5.11. Our nearest neighbors implementation uses the PCA embedding by default, so let’s pre-compute that:. adata_default = sc.datasets.paul15(); sc.pp.pca(adata_default); adata_annoy, adata_pynnd = adata_default.copy(), adata_default.copy(). WARNING: In Scanpy 0.*, this returned logarithmized data. Now it returns non-logarithmized data. The best way to use a third-party approximate nearest neighbors implementation is to use sklearn-ann. It provides kNN Transformer classes wrapping several popular approximate nearest neighbor libraries.; Explicitly setting the transformer parameter allows customizing how this function behaves.; By default, for small datasets, Scanpy just calculates all distances.; Setting the transformer parameter to ""pynndescent"" makes Scanpy always use its d

Check that that error message is actually thrown.; Can you place bounds on the values returned by your function?; Are there different input values which should generate equivalent output (e.g. if an array is sparse or dense)?; Do you have arguments which should have orthogonal effects on the output? Check that they are independent. For example, if there is a flag for extended output, the base output should remain the same

",True,"The content provided is primarily composed of code references, function calls, and configuration settings related to Scanpy's preprocessing, plotting, and exporting functionalities. This includes mentions of specific functions like 'filter_genes_dispersion' and 'normalize_per_cell', which are part of the data processing pipeline in bioinformatics. The presence of terms such as 'DotPlot.DEFAULT_LEGENDS_WIDTH' suggests configuration settings for visualizations. While there is no direct mention of testing or validation processes, the overall context relates to the software's functionality and its various components, which indirectly contributes to testability by ensuring different modules and configurations are well-defined and accessible. Therefore, it is a True Positive as it aligns with aspects of the software's structure that facilitate testing.","

Here, we will use the original cell labels given by 10x to identify marker genes for those cell types. sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(pbmc, groupby=""clusters"", method=""wilcoxon""). Visualize marker genes using dotplot#; The dotplot visualization is useful to get an overview of the genes that show differential expression. To make the resulting image more compact we will use n_genes=4 to show only the top 4 scoring genes. sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot(pbmc, n_genes=4). In order to get a better representation we can plot log fold changes instead of gene expression. Also, we want to focus on genes that have a log fold change >= 3 between the cell type expression and the rest of cells.; In this case we set values_to_plot='logfoldchanges' and min_logfoldchange=3.; Because log fold change is a divergent scale we also adjust the min and max to be plotted and use a divergent color map. Notice in the following plot that is rather difficult to distinguish between T-cell populations. sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot(; pbmc,; n_genes=4,; values_to_plot=""logfoldchanges"",; min_logfoldchange=3,; vmax=7,; vmin=-7,; cmap=""bwr"",; ).

Content: p is commonly known as feature selection. The scanpy function pp.highly_variable_genes annotates highly variable genes by reproducing the implementations of Seurat [Satija et al., 2015], Cell Ranger [Zheng et al., 2017], and Seurat v3 [Stuart et al., 2019] depending on the chosen flavor. sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, n_top_genes=2000, batch_key=""sample""). sc.pl.highly_variable_genes(adata). Dimensionality Reduction#; Reduce the dimensionality of the data by running principal component analysis (PCA), which reveals the main axes of variation and denoises the data. sc.tl.pca(adata). Let us inspect the contribution of single PCs to the total variance in the data. This gives us information about how many PCs we should consider in order to compute the neighborhood relations of cells, e.g. used in the clustering function leiden() or tsne(). In our experience, there does not seem to be signifigant downside to overestimating the numer of principal components. sc.pl.pca_variance_ratio(adata, n_pcs=50, log=True). You can also plot the principal components to see if there are any potentially undesired features (e.g. batch, QC metrics) driving signifigant variation in this dataset. In this case, there isn’t anything too alarming, but it’s a good idea to explore this. sc.pl.pca(; adata,; color=[""sample"", ""sample"", ""pct_counts_mt"", ""pct_counts_mt""],; dimensions=[(0, 1), (2, 3), (0, 1), (2, 3)],; ncols=2,; size=2,; ).

Adding to the docs#; For any user-visible changes, please make sure a note has been added to the release notes using hatch run towncrier:create.; We recommend waiting on this until your PR is close to done since this can often causes merge conflicts.; Once you’ve added a new function to the documentation, you’ll need to make sure there is a link somewhere in the documentation site pointing to it.; This should be added to docs/api.md under a relevant heading.; For tutorials and more in depth examples, consider adding a notebook to the scanpy-tutorials repository.; The tutorials are tied to this repository via a submodule.; To update the submodule, run git submodule update --remote from the root of the repository.; Subsequently, commit and push the changes in a PR.; This should be done before each release to ensure the tutorials are up to date. docstrings format#; We use the numpydoc style for writing docstrings.; We’d primarily suggest looking at existing docstrings for examples, but the napolean guide to numpy style docstrings is also a great source.; If you’re unfamiliar with the reStructuredText (rST) markup format, check out the Sphinx rST primer.; Some key points:. We have some custom sphinx extensions activated. When in doubt, try to copy the style of existing docstrings.; We autopopulate type information in docstrings when possible, so just add the type information to signatures.; When docs exist in the same file as code, line length restrictions still apply. In files which are just docs, go with a sentence per line (for easier git diffs).; Check that the docs look like what you expect them too! It’s easy to forget to add a reference to function, be sure it got added and looks right. Look at sc.tl.louvain as an example for everything mentioned here. Plots in docstrings#; One of the most useful things you can include in a docstring is examples of how the function should be used.; These are a great way to demonstrate intended usage and give users a template
