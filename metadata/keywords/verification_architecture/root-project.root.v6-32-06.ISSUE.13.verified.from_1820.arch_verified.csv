This PR is the first step in using pure clang based reflection API in meta, and part of eventually integrating the JITCall and DynamicLibraryManager infrastructure. Adopting more of CppInterOp in ROOT will help simplify the LLVM migration process and allow us to upstream more patches to either CppInterOp or LLVM.

The integral of the `RooGenericPdf` should have the same value servers,; but it doesn't. Instead, it uses the leaves of the computation graph:; ```; (0x7ffc9b9bf798,-S) RooRealVar::x """"; (0x7ffc9b9bec88,--) RooRealSumPdf::pdf """"; (0x7ffc9b9bfb80,V-) RooRealVar::par """"; (0x55ac51984c50,V-) RooConstVar::10 ""10""; (0x55ac531cd470,V-) RooConstVar::2 ""2""; ```. That means, the direct value server `par_mod` is **skipped** now,; misrepresenting the client-server relationship. The new BatchMode makes strong use of the value-server interface for the; `RooFitDriver`, so it's very sensitive to `RooRealIntegrals` getting it; wrong. That's why this commit suggests to change the logic in `RooRealIntegral`; to always add the next direct value servers that don't depend on the; integration variable, and not the leaves. A unit test that verifies that the value servers of the integral are the; mathematically direct value servers and not the computation graph leaves; is also implemented. Closes https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11578. The PR also fixes the same problem for the RooProjectedPdf, which is essentially a integral wrapper but it also got the server-client interface wrong. Now, it simply takes over the shape and value servers from the underlying integral, which is now implemented correctly.

Without this fix, users would encounter broken links or incorrect content, leading to frustration and inefficiency. Therefore, this content is a true positive for the Usability quality attribute.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: curls default behaviour is to not follow HTTP redirects, resulting in some of the tutorials not functioning as users attempt to operate on HTML error pages rather than valid ROOT files. A specific example prior to this commit would be the URL for ClassificationKeras.py. Since it's impossible to know in advance which URL's might end up having redirects in the future, I've simply added '-L' to every invocation of CURL (including in a few tests) which should prevent any issues in the future and otherwise work exactly the same for files which don't have redirects today. (curl behaviour tested on Ubuntu 20.04)
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.

Even though it clearly ""publicly"" depends on those headers. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/math/vecops/inc/ROOT/RVec.hxx#L54. ### Expected behavior. When using the exported target `ROOT::ROOTVecOps`, I would expect to be able to use `RVec.hxx` just by linking my own target against `ROOT::ROOTVecOps`. Not having to care about the ""internal"" dependency of the ROOT code on VDT myself. To fix, the following should happen:; - VDT should be used in the ROOT CMake configuration through an imported target, not through `${VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS}` and `${VDT_LIBRARIES}`. (Since these make relocation very hard.); - Once `ROOTVecOps` depends on a library like `VDT::vdt`, `ROOTConfig.cmake.in` will need to include. ```cmake; find_dependency(VDT); ```. somewhere around here: https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/cmake/scripts/ROOTConfig.cmake.in#L88-L99. In such a setup, as long as `builtin_vdt` is ""correctly"" installed alongside ROOT, the configuration should start becoming correct under all circumstances. ### To Reproduce. Don't really have a reproducer. But a CMake project like:. ```cmake; cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.10 ); project( VecOpsTest ). find_package( ROOT REQUIRED ). add_executable( VecOpsTest VecOpsText.cpp ); target_link_libraries( VecOpsTest PRIVATE ROOT::ROOTVecOps ); ```. , with a simple. ```c++; #include <ROOT/RVec.hxx>. int main() { return 0; }; ```. (as `VecOpsTest.cpp`) should be able to produce an error. As long as ROOT and VDT headers are not in the same location. Which is usually the case unfortunately... ### Setup. This is primarily an issue with ""LCG builds"" of ROOT. Where currently we have to manually take care of linking our code explicitly against VDT, even if we don't use those headers directly ourselves. ### Additional context. The report was triggered by an ATLAS analyser complaining about this issue, with their own analysis code.

If you find one, you are very welcome to add to the existing report, for instance ""issue still exists in today's master"".; -->. ### Describe the bug; <!--; A clear and concise description of what the wrong behavior is.; -->; When passing a argument to a formula based RooFit function (e.g. `RooFormulaVar` or `RooGenericPdf`), RooFit will search for all occurrences of the object name in the formula and replace them with an ordinal parameter (needed for the underling `TFormula`). However, when the argument is a `RooConst` the name is just a string containing the value and this can break if there are numeric literals inside the formula.; For example; ```; RooFormulaVar f(""f"", ""2.7*@0"", RooFit::RooConst(2.)); ```; becomes inside the `TFormula`; ```; x[0].7*x[0]; ```; because the name 2 of the `RooConst` matched the 2 of the numeric literal. This of course breaks during formula compilation. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->; The variables do not replace numeric literals no matter the name. Possibly `RooConst`s should be matched only by index?. ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves.; 2. Don't forget to attach the required input files!; 3. How to run your code and / or build it, e.g. `root myMacro.C`, ...; -->; ```; RooFormulaVar f(""f"", ""2.7*@0"", RooFit::RooConst(2.)); ```. ### Setup; <!--; 1. ROOT version; 2. Operating system; 3. How you obtained ROOT, such as `dnf install` / binary download / you built it yourself.; -->; HEAD of ROOT 6.26 from LCG dev4. ### Additional context; <!--; Add any other context about the problem here.; -->; `RooFormulaVar f(""f"", ""2.7*@0"", RooFit::RooConst(2.7))` creates `x[0]*x[0]`, which is mostly fine but may break if servers are redirected

Usability,"nd we merely get the class name (e.g. &amp;quot;vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt;&amp;quot;) and the value of the pointer to the container, which tells you nothing more than that the container is allocated. I think it is possible to add this feature with some minor edits to TStreamerInfo. I have attempted this myself for vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; (see the attached) and had success with the following:. \- A branch made directly from a vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt;; \- A branch made out of a class (call it &amp;quot;TTestClass&amp;quot;) that derives from TObject and contains a vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; as a data member; \- A branch made out of a class containing a data member that is a TClonesArray of TTestClass's. The basic idea was to imitate the special-case-handling for the std::string class in the TStreamerInfo::PrintValue() and TStreamerInfo::PrintValueAux(). One issue is that for the STL classes, counter-intuitively TStreamerInfo::fLength = 1, no matter how many entries are in the container, so that PrintValueAux() always gets called with aleng = 1 instead of something related to the size of the array. Rather than mess with fLength, which appears to have important function outside of the PrintValue*() routines, I thought it would be better to simply add lenmax as an additional final parameter to PrintValueAux(), to be used in place of aleng by the stl classes. This could then be compared to the container length and used in the printf loop in the same way that aleng is used for arrays of basic data types. The other issue I ran into is that it is not easy to format the output to make it look &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot;. The PrintCR() function used by other data types in PrintValueAux() works well for vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; in PrintValue(), so I suggest moving that function declaration up so that it can be used there. However, in PrintValueAux() the printing somehow always looks funny for the case of the TClonesArray of TTestClass's.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: nd we merely get the class name (e.g. &amp;quot;vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt;&amp;quot;) and the value of the pointer to the container, which tells you nothing more than that the container is allocated. I think it is possible to add this feature with some minor edits to TStreamerInfo. I have attempted this myself for vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; (see the attached) and had success with the following:. \- A branch made directly from a vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt;; \- A branch made out of a class (call it &amp;quot;TTestClass&amp;quot;) that derives from TObject and contains a vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; as a data member; \- A branch made out of a class containing a data member that is a TClonesArray of TTestClass's. The basic idea was to imitate the special-case-handling for the std::string class in the TStreamerInfo::PrintValue() and TStreamerInfo::PrintValueAux(). One issue is that for the STL classes, counter-intuitively TStreamerInfo::fLength = 1, no matter how many entries are in the container, so that PrintValueAux() always gets called with aleng = 1 instead of something related to the size of the array. Rather than mess with fLength, which appears to have important function outside of the PrintValue*() routines, I thought it would be better to simply add lenmax as an additional final parameter to PrintValueAux(), to be used in place of aleng by the stl classes. This could then be compared to the container length and used in the printf loop in the same way that aleng is used for arrays of basic data types. The other issue I ran into is that it is not easy to format the output to make it look &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot;.

Usability,"ng class in the TStreamerInfo::PrintValue() and TStreamerInfo::PrintValueAux(). One issue is that for the STL classes, counter-intuitively TStreamerInfo::fLength = 1, no matter how many entries are in the container, so that PrintValueAux() always gets called with aleng = 1 instead of something related to the size of the array. Rather than mess with fLength, which appears to have important function outside of the PrintValue*() routines, I thought it would be better to simply add lenmax as an additional final parameter to PrintValueAux(), to be used in place of aleng by the stl classes. This could then be compared to the container length and used in the printf loop in the same way that aleng is used for arrays of basic data types. The other issue I ran into is that it is not easy to format the output to make it look &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot;. The PrintCR() function used by other data types in PrintValueAux() works well for vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; in PrintValue(), so I suggest moving that function declaration up so that it can be used there. However, in PrintValueAux() the printing somehow always looks funny for the case of the TClonesArray of TTestClass's.

At any rate, I tried a number of options and left them in the file in my order of preference with all but the first one (no carriage returns) commented out. I also thought it was best to make the entry delimiter in PrintValueClones() and; PrintValueSTL() from &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;;&amp;quot;. It should be simple to add this feature for other STL containers, such as vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, vector&amp;lt;float&amp;gt;, vector&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;, etc. It would be nice to also add output for maps, e.g. if `map<keytype, valtype>` could print as. key1 => val1, key1 => val2, ... ### Alternatives considered. _No response_. ### Additional context. _No response_",simpl,MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14555:2726,simple,2726,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14555,1,['simpl'],['simple'],"The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction.

One issue is that for the STL classes, counter-intuitively TStreamerInfo::fLength = 1, no matter how many entries are in the container, so that PrintValueAux() always gets called with aleng = 1 instead of something related to the size of the array. Rather than mess with fLength, which appears to have important function outside of the PrintValue*() routines, I thought it would be better to simply add lenmax as an additional final parameter to PrintValueAux(), to be used in place of aleng by the stl classes. This could then be compared to the container length and used in the printf loop in the same way that aleng is used for arrays of basic data types. The other issue I ran into is that it is not easy to format the output to make it look &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot;. The PrintCR() function used by other data types in PrintValueAux() works well for vector&amp;lt;double&amp;gt; in PrintValue(), so I suggest moving that function declaration up so that it can be used there. However, in PrintValueAux() the printing somehow always looks funny for the case of the TClonesArray of TTestClass's. My guess is that the printing looks funny as well for the other array types handled by PrintValueAux() so maybe this is considered to be okay? At any rate, I tried a number of options and left them in the file in my order of preference with all but the first one (no carriage returns) commented out. I also thought it was best to make the entry delimiter in PrintValueClones() and; PrintValueSTL() from &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;;&amp;quot;. It should be simple to add this feature for other STL containers, such as vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, vector&amp;lt;float&amp;gt;, vector&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;, etc. It would be nice to also add output for maps, e.g. if `map<keytype, valtype>` could print as. key1 => val1, key1 => val2, ... ### Alternatives considered. _No response_. ### Additional context. _No response_

Usability,"ressions. I discarded that because of two reasons:; - They are more costly that simple string comparison.; - They complicate the registration of pythonizors per scope. In this new `@pythonization` decorator, the scope of the class is parsed (e.g. `NS1::NS2` for `NS1::NS2::C`) and the pythonizor is _registered for that scope_. This allows for more efficient lookup of the pythonizors to apply, because when a class is accessed for the first time, only the pythonizors registered for its scope will be attempted. This is nice for user classes, because if a user class belongs to `UserNamespace`, when the user script first accesses the class only the pythonizors for classes in `UserNamespace` will be tried, and not every single registered pythonizor (in particular, not all the pythonizors ROOT registers for its classes in the global namespace). So I prefer to have a clean static prefix that unambiguously tells me what the target scope is than something like `NS1::(.+)::C`. And if the user wants to do an additional complex matching with regular expressions, they can still do so in their pythonizor code via the `name` parameter. I'd like to hear the opinion of @pikacic and @daritter about this since we've discussed about this decorator in the past (no need to review the whole PR, giving your opinion on the programming examples is already more than enough!). EDIT: I have received some feedback from @eguiraud on the `name` parameter: he thinks it could be removed since some users won't need it (they won't do any further filtering inside the pythonizor). As an alternative, `name` could be injected in `klass` before the user pythonizor runs (so users would access it as `klass.name`), but that could cause a clash if `name` is already a static member of the class. There is also `klass.__cpp_name__` that is provided by cppyy with the fully qualified name of the class, so we could rely on that too. @vepadulano would rather keep `name` as a parameter.

",True,"The content discusses implementation details related to a decorator called '@pythonization' in Python. It talks about how the scope of classes affects registration of 'pythonizors,' which are tools for adding Python bindings to C++ classes. The description mentions parsing class scopes (like `NS1::NS2` for `NS1::NS2::C`) and registering pythonizors per scope for efficient lookup. This is about making it easier for users by allowing specific registration based on the namespace or module where a class resides, thus improving user satisfaction and efficiency in using these bindings. It also touches on design decisions regarding parameters like 'name' in the decorator, considering user feedback to make the system more flexible and user-friendly. These aspects directly relate to usability: efficient task completion, ease of learning (by providing clear registration and scope handling), and adaptability (allowing users to choose how they interact with the bindings). The content does not appear to be a log but rather a discussion about design choices and implementation strategies aimed at enhancing usability by simplifying and optimizing the process for users.","

This would allow a user to catch code that may incur in performance penalties and may not work properly when AOT-compiled. . ### Reproducer. 1. download the source code of [this tutorial](https://root.cern/doc/master/df106__HiggsToFourLeptons_8C.html); 2. compile it; 3. run it. ### ROOT version. 6.33.01. ### Installation method. from source. ### Operating system.

    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.

",False,"The content discusses compilation issues and runtime errors in software, specifically regarding ROOT's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. It mentions problems when compiling code that relies on user-defined functions with unknown signatures. The issue is related to how RDF (a data representation format) interacts with C++ expressions and JIT compilation. While this involves understanding of how the compiler works and potential performance issues, it is more about implementation details and specific toolchain problems rather than the broader architectural concerns."

This suggestion can be taken as an opportunity to improve the crystal ball shapes in RooFit in general. Right now there is the [RooCBShape](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofit/src/RooCBShape.cxx) that only has a left non-Gaussian tail and [RooDSCBShape](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofit/src/RooDSCBShape.cxx) that has two separately parametrized tails. The implementation of the RooDSCBShape is not super elegant because it has a lot of code duplication that would only get worse with the further parametrzation. To clear this up, we could implement one modern and fully parametrized crystal ball shape with a clear name like **RooCrystalBall** that can serve as a drop-in replacement for both RooCBShape and RooDSCBShape as well as cover the usecase of the asymmetric Gaussian core. Such a class and a rigurous test is implemented in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7257, which can serve as a starting point for this development. In addition to the commit suggested in the PR, there are a few more things that could be done to make RooCrystalBall the new standard:. * Write documentation.; * Implement batch computation interface.; * Maybe even deprecate the old shapes somehow. They probably need to be kept for backwards compatibility, but they could be put in RooFitMore and the user gets a nudge to use the new shape if it is used. Probably we should also look at the crystal ball implementation in Higgs combine to see if we can take some of the improvements upstream:; * [RooDoubleCBFast.h](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/blob/102x/interface/RooDoubleCBFast.h); * [RooDoubleCBFast.cc](https://github.co

A relativistic voigt is a convolution of a relativistic breit wigner and a gaussian, doing this naively is computationally infeasible however a fairly simple redefinition of variables allows rewriting the integral in a form that is reasonable to compute.

4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided discusses file reading performance based on location (remote vs local), which is related to efficiency and task completion in data processing tasks. This ties into usability as it impacts how effectively users can perform their work, considering factors that affect performance.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: … spectrum and adjust final plot. The files are taken form publiceos!. The final plot looks like this:. ![x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6951222/47027878-93b95200-d168-11e8-96d8-790d5a024e7e.png). **Edit:**. I've restuctured the tutorial a little and simplified the cuts. Now, it's very clear without index magic and much more condense! The simplification comes from requiring *exactly* two muons for each events. We loose a little statistics but the analysis is now easier to understand. I leave the complicated stuff to the upcoming Higgs analysis tutorial ;) The plot looks now like this:. ![x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6951222/47138237-21a45280-d2b9-11e8-809c-044751d2b112.png). And I've added a cut-flow report! ->. ```; Events with exactly two muons: pass=33370298 all=66128870 -- 50.463 %; Muons with opposite charge: pass=25794885 all=33370298 -- 77.299 %; ```. Runtime depends heavily on the xrootd connection. From my experience about 1 to 3 minutes with files read remotely and about 20s with files read from local disk.
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content discusses data analysis, plotting results, and file reading efficiency in a particle physics context. It involves technical details about data processing steps, performance metrics, and configuration adjustments but does not delve into software architecture concepts or principles."
