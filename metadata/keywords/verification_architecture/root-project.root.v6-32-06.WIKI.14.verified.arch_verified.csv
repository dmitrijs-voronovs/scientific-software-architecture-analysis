Data:

Content: er the data se using parallel coordinates. With that representation, a selection is an ensemble of ranges defined on the axes. Ranges defined on the same axis are conjugated with OR (an entry must be in one or the other ranges to be selected). Ranges on different axes are are conjugated with AND (an entry must be in all the ranges to be selected). Several selections can be defined with different colors. It is possible to generate an entry list from a given selection and apply it to the tree using the editor (""Apply to tree"" button).; Axes:. Options can be defined each axis separatly using the right mouse click. These options can be applied to every axes using the editor. Axis width: If set to 0, the axis is simply a line. If higher, a color histogram is drawn on the axis.; Axis histogram height: If not 0, a usual bar histogram is drawn on the plot. The order in which the variables are drawn is essential to see the clusters. The axes can be dragged to change their position. A zoom is also available. The logarithm scale is also available by right clicking on the axis.; Candle chart:. TParallelCoord can also be used to display a candle chart. In that mode, every variable is drawn in the same scale. The candle chart can be combined with the parallel coordinates mode, drawing the candle sticks over the axes.

If TERMINATOR; returns 0, it means that the terminator has not been seen.; Otherwise it should return a pointer to the character immediately; following the terminator.

Availability,"ere are data points, or that the parametrization of the fit contains a linear dependence. If this is the case, then M (or any other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely, and the error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user must remove the under-determinedness by reformulating the parametrization. M cannot do this itself, but it can provide some hints (contours, global correlation coefficients, eigenvalues) which can help the clever user to find out what is wrong.; Numerical inaccuracies. It is possible that the apparent lack of positive–definiteness is in fact only due to excessive roundoff errors in numerical calculations, either in \(\mbox{FCN}\) or in M . This is unlikely in general, but becomes more likely if the number of free parameters is very large, or if the parameters are badly scaled (not all of the same order of magnitude), and correlations are also large. In any case, whether the non–positive–definiteness is real or only numerical is largely irrelevant, since in both cases the error matrix will be unreliable and the minimum suspicious. 6.7 Additional trouble–shooting; When M just doesn’t work, some of the more common causes are:. Precision mismatch. Make sure your \(\mbox{FCN}\) uses internally the same precision as M .; If the problem is only one of precision, and not of word length mismatch, an appropriate MnMachinePrecision::setPrecision() may fix it.; Trivial bugs in \(\mbox{FCN}\). The possibilities for bugs are numerous.

Content: erence Guide ; .  . Loading...; Searching...; No Matches. rf612_recoverFromInvalidParameters.C File ReferenceTutorials » RooFit Tutorials. Detailed Description; Likelihood and minimization: Recover from regions where the function is not defined. ; We demonstrate improved recovery from disallowed parameters. For this, we use a polynomial PDF of the form ; \[; \mathrm{Pol2} = \mathcal{N} \left( c + a_1 \cdot x + a_2 \cdot x^2 + 0.01 \cdot x^3 \right),; \]. where \( \mathcal{N} \) is a normalisation factor. Unless the parameters are chosen carefully, this function can be negative, and hence, it cannot be used as a PDF. In this case, RooFit passes an error to the minimiser, which might try to recover.; Before ROOT 6.24, RooFit always passed the highest function value that was encountered during the minimisation to the minimiser. If a parameter is far in a disallowed region, the minimiser has to blindly test various values of the parameters. It might find the correct values by chance, but often be unable to recover from bad starting values. Here, we use a model with such bad values.; Starting with ROOT 6.24, the minimiser receives more information. For example, when a PDF is negative, the magnitude of the ""undershoot"" is passed to the minimiser. The minimiser can use this to compute a gradient, which will eventually lead it out of the disallowed region. The steepness of this gradient can be chosen using RooFit::RecoverFromUndefinedRegions(double). A value of zero is equivalent to RooFit before ROOT 6.24. Positive values activate the recovery.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: error on the mean of Y = S(Y)/SQRT(N) where S(Y) is the standard deviation (RMS) of the Y data in the bin and N is the number of bin entries (from TProfile::GetBinEntries(ibin) ) (i.e the errors are the standard error on the bin content of the profile); 's' Errors are the standard deviation of Y, S(Y); 'i' Errors are S(Y)/SQRT(N) (standard error on the mean as in the default) The only difference is only when the standard deviation in Y is zero. In this case the error a standard deviation = 1/SQRT(12) is assumed and the error is 1./SQRT(12*N). This approximation assumes that the Y values are integer (e.g. ADC counts) and have an implicit uncertainty of y +/- 0.5. With the assumption that the probability that y takes any value between y-0.5 and y+0.5 is uniform, its standard error is 1/SQRT(12); 'g' Errors are 1./SQRT(W) where W is the sum of the weights for the bin j W is obtained as from TProfile::GetBinEntries(ibin) This errors corresponds to the standard deviation of weighted mean where each measurement Y is uncorrelated and has an error sigma, which is expressed in the weight used to fill the Profile: w = 1/sigma^2 The resulting error in TProfile is then 1./SQRT( Sum(1./sigma^2) ). In the case of Profile filled weights and with TProfile::Sumw2() called, STD(Y) is the standard deviation of the weighted sample Y and N is in this case the number of effective entries (TProfile::GetBinEffectiveEntries(ibin) ); If a bin has N data points all with the same value Y (especially possible when dealing with integers), the spread in Y for that bin is zero, and the uncertainty assigned is also zero, and the bin is ignored in making subsequent fits. To avoid this problem one can use an approximation for the standard deviation S(Y), by using the average of all the S(Y) of the other Profile bins. To use this approximation one must call before TProfile::Approximate This approximation applies only for the default and the 's' options ; Definition at line 227 of file TProfile.cxx. ◆

One can write in this case; directly:; Int_t fitStatus = h->Fit(myFunc). If the option ""S"" is instead used, TFitResultPtr contains the TFitResult and behaves; as a smart pointer to it. For example one can do:; TFitResultPtr r = h->Fit(myFunc,""S"");; TMatrixDSym cov = r->GetCovarianceMatrix(); // to access the covariance matrix; Double_t chi2 = r->Chi2(); // to retrieve the fit chi2; Double_t par0 = r->Value(0); // retrieve the value for the parameter 0; Double_t err0 = r->ParError(0); // retrieve the error for the parameter 0; r->Print(""V""); // print full information of fit including covariance matrix; r->Write(); // store the result in a file. The fit parameters, error and chi2 (but not covariance matrix) can be retrieved also; from the fitted function.; If the histogram is made persistent, the list of; associated functions is also persistent. Given a pointer (see above); to an associated function myfunc, one can retrieve the function/fit; parameters with calls such as:; Double_t chi2 = myfunc->GetChisquare();; Double_t par0 = myfunc->GetParameter(0); //value of 1st parameter; Double_t err0 = myfunc->GetParError(0); //error on first parameter. Access to the fit status. The status of the fit can be obtained converting the TFitResultPtr to an integer; indipendently if the fit option ""S"" is used or not:; TFitResultPtr r = h->Fit(myFunc,opt);; Int_t fitStatus = r;. The fitStatus is 0 if the fit is OK (i.e. no error occurred).; The value of the fit status code is negative in case of an error not connected with the; minimization procedure, for example when a wrong function is used.; Otherwise the return value is the one returned from the minimization procedure.; When TMinuit (default

Idem for ErrorDef(). void SetErrorDef(double ). add interface to set dynamically a new error definition; Re-implement this function if needed. {}. » Last changed: root/minuit2:$Id$ » Last generated: 2015-09-08 17:01; This page has been automatically generated.

Interpretation of Parameter Errors:; There are two kinds of problems that can arise: the reliability of MINUIT's error estimates, and their statistical interpretation, assuming they are accurate. Statistical interpretation:; For discussion of basic concepts, such as the meaning of the elements of the error matrix, or setting of exact confidence levels see:. F.James. Determining the statistical Significance of experimental Results. Technical Report DD/81/02 and CERN Report 81-03, CERN, 1981.; W.T.Eadie, D.Drijard, F.James, M.Roos, and B.Sadoulet. Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics. North-Holland, 1971. Reliability of MINUIT error estimates.; MINUIT always carries around its own current estimates of the parameter errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how accurate they are at any given point in the execution. For example, at initialization, these estimates are just the starting step sizes as specified by the user. After a HESSE step, the errors are usually quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. MINUIT, when it prints out error values, also gives some indication of how reliable it thinks they are. For example, those marked CURRENT GUESS ERROR are only working values not to be believed, and APPROXIMATE ERROR means that they have been calculated but there is reason to believe that they may not be accurate.; If no mitigating adjective is given, then at least MINUIT believes the errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that MINUIT has been fooled. Some visible signs that MINUIT may have been fooled are:. Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis.; Failure to find new minimum.; Value of EDM too big (estimated Distance to Minimum).; Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others.; Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99). This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one which has been ba

",True,"The content provided describes several functions and methods related to file access and management in what appears to be a server or client component of a larger system. Functions like Unlink, Prepare, GetPathsInfo, and others are discussed. These functions seem to handle operations related to files on remote servers or distributed systems, potentially ensuring that the necessary files are available when required. For example, the IsOnline function checks if a file is ready to be used, which relates to availability. Similarly, functions like Locate and GetClientAdmin might be involved in determining where files are located or managing access rights, which can impact the system's readiness. However, not all functions directly relate to failure recovery or reliability aspects as described in the Availability attribute. The Unlink function, for instance, deals more with file deletion rather than ensuring availability.

",True,"The content provided contains code snippets related to file system operations in a network environment. The functions mentioned like Unlink, IsOnline, Prepare, GetPathsInfo, and Locate are all related to accessing and managing files across a network. These functions deal with checking if files are available (IsOnline), preparing for access (Prepare), retrieving information about paths (GetPathsInfo), and locating endpoints (Locate). The descriptions of these functions focus on ensuring that the system can reliably access and handle file operations, which aligns with the concept of availability in the context of a distributed system. Availability here refers to the system's readiness to perform its function when required, which is achieved through fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms. For instance, IsOnline checks if a file is ready to be used, ensuring that any issues are detected early, and Prepare and Unlink functions handle potential failures by gracefully terminating or preparing for access. Thus, while not explicitly stated in the attribute description, these functions collectively contribute to the system's availability by maintaining reliable file operations and handling network-related issues.","

",True,"The content describes methods related to file transfer and directory operations, such as PutFile(), GetFile(), ChangeDirectory(), MakeDirectory(), DeleteDirectory(). These functions handle remote file operations and involve transferring files, handling connection states, and managing directories.

",True,"The content provided appears to be code snippets from a software application, specifically related to file handling and asynchronous operations. The presence of 'TFile', 'TNetXNGFile', and various method calls suggests that this is part of a system designed for managing files, possibly in a high-availability or network-optimized context.

",True,"The code provided is for a method called TTree::DropBranchFromCache. This method handles removing branches from a cache in a tree structure. The code checks if the tree is available, and if not, attempts to load it. It also verifies that the current tree is this one to prevent dropping branches from another tree. If all these checks pass, it proceeds to remove the specified branch or sub-branches from the cache. This process ensures that when a branch needs to be dropped, it can do so without affecting other parts of the system, maintaining its availability. The code is related to ensuring that necessary branches are available when required and handles removal efficiently, which directly aligns with the quality attribute of Availability by focusing on reliability and recovery.","

Availability,"evels, see (in order of increasing complexity and completeness):. “Interpretation of the Errors on Parameters”, see Part 3 of this write-up.; “Determining the Statistical Significance of Experimental Results”@bib-MIN81.; “Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics”@bib-EADIE. 6.5.2 The reliability of M error estimates; M always carries around its own current estimates of the parameter errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how accurate they are at any given point in the execution. For example, at initialization, these estimates are just the starting step sizes as specified by the user. After a \(\mbox{MIGRAD}\) or \(\mbox{HESSE}\) step, the errors are usually quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. If no mitigating adjective is given in the printout of the errors, then at least M believes the errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that M has been fooled. Some visible signs that M may have been fooled are:. Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis.; Failure to find new minimum.; Value of \(\mbox{EDM}\) too big. For a “normal” minimization, after \(\mbox{MIGRAD}\), the value of \(\mbox{EDM}\) is usually more than three orders of magnitude smaller than \(\mbox{up}\), unless a looser tolerance has been specified.; Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others.; Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one which has been badly parametrized so that individual errors are not very meaningful because they are so highly correlated.; Parameter at limit.

The code also involves checking for specific types of viewers ('gl' and 'ogl') and preparing the system to handle them. This maintenance and setup of viewers are aspects of availability as they ensure the system can perform its functions reliably even in various configurations. Therefore, the content aligns with the quality attribute of Availability by focusing on the readiness and reliability of the 3D viewer component. The true_positive: true label is justified by the direct relation between the code activities and the system's ability to be available when needed.","

",True,"The code provided discusses methods for retrieving high and low errors related to graphical data points (eXlow, eXhigh, eYlow, eYhigh) in a system. It includes function definitions for accessing these error values based on indices. Additionally, there's a method FillZero which sets zero values for arrays within a specified range. The functions seem to handle error calculations and initialization of error arrays, which relates to the system's ability to perform its functions reliably. This aligns with the concept of Availability in software engineering, focusing on readiness and minimizing downtime through effective error handling and recovery mechanisms.","

Content: f not correctly closed. ; The function returns the number of keys that have been recovered. If no keys can be recovered, the file will be declared Zombie by the calling function. This function is automatically called when opening a file. If the file is open in read only mode, the file is not modified. If open in update mode and the function finds something to recover, a new directory header is written to the file. When opening the file gain no message from Recover will be reported. If keys have been recovered, the file is usable and you can safely read the corresponding objects. If the file is not usable (a zombie), you can test for this case with code like:; TFile f(""myfile.root"");; if (f.IsZombie()) {<actions to take if file is unusable>}; TFileA ROOT file is an on-disk file, usually with extension .root, that stores objects in a file-system-li...Definition TFile.h:53; If the file has been recovered, the bit kRecovered is set in the TFile object in memory. You can test if the file has been recovered with if (f.TestBit(TFile::kRecovered)) {... the file has been recovered}; When writing TTrees to a file, it is important to save the Tree header at regular intervals (see TTree::AutoSave). If a file containing a Tree is recovered, the last Tree header written to the file will be used. In this case all the entries in all the branches written before writing the header are valid entries.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided content appears to be a series of log entries from a system. Each line starts with 'Minimum Test error found - save the configuration' which suggests that the system encountered an error and took some action, possibly leading to a test failure. The mention of 'save the configuration' indicates an attempt to mitigate the issue. This aligns with concepts related to fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms, which are part of the Availability quality attribute. Therefore, despite being log data, it relates directly to availability by showing how the system handles errors through recovery actions.","
