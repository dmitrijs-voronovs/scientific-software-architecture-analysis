Content: . Root.Html.OutputDir: htmldocII.3 Linking other documentation; When trying to document a class, THtml searches for a source file in the directories set via SetInputDir(). If it cannot find it, it assumes that this class must have been documented before. Based on the library this class is defined in, it checks the configuration variable Root.Html.LibName, and creates a link using its value. Alternatively, you can set these URLs via THtml::SetLibURL().; Example:; If a class MyClass is defined in class mylibs/libMyLib.so, and .rootrc contains. Root.Html.MyLib: ../mylib/ THtml will create a link to ""../mylib/MyClass.html"".; The library name association can be set up using the rootmap facility. For the library in the example above, which contains a dictionary generated from the linkdef MyLinkdef.h, the command to generate the rootmap file is; $ rlibmap -f -r rootmap -l mylib/libMyLib.so -d libCore.so -c MyLinkdef.h Here, -r specifies that the entries for libMyLib should be updated, -l specifies the library we're dealing with, -d its dependencies, and -c its linkdef.

This function; will execute the specified command.; The following example uses the services of the class Aclock created; in $ROOTSYS/test/Aclock.cxx.; This examples uses a TTimer to redraw a pad at regular intervals (clock).; When the clock is updated, a string with the current date&time is drawn.; {; gSystem->Load(""$ROOTSYS/test/Aclock"");; Aclock ck(400);; gPad->SetFillColor(5);; TDatime dt;; TText t(.5,.3,""t"");; t.SetTextAlign(22);; t.SetTextSize(.07);; t.SetTextColor(4);; t.Draw();; TExec ex(""ex"",""dt.Set();t.SetTitle(dt.AsString())"");; ex.Draw();; }. Case 2:. The TExec object may be added to the list of functions of a TH1 or TGraph; object via hist->GetListOfFunctions()->Add(exec).; When the histogram (or graph) is drawn, the TExec will be executed.; If the histogram is made persistent on a file, the TExec object; is also saved with the histogram. When redrawing the histogram in a; new session, the TExec will be executed.; Example:; Assume an histogram TH1F *h already filled.; TExec *ex1 = new TExec(""ex1"",""DoSomething()"");; TExec *ex2 = new TExec(""ex2"","".x macro.C"");; h->GetListOfFunctions()->Add(ex1);; h->GetListOfFunctions()->Add(ex2);; h->Draw();; When the Paint function for the histogram will be called, the ""DoSomething""; function will be called (interpreted or compiled) and also the macro.C.

Int_t TFile::Recover ; (; ). virtual . Attempt to recover file if not correctly closed. ; The function returns the number of keys that have been recovered. If no keys can be recovered, the file will be declared Zombie by the calling function. This function is automatically called when opening a file. If the file is open in read only mode, the file is not modified. If open in update mode and the function finds something to recover, a new directory header is written to the file. When opening the file gain no message from Recover will be reported. If keys have been recovered, the file is usable and you can safely read the corresponding objects. If the file is not usable (a zombie), you can test for this case with code like:; TFile f(""myfile.root"");; if (f.IsZombie()) {<actions to take if file is unusable>}; If the file has been recovered, the bit kRecovered is set in the TFile object in memory. You can test if the file has been recovered with if (f.TestBit(TFile::kRecovered)) {... the file has been recovered}; When writing TTrees to a file, it is important to save the Tree header at regular intervals (see TTree::AutoSave). If a file containing a Tree is recovered, the last Tree header written to the file will be used. In this case all the entries in all the branches written before writing the header are valid entries. One can disable the automatic recovery procedure by setting TFile.Recover 0; in the sys

2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided is code snippets from a RooCacheManager class in ROOT, an experiment control system. The methods described (setObj, getObj) relate to managing cache storage and retrieval of objects based on sets of arguments. These functions handle deployment aspects such as object insertion, retrieval by index or argument sets, and cache size. While not explicitly discussing deployment options or rollback mechanisms, the code implies functionality that supports efficient and structured deployment of software components, thus aligning with Deployability in terms of automation and deployment speed. However, without explicit mention of rollback or specific deployment strategies, there's a partial alignment. Therefore, considering the full context, it is a true positive as it supports deployment capabilities.","

",True,"The content provided is a snippet of code from a C++ file, specifically a function definition for TClass::GetClass with various overloads. The function handles class loading and lookup mechanisms in a ROOT (a data analysis framework). It includes checks to avoid creating instances of classes that are not meant to be persistent or anonymous. The attribute Deployability refers to the ability to deploy software predictably, which involves factors like automation and deployment speed. This code snippet deals with how classes are managed within an application, such as efficient loading and lookup, which supports deployment by ensuring classes are available when needed. While it doesn't directly mention deployment aspects, its functionality contributes indirectly to deployability by optimizing class management, reducing deployment effort and potential issues.

3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The code provided shows implementation details related to convolution evaluation in a C++ context. The functions mentioned (EvalFFTConv and EvalNumConv) appear to handle different methods of convolution computation, possibly using FFT for speed (FFT Convolution) or direct numerical convolution. The presence of these functions suggests that the software has mechanisms to perform convolutions efficiently, which relates to deployment considerations when integrating such computational intensive tasks. Additionally, the use of ROOT's Math library indicates a specific toolset used for scientific computations, which is often part of deployable software frameworks. While the content primarily consists of code snippets rather than logs, it aligns with the idea of making the software capable of being deployed with predictable time and effort through efficient computation methods. Therefore, this content accurately reflects the Deployability quality attribute as it contributes to the ability of the software to perform its operations efficiently during deployment.","

",True,"The code provided discusses functions related to integrating observables in ROOT, particularly focusing on identifying which observables can be integrated together based on their ranges. This involves checking whether the ranges are fixed or parameterized and how they depend on other observables. The goal is to automate the integration process and ensure that dependencies are handled correctly to avoid issues during deployment. By ensuring that the integration is efficient and well-organized, this contributes directly to deployability as it reduces potential deployment errors by automating and optimizing the integration steps.","
