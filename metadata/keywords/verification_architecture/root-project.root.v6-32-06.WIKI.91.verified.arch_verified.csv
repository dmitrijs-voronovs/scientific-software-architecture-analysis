",True,"The content provided describes the implementation details of a graphical user interface (GUI) component, including methods for connecting senders and receivers, static functions for disconnecting signals, and protected attributes such as buttons, check buttons, and number entry fields. These details relate to how the system's components are structured and interact, which is relevant to modifiability because it assesses the ease of adapting the system by modifying features or adjusting to new environments. The code shows that various UI elements can be added, removed, or modified through methods like Disconnect(), which suggests that the system allows for flexibility in adapting its functionality. Additionally, the presence of protected attributes and configuration options (e.g., fApplyButton, fAutoUpdate) indicates that these components can be customized and potentially adjusted without significantly impacting the rest of the system. The use of inheritance and protection in attribute access also contributes to modifiability by ensuring that changes in one part do not propagate negatively throughout the entire system. Therefore, this content accurately reflects modifiability as it demonstrates how the system can be adapted through modifications and configuration adjustments.","

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The provided content discusses code snippets related to creating and configuring a canvas in a graphical user interface library, including setting size and window preferences. It details specific function calls and parameters, such as `TCanvas` constructor overloads and enum definitions for status bits. While this is related to software development, it focuses on implementation details rather than architectural principles or patterns."
