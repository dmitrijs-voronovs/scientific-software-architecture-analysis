We are applying median count depth normalization with log1p transformation (AKA log1PF). # Saving count data; adata.layers[""counts""] = adata.X.copy(). # Normalizing to median total counts; sc.pp.normalize_total(adata); # Logarithmize the data; sc.pp.log1p(adata). Feature selection#; As a next step, we want to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and only include the most informative genes. This step is commonly known as feature selection. The scanpy function pp.highly_variable_genes annotates highly variable genes by reproducing the implementations of Seurat [Satija et al., 2015], Cell Ranger [Zheng et al., 2017], and Seurat v3 [Stuart et al., 2019] depending on the chosen flavor. sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, n_top_genes=2000, batch_key=""sample""). sc.pl.highly_variable_genes(adata). Dimensionality Reduction#; Reduce the dimensionality of the data by running principal component analysis (PCA), which reveals the main axes of variation and denoises the data. sc.tl.pca(adata). Let us inspect the contribution of single PCs to the total variance in the data. This gives us information about how many PCs we should consider in order to compute the neighborhood relations of cells, e.g. used in the clustering function leiden() or tsne(). In our experience, there does not seem to be signifigant downside to overestimating the numer of principal components. sc.pl.pca_variance_ratio(adata, n_pcs=50, log=True). You can also plot the principal components to see if there are any potentially undesired features (e.g. batch, QC metrics) driving signifigant variation in this dataset. In this case, there isn’t anything too alarming, but it’s a good idea to ex

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",True,"The content discusses various aspects of data analysis and visualization in bioinformatics, such as preprocessing steps, clustering techniques, trajectory inference, spatial analysis, and plotting methods. While these topics are common in data science, they often focus on algorithmic and computational aspects rather than high-level architectural considerations. However, when considering the broader context of software development, the structure and integration of different tools (e.g., preprocessors like pp and tools like tl) can imply a certain level of architectural organization. The mention of APIs and specific plotting functions also touches on how components are structured within the software stack. Thus, while not explicitly discussing traditional software architecture concepts like patterns or styles, there is an indirect reference to the overall system's structure and component interactions."

Nearest neighbor graph constuction and visualization#; Let us compute the neighborhood graph of cells using the PCA representation of the data matrix. sc.pp.neighbors(adata). This graph can then be embedded in two dimensions for visualiztion with UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018):. sc.tl.umap(adata). We can now visualize the UMAP according to the sample. sc.pl.umap(; adata,; color=""sample"",; # Setting a smaller point size to get prevent overlap; size=2,; ). Even though the data considered in this tutorial includes two different samples, we only observe a minor batch effect and we can continue with clustering and annotation of our data.; If you inspect batch effects in your UMAP it can be beneficial to integrate across samples and perform batch correction/integration. We recommend checking out scanorama and scvi-tools for batch integration. Clustering#; As with Seurat and many other frameworks, we recommend the Leiden graph-clustering method (community detection based on optimizing modularity) [Traag et al., 2019]. Note that Leiden clustering directly clusters the neighborhood graph of cells, which we already computed in the previous section. # Using the igraph implementation and a fixed number of iterations can be significantly faster, especially for larger datasets; sc.tl.leiden(adata, flavor=""igraph"", n_iterations=2). sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[""leiden""]). Re-assess quality control and cell filtering#; As indicated before, we will now re-assess our filtering strategy by visualizing different QC metrics using UMAP. sc.pl.umap(; adata,; color=[""leiden"", ""predicted_doublet"", ""doublet_score""],; # increase horizontal space between panels; wspace=0.5,; size=3,; ). sc.pl.umap(; adata,; co

",True,"The content provided appears to be code snippets and commands used in a Python environment, likely related to data processing and analysis using tools like Scanpy and Scikit-learn. It involves installing necessary packages, setting up data structures, performing PCA, and computing nearest neighbors using different implementations such as PyNNDescent and AnnoyTransformer. The focus seems to be on efficiently implementing k-nearest neighbor searches for large datasets, which is a common task in machine learning. This falls under the realm of integrability because it's about integrating various components (e.g., different kNN algorithms) into a system seamlessly. The code demonstrates how different tools can be integrated together to achieve efficient nearest neighbor search, reducing technical risks and integration complexity. Therefore, this content is accurately reflecting the quality attribute of Integrability.","

This simple process avoids the selection of batch-specific genes; and acts as a lightweight batch correction method. Genes are first sorted by; how many batches they are a HVG. If flavor='pearson_residuals', ties are; broken by the median rank (across batches) based on within-batch residual; variance. chunksize int (default: 1000)If flavor='pearson_residuals', this dertermines how many genes are processed at; once while computing the residual variance. Choosing a smaller value will reduce; the required memory. flavor Literal['pearson_residuals'] (default: 'pearson_residuals')Choose the flavor for identifying highly variable genes. In this experimental; version, only ‘pearson_residuals’ is functional. check_values bool (default: True)If True, checks if counts in selected layer are integers as expected by this; function, and return a warning if non-integers are found.

",True,"The content provided discusses configuring parameters for a function related to identifying highly variable genes in gene expression data. This involves modifying the function's settings to suit specific experimental needs, such as choosing the flavor of residuals (pearson_residuals) and enabling or disabling checks for integer counts in selected layers. Additionally, it allows for selecting a layer other than X by providing a string argument, which can be None, and enables subsetting data based on high variability after identification. This directly pertains to modifiability as the system can be adjusted through parameter configuration to meet different requirements, such as enabling or disabling certain checks, changing default behavior, and tailoring analysis steps to experimental needs. The ability to modify settings without altering the underlying algorithm's core functionality demonstrates how the system adapts to various use cases and user preferences, fitting the definition of modifiability in software engineering.","

",True,"The content provided describes how to aggregate data using certain parameters and functions in Scanpy. It discusses grouping by columns, applying functions like mean, count_nonzero, sum, var, and handling axes and boolean masks. This is related to modifiability because it shows how the system (Scanpy) can be adapted or modified for different kinds of aggregations, such as grouping by specific columns, choosing aggregation functions, and setting parameters. By adjusting these settings, users can modify their analyses, making the system more adaptable to various data processing needs. The ability to easily alter parameters and apply different aggregation methods directly contributes to modifiability.","

We are then able to explore how cell types are propagated from the scRNA-seq dataset to the visium dataset. Let’s first visualize the neurons cortical layers. sc.pl.spatial(; adata_anterior_subset_transfer,; img_key=""hires"",; color=[""L2/3 IT"", ""L4"", ""L5 PT"", ""L6 CT""],; size=1.5,; ); sc.pl.spatial(; adata_posterior_subset_transfer,; img_key=""hires"",; color=[""L2/3 IT"", ""L4"", ""L5 PT"", ""L6 CT""],; size=1.5,; ). Interestingly, it seems that this approach worked, since sequential layers of cortical neurons could be correctly identified, both in the anterior and posterior sagittal slide.; We can go ahead an visualize astrocytes and oligodendrocytes as well. sc.pl.spatial(; adata_anterior_subset_transfer, img_key=""hires"", color=[""Oligo"", ""Astro""], size=1.5; ); sc.pl.spatial(; adata_posterior_subset_transfer, img_key=""hires"", color=[""Oligo"", ""Astro""], size=1.5; ). In this tutorial, we showed how to work with multiple slices in Scanpy, and perform label transfers between an annotated scRNA-seq dataset and an unannotated Visium dataset. We showed that such approach, that leverages the data integration performances of Scanorama, is useful and provide a straightforward tool for exploratory analysis.; However, for the label transfer task, we advise analysts to explore more principled approaches, based on cell-type deconvolution, that are likely to provide more accurate and interpretable results. See recent approaches such as:. Stereoscope paper - code; AutogeneS paper - code; MuSiC paper

We can also create an Axes object with a predefined size and pass it to a scanpy plotting function. fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 4)); sc.pl.umap(adata, color=""bulk_labels"", ax=ax). The figsize is divided between all Axes and spaces between them. Thus, if we have multiple Axes (columns or rows) we must accordingly increase figsize.; However, if we do not pass Axes objects to the scanpy embedding function it will automatically create individual Axes with the size of the current global figsize (as specified by e.g. matplotlib figure.figsize). ncol = 2; nrow = 1; figsize = 3; wspace = 1; # Adapt figure size based on number of rows and columns and added space between them; # (e.g. wspace between columns); fig, axs = plt.subplots(; nrow, ncol, figsize=(ncol * figsize + (ncol - 1) * wspace * figsize, nrow * figsize); ); plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=wspace); sc.pl.umap(adata, color=""louvain"", ax=axs[0], show=False); sc.pl.umap(adata, color=""phase"", ax=axs[1]). Adjust space between subplots#; When plotting multiple plots (e.g. with embedding) in the same row or column it may happen that the legend overlaps with the neighbouring plot. This can be overcomed by setting wspace (width) or hspace (height). These parameters can be likewise used when creating Axes for plotting (see the above section on using matplotlib Axes). # Default, legend is overlapping; sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[""bulk_labels"", ""phase""]). # Increase gap size between plots; sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[""bulk_labels"", ""phase""], wspace=1). Adapt axes appearance#; We can further modify the plot object (e.g. Axes) to change axis text, title siz

Data:

Content:  that you reduce the size of your count matrix by gene selection, before running normalize_pearson_residuals(adata) on the reduced data. To perform RAM-efficient gene selection, use highly_variable_genes(adata,flavor='pearson_residuals') with the chunksize argument: This will still use Pearson residual variance to identify variable genes, but won’t compute all residuals at once. Reduce the chunksize as needed if you run into RAM issues during gene selection. Note that a very small chunksize will slow down the computation, so try to set it as large as possible with your resources.; As an example, we used chunksize=1000 when processing a dataset with 2 million cells in a machine with 500 GB RAM. For smaller machines, we would recommend to reduce this below 100. Wrapper functions for Pearson residuals preprocessing#; The scanpy.experimental.pp module also ships two wrappers that run multiple pre-processing steps at once:. sc.experimental.pp.normalize_pearson_residuals_pca() performs normalization by Pearson residuals and PCA in one go. This function is helpful to quickly obtain a Pearson residual-based data representation when highly variable genes are already defined, as only those are used by default.; sc.experimental.pp.recipe_pearson_residuals() performs gene selection and normalization by Pearson residuals, and PCA on top. This is intended to make the full Pearson residual preprocessing available in one step. All hyperparameters of the individual steps can still be controlled using the wrapper functions’ arguments. See the documentation for details.

Safety,"e Pearson residuals, we need an estimation of the technical variance in the data. There is still a debate on which noise distribution is most appropiate for scRNA UMI data, with Poisson or the Negative binomial being likely candidates. We implemented the negative binomial model here, which is overdispersed compared to Poisson. The amount of overdispersion is controlled by the argument theta, where a smaller theta corresponds to larger overdispersion. Lause et al. (2021) recommend using the default theta=100, as noise in negative control data without biological variation was fit well by this value. If Poisson behavior is desired, the overdispersion parameter can instead be set to infinity (theta=np.Inf). Clipping threshold clip#; When a gene is expressed in only very few cells, and missing in all others, it will generate very large residuals for these few cells. In turn, these cells might dominate in downstream processing. To avoid such unbalanced behavior, Hafemeister & Satija (2019) introduced a heuristic that clips all residuals to +-sqrt(n_cells). This is the default behavior of all functions for Pearson residuals discussed here. If desired, a different threshold can be set using the clip argument. If no clipping is desired, use clip=np.Inf. chunksize and best practice to obtain Pearson residuals for large datasets#; Raw scRNA UMI counts are usually sparse, and can thus be stored efficiently for large datasets. However, when the count matrix is transformed to Pearson residuals, the data becomes dense.

Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: e Pearson residuals, we need an estimation of the technical variance in the data. There is still a debate on which noise distribution is most appropiate for scRNA UMI data, with Poisson or the Negative binomial being likely candidates. We implemented the negative binomial model here, which is overdispersed compared to Poisson. The amount of overdispersion is controlled by the argument theta, where a smaller theta corresponds to larger overdispersion. Lause et al. (2021) recommend using the default theta=100, as noise in negative control data without biological variation was fit well by this value. If Poisson behavior is desired, the overdispersion parameter can instead be set to infinity (theta=np.Inf). Clipping threshold clip#; When a gene is expressed in only very few cells, and missing in all others, it will generate very large residuals for these few cells. In turn, these cells might dominate in downstream processing. To avoid such unbalanced behavior, Hafemeister & Satija (2019) introduced a heuristic that clips all residuals to +-sqrt(n_cells). This is the default behavior of all functions for Pearson residuals discussed here. If desired, a different threshold can be set using the clip argument. If no clipping is desired, use clip=np.Inf. chunksize and best practice to obtain Pearson residuals for large datasets#; Raw scRNA UMI counts are usually sparse, and can thus be stored efficiently for large datasets. However, when the count matrix is transformed to Pearson residuals, the data becomes dense. To avoid memory problems, we recommend that you reduce the size of your count matrix by gene selection, before running normalize_pearson_residuals(adata) on the reduced data. To perform RAM-efficient gene selection, use highly_variable_genes(adata,flavor='pearson_residuals') with the chunksize argument: This will still use Pearson residual variance to identify variable genes, but won’t compute all residuals at once.

",True,"The content discusses computational methods for handling and normalizing scRNA-seq data residuals, such as Pearson residuals. It involves selecting genes based on variability using 'highly_variable_genes' function, adjusting parameters like 'chunksize' to manage memory usage, and setting a clipping threshold to prevent outliers in residual calculations. These actions aim to ensure that the system can handle errors or incorrect values (e.g., large residuals) effectively by reducing computational demands and avoiding unbalanced data processing issues. This directly relates to the Safety attribute as it involves error detection and handling in data processing steps, preventing potential hazards like memory overflow or computational inefficiencies which could harm the analysis process.","

High proportions are indicative of poor-quality cells (Islam et al. 2014; Ilicic et al. 2016), possibly because of loss of cytoplasmic RNA from perforated cells. The reasoning is that mitochondria are larger than individual transcript molecules and less likely to escape through tears in the cell membrane.

2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content describes the use of a transformer in the neighbors function to process data for neighbor finding and distance calculations. It mentions storage locations for distances and connectivities which are related to the computation of these metrics. This directly relates to security by ensuring that sensitive data is handled properly, stored securely, and access is controlled through parameters like key_added. The use of transformers can also involve encryption or secure processing steps, which tie into security measures.","
