This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter. The; fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized; before by the caller. The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window; size (the size of the history buffer). It should be in the range 8..15 for; this version of the library. The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used; instead. windowBits must be greater than or equal to the windowBits value; provided to deflateInit2() while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if; deflateInit2() was not used. If a compressed stream with a larger window; size is given as input, inflate() will return with the error code; Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window. windowBits can also be zero to request that inflate use the window size in; the zlib header of the compressed stream. windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate. In this case, -windowBits; determines the window size. inflate() will then process raw deflate data,; not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not; looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream. This; is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format; such as zip. Those formats provide their own check values.

The function returns when either the input; * buffer is empty or the output buffer is full.; *; * On entry to isal_deflate(), next_in points to an input buffer and avail_in; * indicates the length of that buffer. Similarly next_out points to an empty; * output buffer and avail_out indicates the size of that buffer.; *; * The fields total_in and total_out start at 0 and are updated by; * isal_deflate(). These reflect the total number of bytes read or written so far.; *; * When the last input buffer is passed in, signaled by setting the; * end_of_stream, the routine will complete compression at the end of the input; * buffer, as long as the output buffer is big enough.; *; * The compression level can be set by setting level to any value between; * ISAL_DEF_MIN_LEVEL and ISAL_DEF_MAX_LEVEL. When the compression level is; * ISAL_DEF_MIN_LEVEL, hufftables can be set to a table trained for the the; * specific data type being compressed to achieve better compression. When a; * higher compression level is desired, a larger generic memory buffer needs to; * be supplied by setting level_buf and level_buf_size to represent the chunk of; * memory.

Add; 16 to windowBits to write a simple gzip header and trailer around the; compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper. The gzip header will have no; file name, no extra data, no comment, no modification time (set to zero), no; header crc, and the operating system will be set to 255 (unknown). If a; gzip stream is being written, strm->adler is a crc32 instead of an adler32. The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated; for the internal compression state. memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but is; slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory for; optimal speed. The default value is 8. See zconf.h for total memory usage; as a function of windowBits and memLevel. The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the; value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a; filter (or predictor), Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no; string match), or Z_RLE to limit match distances to one (run-length; encoding). Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat; random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to; compress them better. The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman; coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between; Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY. Z_RLE is designed to be almost as; fast as Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY, but give better compression for PNG image data. The; strategy parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the; correctness of the compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.; Z_FIXED prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler; decoder for special applications. deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_
