""Merging"" allows to create macro commands, e.g. TQCommand *macro = new TQCommand(""my macro"");; macro->Add(com1);; macro->Add(com2);. During Redo operation commands composing macro command are executed; sequentially in direct order (first in first out). During Undo,; they are executed in reverse order (last in first out). 6. Undo manager. TQUndoManager is recorder of undo and redo operations. This is; command history list which can be traversed backwards and upwards; performing undo and redo operations.; To register command TQUndoManager::Add(TObject*) method is used. TQUndoManager *history = new TQUndoManager();; history->Add(com);. TQUndoManager::Add automatically invokes execution of command's; Redo method. Use TQUndoManager::Undo to undo commands in history list.; Redo is Undo for undo action. Use TQUndoManager::Redo method for that.

",True,"The content provided is a list of method declarations and their definitions in C++ code related to a class called TCanvas. These methods appear to be related to user interaction, such as handling mouse events and canvas feedback. The Usability quality attribute focuses on how well users can use the software effectively. Since these methods deal with user interactions (like mouse movements and events), they contribute to usability by making the interface more responsive and efficient for users. For example, the ExecuteEvent method handles mouse clicks, which is essential for allowing users to interact with the canvas. The presence of such methods that handle user actions aligns with the aspect of usability as it relates to ease of use and efficiency in task accomplishment.","

",True,"The content provided seems to be technical documentation related to a Decision Tree implementation, specifically discussing parameters and methods used in node splitting. The terms like 'purity limit', 'Fisher criterion', 'variable importance' etc., are all related to machine learning concepts, particularly decision trees. These concepts tie into the usability of a system in that they relate to how effectively users (in this case developers) can utilize the system. For example, parameters such as 'randomisedTree' and 'usePoissonNvars' help in optimizing tree construction for usability by ensuring efficient splitting and pruning, which aids in user understanding and task efficiency. The mention of 'debugLevel' and 'fgRandomSeed' could be seen as logging parameters, but their presence doesn't negate the overall relevance to usability. Overall, while part of the content might be logging information, the majority focuses on settings and methods that enhance the system's usability by improving user experience through efficient and effective design decisions.","

Usability,"rder to use these algorithm the user needs to provide a function. ROOT provides a common way of specifying them via some interfaces; 13.7 ROOT::Math Function interfaces; To get a consistency in the mathematical methods within ROOT, there exists a set of interfaces to define the basic behaviour of a mathematical function. In order to use the classes presented in this chapter, the mathematical functions defined by the user must inherit from any of the classes seen in the figure:. ROOT::Math Function interface structure. 13.7.1 One-dimensional Function Interfaces; These interfaces are used for numerical algorithms operating only on one-dimensional functions and cannot be applied to multi-dimensional functions. For this case the users needs to define a function object which evaluates in one dimension, and the object will have to derivate from the following:. ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDim: This class is the most basic function. Provides a method to evaluate the function given a value (simple double) by implementing double operator() (const double ).

The source is quicker to transfer since it is only ~22 MB, but you will need to compile and link it. The binaries compiled with no debug information range from ~35 MB to ~45 MB depending on the target platform.; The installation and building of ROOT is described in Appendix A: Install and Build ROOT. You can download the binaries, or the source. The GNU g++ compiler on most UNIX platforms can compile ROOT.; Before downloading a binary version make sure your machine contains the right run-time environment. In most cases it is not possible to run a version compiled with, e.g., gcc4.0 on a platform where only gcc 3.2 is installed. In such cases you’ll have to install ROOT from source.; ROOT is currently running on the following platforms: supported platforms. GNU/Linux x86-32 (IA32) and x86-64 (AMD64)(GCC,Intel/icc, Portland/PGCC,KAI/KCC); Intel Itanium (IA64) GNU/Linux (GCC, Intel/ecc, SGI/CC); FreeBSD and OpenBSD (GCC); GNU/Hurd (GCC); HP HP-UX 10.x (IA32) and 11 (IA64) (HP CC, aCC, GCC); IBM AIX 4.1 (xlC compiler, GCC); Sun Solaris for SPARC (SUN C++ compiler, GCC); Sun Solaris for x86 (SUN C++ compiler, KAI/KCC); Compaq Alpha (GCC, KAI/KCC, DEC/CXX); SGI Irix 32 and 64 bits (GCC, KAI/KCC, SGI C++ compiler); Windows >= 95 (Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, Cygwin/GCC); MacOS X PPC, x86-32, x86-64 (GCC, Intel/ICC, IBM/xl); PowerPC with GNU/Linux and GCC, Debian v2; PowerPC64 with GNU/Linux and GCC; ARM with GNU/Linux and GCC; LynxOS. 1.6 The Organization of the ROOT Framework; Now after we know in abstract terms what the ROOT framework is, let us look at the physical directories and files that come with the ROOT installation. You may work on a platform where your system administrator has already installed ROOT. You will need to follow the specific development environment for your setup and you may not have write access to the directorie

Usability,"rs R,; O and T. Why one have to define so many volumes to make an R?""; A: Well, in real life some objects have much more complex shapes that an ""R"". The modeller cannot just know all of them; the idea is to make a complex object by using elementary building blocks that have known shapes (called ""primitive shapes""). Gluing these together in the appropriate way is the user responsibility.; Q: ""I am getting the global picture but not making much out of it... There; are also a lot of calls to TGeoVolume::AddNode() that I do not understand.""; A: A volume is positioned inside another one by using this method.

Usability,"s. Another particular case where volume families are used is when we want that a volume positioned inside a container to match one ore more container limits. Suppose we want to position the same box inside 2 different volumes and we want the Z size to match the one of each container:; TGeoVolume *container1 = gGeoManager->MakeBox(""C1"",imed,10,10,30);; TGeoVolume *container2 = gGeoManager->MakeBox(""C2"",imed,10,10,20);; TGeoVolume *pvol = gGeoManager->MakeBox(""PVOL"",jmed,3,3,-1);; container1->AddNode(pvol,1);; container2->AddNode(pvol,1);; Note that the third parameter of PVOL is negative, which does not make sense as half-length on Z. This is interpreted as: when positioned, create a box replacing all invalid parameters with the corresponding dimensions of the container. This is also internally handled by the **TGeoVolumeMulti** class, which does not need to be instantiated by users.; Dividing Volumes; Volumes can be divided according a pattern. The simplest division can be done along one axis that can be: X,Y,Z,Phi,Rxy or Rxyz. Let's take a simple case: we would like to divide a box in N equal slices along X coordinate, representing a new volume family. Supposing we already have created the initial box, this can be done like:; TGeoVolume *slicex = box->Divide(""SLICEX"",1,N);; N#define N; TGeoVolume::Dividevirtual TGeoVolume * Divide(const char *divname, Int_t iaxis, Int_t ndiv, Double_t start, Double_t step, Int_t numed=0, Option_t *option="""")Division a la G3.Definition TGeoVolume.cxx:1103; boxvoid box(Int_t pat, Double_t x1, Double_t y1, Double_t x2, Double_t y2)Definition fillpatterns.C:1; Here SLICEX is the name of the new family representing all slices and 1 is the slicing axis.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: s. Another particular case where volume families are used is when we want that a volume positioned inside a container to match one ore more container limits. Suppose we want to position the same box inside 2 different volumes and we want the Z size to match the one of each container:; TGeoVolume *container1 = gGeoManager->MakeBox(""C1"",imed,10,10,30);; TGeoVolume *container2 = gGeoManager->MakeBox(""C2"",imed,10,10,20);; TGeoVolume *pvol = gGeoManager->MakeBox(""PVOL"",jmed,3,3,-1);; container1->AddNode(pvol,1);; container2->AddNode(pvol,1);; Note that the third parameter of PVOL is negative, which does not make sense as half-length on Z. This is interpreted as: when positioned, create a box replacing all invalid parameters with the corresponding dimensions of the container. This is also internally handled by the **TGeoVolumeMulti** class, which does not need to be instantiated by users.; Dividing Volumes; Volumes can be divided according a pattern. The simplest division can be done along one axis that can be: X,Y,Z,Phi,Rxy or Rxyz. Let's take a simple case: we would like to divide a box in N equal slices along X coordinate, representing a new volume family. Supposing we already have created the initial box, this can be done like:; TGeoVolume *slicex = box->Divide(""SLICEX"",1,N);; N#define N; TGeoVolume::Dividevirtual TGeoVolume * Divide(const char *divname, Int_t iaxis, Int_t ndiv, Double_t start, Double_t step, Int_t numed=0, Option_t *option="""")Division a la G3.Definition TGeoVolume.cxx:1103; boxvoid box(Int_t pat, Double_t x1, Double_t y1, Double_t x2, Double_t y2)Definition fillpatterns.C:1; Here SLICEX is the name of the new family representing all slices and 1 is the slicing axis. The meaning of the axis index is the following: for all volumes having shapes like box, trd1, trd2, trap, gtraorpara -1, 2, 3 mean X, Y, Z; for tube, tubs, cone, cons -1 means Rxy, 2 means phi and 3 means Z; for pcon and pgon - 2 means phi and 3 means Z; for spheres 1 means Rand 2 means ph

Content: sigmoids can approximate any continuous function.; 2- Trained with output=1 for the signal and 0 for the background, the approximated function of inputs X is the probability of signal, knowing X.; 5.12.3 Learning Methods; The aim of all learning methods is to minimize the total error on a set of weighted examples. The error is defined as the sum in quadrate, divided by two, of the error on each individual output neuron. In all methods implemented in this library, one needs to compute the first derivative of that error with respect to the weights. Exploiting the well-known properties of the derivative, one can express this derivative as the product of the local partial derivative by the weighted sum of the outputs derivatives (for a neuron) or as the product of the input value with the local partial derivative of the output neuron (for a synapse).

Content: ssible to exclude individual bins from the fit through fit->ExcludeBin(bin #);; where the given bin number is assumed to follow the TH1::GetBin() numbering. Any bins excluded in this way can be included again using the corresponding fit->IncludeBin(bin #);; ; Weights histograms; Weights histograms (for a motivation see the above publication) can be specified for the individual MC sources through fit->SetWeight(parameter #, pointer to weights histogram);; and unset by specifying a null pointer. Obtaining fit results; The fit is carried out through Int_t status = fit->Fit();; where status is the code returned from the ""MINIMIZE"" command. For fits that converged, parameter values and errors can be obtained through fit->GetResult(parameter #, value, error);; and the histogram corresponding to the total Monte Carlo prediction (which is not the same as a simple weighted sum of the input Monte Carlo distributions) can be obtained by TH1* result = fit->GetPlot();; ; Using different histograms; It is possible to change the histogram being fitted through fit->SetData(TH1* data);; and to change the template histogram for a given parameter number through fit->SetMC(parameter #, TH1* MC);; This can speed up code in case of multiple data or template histograms; however, it should be done with care as any settings are taken over from the previous fit. In addition, neither the dimensionality nor the numbers of bins of the histograms should change (in that case it is better to instantiate a new TFractionFitter object).

One can disable the automatic recovery procedure by setting; TFile.Recover 0; in the system.rootrc file. Int_t ReOpen(Option_t* mode); Reopen a file with a different access mode, like from READ to; UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE, RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the; mode argument can be either ""READ"" or ""UPDATE"". The method returns; 0 in case the mode was successfully modified, 1

",False,"The content appears to be documentation for a software library (ROOT) specific to axis painting and labeling functionality. It includes method definitions, such as Paint, SetLabelSize, SetFunction, SetName, etc., along with their parameters and descriptions.
