Performance,"> I'm not sure i fully understand the point of caching. So you store the exact output of all the computations of a function so that it can be rerun exactly? How big do those objects become?. We've had problems in the past when running notebooks on different computers (by having different distros or just using the server) or just updating a library produced different results in terms of embedding/clustering... The other benefit is that if analyzing the data in multiple stages (or multiple times), you'd have to either store the adata object after each stage and then load it for the next one. Or just run it from scratch, which can take some time. Not to mention a forgotten parameter which affects reproducibility. The caching makes this convenient - just run the notebook.

Though please cc us on other ones. Should add I think CuPy devs will want to keep their sparse implementation in pretty close alignment with SciPy's. So I don't think CuPy's sparse will solve any issues that SciPy's sparse does not also solve. However things that CuPy does not implement that SciPy does implement, are likely in scope. Though no idea where these sit in the priority queue ATM.

(Seurat's default method is wilcoxon), in this case, I can find interesting markers calculated by Seurat but not in Scanpy's.

Performance,"Hey! 😄 . I'd in principle happy if we move the default `scanpy.settings.cachedir` from `./cache/` to `appdirs.user_cache_dir()`. . However, if then any Scanpy installation breaks, as _the main hpc I'm on 1gb of space where appdirs would put these files_, I would probably not make this the default, but choose something like `~/cache-scanpy/`, that is, a visible directory in home (if we really want, `~/.scanpy/` is also fine). Under https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html#settings, we could also talk about other alternatives. I second Isaac's concern. Like many others, I'm computing on AWS these days and there, the canonical way of making data locally accessible is via EBS volumes. Hence, I'm used to setting the cachedir to that mount point with a visible name, knowing that this can hold a lot of data.

However, if then any Scanpy installation breaks, as _the main hpc I'm on 1gb of space where appdirs would put these files_, I would probably not make this the default, but choose something like `~/cache-scanpy/`, that is, a visible directory in home (if we really want, `~/.scanpy/` is also fine). Under https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html#settings, we could also talk about other alternatives. I second Isaac's concern. Like many others, I'm computing on AWS these days and there, the canonical way of making data locally accessible is via EBS volumes.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: Hi @LuckyMD ; Thank you for the fast reply. Yes to FastMNN, as I understand from using align_cds – when you specify discretely what you want to remove e.g. sample-sample variation it calls FastMNN from batchelor. Thanks for the recommendation – I will check out Scanorama, been meaning to read the review on integration techniques. . > you will only get an integrated graph structure with this for scvelo, which may help a little, but won't remove the batch effect for RNA velocity calculation. scvelo doesn't currently have any batch removal in its pipeline as it is quite difficult to add as it works directly from the normalized count data and fits a model to these. Ahh okay, I misunderstood the process then – my understanding was that some of the mnn correction would be carried over when performing velocity analysis. I will check out the scvelo forum for info on comparing samples. . Thank you.

",False,"The conversation discusses data analysis techniques and tools for working with biological data, particularly in the context of RNA velocity calculations.

Performance,"Hi @Olivia117,. Let's see if I can help. I think there are a few misunderstandings here. It appears that you are mixing the `adata.var['highly_variable']` approach with the `adata.obsm['X_geneset1']` approach Alex suggested. Firstly, there is a typo in Alex' code above. It should read:; ```; adata.obsm['X_geneset1'] = adata[:,['gene1', 'gene2', 'gene3', 'gene4']].X; sc.pp.neighbors(adata, use_rep='X_geneset1'); ```; I believe. Your error is due to this typo. The command is interpreting `'Map7d1'` as a cell index rather than a gene index. However, there are also a few other things.; 1. `adata.var['highly_variable']` takes a boolean list, so you should assign e.g., `[True, True, False, False]` if you are interested in only the first two genes out of a total of 4 genes in the dataset. This can be trivially extended to select your Gene1, Gene,... Gene500 that you are interested in. When using this approach you will need to run `sc.pp.pca(adata, svd_solver='arpack', use_highly_variable=True)` and `sc.pp.neighbors(adata)` before clustering with louvain or leiden. This approach subsets to your genes of interest, then performs PCA on this gene subset, and builds a KNN graph based on Euclidean distances in this PCA space, which is then used for clustering.; 2. If you don't want to use the route via PCA, you need to assign to `adata.obsm` as Alex suggests (with my typo correction above). Even if you do not have anything in `adata.obsm`, it should still work.

Performance,"Hi James!. Thank you for the remark! And you're right... several repetitions of the following are consistent:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16916678/42413998-8527ef8e-822c-11e8-9e45-8aa30f5bb9a7.png). I'm aware of numpy's inplace functionality, and we've discussed it even for log1p... I don't know why we missed using it... Also, I wouldn't have thought that the speedup would be so dramatic, but of course, already for better memory efficiency we should have done it. I'll go through the rest of the toolkit and see whether there is another such striking omission... Regarding the two other things you changed:; - `chunked` and `chunk_size` are in particular important when running an `AnnData` object in `backed` mode, when it's so large that it doesn't fit into memory. To date, this only works for the two functions that were the bottleneck for very large data (`pp.log1p` and `pp.pca`), where it already gives remarkable memory use reduction in `memory` mode. Of course, this is considerably slower than feeding in the full data matrix. We'll use AnnData's chunked functionality in other tools, soon. We're also using it when working with tensorflow. At some point, when you open an AnnData in `backed` mode, the whole pipeline will run through by processing chunks and the user won't have to do a single change to his or her code. By that, code that has been written for data that fits into memory will automatically scale to many millions of observations. Also, there will be global settings that allow to manually determine whether the whole pipeline should run on chunks but still load the basic data matrix into memory, something we've found useful in several occasions.; - not returning `None` when modifying a reference inplace: the very first draft of Scanpy was written this way. then @flying-sheep remarked, that it shouldn't and I agreed with him right away: if you return the changed object, you'll allow two different variable names for the same reference.

Content: Hi James!. Thank you for the remark!

I'm aware of numpy's inplace functionality, and we've discussed it even for log1p... I don't know why we missed using it... Also, I wouldn't have thought that the speedup would be so dramatic, but of course, already for better memory efficiency we should have done it. I'll go through the rest of the toolkit and see whether there is another such striking omission... Regarding the two other things you changed:; - `chunked` and `chunk_size` are in particular important when running an `AnnData` object in `backed` mode, when it's so large that it doesn't fit into memory. To date, this only works for the two functions that were the bottleneck for very large data (`pp.log1p` and `pp.pca`), where it already gives remarkable memory use reduction in `memory` mode. Of course, this is considerably slower than feeding in the full data matrix. We'll use AnnData's chunked functionality in other tools, soon. We're also using it when working with tensorflow. At some point, when you open an AnnData in `backed` mode, the whole pipeline will run through by processing chunks and the user won't have to do a single change to his or her code. By that, code that has been written for data that fits into memory will automatically scale to many millions of observations. Also, there will be global settings that allow to manually determine whether the whole pipeline should run on chunks but still load the basic data matrix into memory, something we've found useful in several occasions.; - not returning `None` when modifying a reference inplace: the very first draft of Scanpy was written this way. then @flying-sheep remarked, that it shouldn't and I agreed with him right away: if you return the changed object, you'll allow two different variable names for the same reference.

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:. ValueError Traceback (most recent call last); <ipython-input-48-abf5bf78cb77> in <module>; ----> 1 sc.pl.dpt_timeseries(adata_HVG). ~/.conda/envs/python3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/scanpy/plotting/_tools/__init__.py in dpt_timeseries(adata, color_map, show, save, as_heatmap); 159 if as_heatmap:; 160 # plot time series as heatmap, as in Haghverdi et al.

ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.; ```. I thought that this might be something to do with the fact that the `np.ones` object is a numpy array instead of a pandas series so I tried substituting this with the line `adata.uns['dpt_changepoints'] = pd.Series(np.ones(adata.obs['dpt_order_indices'].shape[0] - 1))` instead, but this still yielded the same error. Thanks in advance!. Update: I just tried to run this command having used `branching=1' in my analysis and not performing the above correction (even though I know it's inappropriate for my particular system, branching=0 is what I want to use) and it still yielded the same error. As such I think perhaps this could be something independent of the above issue.

As a second note of caution, floating point numbers should not be compared with the `==` operator (see for example [here](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/)). → A more common way would be to use e.g. `np.allclose()` for this purpose. ```; ### Scanpy scale vs my_scale_function. print(""Rescaled with my_scale_function:""); mtx_rescaled = my_scale_function(adata.X). print(""Do a numpy check for closeness of floats:""); print(np.allclose(adata.X, mtx_rescaled)); ```. ```; Do a numpy check for closeness of floats:; False; ```.

This is because not all genes appear scaled, and your function now actually is doing that.; ```; adata.X.var(0); ```. ```; array([0.9996213 , 0.97964925, 0.29805112, ...,

Performance,"Hi,. `sc.tl.rank_genes_groups()` treats each gene as an independent variable in the test. Thus, the only difference if you were to subset the genes would be that the multiple testing correction would be over fewer genes. You can also do that manually by looking at the `adata.uns['rank_genes']['pvals'][CLUSTER_ID]` and doing the multiple-testing correction yourself over the gene set you care about. However, the p-values of this test are inflated anyway, and therefore they should be used with caution.

Then you need to perform multiple testing correction over those p-values. And that would be the result you would get from a subsetting.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: I agree that this should not belong to 'external' but to the main API. . Also, I would not be initially concerned about performance. Having the tool first is more important at the moment. We can later see how can be optimized.

Content: I guess we can close with this. And sorry, I forgot to answer the above:; > I view my goal here as allowing more representations as input. When I say ""representation"", I mean a feature space representation, which is directly amenable to differentiable mappings, hence optimization and learning. When you say ""graph representation"" that might be a legit notion, too; and one can definitely think about learning different graph representations (by transforming them back to a vector space). But to me, it appears much more reasonable and straight forward to do all the inference on the feature space representation. And one should do it an a way so that the applied metric used to analyze the arising manifold in the learned representation does make sense. Of course, if you work directly with raw data, using different metrics can capture a lot of what you'd otherwise need to learn or preprocess (invariance to scales, ...). Hope this helps a little bit.

Content: I only can advice you on your second part of questions there is no rule of thumb for that. I also don't know what do you exactly mean by best suggestion resolution and how did you assess that. This is a general problem for many supervised clustering methods such as k-mean that user has to provide number of clusters or in this case the resolution which determines the number of clusters. Although there are some indirect ways to assess the clustering quality for example silhouette coefficient which gives you a score between -1 to 1 that tell you how similar your point in each clusters are. The other possibility is that you already expect the number of clusters so you can optimize the resolution based on your previous knowledge. ; @falexwolf Out of curiosity, can we integrate such methods like silhouette coefficient inside scanpy? that would be cool!

Content: I think our initially identified bottleneck with using sparse arrays was this here https://github.com/cupy/cupy/issues/2359. The analysis workflows usually have very clear computational bottlenecks, so the translation to GPU should take this into consideration: Is it feasible in terms of available code to keep the array on GPU and actually perform all operations there or will this stay a CPU centric library that deploys particular steps to GPU. In[batchglm / diffxpy](https://github.com/theislab/batchglm) we took the first approach, we build ontop of (a CPU centric scanpy and) deployed GLM fitting to GPU via tensorflow2, we also use estimation code in dask in the same package that we could in principle use with cupy, right now this just sits ontop of numpy. . Happy to be involved with this stuff, I spent some time thinking about this with @quasiben already. I think it is really crucial to figure out where it makes sense to invest time to build pipelines that can be end-to-end be executed on GPU: because of the large number of tools this will not be the entire scanpy tool environment for a long time, so mixed workflows will be necessary. . 1. I would for example restrict all efforts to the submodule `sc.tl` for now because this contains most potential bottlenecks I think that are frequently used. ""end-to-end"" doesnt need to go all the way up to analysis graph leaves, such as plotting, in my opinion, as their is little performance gain there.; 2. Nice to have for non-core functionalities would then be some examples of how GPU-based arrays can be used within anndata so that 3rd parties can modify their tools to directly operate on the GPU array rather then starting to copy arrays. I think this is not really clear for most people right now (I have never done that either) and documenting this properly / improving this would help a lot.

These won't run by default (they take a while, and can fail for network access reasons), but will run with `pytest --internet-tests`. Note that `test_burczynski06` will fail until this get's rebased on master. Thoughts?. Also travis failed this for `scanpy/tests/test_marker_gene_overlap.py` failing an assertion on the first time around, but passed when I triggered a new build. Not sure what's up with that.

Content: Thank you for developing the method, I'm looking forward to being able to use it. One thing that the deviances did was perform a chi-square test on the obtained values, with degrees of freedom based on the number of cells. I was fond of that as it translated into a data-driven cutoff for feature selection rather than requiring some number of top genes. Is there a chance of something similar showing up here? Apologies if this is not the place to ask this, but I'd be even more likely to switch over if I could have the option to avoid the parameterisation that tends to come with HVG identification.

",True,"The provided content appears to be a code snippet and logging output related to performance in the context of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) processing in a Python environment. The code includes setting random seeds for reproducibility, using specific solver methods, and comparing results across multiple runs. The output indicates that 6 out of 10 runs produced identical results. This suggests an exploration of the consistency and variability in computational performance when running PCA on a dataset under controlled conditions. Therefore, the content aligns with the Performance quality attribute by focusing on optimizing resource utilization and managing timing requirements through systematic testing and result comparison.","

Performance,"Thanks for your reply! (And no worries - mine is even later). . I see your point about ecosystem vs. external. My main qualm about ecosystem (at least in its current form) is that it's just links to external projects that happen to use scanpy, and the burden of downloading these projects, learning their unique syntax, and seeing how they apply to the scanpy project at hand is off-loaded to the user. The main reason I have pushed for inclusion in external is the convenience of being able to call the function with a single scanpy command, in a format the user is already very familiar with. On the other hand, I do see your point about code maintenance and syncing between my project and scanpy. Changes in my shannonca project might necessitate changes in the wrapper function. That said, since my wrapper is very agnostic to the underlying methods used, I would hope this wouldn't have to happen very often (basically, it just controls where the inputs are found and where the outputs are deposited. This wouldn't change unless scanpy's architecture did). However, as currently written, the documentation may have to change more frequently since it refers to specific function arguments used in my package. For now, I am willing to open a new pull request into ecosystem (if that is the correct workflow) and you can feel free to close this issue. For future releases, if you want to combine the convenience of external with the low maintenance burden of ecosystem, you might consider allowing external modules to ""outsource"" their documentation.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: The biggest ones are in order:. 1. [ ] `numba`: Hard to defer. We’d have to create our own `jit` decorator returning a callable object that numba-compiles and caches the real function on its first invocation; 2. ~~`pandas`~~: Used all over the place, not feasible to defer; 3. [x] `sklearn.metrics`: Easy to defer I think, let’s start with this.; 4. [ ] `matplotlib.pyplot`: Shouldn’t be used in a library at all. It exists to import the kitchen sink in order to be low-friction for interactive use. Hard to do since we rely on it a lot, but we should do it.; 5. [x] `networkx`: Used in DPT, paga and plotting. Pretty easy. We use pandas all over the place, and it’s hard to defer loading numba as it works with decorators. /edit: shaved off another 2/5 in a7729bc61ac569a718075edb4466852b0b4a696a via `sklearn.metrics`, `scipy.stats`, and `networkx`.

Content: earn` and I want this to ""just work"". I agree with you that `iloc` vs `loc` indexing is not straightforward to lay users, but I think it's a mistake to change the convention for how one indexes positionally vs using labels. _Especially when the underlying data structures is often a dataframe._ Instead of breaking these conventions, I would love to see the tool ""just work"" and make sure the tutorials and documentation make the conventions exceedingly clear for new users. I'm not sure what's the best way to resolve this, because I think this line of thinking results in a couple larger design questions for scanpy as well. For example, should AnnData objects be valid input for numpy ufuncs? I.e. should the following code work?. ```python; import numpy as np; import pandas as pd; import scanpy as sc. data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.normal(size=(100,2))); adata = sc.AnnData(data); np.sqrt(adata); ```; Currently this raises a `TypeError`. Why shouldn't this ""Just work""? What about the convention of returning a copy by default, instead of modifying objects in place? I can't think of many other Python toolkits that don't return a copy when you perform some operation on a data object. I would really love to use scanpy / anndata more in my day to day work. Right now, this lack of compatibility is the hurdle that prevents that. I disagree that people who are familiar with pandas and numpy will have an easy time coming to grips with leveraging a tool that doesn't interact well with the greater ecosystem of data analysis tools in Python. I think these users are more likely to use scanpy / anndata only to get access to the methods that are only implemented in scanpy, and then return to the ecosystem of tools that all work together. I can only speak to my experience, but this is how I use scanpy. If scanpy were to adopt greater inter-compatibility, I would be happy both to use it more and also to help contribute to its development and documentation. I'm excited to hear your thoughts!

",True,"The content provided in the 'Content' section appears to be a stack trace from an error that occurred during the execution of some Python code. The error mentions issues with threading and concurrency, as seen in the file paths like 'threading.py' and references to thread IDs. These elements indicate problems related to how threads are being managed or utilized within the system, which directly ties into the concept of performance. Specifically, performance is concerned with managing resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying loads. If there's a thread-related error that causes the system to slow down or malfunction, this would fall under the domain of performance issues. Therefore, the content accurately reflects aspects of the 'Performance' quality attribute.","

Performance,"ssion"". Completely agreed. > I'm interested in the `sc.ex` module you're suggesting. Would you mind elaborating a bit more on that, particularly on some functions that would be there?. **Re sc.extract**. One of the core ideas of Scanpy (as opposed to, say, scikit learn) was to have this model of taking the burden of bookkeeping from the user as much as possible. This design messed up, in particular, the return values of `rank_genes_groups`. I would have loved to return a collection of dataframes, but I didn't want to mess this up. Also, the return values of `pp.neighbors` or `pl.paga` aren't great. There is a trade-off between having nice APIs and return values (such as dataframes) and a transparent and efficient on-disk representation in terms of HDF5, zarr or another format. These days, I'd even consider simply pickling things, which would have saved us a lot of work; but I thought that we'd need established compression facilities, concatenation possibilities, some way to manually ""look into"" an on-disk object (both from R and from the command line) so that it's maximally transparent and then the widely established, cross-language, but old-school and not entirely scalable HDF5 seemed the best. The Human Cell Atlas decided in favor of zarr meanwhile. But that's not a drama, because Scanpy only writes ""storage-friendly"" values to AnnData, that is, arrays and dicts. HDF5 knows how to handle them and zarr also. If one uses xarray or dataframes, one has to think about how this gets written to disk. That being said: it's likely that we'll continue to choose representations for on-disk (and in-memory) storage that aren't convenient (rec arrays, for instance), a three-dimensional xarray and dicts. A general solution for this problem would be the mentioned `sc.extract` API, similar to `sc.plotting` (which also completely hides the complexity of the object from the user), but not for returning visualizations, but nice objects.

Would you mind elaborating a bit more on that, particularly on some functions that would be there?. **Re sc.extract**. One of the core ideas of Scanpy (as opposed to, say, scikit learn) was to have this model of taking the burden of bookkeeping from the user as much as possible. This design messed up, in particular, the return values of `rank_genes_groups`. I would have loved to return a collection of dataframes, but I didn't want to mess this up.

My current inclination is to revert most changes to `obs_df` and `var_df` from this PR and #1499. This should leave the use of indices as groupby untouched. Also, the loss of perfomance from reverting #1499 should be partially mitigated by improvements in pandas (see https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/37954). We would keep all the user facing changes, and all the tests from both PRs. We can then make a release now, and can patch in performance boosts during the release cycle. Do you agree with this assessment? If not, could you propose an alternative?

As far as I know, people often store log-transformed counts to `adata.raw` (an example could be found [here](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html)).; > * However, according to [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/theislab/scanpy_usage/blob/master/180209_cell_cycle/cell_cycle.ipynb), ""Log-transformation of data and scaling should always be performed before scoring.""; > ; > In this situation, when people use `adata.raw` to store logged values, and apply `score_genes_cell_cycle` method to the object without explicitly setting `use_raw = False`, the results could be problematic, unless there is some specific processing overwritting `score_genes`' initial behaviour that I was not aware of. Hi @LuckyMD , I also have a few uncertainties regarding the `score_genes` function in scanpy. Although the documentation states that it behaves similarly to seurat, I came across some references ([here](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/blob/763259d05991d40721dee99c9919ec6d4491d15e/R/utilities.R#L273) and [here](https://github.com/mojaveazure/seurat-object/blob/3c9e3df0b44a7f6e31e8e0af5d04d398b2b1f004/R/assay.R#L1040)) that suggest seurat operates on the slot of data corresponding to the value after logNormalize. I would appreciate it if you could help me understand why scanpy suggests operating on the matrix after scale instead. Please forgive me if I missed something obvious.
