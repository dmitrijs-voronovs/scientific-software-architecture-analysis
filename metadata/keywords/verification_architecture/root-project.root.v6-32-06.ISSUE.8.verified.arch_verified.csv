Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided is a stack trace and error messages related to a system crash. This indicates that the system is not performing as expected under certain conditions, which directly relates to the Performance quality attribute. The stack trace details the sequence of events leading to the crash, pointing to specific areas in the code that may need optimization or debugging to improve system performance. Therefore, this content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided is a stack trace from an error in a system. This indicates potential issues with how resources are being managed under varying loads, which aligns with the definition of performance as managing resource contention and optimizing utilization.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content provided discusses system crashes, error handling, and debugging information. It includes stack traces from a Unix system, specifically related to ROOT (a physics software framework). The focus is on identifying issues in the software during runtime, such as signal handling and system calls. While this involves low-level details and potential issues with system configuration or dependencies, it does not explicitly discuss high-level architectural concepts, patterns, or decisions. It is more about troubleshooting specific crashes rather than analyzing the structure, interactions, or design of the overall system."

Content: @gargvaibhav64, this PR should get you going. What we should do next is we should put a separate module for vcruntime* header files which seem to connect to both libc and std. That would mean we will have to have a separate modulemap vcruntime.h, corecrt.h (?) and vcruntime_string.h. On the ROOT side, before loading libc [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/core/metacling/src/TCling.cxx#L1145-L1149) we should load the new `vcruntime`module.
