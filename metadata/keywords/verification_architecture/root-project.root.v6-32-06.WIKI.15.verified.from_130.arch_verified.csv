Reliability of MINUIT error estimates. MINUIT always carries around its own current estimates of the parameter; errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how accurate they; are at any given point in the execution. For example, at initialization,; these estimates are just the starting step sizes as specified by the user.; After a HESSE step, the errors are usually quite accurate,; unless there has been a problem. MINUIT, when it prints out error values,; also gives some indication of how reliable it thinks they are. For; example, those marked CURRENT GUESS ERROR are only working values; not to be believed, and APPROXIMATE ERROR means that they have; been calculated but there is reason to believe that they may not be; accurate. If no mitigating adjective is given, then at least MINUIT believes the; errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that MINUIT; has been fooled. Some visible signs that MINUIT may have been fooled are:. Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis.; Failure to find new minimum.; Value of EDM too big (estimated Distance to Minimum).; Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some parameters; are known to be uncorrelated with the others.; Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).

Availability,"he desired limits). Therefore the internal error matrix kept by Minuit must be transformed to an external error matrix for the user. This is done by multiplying the (I,J)th element by DEXDIN(I)*DEXDIN(J), where DEXDIN is the derivative of the external value with respect to the internal value at the minimum. This is a linearisation of the transformation, and is the only way to produce an error matrix in external coordinates meaningful to the user. But when reporting the individual parabolic errors for limited parameters, Minuit can do a little better, so it does. In this case, Minuit actually transforms the ends of the internal ""error bar"" to external coordinates and reports the length of this transformed interval.

",True,"The content provided appears to be code snippets from a C++ file, specifically functions related to retrieving data values and error handling for points. The functions include assertions to validate their inputs, return appropriate data pointers based on indices, and handle different types of errors. This aligns with the concept of Availability as it ensures that the system can reliably retrieve and handle errors without causing failures. The code focuses on ensuring that when a function is called with a valid index within the maximum points defined, it safely accesses the corresponding data pointer.

The presence of functions related to data transmission, file handling, and system administration suggests that the system is designed to handle multiple tasks efficiently. This contributes to the overall availability and reliability of the system, as it ensures that critical operations can be performed when required. Functions like 'CollectInputFrom' and 'CheckFile' imply mechanisms for gathering and verifying data, which supports fault tolerance and quick recovery in case of issues. Additionally, functions such as 'DeActivateAsyncInput' and 'DisablePackages' provide control over system processes, allowing for targeted shutdowns or repairs without impacting the overall functionality too severely. The system's ability to manage these operations efficiently enhances its availability by minimizing downtime.

5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content appears to be code related to error handling and generating user-defined error pages. This includes setting up default error messages based on different status codes (e.g., 404, 500-599). The code uses mg_snprintf for string formatting to create these error messages. It also checks the length of strings and truncates them if necessary. Additionally, it handles file extensions when determining how to format error pages. This indicates that the system is designed to handle errors gracefully by providing meaningful and formatted responses, which contributes to availability by minimizing downtime through clear communication of issues. The presence of error handling mechanisms supports the quality attribute of Availability as defined in the attribute description.","

(d) uncorrelated errors on background sources, taken as the errors; provided with the background histograms. (e) scale errors on background sources. Source (a) is providede with the original histogram histA; TUnfoldSys(histA,...). Sources (b) are added by calls to; AddSysError(). The systematic uncertainty on tau (c) is set by; SetTauError(). Backgound sources causing errors of type (d) and (e) are added by; SubtractBackground(). NOTE:. Systematic errors (a), (b), (c) are propagated to the result; AFTER unfolding. Background errors (d) and (e) are added to the data errors; BEFORE unfolding. For this reason:; errors of type (d) and (e) are INCLUDED in the standard error matrix; and other methods provided by the base class TUnfold:; GetOutput(); GetEmatrix(). whereas errors of type (a), (b), (c) are NOT INCLUDED in the methods; provided by the base class TUnfold.

Availability,"his set of varied values, e.g. ""ptvariation"". Vary provides a natural and flexible syntax to define systematic variations that automatically propagate to Filters, Defines and results. RDataFrame usage of columns with attached variations does not change, but for results that depend on any varied quantity, a map/dictionary of varied results can be produced with ROOT::RDF::Experimental::VariationsFor (see the example below).; The dictionary will contain a ""nominal"" value (accessed with the ""nominal"" key) for the unchanged result, and values for each of the systematic variations that affected the result (via upstream Filters or via direct or indirect dependencies of the column values on some registered variations). The keys will be a composition of variation names and tags, e.g. ""pt:up"" and ""pt:down"" for the example below.; In the following example we add up/down variations of pt and fill a histogram with a quantity that depends on pt. We automatically obtain three histograms in output (""nominal"", ""pt:up"" and ""pt:down""): auto nominal_hx =; df.Vary(""pt"", [] (double pt) { return RVecD{pt*0.9, pt*1.1}; }, {""down"", ""up""}); .Filter(""pt > k""); .Define(""x"", someFunc, {""pt""}); .Histo1D(""x"");; ; auto hx = ROOT::RDF::Experimental::VariationsFor(nominal_hx);; hx[""nominal""].Draw();; hx[""pt:down""].Draw(""SAME"");; hx[""pt:up""].Draw(""SAME"");; RDataFrame computes all variations as part of a single loop over the data. In particular, this means that I/O and computation of values shared among variations only happen once for all variations. Thus, the event loop run-time typically scales much better than linearly with the number of variations.; RDataFrame lazily computes the varied values required to produce the outputs of VariationsFor(). If VariationsFor() was not called for a result, the computations are only run for the nominal case.; See other overloads for examples when variations are added for multiple existing columns, or when the tags are auto-generated instead of being directly defi",down,MatchSource.WIKI,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RInterface.html:150014,down,150014,doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RInterface.html,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RInterface.html,1,['down'],['down'],"The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery.

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: his set of varied values, e.g. ""ptvariation"". Vary provides a natural and flexible syntax to define systematic variations that automatically propagate to Filters, Defines and results. RDataFrame usage of columns with attached variations does not change, but for results that depend on any varied quantity, a map/dictionary of varied results can be produced with ROOT::RDF::Experimental::VariationsFor (see the example below).; The dictionary will contain a ""nominal"" value (accessed with the ""nominal"" key) for the unchanged result, and values for each of the systematic variations that affected the result (via upstream Filters or via direct or indirect dependencies of the column values on some registered variations). The keys will be a composition of variation names and tags, e.g. ""pt:up"" and ""pt:down"" for the example below.; In the following example we add up/down variations of pt and fill a histogram with a quantity that depends on pt. We automatically obtain three histograms in output (""nominal"", ""pt:up"" and ""pt:down""): auto nominal_hx =; df.Vary(""pt"", [] (double pt) { return RVecD{pt*0.9, pt*1.1}; }, {""down"", ""up""}); .Filter(""pt > k""); .Define(""x"", someFunc, {""pt""}); .Histo1D(""x"");; ; auto hx = ROOT::RDF::Experimental::VariationsFor(nominal_hx);; hx[""nominal""].Draw();; hx[""pt:down""].Draw(""SAME"");; hx[""pt:up""].Draw(""SAME"");; RDataFrame computes all variations as part of a single loop over the data. In particular, this means that I/O and computation of values shared among variations only happen once for all variations. Thus, the event loop run-time typically scales much better than linearly with the number of variations.; RDataFrame lazily computes the varied values required to produce the outputs of VariationsFor(). If VariationsFor() was not called for a result, the computations are only run for the nominal case.; See other overloads for examples when variations are added for multiple existing columns, or when the tags are auto-generated instead of being directly defi

Data:

Content: hms have been developed (Gauss-Newton, Levenber-Marquart conjugate gradients, etc.) and more or less successfully implemented into programs for analysis of complex spectra. They are based on matrix inversion that can impose appreciable convergence difficulties mainly for large number of fitted parameters. Peaks can be fitted separately, each peak (or multiplets) in a region or together all peaks in a spectrum. To fit separately each peak one needs to determine the fitted region. However it can happen that the regions of neighboring peaks are overlapping (mainly in 2-dimensional spectra). Then the results of fitting are very poor. On the other hand, when fitting together all peaks found in a spectrum, one needs to have a method that is stable (converges) and fast enough to carry out fitting in reasonable time. The gradient methods based on the inversion of large matrices are not applicable because of two reasons. calculation of inverse matrix is extremely time consuming;; due to accumulation of truncation and rounding-off errors the result can become worthless. We have implemented two kinds of fitting functions. The first approach is based on the algorithm without matrix inversion [9]-awmi algorithm. It allows to fit large blocks of data and large number of parameters.; The other one is based on calculation of the system of linear equations using Stiefel-Hestens method [10]. It converges faster than awmi algorithm, however it is not suitable to fit large number of parameters.; 5.1 1-DIMENSIONAL SPECTRA. the quantity to be minimized in the fitting procedure for one dimensional spectrum is defined as :. \[ \chi^2 = \frac{1}{N-M}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{[y_i-f(i,a)]^2}{y_i} \]; where \(i\) is the channel in the fitted spectrum, \(N\) is the number of channels in the fitting subregion, \(M\) is the number of free parameters, \(y_i\) is the content of the i-th channel, \(a\) is a vector of the parameters being fitted and \(f(i,a)\) is a fitting or peak shape function.; Instead

If necessary, the function passed to initialize can be called directly by the user in the main application to reproduce the same effect as before.; Some internal details of the RDataFrame implementation were reworked to decrease memory usage and runtime of programs with very deep computation graphs (more than O(10K) nodes in the same branch). Preliminary tests indicate between 30% and a factor 2.5 in memory decrease. This improvement is transparent for RDataFrame users. Graphics backends; The ROOT release 6.32 brings a lot of impressive enhancements to the Web Graphics package, greatly surpassing the features and capabilities of version 6.30. This update provides users with a more robust Web Graphics. The JSROOT version has been updated to v7.7. 2D Graphics Libraries. TMultiGraph: Add the objects from the list of functions in legend produce by TLegend.; Implement the IsInside method for TEllipse, TCrown and TDiamond. Also, a new graphics example inside.C has been added.; Two new methods in TColor: ListColors() and GetColorByname().; Make sure the option L draws closed polygon for TH2Poly.; Use Tex Gyre fonts for sans serif (similar to Helvetica) .; The new method TPad::ModifiedUpdate is short cut to call Modified() and Update() in a single call. On Mac with Cocoa, it performs an additional ProcessEvents().; Improve SetTextSize error: show code and values.; Very long text string generated a wrong SVG file.; Fix the option SAME works for TGraph2D.; Implement the title for the palette of a TH3.; Fix typo in TLegend::PaintPrimitives() and improve the exclusion graphs legend.; SetParameters(…) or SetParameter(…) on a TF1 reset the properties of the axis tha

The function includes error checking, such as ensuring that the first argument is within the valid range (between fBEGIN and fEND), and handles cases where the number of bytes read is less than required to form the header (e.g., 4 bytes).

These functions include sending character strings, objects, raw buffers, and files to specified lists of slaves. The functions also handle errors by returning specific error codes (-1). This indicates that the system has mechanisms in place to communicate effectively among its components, ensuring that operations are performed as required without delays or failures.

",True,"The provided content appears to be code snippets from a software system. It includes method declarations, parameter types, and function calls related to object-oriented programming concepts such as signals and emissions. These are typical of GUI widget systems where events and signal emission are crucial for user interactions. The presence of methods like voidTQObject::Emit and its various overloads suggests that the system is designed to handle different data types when emitting signals, which is essential for maintaining functionality across multiple platforms or contexts. While this does not directly discuss fault tolerance, error handling, or recovery mechanisms, it's a foundational aspect of systems' reliability. The focus here is on the proper handling and transmission of data, contributing indirectly to availability by ensuring that functions are executed as expected without delays or errors. Therefore, while not explicitly about system readiness or recovery, this content supports overall system functionality, aligning with the idea of availability in terms of consistent and reliable operation.","

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided content appears to be a series of log entries related to test configurations. Each line mentions 'Minimum Test error found - save the configuration', which suggests that during testing, errors were detected and configurations were saved to address them. This indicates an attempt to handle issues (errors) by saving configurations, likely aiming to prevent or minimize failures in future tests. This aligns with the concept of availability as it focuses on ensuring the system can handle errors gracefully and recover from them effectively.","

Availability,"indings. On top, these bindings are compiled against a specific version of Python, making for a distribution headache (just see the non-pickup of Python3 because of this problem). Compare: dictionaries are already available for all the most important classes in experiments, the EDM, because they are generated for I/O needs. They also do not depend on Python, and thus not on any specific version (only PyROOT does). Besides the obvious ease of use, there is also the benefit of lower memory footprints by not replicating structures. (For that matter, PyROOT creates bindings lazily, the others do not.); Other problems we've had, are that boost.python is very, very slow and only in ""keeping alive"" mode since 2004 or so. Pyste is based on gccxml, so no C++11 there, and has seen no major updates since 2005. SWIG is much, much better in both regards, but not up to snuff: it plain and simply can not parse our header files. The way around that, is to write .i files, but as you can imagine, that duplication is not nice for maintenance. Worse, the developers of individual packages need to do this work, and not every C++ developer has Python, let alone SWIG, experience.; Then there's PyPy. All existing binding generator tools (including PyROOT) rely on CPython internals, or at least on the Python C-API. That does not jive with PyPy as it has for example a garbage collector instead of reference counting. Through some heroics, it does expose a Python C-API, but it's slow as it interferes (blocks, really) the just-in-time compiler. Therefore, within PyPy, there are two new approaches: cffi for C and cppyy for C++. Both are part of the standard PyPy releases. There is also already a PyROOT version for the latter (see: http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/pypyroot).; Cheers,; Wim. Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Thu, 07/23/2015 - 21:49 Permalink .

Content: ing HTTP as the transport protocol.; The 'options' argument can contain 'NOPROXY' if you want to bypass the HTTP proxy when retrieving this file's contents. As for any TWebFile-derived object, the URL of the web proxy can be specified by setting an environmental variable 'http_proxy'. If this variable is set, we ask that proxy to route our requests HTTP(S) requests to the file server.; In addition, you can also use the 'options' argument to provide the access key and secret key to be used for authentication purposes for this file by using a string of the form ""AUTH=myAccessKey:mySecretkey"". This may be useful to open several files hosted by different providers in the same program/macro, where the environemntal variables solution is not convenient (see below).; To use AWS temporary security credentials you need to specify the session token. This can be added to the options argument with a string of the form TOKEN=mySessionToken. The temporary access and secret keys must also be available, either via the AUTH option or by environmental variable.; If you need to specify more than one option separate them by ' ' (blank), for instance: ""NOPROXY AUTH=F38XYZABCDeFgH4D0E1F:V+frt4re7J1euSNFnmaf8wwmI4AAAE7kzxZ/TTM+""; Examples: TFile* f1 = TFile::Open(""s3://host.example.com/bucket/path/to/my/file"",; ""NOPROXY AUTH=F38XYZABCDeFgH4D0E1F:V+frt4re7J1euSNFnmaf8wwmI4AAAE7kzxZ/TTM+"");; TFile* f2 = TFile::Open(""s3://host.example.com/bucket/path/to/my/file"",; ""AUTH=F38XYZABCDeFgH4D0E1F:V+frt4re7J1euSNFnmaf8wwmI4AAAE7kzxZ/TTM+"");; TFile* f3 = TFile::Open(""s3://host.example.com/bucket/path/to/my/file"",; ""TOKEN=AQoDYXdzEM///////////wEa8AHEYmCinjD+TsGEjtgKSMAT6wnY"");; If there is no authentication information in the 'options' argument (i.e. not AUTH=""...."") the values of the environmental variables S3_ACCESS_KEY and S3_SECRET_KEY (if set) are expected to contain the access key id and the secret access key, respectively. You have been provided with these credentials by your S3 service provid

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided code snippets are related to system setup and include path management functions, error handling, class information updates, and library dependency resolution. These functionalities contribute to the interpreter's ability to function correctly when required, thus supporting availability by ensuring smooth operations and minimizing downtime.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: ing the setup function). In such; cases we have to update the tagnum in the G__ClassInfo used by; the TClass for class ""item"". void UpdateClassInfoWork(const char* name, Long_t tagnum); This does the actual work of UpdateClassInfo. void UpdateAllCanvases(); Update all canvases at end the terminal input command. const char* GetSharedLibs(); Return the list of shared libraries known to CINT. const char * GetClassSharedLibs(const char* cls); Get the list of shared libraries containing the code for class cls.; The first library in the list is the one containing the class, the; others are the libraries the first one depends on. Returns 0; in case the library is not found. const char * GetSharedLibDeps(const char* lib); Get the list a libraries on which the specified lib depends. The; returned string contains as first element the lib itself.; Returns 0 in case the lib does not exist or does not have; any dependencies. Bool_t IsErrorMessagesEnabled() const; If error messages are disabled, the interpreter should suppress its; failures and warning messages from stdout. Bool_t SetErrorMessages(Bool_t enable = kTRUE); If error messages are disabled, the interpreter should suppress its; failures and warning messages from stdout.

Only one path item can be specified at a; time, i.e. ""path1:path2"" is not supported. const char * GetIncludePath(); Refresh the list of include paths known to the interpreter and return it; with -I prepended. const char * GetSTLIncludePath() const; Return the directory containing CINT's stl cintdlls. int DisplayClass(FILE* fout, char* name, int base, int start) const; Interface to CINT function. int DisplayIncludePath(FILE* fout) const; Interface to CINT function. void * FindSym(const char* entry) const; Interface to CINT function. void GenericError(const char* error) const; Interface to CINT f
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content discusses various functions and APIs related to CINT, such as updating class information, managing shared libraries, include paths, error messages, and displaying classes. These are implementation-level details about how a system operates rather than architectural concerns. There is no mention of architectural patterns, trade-offs, or high-level system structure."
