Availability," should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # duplication rate and deduplication; For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. ## duplication rate evaluation; By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time.

The default value 0 means no limitation. ## low complexity filter; Low complexity filter is disabled by default, and you can enable it by `-y` or `--low_complexity_filter`. The complexity is defined as the percentage of base that is different from its next base (base[i] != base[i+1]). For example:; ```; # a 51-bp sequence, with 3 bases that is different from its next base; seq = 'AAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGCCCC'; complexity = 3/(51-1) = 6%; ```; The threshold for low complexity filter can be specified by `-Y` or `--complexity_threshold`. It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required. ## Other filter; New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since

Safety,"st and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: st and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:; ```; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1; AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2; AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT; >polyA; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA; ```.

Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: G in 3' ends, which is commonly seen in NovaSeq/NextSeq data. Trim polyX in 3' ends to remove unwanted polyX tailing (i.e. polyA tailing for mRNA-Seq data); 7. preprocess unique molecular identifier (UMI) enabled data, shift UMI to sequence name.; 8. report JSON format result for further interpreting.; 9. visualize quality control and filtering results on a single HTML page (like FASTQC but faster and more informative).; 10. split the output to multiple files (0001.R1.gz, 0002.R1.gz...) to support parallel processing. Two modes can be used, limiting the total split file number, or limitting the lines of each split file.; 11. support long reads (data from PacBio / Nanopore devices).; 12. support reading from STDIN and writing to STDOUT; 13. support interleaved input; 14. support ultra-fast FASTQ-level deduplication; 15. ... If you find a bug or have additional requirement for `fastp`, please file an issue:https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/new. # simple usage; * for single end data (not compressed); ```; fastp -i in.fq -o out.fq; ```; * for paired end data (gzip compressed); ```; fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz; ```; By default, the HTML report is saved to `fastp.html` (can be specified with `-h` option), and the JSON report is saved to `fastp.json` (can be specified with `-j` option). # examples of report; `fastp` creates reports in both HTML and JSON format.; * HTML report: http://opengene.org/fastp/fastp.html; * JSON report: http://opengene.org/fastp/fastp.json. # get fastp; ## install with Bioconda; [![install with conda](; https://anaconda.org/bioconda/fastp/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/fastp); ```shell; # note: the fastp version in bioconda may be not the latest; conda install -c bioconda fastp; ```; ## or download the latest prebuilt binary for Linux users; This binary was compiled on CentOS, and tested on CentOS/Ubuntu; ```shell; # download the latest build; wget http://opengene.org/fastp/fastp; 

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided content discusses various preprocessing steps and functionalities of the fastp tool related to data processing for sequencing projects. It includes details about handling different file formats (gzipped or non-compressed), support for paired-end data, generating reports in HTML and JSON formats, installation instructions via Bioconda, and examples of usage commands. These aspects pertain to usability by ensuring that users can efficiently process their data through clear instructions, generate informative reports, and handle different input/output configurations. The information is presented in a structured manner with code snippets and shell commands, which aids users in effectively utilizing the tool. Thus, it aligns well with the usability quality attribute as described.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content describes a tool (fastp) and its usage, including command-line options and examples. It discusses preprocessing steps, data handling, output formats, and installation instructions. While it touches on technical aspects of software development, it does not address high-level architectural concepts, patterns, or trade-offs. Instead, it focuses on specific implementation details and tool usage."
