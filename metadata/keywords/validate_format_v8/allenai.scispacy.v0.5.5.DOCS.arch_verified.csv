By using exome sequencing and extreme phenotype design, it was recently shown that isoforms of dynactin 4 (DCTN4) may influence Pa infection in CF, leading to worse respiratory disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DCTN4 missense variants on Pa infection incidence, age at first Pa infection and chronic Pa infection incidence in a cohort of adult CF patients from a single centre. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to screen DNA samples for DCTN4 variants. A total of 121 adult CF patients from the Cochin Hospital CF centre have been included, all of them carrying two CFTR defects: 103 developed at least 1 pulmonary infection with Pa, and 68 patients of them had CPA. DCTN4 variants were identified in 24% (29/121) CF patients with Pa infection and in only 17% (3/18) CF patients with no Pa infection. Of the patients with CPA, 29% (20/68) had DCTN4 missense variants vs 23% (8/35) in patients without CPA. Interestingly, p.Tyr263Cys tend to be more frequently observed in CF patients with CPA than in patients without CPA (4/68 vs 0/35), and DCTN4 missense variants tend to be more frequent in male CF patients with CPA bearing two class II mutations than in male CF patients without CPA bearing two class II mutations (P = 0.06).

Induction of cytokine expression in leukocytes by binding of thrombin-stimulated platelets.; BACKGROUND: Activated platelets tether and activate myeloid leukocytes.; To investigate the potential relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we examined cytokine induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI.; METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA.; Throughout the study period, CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes (flow cytometry) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients (mean +/- SE of fluorescence [channels] before PTCA: 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9; P = .003).; In vitro, thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes.; Within 2 hours, this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL),1 beta, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in unfractionated leukocytes.; After 4 hours, IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36% and 210 +/- 7%, respectively, and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 +/- 8%.; Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation.; Inhibition of binding by anti-P selectin antibodies reduced the effect of activated platelets on cytokine production.; CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AMI, leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased.; Binding of activated platelets induces IL-1 beta, IL-8, and MCP-1 in leukocytes.; Our findings suggest that leukocyte-platelet adhesion contributes to the regulation of inflammatory responses in AMI.;

In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm. This study lays the foundation for creating a prevascularized port that can be used to reduce fibrous encapsulation and thus enhance diffusion to implanted medical devices and sensors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Apoptosis has been shown to be induced by serum deprivation or copper treatment. To understand the toxicity of nonylphenol diethoxylate, we investigated the effects of NP2 EO on apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and copper by using PC12 cell system. Nonylphenol diethoxylate itself showed no toxicity and recovered cell viability from apoptosis. In addition, nonylphenol diethoxylate decreased DNA fragmentation caused by apoptosis in PC12 cells. This phenomenon was confirmed after treating apoptotic PC12 cells with nonylphenol diethoxylate, whereas the cytochrome c release into the cytosol decreased as compared to that in apoptotic cells not treated with nonylphenol diethoxylate s. Furthermore, Bax contents in apoptotic cells were reduced after exposure to nonylphenol diethoxylate. Thus, nonylphenol diethoxylate has the opposite effect on apoptosis in PC12 cells compared to nonylphenol, which enhances apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The difference in structure of the two compounds is hypothesized to be responsible for this phenomenon. These results indicated that nonylphenol diethoxylate has capability to affect cell differentiation and development and has potentially harmful effect on organisms because of its unexpected impact on apoptosis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ethoxylate inhibits apoptosis induced in PC12 cells; 25847295|a|Nonylphenol and short-chain nonylphenol ethoxylates such as NP2 EO are present in aquatic environment as wastewater contaminants, and their toxic effects on aquatic species have been reported. Apoptosis has been shown to be induced by serum deprivation or copper treatment. To understand the toxicity of nonylphenol diethoxylate, we investigated the effects of NP2 EO on apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and copper by using PC12 cell system. Nonylphenol diethoxylate itself showed no toxicity and recovered cell viability from apoptosis. In addition, nonylphenol diethoxylate decreased DNA fragmentation caused by apoptosis in PC12 cells. This phenomenon was confirmed after treating apoptotic PC12 cells with nonylphenol diethoxylate, whereas the cytochrome c release into the cytosol decreased as compared to that in apoptotic cells not treated with nonylphenol diethoxylate s. Furthermore, Bax contents in apoptotic cells were reduced after exposure to nonylphenol diethoxylate. Thus, nonylphenol diethoxylate has the opposite effect on apoptosis in PC12 cells compared to nonylphenol, which enhances apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The difference in structure of the two compounds is hypothesized to be responsible for this phenomenon. These results indicated that nonylphenol diethoxylate has capability to affect cell differentiation and development and has potentially harmful effect on organisms because of its unexpected impact on apoptosis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Energy Efficiency,"psulation. In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm. This study lays the foundation for creating a prevascularized port that can be used to reduce fibrous encapsulation and thus enhance diffusion to implanted medical devices and sensors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``. This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory.

psulation. In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm. This study lays the foundation for creating a prevascularized port that can be used to reduce fibrous encapsulation and thus enhance diffusion to implanted medical devices and sensors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Testability,"; ### Creating a release. Scispacy has two components:. - The scispacy pip package; - The scispacy models. The scispacy pip package is published automatically using the `.github/actions/publish.yml` github action. It happens whenever a release is published (with an associated tag) in the github releases UI. In order to create a new release, the following should happen:. #### Updating `scispacy/version.py`; Update the version in version.py. #### Training new models. The entire pipeline can be run using `spacy project run all`. This will train and package all the models. The packages should then be uploaded to the `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/{VERSION}` S3 bucket, and references to previous models (e.g in the readme and in the docs) should be updated. You can find all these places using `git grep <previous version>`. The scripts `install_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, `print_out_metrics.py`, `smoke_test.py`, and `uninstall_local_packages.py` are useful for testing at each step of the process. Before uploading, `install_local_packages.py` and `smoke_test.py` can be used to make sure the packages are installable and do a quick check of output. `print_out_metrics.py` can then be used to easily get the metrics that need to be updated in the README. Once the packages have been uploaded, `uninstall_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, and `smoke_test.py` can be used to ensure everything was uploaded correctly. #### Merge a PR with the above changes; Merge a PR with the above changes, and publish a release with a tag corresponding to the commit from the merged PR.

; ### Creating a release. Scispacy has two components:. - The scispacy pip package; - The scispacy models. The scispacy pip package is published automatically using the `.github/actions/publish.yml` github action. It happens whenever a release is published (with an associated tag) in the github releases UI. In order to create a new release, the following should happen:. #### Updating `scispacy/version.py`; Update the version in version.py. #### Training new models. The entire pipeline can be run using `spacy project run all`. This will train and package all the models. The packages should then be uploaded to the `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/{VERSION}` S3 bucket, and references to previous models (e.g in the readme and in the docs) should be updated. You can find all these places using `git grep <previous version>`. The scripts `install_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, `print_out_metrics.py`, `smoke_test.py`, and `uninstall_local_packages.py` are useful for testing at each step of the process. Before uploading, `install_local_packages.py` and `smoke_test.py` can be used to make sure the packages are installable and do a quick check of output. `print_out_metrics.py` can then be used to easily get the metrics that need to be updated in the README. Once the packages have been uploaded, `uninstall_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, and `smoke_test.py` can be used to ensure everything was uploaded correctly. #### Merge a PR with the above changes; Merge a PR with the above changes, and publish a release with a tag corresponding to the commit from the merged PR. This should trigger the publish github action, which will create the `scispacy` package and publish it to pypi.
