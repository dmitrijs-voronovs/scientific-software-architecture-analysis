Previous Versions; SU2 is hosted on GitHub, and previous versions are tagged and available on the releases page. Tutorials; As part of our documentation and training, we ship a set of tutorials that walk the user through setting up and executing a number of examples. These cases start from the basics and help the user learn SU2 quickly. Later tutorials cover advanced SU2 capabilities, such as optimal shape design. You can get the most recent config and mesh files using the following links:. Web Tutorials (.zip). Web Tutorials (.tar.gz). Or you can directly clone the repository:; $ git clone https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials. Test Case Suite; SU2 comes with an extensive collection of common test cases. The test cases contain meshes and configuration files that can be run to ensure different components of the suite are working properly. Test cases (configuration and mesh files) are included in a separate repository, also available on GitHub that can be accessed using:; $ git clone https://github.com/su2code/TestCases.git. The latest release of the test cases will also be tagged and available on the GitHub releases page, and for convenience, you can download the this source code from the latest release directly with the button below:. Test Cases (.zip). Test Cases (.tar.gz). Note that, while many of the cases are used for regression testing, this test case suite is provided without any guarantees on performance or expected results. Keep in mind that small changes to the configuration options can often result in large changes to the output. We encourage the community to experiment with these test cases, or even try (and share!) other interesting validation cases with SU2!; Please see the documentation on how to use the test cases.
