When talking to either GCP or Azure, hail chooses credentials in the following order from highest priority to lowest priority:. 1. An explicit `credential_file` argument passed to the relevant credentials class; 2. An environment variable containing the path to the credentials (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or `AZURE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) (from this you can see why the code that was here is totally redundant); 3. The latent credentials present on the machine. This might be `gcloud` or `az` credentials, or the metadata server if you're on a cloud VM. I'm trying to rid the codebase of most explicit providing of credentials file paths, for two reasons:; - Quality of life. I'm already signed into the cloud with `gcloud` and `az`. I shouldn't need to download some file and provide `AZURE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to run this test. It should just use the latent credentials.; - We are trying to phase out credentials files altogether for security reasons. These files are long-lived secrets that you really don't want to leak and are currently exposed to users in Batch jobs, so they can be easily exfiltrated.

Instead, all typechecking logic is moved to the `TypeCheck` pass. Some benefits of this change:; * The parser is simpler, as it doesn't have to maintain a typing environment.; * Binds.scala is now the single source of truth on the binding structure of the IR.; * Instead of typechecking being split in an ad-hoc way between IR constructors and the `TypeCheck` pass, all typechecking and type error reporting logic is in one place.; * The parser parses a context-free grammar, no more and no less.

For example:; - `HasSharing` can use the field to see if it has visited a node before.; - `Requiredness` uses this field to tell if a node is currently enqueued. The `nextFlag` method in `IrMetadata` allows for analyses to get a fresh value they can set the `mark` field. ; This removes the need to traverse the IR after analyses to re-zero every `mark` field.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13991

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14004:339,Usability,simpl,simple,339,"### What happened?. Hello,; I have some gwas results that I have converted into a pandas dataframe. Typically with dataframes I pickle my outputs for speed and easily maintaining data types. Within All of Us we have separate analysis environments whether we're using hail or not. The environment that doesn't have hail is much cheaper for simple analyses and does not have pyspark installed. You can see in the error below when I try to reread the pickled dataframe, I get an error that it can't find the pyspark from within a hail module. If I write the dataframe as a csv, read it back in, and then pickle it then the error goes away. This suggests to me that the dataframe created by hail maintains reference to hail objects and pandas is attempting to recreate these objects when unpickling. I suspect this is not intentional. ```python; # Hail environment; vat_simplified_file = os.path.join(bucket, 'vat.ht'); gwas = hl.read_table(gwas_results_file_no_sex_chr); vat = hl.read_table(vat_simplified_file); gwas = gwas.filter(gwas.p_value <= 1e-4); combined = gwas.join(vat, how='left'); combined_pandas = combined.to_pandas(). gwas_pandas_file = os.path.join(bucket, 'gwas_results.pkl'); combined_pandas.to_pickle(gwas_pandas_file); ```. ```python; # Non hail environment without pyspark; combined_pandas = pd.read_pickle(gwas_pandas_file). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------; ModuleNotFoundError Traceback (most recent call last); /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/io/pickle.py in read_pickle(filepath_or_buffer, compression, storage_options); 216 # expected ""IO[bytes]""; --> 217 return pickle.load(handles.handle) # type: ignore[arg-type]; 218 except excs_to_catch:. /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/hail/__init__.py in <module>; 32 # E402 module level import not at top of file; ---> 33 from .table import Table, GroupedTable, asc, desc # noqa: E402; 34 from .matrixtable import MatrixTable, GroupedMatrixTable # noqa: E402. /opt/conda",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14004

M1 chips will try to simulate a very basic x86_64 ISA using Rosetta 2 but our x86_64 dylibs expect the ISA of at least sandybridge, which includes some SIMD instructions not supported by Rosetta 2. This PR bifurcates our native build into x86_64 and arm64 targets which live in build/x86_64 and build/arm64, respectively. In Linux, this moves where the object files live, but should otherwise have no effect. The test and benchmark targets use the ""native"" build which always points at the x86_64 object files. The shared object targets, LIBBOOT & LIBHAIL, explicitly depend on x86_64 because that is the only linux architecture we support. In OS X, we only test and benchmark the ""native"" build, which is detected using `uname -m`. For the shared objects (the dylibs) we have four new files: libboot and libbhail for x86_64 and for arm64. Each pair files is placed in `darwin/x86_64/` and `darwin/arm64/`, respectively. Those dylibs are never meant to escape the src/main/c world.

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14033:716,Testability,log,log,716,"### What happened?. Our Zstd buffer size is currently 64KiB. Zstd supports window sizes of at least 512 MiB. In Meta's data warehouse [1] they commonly use 256KiB block sizes. I made a quick and dirty experiment compressing blocks of 512KiB and saw at 12% reduction in the size of a VDS from 1.6GiB to 1.4GiB. If this result generalizes, that's a non-trivial savings in storage costs. For particularly large matrix tables (say, larger than 10,000 samples), I suspect an even larger block size would be reasonable because a single row is probably larger than 512KiB.

It is now set to an appropriate level. This issue manifests in a variety of inscrutable ways including RemoteDisconnectedError and socket closed. See issue #13960 for details. In Dataproc versions 1.5.74, 2.0.48, and 2.1.0, Dataproc introduced [""memory protection""](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/support/troubleshoot-oom-errors#memory_protection) which is a euphemism for a newly aggressive OOMKiller. When the OOMKiller kills the JVM driver process, there is no hs_err_pid...log file, no exceptional log statements, and no clean shutdown of any sockets. The process is simply SIGTERM'ed and then SIGKILL'ed. From Hail 0.2.83 through Hail 0.2.109 (released February 2023), Hail was pinned to Dataproc 2.0.44. From Hail 0.2.15 onwards, `hailctl dataproc`, by default, reserves 80% of the advertised memory of the driver node for the use of the Hail Query Driver JVM process. For example, Google advertises that an n1-highmem-8 has 52 GiB of RAM, so Hail sets the `spark:spark.driver.memory` property to 41g (we always round down). Before aggressive memory protection, this setting was sufficient to protect the driver from starving itself of memory. Unfortunately, Hail 0.2.110 upgraded to Dataproc 2.1.2 which enabled ""memory protection"". Moreover, in the years since Hail 0.2.15, the memory in use by system processes on Dataproc driver nodes appears to have increased. Due to these two circumstances, the driver VM's memory usage can grow high enough to trigger the OOMKiller before the JVM triggers a GC. Consider, for example, these slices of the syslog of the n1-highmem-8 driver VM of a Dataproc cluster:. ```; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: earlyoom v1.6.2; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: mem total: 52223 MiB, swap total: 0 MiB; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: sending SIGTERM when mem <= 0.12% and ",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14066

In this PR, I did the following:; 1. Installed samtools into the Docker image to get rid of errors in the log output; 2. Added the `--merged` flag so that VEP will use the directory `homo_sapiens_merged` for the cache. Outstanding Issues:; 1. The FASTA files that are in `homo_sapiens/` were not present in the merged dataset. Do we keep both the `homo_sapiens` and `homo_sapiens_merged/` directories in our bucket or do we transfer the FASTA files to the merged directory?; 2. Once we decide the answer to (1), then I can fix this in dataproc. The easiest thing to do is to add the tar file with the `_merged` data to the dataproc vep folders and use the `--merged` flag.

If there's no channel, open a new channel with the current position.; 2. Read *some* data from the input ByteChannel into an intermediate ByteBuffer.; 3. While attempting to read more data into a subsequent intermediate ByteBuffer, an retryable exception occurs.; 4. The exception bubbles to google-cloud-storage's error handling, which frees the channel and loops back to (1). The key bug is that the intermediate buffers have data but the `position` hasn't been updated. When we recreate the channel we will jump to the wrong position and re-read some data. Lucky for us, between Zstd and our assertions, this usually crashes the program instead of silently returning bad data. This is the third bug we have found in Google's cloud storage java library. The previous two:. 1. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13721; 2. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13937. Be forewarned: the next time we see bizarre networking or data corruption issues, check if updating google-cloud-storage fixes the problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14080

Suppose there are 10,000 partitions, but we only need to compute 1, 100, and 1543. 0.2.126 would try to submit a batch of size 3 but whose job indices are 1, 100, and 1543. 2. Likewise, the Query-on-Spark path returns an invalid `SparkTaskContext.partitionId` which, at best, produces confusing partition filenames. I only fixed the former because it was simple to fix. I wasn't exactly sure what to do about the latter. We should fix that separately because the changes in this PR need to urgently land in the next release to avoid unexpected cost when one partition fails.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14085

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14102:257,Availability,error,error,257,"### What happened?. Dear developers,. During the process of reading a large set of VCF files from an exome sequencing study into Hail (version 0.2.126-ee77707f4fab run on Terra container terra-jupyter-hail:1.1.8 using Spark 3.3.0), I ran into an unexpected error. Using a script I have been using for years for sequence datasets, I now run into an error during parsing of certain lines from the VCF file. Specifically, the Hail outputs the error ""cannot set missing field for required type +PFloat64"". I was concerned that there may have been issues in the actual VCF file, and therefore I tested the script on older datasets that I managed to process without any problem previously; the error was recapitulated on all these old datasets. Therefore I do not think there is an intrinsic issue in the VCFs, but rather in the way the current version of Hail (inside the terra container) is parsing information from the lines. I was not capable of running older versions of the Terra container (1.0.x) because the versions of Hail implemented there are not compatible with the current version of Spark on Terra. . I hope you may have a solution to this irritating problem. I have added the scripts and logs below. .

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14102:590,Testability,test,tested,590,"### What happened?. Dear developers,. During the process of reading a large set of VCF files from an exome sequencing study into Hail (version 0.2.126-ee77707f4fab run on Terra container terra-jupyter-hail:1.1.8 using Spark 3.3.0), I ran into an unexpected error. Using a script I have been using for years for sequence datasets, I now run into an error during parsing of certain lines from the VCF file. Specifically, the Hail outputs the error ""cannot set missing field for required type +PFloat64"". I was concerned that there may have been issues in the actual VCF file, and therefore I tested the script on older datasets that I managed to process without any problem previously; the error was recapitulated on all these old datasets. Therefore I do not think there is an intrinsic issue in the VCFs, but rather in the way the current version of Hail (inside the terra container) is parsing information from the lines. I was not capable of running older versions of the Terra container (1.0.x) because the versions of Hail implemented there are not compatible with the current version of Spark on Terra. . I hope you may have a solution to this irritating problem. I have added the scripts and logs below. . Thanks in advance,; Sean Jurgens. ### Version. 0.2.126-ee77707f4fab. ### Relevant log output. ```shell; ## PLEASE NOTE: to protect privacy as much as possible, I have removed almost all entries shown by the code, and for the few line entries that remain I have changed/randomized the numeric values.
