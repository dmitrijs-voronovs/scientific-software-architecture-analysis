Usability,simpl,simple,"ifying Internal QuTiP Settings. Modifying Internal QuTiP Settings¶. User Accessible Parameters¶; In this section we show how to modify a few of the internal parameters used by QuTiP. The settings that can be modified are given in the following table:. Setting; Description; Options. auto_herm; Automatically calculate the hermicity of; quantum objects.; True / False. auto_tidyup; Automatically tidyup quantum objects.; True / False. auto_tidyup_atol; Tolerance used by tidyup; any float value > 0. atol; General tolerance; any float value > 0. num_cpus; Number of CPU’s used for multiprocessing.; int between 1 and # cpu’s. debug; Show debug printouts.; True / False. openmp_thresh; NNZ matrix must have for OPENMP.; Int. Example: Changing Settings¶; The two most important settings are auto_tidyup and auto_tidyup_atol as they control whether the small elements of a quantum object should be removed, and what number should be considered as the cut-off tolerance. Modifying these, or any other parameters, is quite simple:; >>> qutip.settings.auto_tidyup = False. These settings will be used for the current QuTiP session only and will need to be modified again when restarting QuTiP. If running QuTiP from a script file, then place the qutip.setings.xxxx commands immediately after from qutip import * at the top of the script file. If you want to reset the parameters back to their default values then call the reset command:; >>> qutip.settings.reset(). Persistent Settings¶; When QuTiP is imported, it looks for a file named qutiprc in a folder called .qutip user’s home directory. If this file is found, it will be loaded and overwrite the QuTiP default settings, which allows for persistent changes in the QuTiP settings to be made. A sample qutiprc file is show below. The syntax is a simple key-value format, where the keys and possible values are described in the table above:; [qutip]; auto_tidyup=True; auto_herm=True; auto_tidyup_atol=1e-12; num_cpus=4; debug=False.

As an example, notice that the snippet above already calculates; the Choi matrix of the transpose map by acting it on half of an entangled; pair. We simply need to manually set the dims and superrep attributes to reflect the; structure of the underlying Hilbert space and the chosen representation.; In [139]: J = rho_out. In [140]: J.dims = [[[2], [2]], [[2], [2]]]; .....: J.superrep = 'choi'; .....: . In [142]: print(J.iscp); False. This confirms that the transpose map is not completely positive. On the other hand,; the transpose map does satisfy a weaker condition, namely that it is hermicity preserving.; That is, \(\Lambda(\rho) = (\Lambda(\rho))^\dagger\) for all \(\rho\) such that; \(\rho = \rho^\dagger\). To see this, we note that \((\rho^{\mathrm{T}})^\dagger; = \rho^*\), the complex conjugate of \(\rho\). By assumption, \(\rho = \rho^\dagger; = (\rho^*)^{\mathrm{T}}\), though, such that \(\Lambda(\rho) = \Lambda(\rho^\dagger) = \rho^*\).; We can confirm this by checking the ishp attribute:; In [143]: print(J.ishp); True. Next, we note that the transpose map does preserve the trace of its inputs, such that; \(\operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda[\rho]) = \operatorname{Tr}(\rho)\) for all \(\rho\).; This can be confirmed by the istp attribute:; In [144]: print(J.ishp); True. Finally, a map is called a quantum channel if it always maps valid states to valid; states. Formally, a map is a channel if it is both completely positive and trace preserving.; Thus, QuTiP provides a single attribute to quickly check that this is true.; In [145]: print(J.iscptp); False.

Instead of using the dagger Qobj.dag() method to raise the state, we could have also used the built in qutip.operators.create function to make a raising operator:; In [7]: c = create(5). In [8]: c * vac; Out[8]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 1.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. which does the same thing. We can raise the vacuum state more than once by successively apply the raising operator:; In [9]: c * c * vac; Out[9]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0. ]; [ 0. ]; [ 1.41421356]; [ 0. ]; [ 0. ]]. or just taking the square of the raising operator \(\left(\hat{a}^\dagger\right)^{2}\):; In [10]: c ** 2 * vac; Out[10]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0. ]; [ 0. ]; [ 1.41421356]; [ 0. ]; [ 0. ]]. Applying the raising operator twice gives the expected \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) dependence. We can use the product of \(c * a\) to also apply the number operator to the state vector vac:; In [11]: c * a * vac; Out[11]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. or on the \(\left| 1\right>\) state:; In [12]: c * a * (c * vac); Out[12]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 1.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. or the \(\left| 2\right>\) state:; In [13]: c * a * (c**2 * vac); Out[13]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0. ]; [ 0. ]; [ 2.82842712]; [ 0. ]; [ 0. ]]. Notice how in this last example, application of the number operator does not give the expected value \(n=2\), but rather \(2\sqrt{2}\). This is because this last state is not normalized to unity as \(c\left| n\right> = \sqrt{n+1}\left| n+1\right>\).

The downside is that these methods can take much longer than the direct method as the condition number of the Liouvillian matrix is large, indicating that these iterative methods require a large number of iterations for convergence. To overcome this, one can use a preconditioner \(M\) that solves for an approximate inverse for the (modified) Liouvillian, thus better conditioning the problem, leading to faster convergence. The use of a preconditioner can actually make these iterative methods faster than the other solution methods. The problem with precondioning is that it is only well defined for Hermitian matrices. Since the Liouvillian is non-Hermitian, the ability to find a good preconditioner is not guaranteed. And moreover, if a preconditioner is found, it is not guaranteed to have a good condition number. QuTiP can make use of an incomplete LU preconditioner when using the iterative 'gmres', 'lgmres', and 'bicgstab' solvers by setting use_precond=True.

For many these systems, solving for the asymptotic density matrix \(\hat{\rho}_{ss}\) can be achieved using direct or iterative solution methods faster than using master equation or Monte Carlo simulations. Although the steady state equation has a simple mathematical form, the properties of the Liouvillian operator are such that the solutions to this equation are anything but straightforward to find. Steady State solvers in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, the steady-state solution for a system Hamiltonian or Liouvillian is given by qutip.steadystate.steadystate. This function implements a number of different methods for finding the steady state, each with their own pros and cons, where the method used can be chosen using the method keyword argument. Method; Keyword; Description. Direct (default); ‘direct’; Direct solution solving \(Ax=b\) via sparse LU decomposition. Eigenvalue; ‘eigen’; Iteratively find the zero eigenvalue of \(\mathcal{L}\). Inverse-Power; ‘power’; Solve using the inverse-power method. GMRES; ‘iterative-gmres’; Solve using the GMRES method and optional preconditioner. LGMRES; ‘iterative-lgmres’; Solve using the LGMRES method and optional preconditioner. BICGSTAB; ‘iterative-bicgstab’; Solve using the BICGSTAB method and optional preconditioner. SVD; ‘svd’; Steady-state solution via the dense SVD of the Liouvillian. The function qutip.steadystate.steadystate can take either a Hamiltonian and a list of collapse operators as input, generating internally the corresponding Liouvillian super operator in Lindblad form, or alternatively, a Liouvillian passed by the user. When possible, we recommend passing the Hamiltonian and collapse operators to qutip.steadystate.steadystate, and letting the function automatically build the Liouvillian (in Lindblad form) for the system.; As of QuTiP 3.2, the direct and power methods can take advantage of the Intel Pardiso LU solver in the Intel Math Kernel library that comes with the Anacoda (2.5+) and Intel",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/guide-steady.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/guide-steady.html

The output, labeled as rho_ss, is the steady-state solution for the systems. If no other keywords are passed to the solver, the default ‘direct’ method is used, generating a solution that is exact to machine precision at the expense of a large memory requirement. The large amount of memory need for the direct LU decomposition method stems from the large bandwidth of the system Liouvillian and the correspondingly large fill-in (extra nonzero elements) generated in the LU factors. This fill-in can be reduced by using bandwidth minimization algorithms such as those discussed in Additional Solver Arguments. However, in most cases, the default fill-in reducing algorithm is nearly optimal. Additional parameters may be used by calling the steady-state solver as:; rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops, method='power', use_rcm=True). where method='power' indicates that we are using the inverse-power solution method, and use_rcm=True turns on a bandwidth minimization routine.; Although it is not obvious, the 'direct', eigen, and 'power' methods all use an LU decomposition internally and thus suffer from a large memory overhead.

The function qutip.steadystate.steadystate can take either a Hamiltonian and a list of collapse operators as input, generating internally the corresponding Liouvillian super operator in Lindblad form, or alternatively, a Liouvillian passed by the user. When possible, we recommend passing the Hamiltonian and collapse operators to qutip.steadystate.steadystate, and letting the function automatically build the Liouvillian (in Lindblad form) for the system.; As of QuTiP 3.2, the direct and power methods can take advantage of the Intel Pardiso LU solver in the Intel Math Kernel library that comes with the Anacoda (2.5+) and Intel Python distributions. This gives a substantial increase in performance compared with the standard SuperLU method used by SciPy. To verify that QuTiP can find the necessary libraries, one can check for INTEL MKL Ext: True in the QuTiP about box (qutip.about). Using the Steadystate Solver¶; Solving for the steady state solution to the Lindblad master equation for a general system with qutip.steadystate.steadystate can be accomplished using:; >>> rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops). where H is a quantum object representing the system Hamiltonian, and c_ops is a list of quantum objects for the system collapse operators. The output, labeled as rho_ss, is the steady-state solution for the systems. If no other keywords are passed to the solver, the default ‘direct’ method is used, generating a solution that is exact to machine precision at the expense of a large memory requirement.

Solving for Steady-State Solutions¶. Important; Updated in QuTiP 3.2. Introduction¶; For time-independent open quantum systems with decay rates larger than the corresponding excitation rates, the system will tend toward a steady state as \(t\rightarrow\infty\) that satisfies the equation. \[\frac{d\hat{\rho}_{ss}}{dt}=\mathcal{L}\hat{\rho}_{ss}=0.\]; Although the requirement for time-independence seems quite resitrictive, one can often employ a transformation to the interaction picture that yields a time-independent Hamiltonian. For many these systems, solving for the asymptotic density matrix \(\hat{\rho}_{ss}\) can be achieved using direct or iterative solution methods faster than using master equation or Monte Carlo simulations. Although the steady state equation has a simple mathematical form, the properties of the Liouvillian operator are such that the solutions to this equation are anything but straightforward to find. Steady State solvers in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, the steady-state solution for a system Hamiltonian or Liouvillian is given by qutip.steadystate.steadystate. This function implements a number of different methods for finding the steady state, each with their own pros and cons, where the method used can be chosen using the method keyword argument.

Quantum process tomography¶; Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a useful technique for characterizing experimental implementations of quantum gates involving a small number of qubits. It can also be a useful theoretical tool that can give insight in how a process transforms states, and it can be used for example to study how noise or other imperfections deteriorate a gate. Whereas a fidelity or distance measure can give a single number that indicates how far from ideal a gate is, a quantum process tomography analysis can give detailed information about exactly what kind of errors various imperfections introduce.; The idea is to construct a transformation matrix for a quantum process (for example a quantum gate) that describes how the density matrix of a system is transformed by the process. We can then decompose the transformation in some operator basis that represent well-defined and easily interpreted transformations of the input states.; To see how this works (see e.g. [Moh08] for more details), consider a process that is described by quantum map \(\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out}\), which can be written. (1)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix).

(1)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix). Given an orthogonal operator basis of our choice \(\{B_i\}_i^{N^2}\), which satisfies \({\rm Tr}[B_i^\dagger B_j] = N\delta_{ij}\), we can write the map as. (2)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger.\]; where \(\chi_{mn} = \sum_{ij} b_{im}b_{jn}^*\) and \(A_i = \sum_{m} b_{im}B_{m}\). Here, matrix \(\chi\) is the transformation matrix we are after, since it describes how much \(B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger\) contributes to \(\rho_{\rm out}\).; In a numerical simulation of a quantum process we usually do not have access to the quantum map in the form Eq. (1). Instead, what we usually can do is to calculate the propagator \(U\) for the density matrix in superoperator form, using for example the QuTiP function qutip.propagator.propagator. We can then write. \[\epsilon(\tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}) = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = \tilde{\rho}_{\rm out}\]; where \(\tilde{\rho}\) is the vector representation of the density matrix \(\rho\). If we write Eq. (2) in superoperator form as well we obtain. \[\tilde{\rho}_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}.\]; so we can identify. \[U = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger.\]; Now this is a linear equation systems for the \(N^2 \times N^2\) elements in \(\chi\). We can solve it by writing \(\chi\) and the superoperator propagator as \([N^4]\) vectors, and likewise write the superoperator product \(\tilde{B}_m\tilde{B}_n^\dagger\) as a \([N^4\times N^4]\) matrix \(",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/guide-visualization.html

It starts from a combined system-environment perspective, and derives a perturbative master equation for the system alone, under the assumption of weak system-environment coupling. One advantage of this approach is that the dissipation processes and rates are obtained directly from the properties of the environment. On the downside, it does not intrinsically guarantee that the resulting master equation unconditionally preserves the physical properties of the density matrix (because it is a perturbative method). The Bloch-Redfield master equation must therefore be used with care, and the assumptions made in the derivation must be honored. (The Lindblad master equation is in a sense more robust – it always results in a physical density matrix – although some collapse operators might not be physically justified). For a full derivation of the Bloch Redfield master equation, see e.g. [Coh92] or [Bre02]. Here we present only a brief version of the derivation, with the intention of introducing the notation and how it relates to the implementation in QuTiP. Brief Derivation and Definitions¶; The starting point of the Bloch-Redfield formalism is the total Hamiltonian for the system and the environment (bath): \(H = H_{\rm S} + H_{\rm B} + H_{\rm I}\), where \(H\) is the total system+bath Hamiltonian, \(H_{\rm S}\) and \(H_{\rm B}\) are the system and bath Hamiltonians, respectively, and \(H_{\rm I}\) is",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html
Deployability,integrat,integration,"ho_B\). This assumption is known as the Born approximation, and it implies that there never is any entanglement between the system and the bath, neither in the initial state nor at any time during the evolution. It is justified for weak system-bath interaction.; The master equation (1) is non-Markovian, i.e., the change in the density matrix at a time \(t\) depends on states at all times \(\tau < t\), making it intractable to solve both theoretically and numerically. To make progress towards a manageable master equation, we now introduce the Markovian approximation, in which \(\rho(s)\) is replaced by \(\rho(t)\) in Eq. (1). The result is the Redfield equation. (2)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^t d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]],\]; which is local in time with respect the density matrix, but still not Markovian since it contains an implicit dependence on the initial state. By extending the integration to infinity and substituting \(\tau \rightarrow t-\tau\), a fully Markovian master equation is obtained:. (3)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^\infty d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(t-\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]].\]; The two Markovian approximations introduced above are valid if the time-scale with which the system dynamics changes is large compared to the time-scale with which correlations in the bath decays (corresponding to a “short-memory” bath, which results in Markovian system dynamics).; The master equation (3) is still on a too general form to be suitable for numerical implementation. We therefore assume that the system-bath interaction takes the form \(H_I = \sum_\alpha A_\alpha \otimes B_\alpha\) and where \(A_\alpha\) are system operators and \(B_\alpha\) are bath operators. This allows us to write master equation in terms of system operators and bath correlation functions:. \[\begin{split}\frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) =; -\hbar^{-2}; \sum_{\alpha\beta}; \int_0^\infty d\tau\;; \left\{; g_{\alpha\beta}(\",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html

Note; New in QuTiP 4.2. Warning; It takes ~3-5 seconds (~30 if using Visual Studio) to compile a time-dependent Bloch-Redfield problem. Therefore,; if you are doing repeated simulations by varying parameters, then it is best to pass; options = Options(rhs_reuse=True) to the solver. If you have not done so already, please read the section: Solving Problems with Time-dependent Hamiltonians.; As we have already discussed, the Bloch-Redfield master equation requires transforming into the eigenbasis of the system Hamiltonian. For time-independent systems, this transformation need only be done once. However, for time-dependent systems, one must move to the instantaneous eigenbasis at each time-step in the evolution, thus greatly increasing the computational complexity of the dynamics. In addition, the requirement for computing all the eigenvalues severely limits the scalability of the method. Fortunately, this eigen decomposition occurs at the Hamiltonian level, as opposed to the super-operator level, and thus, with efficient programming, one can tackle many systems that are commonly encountered.; The time-dependent Bloch-Redfield solver in QuTiP relies on the efficient numerical computations afforded by the string-based time-dependent format, and Cython compilation. As such, all the time-dependent terms, and noise power spectra must be expressed in the string format. To begin, lets consider the previous example, but formatted to call the time-dependent solver:; In [18]: ohmic = ""{gamma1} / 2.0 * (w / (2 * pi)) * (w > 0.0)"".format(gamma1=gamma1).

Although the problem itself is time-independent, the use of a string as the noise power spectrum tells the solver to go into time-dependent mode. The string is nearly identical to the Python function format, except that we replaced np.pi with pi to avoid calling Python in our Cython code, and we have hard coded the gamma1 argument into the string as limitations prevent passing arguments into the time-dependent Bloch-Redfield solver.; For actual time-dependent Hamiltonians, the Hamiltonian itself can be passed into the solver like any other string-based Hamiltonian, as thus we will not discuss this topic further. Instead, here the focus is on time-dependent bath coupling terms. To this end, suppose that we have a dissipative harmonic oscillator, where the white-noise dissipation rate decreases exponentially with time \(\kappa(t) = \kappa(0)\exp(-t)\). In the Lindblad or monte-carlo solvers, this could be implemented as a time-dependent collapse operator list c_ops = [[a, 'sqrt(kappa*exp(-t))']]. In the Bloch-Redfield solver, the bath coupling terms must be Hermitian. As such, in this example, our coupling operator is the position operator a+a.dag(). In addition, we do not need the sqrt operation that occurs in the c_ops definition.

Introduction¶; The Lindblad master equation introduced earlier is constructed so that it describes a physical evolution of the density matrix (i.e., trace and positivity preserving), but it does not provide a connection to any underlaying microscopic physical model. The Lindblad operators (collapse operators) describe phenomenological processes, such as for example dephasing and spin flips, and the rates of these processes are arbitrary parameters in the model. In many situations the collapse operators and their corresponding rates have clear physical interpretation, such as dephasing and relaxation rates, and in those cases the Lindblad master equation is usually the method of choice.; However, in some cases, for example systems with varying energy biases and eigenstates and that couple to an environment in some well-defined manner (through a physically motivated system-environment interaction operator), it is often desirable to derive the master equation from more fundamental physical principles, and relate it to for example the noise-power spectrum of the environment.; The Bloch-Redfield formalism is one such approach to derive a master equation from a microscopic system. It starts from a combined system-environment perspective, and derives a perturbative master equation for the system alone, under the assumption of weak system-environment coupling. One advantage of this approach is that the dissipation processes and rates are obtained directly from the properties of the environment. On the downside, it does not intrinsically guarantee that the result",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html

State vectors, or density matrices, as well as col_times and col_which, are accessed in a similar manner, although typically one does not need an index (i.e [0]) since there is only one list for each of these components. The one exception to this rule is if you choose to output state vectors from the Monte Carlo solver, in which case there are ntraj number of state vector arrays. Saving and Loading Result Objects¶; The main advantage in using the Result class as a data storage object comes from the simplicity in which simulation data can be stored and later retrieved. The qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload functions are designed for this task. To begin, let us save the data object from the previous section into a file called “cavity+qubit-data” in the current working directory by calling:; >>> qsave(result, 'cavity+qubit-data'). All of the data results are then stored in a single file of the same name with a ”.qu” extension. Therefore, everything needed to later this data is stored in a single file. Loading the file is just as easy as saving:; >>> stored_result = qload('cavity+qubit-data'); Loaded Result object:; Result object with mcsolve data.; ---------------------------------; expect = True; num_expect = 2, num_collapse = 2, ntraj = 500. where stored_result is the new name of the Result object. We can then extract the data and plot in the same manner as before:; expt0 = stored_result.expect[0]; expt1 = stored_result.expect[1]; times = stored_result.times; plot(times, expt0, times, expt1); show().

Modifiability,coupling,coupling,"pendent due to the driving. In such cases a rigorious approach would be to take the driving into account when deriving the master equation. This can be done in many different ways, but one way common approach is to derive the master equation in the Floquet basis. That approach results in the so-called Floquet-Markov master equation, see Grifoni et al., Physics Reports 304, 299 (1998) for details. The Floquet-Markov master equation in QuTiP¶; The QuTiP function qutip.floquet.fmmesolve implements the Floquet-Markov master equation. It calculates the dynamics of a system given its initial state, a time-dependent hamiltonian, a list of operators through which the system couples to its environment and a list of corresponding spectral-density functions that describes the environment. In contrast to the qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, and the qutip.floquet.fmmesolve does characterize the environment with dissipation rates, but extract the strength of the coupling to the environment from the noise spectral-density functions and the instantaneous Hamiltonian parameters (similar to the Bloch-Redfield master equation solver qutip.bloch_redfield.brmesolve). Note; Currently the qutip.floquet.fmmesolve can only accept a single environment coupling operator and spectral-density function. The noise spectral-density function of the environment is implemented as a Python callback function that is passed to the solver. For example:; >>> gamma1 = 0.1; >>> def noise_spectrum(omega):; >>> return 0.5 * gamma1 * omega/(2*pi). The other parameters are similar to the qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, and the same format for the return value is used qutip.solver.Result. The following example extends the example studied above, and uses qutip.floquet.fmmesolve to introduce dissipation into the calculation; from qutip import *; from scipy import *. delta = 0.0 * 2*pi; eps0 = 1.0 * 2*pi; A = 0.25 * 2*pi; omega = 1.0 * 2*pi; T = (2*pi)/omega; tlist = linspace(0.0, 20 * T, 101); psi0 = basis(2,0).

If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively. Changing the Number of Trajectories¶; As mentioned earlier, by default, the mcsolve function runs 500 trajectories. This value was chosen because it gives good accuracy, Monte Carlo errors scale as \(1/n\) where \(n\) is the number of trajectories, and simultaneously does not take an excessive amount of time to run. However, like many other options in QuTiP you are free to change the number of trajectories to fit your needs. If we want to run 1000 trajectories in the above example, we can simply modify the call to mcsolve like:; In [14]: data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [np.sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm], ntraj=1000); 10.0%.

The Monte Carlo solver also has many available options that can be set using the qutip.solver.Options class as discussed in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Reusing Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. In order to solve a given simulation as fast as possible, the solvers in QuTiP take the given input operators and break them down into simpler components before passing them on to the ODE solvers. Although these operations are reasonably fast, the time spent organizing data can become appreciable when repeatedly solving a system over, for example, many different initial conditions. In cases such as this, the Hamiltonian and other operators may be reused after the initial configuration, thus speeding up calculations. Note that, unless you are planning to reuse the data many times, this functionality will not be very useful.; To turn on the “reuse” functionality we must set the rhs_reuse=True flag in the qutip.solver.Options:; In [20]: options = Options(rhs_reuse=True). A full account of this feature is given in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Using the previous example, we will calculate the dynamics for two different initial states, with the Hamiltonian data being reused on the second call; In [21]: psi0 = tensor(fock(2, 0), fock(10, 5)). In [22]: a = tensor(qeye(2), destroy(10)). In [23]: sm = tensor(destroy(2), qeye(10)). In [24]: H = 2 * np.pi * a.dag() * a + 2 * np.pi * sm.dag() * sm + \; ....: 2 * np.pi * 0.25 * (sm * a.dag() + sm.dag() * a); ....: .

The corresponding collapse operator \(C_{n}\) is chosen such that \(n\) is the smallest integer satisfying:. (5)¶\[\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{n}(\tau) \ge r\]; where the individual \(P_{n}\) are given by Eq. (4). Note that the left hand side of Eq. (5) is, by definition, normalized to unity. IV: Using the renormalized state from step III as the new initial condition at time \(\tau\), draw a new random number, and repeat the above procedure until the final simulation time is reached. Monte Carlo in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, Monte Carlo evolution is implemented with the qutip.mcsolve function. It takes nearly the same arguments as the qutip.mesolve; function for master-equation evolution, except that the initial state must be a ket vector, as oppose to a density matrix, and there is an optional keyword parameter ntraj that defines the number of stochastic trajectories to be simulated. By default, ntraj=500 indicating that 500 Monte Carlo trajectories will be performed.; To illustrate the use of the Monte Carlo evolution of quantum systems in QuTiP, let’s again consider the case of a two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity. The only differences to the master-equation treatment is that in this case we invoke the qutip.mcsolve function instead of qutip.mesolve; In [1]: times = np.linspace(0.0, 10.0, 200). In [2]: psi0 = tensor(fock(2, 0), fock(10, 5)). In [3]: a = tensor(qeye(2), destroy(10)). In [4]: sm = tensor(destroy(2), qeye(10)). In [5]: H = 2 * np.pi * a.dag() * a + 2 * np.pi * sm.dag() * sm + 2 * np.pi * 0.25 * (sm * a.dag() + sm.dag() * a).

Usability,simpl,simply,"r state vectors if no expectation value operators are given. If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively. Changing the Number of Trajectories¶; As mentioned earlier, by default, the mcsolve function runs 500 trajectories. This value was chosen because it gives good accuracy, Monte Carlo errors scale as \(1/n\) where \(n\) is the number of trajectories, and simultaneously does not take an excessive amount of time to run. However, like many other options in QuTiP you are free to change the number of trajectories to fit your needs. If we want to run 1000 trajectories in the above example, we can simply modify the call to mcsolve like:; In [14]: data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [np.sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm], ntraj=1000); 10.0%.

Est. time left: 00:00:00:00; Total run time: 14.55s. where we have added the keyword argument ntraj=1000 at the end of the inputs. Now, the Monte Carlo solver will calculate expectation values for both operators, a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm averaging over 1000 trajectories.

Availability,error,errors,"time for complex time-dependent problems, or when simulating over long intervals.; Like the previous method, the string-based format uses a list pair format [Op, str] where str is now a string representing the time-dependent coefficient. For our first example, this string would be '9 * exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2)'. The Hamiltonian in this format would take the form:; In [42]: H = [H0, [H1, '9 * exp(-(t / 5) ** 2)']]. Notice that this is a valid Hamiltonian for the string-based format as exp is included in the above list of suitable functions. Calling the solvers is the same as before:; In [43]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, [a.dag() * a]). We can also use the args variable in the same manner as before, however we must rewrite our string term to read: 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)'; In [44]: H = [H0, [H1, 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)']]. In [45]: args = {'A': 9, 'sig': 5}. In [46]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag()*a], args=args). Important; Naming your args variables e, j or pi will cause errors when using the string-based format. Collapse operators are handled in the exact same way. Modeling Non-Analytic and/or Experimental Time-Dependent Parameters using Interpolating Functions¶. Note; New in QuTiP 4.1. Sometimes it is necessary to model a system where the time-dependent parameters are non-analytic functions, or are derived from experimental data (i.e. a collection of data points). In these situations, one can use interpolating functions as an approximate functional form for input into a time-dependent solver. QuTiP includes it own custom cubic spline interpolation class qutip.interpolate.Cubic_Spline to provide this functionality. To see how this works, lets first generate some noisy data:; In [47]: t = np.linspace(-15, 15, 100). In [48]: func = lambda t: 9*np.exp(-(t / 5)** 2). In [49]: noisy_func = lambda t: func(t)+(0.05*func(t))*np.random.randn(t.shape[0]). In [50]: noisy_data = noisy_func(t). In [51]: plt.figure(); Out[51]: <matplotlib.figure.Figure at ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html
Deployability,install,installed,".exp(-(t/args['sigma'])**2); ....: . or equivalently,; In [38]: def H1_coeff(t, args):; ....: A = args['A']; ....: sig = args['sigma']; ....: return A * np.exp(-(t / sig) ** 2); ....: . where args is a Python dictionary of key: value pairs args = {'A': a, 'sigma': b} where a and b are the two parameters for the amplitude and width, respectively. Of course, we can always hardcode the values in the dictionary as well args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}, but there is much more flexibility by using variables in args. To let the solvers know that we have a set of args to pass we append the args to the end of the solver input:; In [39]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args={'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}). or to keep things looking pretty; In [40]: args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}. In [41]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args=args). Once again, the Monte Carlo solver qutip.mcsolve works in an identical manner. String Format Method¶. Note; You must have Cython installed on your computer to use this format. See Installation for instructions on installing Cython. The string-based time-dependent format works in a similar manner as the previously discussed Python function method. That being said, the underlying code does something completely different. When using this format, the strings used to represent the time-dependent coefficients, as well as Hamiltonian and collapse operators, are rewritten as Cython code using a code generator class and then compiled into C code. The details of this meta-programming will be published in due course. however, in short, this can lead to a substantial reduction in time for complex time-dependent problems, or when simulating over long intervals.; Like the previous method, the string-based format uses a list pair format [Op, str] where str is now a string representing the time-dependent coefficient.

However, many systems have explicit time dependence in either the Hamiltonian, or the collapse operators describing coupling to the environment, and sometimes both components might depend on time. The time-evolutions solvers qutip.mesolve, qutip.mcsolve, qutip.sesolve, and qutip.brmesolve are all capable of handling time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse terms. There are, in general, three different ways to implement time-dependent problems in QuTiP:. Function based: Hamiltonian / collapse operators expressed using [qobj, func] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients of the Hamiltonian (or collapse operators) are expressed using Python functions.; String (Cython) based: The Hamiltonian and/or collapse operators are expressed as a list of [qobj, string] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients are represented as strings.

Safety,avoid,avoid," function or string-representation. Taking the problem from the previous section as an example. We would make the replacement:; H = [H0, [H1, '9 * exp(-(t / 5) ** 2)']]. to; H = [H0, [H1, S]]. When combining interpolating functions with other Python functions or strings, the interpolating class will automatically pick the appropriate method for calling the class. That is to say that, if for example, you have other time-dependent terms that are given in the string-format, then the cubic spline representation will also be passed in a string-compatible format. In the string-format, the interpolation function is compiled into c-code, and thus is quite fast. This is the default method if no other time-dependent terms are present. Reusing Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. When repeatedly simulating a system where only the time-dependent variables, or initial state change, it is possible to reuse the Hamiltonian data stored in QuTiP and there by avoid spending time needlessly preparing the Hamiltonian and collapse terms for simulation. To turn on the the reuse features, we must pass a qutip.Options object with the rhs_reuse flag turned on. Instructions on setting flags are found in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. For example, we can do; In [61]: H = [H0, [H1, 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)']]. In [62]: args = {'A': 9, 'sig': 5}. In [63]: output = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag()*a], args=args); 10.0%.

This includes a wide range of functionality, but comes with a small overhead created by going from C++->Python->C++.; Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators.

However, when specifying Python functions for coefficients, the function must have (t,args) as the input variables, in that order.

Again, we have had to call add_points twice because adding more than one set of multiple data points is not supported by the add_points function.; What if we want to vary the color of our points. We can tell the qutip.Bloch class to vary the color of each point according to the colors listed in the b.point_color list (see Configuring the Bloch sphere below). Again after clear():; In [39]: xp = [np.cos(th) for th in np.linspace(0, 2*pi, 20)]. In [40]: yp = [sin(th) for th in np.linspace(0, 2*pi, 20)]. In [41]: zp = np.zeros(20). In [42]: pnts = [xp, yp, zp]. In [43]: b.add_points(pnts,'m') # <-- add a 'm' string to signify 'multi' colored points. In [44]: b.show(). Now, the data points cycle through a variety of predefined colors. Now lets add another set of points, but this time we want the set to be a single color, representing say a qubit going from the \(\left|\rm up\right>\) state to the \(\left|\rm down\right>\) state in the y-z plane:; In [45]: xz = np.zeros(20). In [46]: yz = [np.sin(th) for th in np.linspace(0, pi ,20)]. In [47]: zz = [np.cos(th) for th in np.linspace(0, pi, 20)]. In [48]: b.add_points([xz, yz, zz]) # no 'm'. In [49]: b.show(). Again, the same plot can be generated using the qutip.Bloch3d class by replacing Bloch with Bloch3d:. A more slick way of using this ‘multi’ color feature is also given in the example, where we set the color of the markers as a function of time. Differences Between Bloch and Bloch3d¶; While in general the Bloch and Bloch3d classes are interchangeable, there are some important differences to consider when choosing between them. The Bloch class uses Matplotlib to generate figures. As such, the data plotted on the sphere is in reality just a 2D object. In contrast the Bloch3d class uses the 3D rendering engine from VTK via mayavi to generate the sphere and the included data.

Important; Generating animations directly from Matplotlib requires installing either mencoder or ffmpeg. While either choice works on linux, it is best to choose ffmpeg when running on the Mac. If using macports just do: sudo port install ffmpeg. The code to directly generate an mp4 movie of the Qubit decay is as follows:; from pylab import *; import matplotlib.animation as animation; from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D. fig = figure(); ax = Axes3D(fig,azim=-40,elev=30); sphere = Bloch(axes=ax). def animate(i):; sphere.clear(); sphere.add_vectors([np.sin(theta),0,np.cos(theta)]); sphere.add_points([sx[:i+1],sy[:i+1],sz[:i+1]]); sphere.make_sphere(); return ax. def init():; sphere.vector_color = ['r']; return ax. ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, np.arange(len(sx)),; init_func=init, blit=True, repeat=False); ani.save('bloch_sphere.mp4', fps=20, clear_temp=True).

The typical figure of merit for unitary systems is the normalised overlap of the evolution and the target. \[\newcommand{\tr}[0]{\operatorname{tr}} f_{PSU} = \tfrac{1}{d} \big| \tr \{X_{targ}^{\dagger} X(T)\} \big|\]; where \(d\) is the system dimension. In this figure of merit the absolute value is taken to ignore any differences in global phase, and \(0 \le f \le 1\). Typically the fidelity error (or infidelity) is more useful, in this case defined as \(\varepsilon = 1 - f_{PSU}\). There are many other possible objectives, and hence figures of merit.; As there are now \(N \times M\) variables (the \(u_{jk}\)) and one parameter to minimise \(\varepsilon\), then the problem becomes a finite multi-variable optimisation problem, for which there are many established methods, often referred to as ‘hill-climbing’ methods. The simplest of these to understand is that of steepest ascent (or descent). The gradient of the fidelity with respect to all the variables is calculated (or approximated) and a step is made in the variable space in the direction of steepest ascent (or descent). This method is a first order gradient method. In two dimensions this describes a method of climbing a hill by heading in the direction where the ground rises fastest. This analogy also clearly illustrates one of the main challenges in multi-variable optimisation, which is that all methods have a tendency to get stuck in local maxima.

Deployability,integrat,integration,"orithm [Doria11], [Caneva11] comes into play: Since the pulse complexity is usually very low, it is sufficient to transform the optimal control problem to a few parameter search by introducing a physically motivated function basis that builds up the pulse. Compared to the number of time slices needed to accurately simulate quantum dynamics (often equals basis dimension for Gradient based algorithms), this number is lower by orders of magnitude, allowing CRAB to efficiently optimize smooth pulses with realistic experimental constraints. It is important to point out, that CRAB does not make any suggestion on the basis function to be used. The basis must be chosen carefully considered, taking into account a priori knowledge of the system (such as symmetries, magnitudes of scales,…) and solution (e.g. sign, smoothness, bang-bang behavior, singularities, maximum excursion or rate of change,….). By doing so, this algorithm allows for native integration of experimental constraints such as maximum frequencies allowed, maximum amplitude, smooth ramping up and down of the pulse and many more. Moreover initial guesses, if they are available, can (however not have to) be included to speed up convergence.; As mentioned in the GRAPE paragraph, for CRAB local minima arising from algorithmic design can occur, too. However, for CRAB a ‘dressed’ version has recently been introduced [Rach15] that allows to escape local minima.; For some control objectives and/or dynamical quantum descriptions, it is either not possible to derive the gradient for the cost functional with respect to each time slice or it is computationally expensive to do so. The same can apply for the necessary (reverse) propagation of the co-state. All this trouble does not occur within CRAB as those elements are not in use here. CRAB, instead, takes the time evolution as a black-box where the pulse goes as an input and the cost (e.g. infidelity) value will be returned as an output.

Energy Efficiency,efficient,efficient,"dency to get stuck in local maxima. It is hard to determine whether one has found a global maximum or not - a local peak is likely not to be the highest mountain in the region. In quantum optimal control we can typically define an infidelity that has a lower bound of zero. We can then look to minimise the infidelity (from here on we will only consider optimising for infidelity minima). This means that we can terminate any pulse optimisation when the infidelity reaches zero (to a sufficient precision). This is however only possible for fully controllable systems; otherwise it is hard (if not impossible) to know that the minimum possible infidelity has been achieved. In the hill walking analogy the step size is roughly fixed to a stride, however, in computations the step size must be chosen. Clearly there is a trade-off here between the number of steps (or iterations) required to reach the minima and the possibility that we might step over a minima. In practice it is difficult to determine an efficient and effective step size.; The second order differentials of the infidelity with respect to the variables can be used to approximate the local landscape to a parabola. This way a step (or jump) can be made to where the minima would be if it were parabolic. This typically vastly reduces the number of iterations, and removes the need to guess a step size. The method where all the second differentials are calculated explicitly is called the Newton-Raphson method. However, calculating the second-order differentials (the Hessian matrix) can be computationally expensive, and so there are a class of methods known as quasi-Newton that approximate the Hessian based on successive iterations. The most popular of these (in quantum optimal control) is the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm (BFGS). The default method in the QuTiP Qtrl GRAPE implementation is the L-BFGS-B method in Scipy, which is a wrapper to the implementation described in [Byrd95].

Performance,perform,performing,"o store the entire Hessian, which reduces the computer memory required, and allows bounds to be set for variable values, which considering these are field amplitudes is often physical.; The pulse optimisation is typically far more efficient if the gradients can be calculated exactly, rather than approximated. For simple fidelity measures such as \(f_{PSU}\) this is possible. Firstly the propagator gradient for each timeslot with respect to the control amplitudes is calculated. For closed systems, with unitary dynamics, a method using the eigendecomposition is used, which is efficient as it is also used in the propagator calculation (to exponentiate the combined Hamiltonian). More generally (for example open systems and symplectic dynamics) the Frechet derivative (or augmented matrix) method is used, which is described in [Flo12]. For other optimisation goals it may not be possible to calculate analytic gradients. In these cases it is necessary to approximate the gradients, but this can be very expensive, and can lead to other algorithms out-performing GRAPE. The CRAB Algorithm¶; It has been shown [Lloyd14], the dimension of a quantum optimal control problem is a polynomial function of the dimension of the manifold of the time-polynomial reachable states, when allowing for a finite control precision and evolution time. You can think of this as the information content of the pulse (as being the only effective input) being very limited e.g. the pulse is compressible to a few bytes without loosing the target.; This is where the Chopped RAndom Basis (CRAB) algorithm [Doria11], [Caneva11] comes into play: Since the pulse complexity is usually very low, it is sufficient to transform the optimal control problem to a few parameter search by introducing a physically motivated function basis that builds up the pulse. Compared to the number of time slices needed to accurately simulate quantum dynamics (often equals basis dimension for Gradient based algorithms), this number is ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/guide-control.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/guide-control.html
Usability,simpl,simplest,"e of merit or fidelity is some measure of how close the evolution is to the target, based on the control amplitudes in the timeslots. The typical figure of merit for unitary systems is the normalised overlap of the evolution and the target. \[\newcommand{\tr}[0]{\operatorname{tr}} f_{PSU} = \tfrac{1}{d} \big| \tr \{X_{targ}^{\dagger} X(T)\} \big|\]; where \(d\) is the system dimension. In this figure of merit the absolute value is taken to ignore any differences in global phase, and \(0 \le f \le 1\). Typically the fidelity error (or infidelity) is more useful, in this case defined as \(\varepsilon = 1 - f_{PSU}\). There are many other possible objectives, and hence figures of merit.; As there are now \(N \times M\) variables (the \(u_{jk}\)) and one parameter to minimise \(\varepsilon\), then the problem becomes a finite multi-variable optimisation problem, for which there are many established methods, often referred to as ‘hill-climbing’ methods. The simplest of these to understand is that of steepest ascent (or descent). The gradient of the fidelity with respect to all the variables is calculated (or approximated) and a step is made in the variable space in the direction of steepest ascent (or descent). This method is a first order gradient method. In two dimensions this describes a method of climbing a hill by heading in the direction where the ground rises fastest. This analogy also clearly illustrates one of the main challenges in multi-variable optimisation, which is that all methods have a tendency to get stuck in local maxima. It is hard to determine whether one has found a global maximum or not - a local peak is likely not to be the highest mountain in the region.

The coefficients are typically quantum objects (type Qobj: states, operators, etc.), so that the value of the eseries also is a quantum object, and the rates can be either real or complex numbers (describing decay rates and oscillation frequencies, respectively).

Saving QuTiP Objects and Data Sets¶; With time-consuming calculations it is often necessary to store the results to files on disk, so it can be post-processed and archived. In QuTiP there are two facilities for storing data: Quantum objects can be stored to files and later read back as python pickles, and numerical data (vectors and matrices) can be exported as plain text files in for example CSV (comma-separated values), TSV (tab-separated values), etc. The former method is preferred when further calculations will be performed with the data, and the latter when the calculations are completed and data is to be imported into a post-processing tool (e.g. for generating figures). Storing and loading QuTiP objects¶; To store and load arbitrary QuTiP related objects (qutip.Qobj, qutip.solver.Result, etc.) there are two functions: qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload. The function qutip.fileio.qsave takes an arbitrary object as first parameter and an optional filename as second parameter (default filename is qutip_data.qu). The filename extension is always .qu.

The function qutip.fileio.qsave takes an arbitrary object as first parameter and an optional filename as second parameter (default filename is qutip_data.qu). The filename extension is always .qu. The function qutip.fileio.qload takes a mandatory filename as first argument and loads and returns the objects in the file.; To illustrate how these functions can be used, consider a simple calculation of the steadystate of the harmonic oscillator:; In [1]: a = destroy(10); H = a.dag() * a ; c_ops = [np.sqrt(0.5) * a, np.sqrt(0.25) * a.dag()]. In [2]: rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops). The steadystate density matrix rho_ss is an instance of qutip.Qobj. It can be stored to a file steadystate.qu using; In [3]: qsave(rho_ss, 'steadystate'). In [4]: ls *.qu; density_matrix_vs_time.qu steadystate.qu. and it can later be loaded again, and used in further calculations:; In [5]: rho_ss_loaded = qload('steadystate'); Loaded Qobj object:; Quantum object: dims = [[10], [10]], shape = (10, 10), type = oper, isHerm = True. In [6]: a = destroy(10). In [7]: expect(a.dag() * a, rho_ss_loaded); Out[7]: 0.9902248289345061. The nice thing about the qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload functions is that almost any object can be stored and load again later on.

As an example, notice that the snippet above already calculates; the Choi matrix of the transpose map by acting it on half of an entangled; pair. We simply need to manually set the dims and superrep attributes to reflect the; structure of the underlying Hilbert space and the chosen representation.; In [139]: J = rho_out. In [140]: J.dims = [[[2], [2]], [[2], [2]]]; .....: J.superrep = 'choi'; .....: . In [142]: print(J.iscp); False. This confirms that the transpose map is not completely positive. On the other hand,; the transpose map does satisfy a weaker condition, namely that it is hermicity preserving.; That is, \(\Lambda(\rho) = (\Lambda(\rho))^\dagger\) for all \(\rho\) such that; \(\rho = \rho^\dagger\). To see this, we note that \((\rho^{\mathrm{T}})^\dagger; = \rho^*\), the complex conjugate of \(\rho\). By assumption, \(\rho = \rho^\dagger; = (\rho^*)^{\mathrm{T}}\), though, such that \(\Lambda(\rho) = \Lambda(\rho^\dagger) = \rho^*\).; We can confirm this by checking the ishp attribute:; In [143]: print(J.ishp); True. Next, we note that the transpose map does preserve the trace of its inputs, such that; \(\operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda[\rho]) = \operatorname{Tr}(\rho)\) for all \(\rho\).; This can be confirmed by the istp attribute:; In [144]: print(J.ishp); True. Finally, a map is called a quantum channel if it always maps valid states to valid; states. Formally, a map is a channel if it is both completely positive and trace preserving.; Thus, QuTiP provides a single attribute to quickly check that this is true.; In [145]: print(J.iscptp); False.

Instead of using the dagger Qobj.dag() method to raise the state, we could have also used the built in qutip.operators.create function to make a raising operator:; In [7]: c = create(5). In [8]: c * vac; Out[8]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [1.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]]. which does the same thing.

Applying the raising operator twice gives the expected \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) dependence. We can use the product of \(c * a\) to also apply the number operator to the state vector vac:; In [11]: c * a * vac; Out[11]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]]. or on the \(\left| 1\right>\) state:; In [12]: c * a * (c * vac); Out[12]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [1.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]]. or the \(\left| 2\right>\) state:; In [13]: c * a * (c**2 * vac); Out[13]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0. ]; [0. ]; [2.82842712]; [0. ]; [0. ]]. Notice how in this last example, application of the number operator does not give the expected value \(n=2\), but rather \(2\sqrt{2}\). This is because this last state is not normalized to unity as \(c\left| n\right> = \sqrt{n+1}\left| n+1\right>\).

Introduction¶; In the previous guide section Basic Operations on Quantum Objects, we saw how to create states and operators, using the functions built into QuTiP. In this portion of the guide, we will look at performing basic operations with states and operators. For more detailed demonstrations on how to use and manipulate these objects, see the examples on the tutorials web page.

However, in most cases, the default fill-in reducing algorithm is nearly optimal. Additional parameters may be used by calling the steady-state solver as:; rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops, method='power', use_rcm=True). where method='power' indicates that we are using the inverse-power solution method, and use_rcm=True turns on a bandwidth minimization routine.; Although it is not obvious, the 'direct', eigen, and 'power' methods all use an LU decomposition internally and thus suffer from a large memory overhead. In contrast, iterative methods such as the 'iterative-gmres', 'iterative-lgmres', and 'iterative-bicgstab' methods do not factor the matrix and thus take less memory than these previous methods and allowing, in principle, for extremely large system sizes. The downside is that these methods can take much longer than the direct method as the condition number of the Liouvillian matrix is large, indicating that these iterative methods require a large number of iterations for convergence. To overcome this, one can use a preconditioner \(M\) that solves for an approximate inverse for the (modified) Liouvillian, thus better conditioning the problem, leading to faster convergence. The use of a preconditioner can actually make these iterative methods faster than the other solution methods. The problem with precondioning is that it is only well defined for Hermitian matrices. Since the Liouvillian is non-Hermitian, the ability to find a good preconditioner is not guaranteed. And moreover, if a preconditioner is found, it is not guaranteed to have a good condition number. QuTiP can make use of an incomplete LU preconditioner when using the iterative 'gmres', 'lgmres', and 'bicgstab' solvers by setting use_precond=True. The preconditioner optionally makes use of a combination of symmetric and anti-symmetric matrix permutations that attempt to improve the precond",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/guide-steady.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/guide-steady.html

Steady State solvers in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, the steady-state solution for a system Hamiltonian or Liouvillian is given by qutip.steadystate.steadystate.

Example: Constructing composite Hamiltonians¶; The qutip.tensor.tensor function is extensively used when constructing Hamiltonians for composite systems. Here we’ll look at some simple examples. Two coupled qubits¶; First, let’s consider a system of two coupled qubits. Assume that both qubit has equal energy splitting, and that the qubits are coupled through a \(\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x\) interaction with strength g = 0.05 (in units where the bare qubit energy splitting is unity). The Hamiltonian describing this system is:; In [6]: H = tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2)) + tensor(identity(2),; ...: sigmaz()) + 0.05 * tensor(sigmax(), sigmax()); ...: . In [7]: H; Out[7]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2, 2], [2, 2]], shape = (4, 4), type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 2. 0. 0. 0.05]; [ 0. 0. 0.05 0. ]; [ 0. 0.05 0. 0. ]; [ 0.05 0. 0. -2. ]]. Three coupled qubits¶; The two-qubit example is easily generalized to three coupled qubits:; In [8]: H = (tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2), identity(2)) +; ...: tensor(identity(2), sigmaz(), identity(2)) +; ...: tensor(identity(2), identity(2), sigmaz()) +; ...: 0.5 * tensor(sigmax(), sigmax(), identity(2)) +; ...: 0.25 * tens",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/guide-tensor.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/guide-tensor.html

In [73]: plt.show(). Similarly, we can use the function qutip.visualization.hinton, which is; used below to visualize the corresponding steadystate density matrix:; In [74]: rho_ss = steadystate(H, [np.sqrt(0.1) * a, np.sqrt(0.4) * b.dag()]). In [75]: fig, ax = hinton(rho_ss) # xlabels=xlabels, ylabels=xlabels). In [76]: plt.show(). Quantum process tomography¶; Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a useful technique for characterizing experimental implementations of quantum gates involving a small number of qubits. It can also be a useful theoretical tool that can give insight in how a process transforms states, and it can be used for example to study how noise or other imperfections deteriorate a gate. Whereas a fidelity or distance measure can give a single number that indicates how far from ideal a gate is, a quantum process tomography analysis can give detailed information about exactly what kind of errors various imperfections introduce.; The idea is to construct a transformation matrix for a quantum process (for example a quantum gate) that describes how the density matrix of a system is transformed by the process. We can then decompose the transformation in some operator basis that represent well-defined and easily interpreted transformations of the input states.; To see how this works (see e.g. [Moh08] for more details), consider a process that is described by quantum map \(\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out}\), which can be written. (1)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix).

In QuTiP the function qutip.gates.iswap generates the unitary transformation for the state kets:; In [77]: U_psi = iswap().

QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python. Docs »; Users Guide »; Visualization of quantum states and processes. Visualization of quantum states and processes¶; Visualization is often an important complement to a simulation of a quantum; mechanical system. The first method of visualization that come to mind might be; to plot the expectation values of a few selected operators. But on top of that,; it can often be instructive to visualize for example the state vectors or; density matices that describe the state of the system, or how the state is; transformed as a function of time (see process tomography below). In this; section we demonstrate how QuTiP and matplotlib can be used to perform a few; types of visualizations that often can provide additional understanding of; quantum system. Fock-basis probability distribution¶; In quantum mechanics probability distributions plays an important role, and as; in statistics, the expectation values computed from a probability distribution; does not reveal the full story. For example, consider an quantum harmonic; oscillator mode with Hamiltonian \(H = \hbar\omega a^\dagger a\), which is; in a state described by its density matrix \(\rho\), and which on average; is occupied by two photons, \(\mathrm{Tr}[\rho a^\dagger a] = 2\). Given; this information we cannot say whether the oscillator is in a Fock state,; a thermal state, a coherent state, etc. By visualizing the photon distribution; in the Fock state basis important clues about the underlying state can be; obtained.; One convenient way to visualize a probability distribution is to use histograms.; Consider the following histogram visualization of the number-basis probability; distribut",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/guide-visualization.html
Security,access,access,"terpreted transformations of the input states.; To see how this works (see e.g. [Moh08] for more details), consider a process that is described by quantum map \(\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out}\), which can be written. (1)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix). Given an orthogonal operator basis of our choice \(\{B_i\}_i^{N^2}\), which satisfies \({\rm Tr}[B_i^\dagger B_j] = N\delta_{ij}\), we can write the map as. (2)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger.\]; where \(\chi_{mn} = \sum_{ij} b_{im}b_{jn}^*\) and \(A_i = \sum_{m} b_{im}B_{m}\). Here, matrix \(\chi\) is the transformation matrix we are after, since it describes how much \(B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger\) contributes to \(\rho_{\rm out}\).; In a numerical simulation of a quantum process we usually do not have access to the quantum map in the form Eq. (1). Instead, what we usually can do is to calculate the propagator \(U\) for the density matrix in superoperator form, using for example the QuTiP function qutip.propagator.propagator. We can then write. \[\epsilon(\tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}) = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = \tilde{\rho}_{\rm out}\]; where \(\tilde{\rho}\) is the vector representation of the density matrix \(\rho\). If we write Eq. (2) in superoperator form as well we obtain. \[\tilde{\rho}_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}.\]; so we can identify. \[U = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger.\]; Now this is a linear equation systems for the \(N^2 \times N^2\) elements in \(\chi\). We can solve it by writing \(\chi\) and the superoperator propagator as \([N^4]\) vectors, and likewise write the superoperator product \(\tilde{B}_m\tilde{B}_n^\dagger\) as a \([N^4\times N^4]\) matrix \(",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/guide-visualization.html

It starts from a combined system-environment perspective, and derives a perturbative master equation for the system alone, under the assumption of weak system-environment coupling. One advantage of this approach is that the dissipation processes and rates are obtained directly from the properties of the environment. On the downside, it does not intrinsically guarantee that the resulting master equation unconditionally preserves the physical properties of the density matrix (because it is a perturbative method). The Bloch-Redfield master equation must therefore be used with care, and the assumptions made in the derivation must be honored. (The Lindblad master equation is in a sense more robust – it always results in a physical density matrix – although some collapse operators might not be physically justified). For a full derivation of the Bloch Redfield master equation, see e.g. [Coh92] or [Bre02]. Here we present only a brief version of the derivation, with the intention of introducing the notation and how it relates to the implementation in QuTiP. Brief Derivation and Definitions¶; The starting point of the Bloch-Redfield formalism is the total Hamiltonian for the system and the environment (bath): \(H = H_{\rm S} + H_{\rm B} + H_{\rm I}\), where \(H\) is the total system+bath Hamiltonian, \(H_{\rm S}\) and \(H_{\rm B}\) are the system and bath Hamiltonians, respectively, and \(H_{\rm I}\) is",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html
Deployability,integrat,integration,"ho_B\). This assumption is known as the Born approximation, and it implies that there never is any entanglement between the system and the bath, neither in the initial state nor at any time during the evolution. It is justified for weak system-bath interaction.; The master equation (1) is non-Markovian, i.e., the change in the density matrix at a time \(t\) depends on states at all times \(\tau < t\), making it intractable to solve both theoretically and numerically. To make progress towards a manageable master equation, we now introduce the Markovian approximation, in which \(\rho(s)\) is replaced by \(\rho(t)\) in Eq. (1). The result is the Redfield equation. (2)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^t d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]],\]; which is local in time with respect the density matrix, but still not Markovian since it contains an implicit dependence on the initial state. By extending the integration to infinity and substituting \(\tau \rightarrow t-\tau\), a fully Markovian master equation is obtained:. (3)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^\infty d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(t-\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]].\]; The two Markovian approximations introduced above are valid if the time-scale with which the system dynamics changes is large compared to the time-scale with which correlations in the bath decays (corresponding to a “short-memory” bath, which results in Markovian system dynamics).; The master equation (3) is still on a too general form to be suitable for numerical implementation. We therefore assume that the system-bath interaction takes the form \(H_I = \sum_\alpha A_\alpha \otimes B_\alpha\) and where \(A_\alpha\) are system operators and \(B_\alpha\) are bath operators. This allows us to write master equation in terms of system operators and bath correlation functions:. \[\begin{split}\frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) =; -\hbar^{-2}; \sum_{\alpha\beta}; \int_0^\infty d\tau\;; \left\{; g_{\alpha\beta}(\",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html

Note; New in QuTiP 4.2. Warning; It takes ~3-5 seconds (~30 if using Visual Studio) to compile a time-dependent Bloch-Redfield problem. Therefore,; if you are doing repeated simulations by varying parameters, then it is best to pass; options = Options(rhs_reuse=True) to the solver. If you have not done so already, please read the section: Solving Problems with Time-dependent Hamiltonians.; As we have already discussed, the Bloch-Redfield master equation requires transforming into the eigenbasis of the system Hamiltonian. For time-independent systems, this transformation need only be done once. However, for time-dependent systems, one must move to the instantaneous eigenbasis at each time-step in the evolution, thus greatly increasing the computational complexity of the dynamics. In addition, the requirement for computing all the eigenvalues severely limits the scalability of the method. Fortunately, this eigen decomposition occurs at the Hamiltonian level, as opposed to the super-operator level, and thus, with efficient programming, one can tackle many systems that are commonly encountered.; The time-dependent Bloch-Redfield solver in QuTiP relies on the efficient numerical computations afforded by the string-based time-dependent format, and Cython compilation. As such, all the time-dependent terms, and noise power spectra must be expressed in the string format. To begin, lets consider the previous example, but formatted to call the time-dependent solver:; In [18]: ohmic = ""{gamma1} / 2.0 * (w / (2 * pi)) * (w > 0.0)"".format(gamma1=gamma1).

Although the problem itself is time-independent, the use of a string as the noise power spectrum tells the solver to go into time-dependent mode. The string is nearly identical to the Python function format, except that we replaced np.pi with pi to avoid calling Python in our Cython code, and we have hard coded the gamma1 argument into the string as limitations prevent passing arguments into the time-dependent Bloch-Redfield solver.; For actual time-dependent Hamiltonians, the Hamiltonian itself can be passed into the solver like any other string-based Hamiltonian, as thus we will not discuss this topic further. Instead, here the focus is on time-dependent bath coupling terms. To this end, suppose that we have a dissipative harmonic oscillator, where the white-noise dissipation rate decreases exponentially with time \(\kappa(t) = \kappa(0)\exp(-t)\). In the Lindblad or monte-carlo solvers, this could be implemented as a time-dependent collapse operator list c_ops = [[a, 'sqrt(kappa*exp(-t))']]. In the Bloch-Redfield solver, the bath coupling terms must be Hermitian. As such, in this example, our coupling operator is the position operator a+a.dag(). In addition, we do not need the sqrt operation that occurs in the c_ops definition.

State vectors, or density matrices, as well as col_times and col_which, are accessed in a similar manner, although typically one does not need an index (i.e [0]) since there is only one list for each of these components. The one exception to this rule is if you choose to output state vectors from the Monte Carlo solver, in which case there are ntraj number of state vector arrays. Saving and Loading Result Objects¶; The main advantage in using the Result class as a data storage object comes from the simplicity in which simulation data can be stored and later retrieved. The qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload functions are designed for this task. To begin, let us save the data object from the previous section into a file called “cavity+qubit-data” in the current working directory by calling:; >>> qsave(result, 'cavity+qubit-data'). All of the data results are then stored in a single file of the same name with a “.qu” extension. Therefore, everything needed to later this data is stored in a single file. Loading the file is just as easy as saving:; >>> stored_result = qload('cavity+qubit-data'); Loaded Result object:; Result object with mcsolve data.; ---------------------------------; expect = True; num_expect = 2, num_collapse = 2, ntraj = 500. where stored_result is the new name of the Result object. We can then extract the data and plot in the same manner as before:; expt0 = stored_result.expect[0]; expt1 = stored_result.expect[1]; times = stored_result.times; plot(times, expt0, times, expt1); show().

Introduction¶; Many time-dependent problems of interest are periodic. The dynamics of such systems can be solved for directly by numerical integration of the Schrödinger or Master equation, using the time-dependent Hamiltonian. But they can also be transformed into time-independent problems using the Floquet formalism. Time-independent problems can be solve much more efficiently, so such a transformation is often very desirable.; In the standard derivations of the Lindblad and Bloch-Redfield master equations the Hamiltonian describing the system under consideration is assumed to be time independent. Thus, strictly speaking, the standard forms of these master equation formalisms should not blindly be applied to system with time-dependent Hamiltonians. However, in many relevant cases, in parti",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html
Modifiability,coupling,coupling,"pendent due to the driving. In such cases a rigorious approach would be to take the driving into account when deriving the master equation. This can be done in many different ways, but one way common approach is to derive the master equation in the Floquet basis. That approach results in the so-called Floquet-Markov master equation, see Grifoni et al., Physics Reports 304, 299 (1998) for details. The Floquet-Markov master equation in QuTiP¶; The QuTiP function qutip.floquet.fmmesolve implements the Floquet-Markov master equation. It calculates the dynamics of a system given its initial state, a time-dependent hamiltonian, a list of operators through which the system couples to its environment and a list of corresponding spectral-density functions that describes the environment. In contrast to the qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, and the qutip.floquet.fmmesolve does characterize the environment with dissipation rates, but extract the strength of the coupling to the environment from the noise spectral-density functions and the instantaneous Hamiltonian parameters (similar to the Bloch-Redfield master equation solver qutip.bloch_redfield.brmesolve). Note; Currently the qutip.floquet.fmmesolve can only accept a single environment coupling operator and spectral-density function. The noise spectral-density function of the environment is implemented as a Python callback function that is passed to the solver. For example:; >>> gamma1 = 0.1; >>> def noise_spectrum(omega):; >>> return 0.5 * gamma1 * omega/(2*pi). The other parameters are similar to the qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, and the same format for the return value is used qutip.solver.Result. The following example extends the example studied above, and uses qutip.floquet.fmmesolve to introduce dissipation into the calculation; from qutip import *; from scipy import *. delta = 0.0 * 2*pi; eps0 = 1.0 * 2*pi; A = 0.25 * 2*pi; omega = 1.0 * 2*pi; T = (2*pi)/omega; tlist = linspace(0.0, 20 * T, 101); psi0 = basis(2,0).

The Monte Carlo solver also has many available options that can be set using the qutip.solver.Options class as discussed in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Reusing Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. In order to solve a given simulation as fast as possible, the solvers in QuTiP take the given input operators and break them down into simpler components before passing them on to the ODE solvers. Although these operations are reasonably fast, the time spent organizing data can become appreciable when repeatedly solving a system over, for example, many different initial conditions. In cases such as this, the Hamiltonian and other operators may be reused after the initial configuration, thus speeding up calculations. Note that, unless you are planning to reuse the data many times, this functionality will not be very useful.; To turn on the “reuse” functionality we must set the rhs_reuse=True flag in the qutip.solver.Options:; In [20]: options = Options(rhs_reuse=True). A full account of this feature is given in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Using the previous example, we will calculate the dynamics for two different initial states, with the Hamiltonian data being reused on the second call; In [21]: psi0 = tensor(fock(2, 0), fock(10, 5)).

IV: Using the renormalized state from step III as the new initial condition at time \(\tau\), draw a new random number, and repeat the above procedure until the final simulation time is reached. Monte Carlo in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, Monte Carlo evolution is implemented with the qutip.mcsolve function. It takes nearly the same arguments as the qutip.mesolve; function for master-equation evolution, except that the initial state must be a ket vector, as oppose to a density matrix, and there is an optional keyword parameter ntraj that defines the number of stochastic trajectories to be simulated. By default, ntraj=500 indicating that 500 Monte Carlo trajectories will be performed.; To illustrate the use of the Monte Carlo evolution of quantum systems in QuTiP, let’s again consider the case of a two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity. The only differences to the master-equation treatment is that in this case we invoke the qutip.mcsolve function instead of qutip.mesolve; In [1]: times = np.linspace(0.0, 10.0, 200).

Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively.

If we want to run 1000 trajectories in the above example, we can simply modify the call to mcsolve like:; In [14]: data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [np.sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm], ntraj=1000); 10.0%.

Permutational Invariance¶. Permutational Invariant Quantum Solver (PIQS)¶; The Permutational Invariant Quantum Solver (PIQS) is a QuTiP module that allows to study the dynamics of an open quantum system consisting of an ensemble of identical qubits that can dissipate through local and collective baths according to a Lindblad master equation.; The Liouvillian of an ensemble of \(N\) qubits, or two-level systems (TLSs), \(\mathcal{D}_{TLS}(\rho)\), can be built using only polynomial – instead of exponential – resources.; This has many applications for the study of realistic quantum optics models of many TLSs and in general as a tool in cavity QED.; Consider a system evolving according to the equation. \[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\dot{\rho} = \mathcal{D}_\text{TLS}(\rho)=-\frac{i}{\hbar}\lbrack H,\rho \rbrack; +\frac{\gamma_\text{CE}}{2}\mathc",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-piqs.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-piqs.html

The collective spin operators are \(J_{\alpha} = \sum_{n}J_{\alpha,n}\) . The Lindblad super-operators are \(\mathcal{L}_{A} = 2A\rho A^\dagger - A^\dagger A \rho - \rho A^\dagger A\).; The inclusion of local processes in the dynamics lead to using a Liouvillian space of dimension \(4^N\). By exploiting the permutational invariance of identical particles [2-8], the Liouvillian \(\mathcal{D}_\text{TLS}(\rho)\) can be built as a block-diagonal matrix in the basis of Dicke states \(|j, m \rangle\).; The system under study is defined by creating an object of the; Dicke class, e.g. simply named; system, whose first attribute is. system.N, the number of TLSs of the system \(N\). The rates for collective and local processes are simply defined as. collective_emission defines \(\gamma_\text{CE}\), collective (superradiant) emission; collective_dephasing defines \(\gamma_\text{CD}\), collective dephasing; collective_pumping defines \(\gamma_\text{CP}\), collective pumping.; emission defines \(\gamma_\text{E}\), incoherent emission (losses); dephasing defines \(\gamma_\text{D}\), local dephasing; pumping defines \(\gamma_\text{P}\), incoherent pumping. Then the system.lindbladian() creates the total TLS Lindbladian superoperator matrix. Similarly, system.hamiltonian defines the TLS hamiltonian of the system \(H_\text{TLS}\).; The system’s Liouvillian can be built using system.liouvillian(). The properties of a Piqs object can be visualized by simply calling; system. We give two basic examples on the use of PIQS. In the first example the incoherent emission of N driven TLSs is considered.; fr",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-piqs.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-piqs.html
Availability,error,errors,"time for complex time-dependent problems, or when simulating over long intervals.; Like the previous method, the string-based format uses a list pair format [Op, str] where str is now a string representing the time-dependent coefficient. For our first example, this string would be '9 * exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2)'. The Hamiltonian in this format would take the form:; In [42]: H = [H0, [H1, '9 * exp(-(t / 5) ** 2)']]. Notice that this is a valid Hamiltonian for the string-based format as exp is included in the above list of suitable functions. Calling the solvers is the same as before:; In [43]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, [a.dag() * a]). We can also use the args variable in the same manner as before, however we must rewrite our string term to read: 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)'; In [44]: H = [H0, [H1, 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)']]. In [45]: args = {'A': 9, 'sig': 5}. In [46]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag()*a], args=args). Important; Naming your args variables e, j or pi will cause errors when using the string-based format. Collapse operators are handled in the exact same way. Modeling Non-Analytic and/or Experimental Time-Dependent Parameters using Interpolating Functions¶. Note; New in QuTiP 4.1. Sometimes it is necessary to model a system where the time-dependent parameters are non-analytic functions, or are derived from experimental data (i.e. a collection of data points). In these situations, one can use interpolating functions as an approximate functional form for input into a time-dependent solver. QuTiP includes it own custom cubic spline interpolation class qutip.interpolate.Cubic_Spline to provide this functionality. To see how this works, lets first generate some noisy data:; In [47]: t = np.linspace(-15, 15, 100). In [48]: func = lambda t: 9*np.exp(-(t / 5)** 2). In [49]: noisy_func = lambda t: func(t)+(0.05*func(t))*np.random.randn(t.shape[0]). In [50]: noisy_data = noisy_func(t). In [51]: plt.figure(); Out[51]: <Figure size 640x480 with 0 A",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

Of course, we can always hardcode the values in the dictionary as well args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}, but there is much more flexibility by using variables in args. To let the solvers know that we have a set of args to pass we append the args to the end of the solver input:; In [39]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args={'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}). or to keep things looking pretty; In [40]: args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}. In [41]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args=args). Once again, the Monte Carlo solver qutip.mcsolve works in an identical manner. String Format Method¶. Note; You must have Cython installed on your computer to use this format. See Installation for instructions on installing Cython. The string-based time-dependent format works in a similar manner as the previously discussed Python function method. That being said, the underlying code does something completely different. When using this format, the strings used to represent the time-dependent coefficients, as well as Hamiltonian and collapse operators, are rewritten as Cython code using a code generator class and then compiled into C code. The details of this meta-programming will be published in due course. however, in short, this can lead to a substantial reduction in time for complex time-dependent problems, or when simulating over long intervals.; Like the previous method, the string-based format uses a list pair format [Op, str] where str is now a string representing the time-dependent coefficient. For our first example, this string would be '9 * exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2)'.

Collapse operators must be time independent using this input format. Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose? In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general, allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions. However, by automatically compiling your system into C++ code, the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster [This is also the only format that is supported in the qutip.brmesolve solver]. Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor. Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of, it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter.

Safety,avoid,avoid," function or string-representation. Taking the problem from the previous section as an example. We would make the replacement:; H = [H0, [H1, '9 * exp(-(t / 5) ** 2)']]. to; H = [H0, [H1, S]]. When combining interpolating functions with other Python functions or strings, the interpolating class will automatically pick the appropriate method for calling the class. That is to say that, if for example, you have other time-dependent terms that are given in the string-format, then the cubic spline representation will also be passed in a string-compatible format. In the string-format, the interpolation function is compiled into c-code, and thus is quite fast. This is the default method if no other time-dependent terms are present. Reusing Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. When repeatedly simulating a system where only the time-dependent variables, or initial state change, it is possible to reuse the Hamiltonian data stored in QuTiP and there by avoid spending time needlessly preparing the Hamiltonian and collapse terms for simulation. To turn on the the reuse features, we must pass a qutip.Options object with the rhs_reuse flag turned on. Instructions on setting flags are found in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. For example, we can do; In [61]: H = [H0, [H1, 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)']]. In [62]: args = {'A': 9, 'sig': 5}. In [63]: output = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag()*a], args=args); 10.0%.

Testability,log,log,"tion with time-dependence. Collapse operators must be time independent using this input format. Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose? In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general, allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions. However, by automatically compiling your system into C++ code, the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster [This is also the only format that is supported in the qutip.brmesolve solver]. Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor. Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of, it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter. Time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions, or combinations thereof (including constants) can be compiled directly into C++-code:; 'abs', 'acos', 'acosh', 'arg', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atanh', 'conj',; 'cos', 'cosh','exp', 'erf', 'imag', 'log', 'log10', 'norm', 'proj', 'real', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt',; 'tan', 'tanh'. In addition, QuTiP supports cubic spline based interpolation functions [Modeling Non-Analytic and/or Experimental Time-Dependent Parameters using Interpolating Functions].; If you require mathematical functions other than those listed above, than it is possible to call any of the functions in the NumPy library using the prefix np. before the function name in the string, i.e 'np.sin(t)'. This includes a wide range of functionality, but comes with a small overhead created by going from C++->Python->C++.; Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators. However, in contrast to options #1 and #2, this me",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.3/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

In [17]: state_GG = tensor(basis(N, 1), ground) # Define states onto which to project. In [18]: sigma_GG = state_GG * state_GG.dag(). In [19]: state_UU = tensor(basis(N, 0), ustate).

In [23]: H1 = (sigma_ue.dag() + sigma_ue) # time-dependent term. Given that we have a single time-dependent Hamiltonian term, and constant collapse terms, we need to specify a single Python function for the coefficient \(f(t)\). In this case, one can simply do; In [24]: def H1_coeff(t, args):; ....: return 9 * np.exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2); ....: . In this case, the return value dependents only on time. However, when specifying Python functions for coefficients, the function must have (t,args) as the input variables, in that order. Having specified our coefficient function, we can now specify the Hamiltonian in list format and call the solver (in this case qutip.mesolve); In [25]: H = [H0,[H1,H1_coeff]]. In [26]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, [ada, sigma_UU, sigma_GG]). We can call the Monte Carlo solver in the exact same way (if using the default ntraj=500):; In [27]: output = mcsolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, [ada, sigma_UU, sigma_GG]); 10.0%. Run time: 0.55s.

Again, we have had to call add_points twice because adding more than one set of multiple data points is not supported by the add_points function.; What if we want to vary the color of our points. We can tell the qutip.Bloch class to vary the color of each point according to the colors listed in the b.point_color list (see Configuring the Bloch sphere below). Again after clear():; In [42]: xp = [np.cos(th) for th in np.linspace(0, 2*pi, 20)]. In [43]: yp = [sin(th) for th in np.linspace(0, 2*pi, 20)]. In [44]: zp = np.zeros(20).

Now, the data points cycle through a variety of predefined colors. Now lets add another set of points, but this time we want the set to be a single color, representing say a qubit going from the \(\left|\rm up\right>\) state to the \(\left|\rm down\right>\) state in the y-z plane:; In [48]: xz = np.zeros(20).

In [52]: b.show(); <Figure size 500x500 with 1 Axes>. Again, the same plot can be generated using the qutip.Bloch3d class by replacing Bloch with Bloch3d:. A more slick way of using this ‘multi’ color feature is also given in the example, where we set the color of the markers as a function of time. Differences Between Bloch and Bloch3d¶; While in general the Bloch and Bloch3d classes are interchangeable, there are some important differences to consider when choosing between them. The Bloch class uses Matplotlib to generate figures. As such, the data plotted on the sphere is in reality just a 2D object.

The simplest of these to understand is that of steepest ascent (or descent). The gradient of the fidelity with respect to all the variables is calculated (or approximated) and a step is made in the variable space in the direction of steepest ascent (or descent). This method is a first order gradient method. In two dimensions this describes a method of climbing a hill by heading in the direction where the ground rises fastest. This analogy also clearly illustrates one of the main challenges in multi-variable optimisation, which is that all methods have a tendency to get stuck in local maxima.

Deployability,integrat,integration,"orithm [Doria11], [Caneva11] comes into play: Since the pulse complexity is usually very low, it is sufficient to transform the optimal control problem to a few parameter search by introducing a physically motivated function basis that builds up the pulse. Compared to the number of time slices needed to accurately simulate quantum dynamics (often equals basis dimension for Gradient based algorithms), this number is lower by orders of magnitude, allowing CRAB to efficiently optimize smooth pulses with realistic experimental constraints. It is important to point out, that CRAB does not make any suggestion on the basis function to be used. The basis must be chosen carefully considered, taking into account a priori knowledge of the system (such as symmetries, magnitudes of scales,…) and solution (e.g. sign, smoothness, bang-bang behavior, singularities, maximum excursion or rate of change,….). By doing so, this algorithm allows for native integration of experimental constraints such as maximum frequencies allowed, maximum amplitude, smooth ramping up and down of the pulse and many more. Moreover initial guesses, if they are available, can (however not have to) be included to speed up convergence.; As mentioned in the GRAPE paragraph, for CRAB local minima arising from algorithmic design can occur, too. However, for CRAB a ‘dressed’ version has recently been introduced [Rach15] that allows to escape local minima.; For some control objectives and/or dynamical quantum descriptions, it is either not possible to derive the gradient for the cost functional with respect to each time slice or it is computationally expensive to do so. The same can apply for the necessary (reverse) propagation of the co-state. All this trouble does not occur within CRAB as those elements are not in use here. CRAB, instead, takes the time evolution as a black-box where the pulse goes as an input and the cost (e.g. infidelity) value will be returned as an output. This concept, on top, allows for dir",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/guide-control.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/guide-control.html
Energy Efficiency,efficient,efficient,"dency to get stuck in local maxima. It is hard to determine whether one has found a global maximum or not - a local peak is likely not to be the highest mountain in the region. In quantum optimal control we can typically define an infidelity that has a lower bound of zero. We can then look to minimise the infidelity (from here on we will only consider optimising for infidelity minima). This means that we can terminate any pulse optimisation when the infidelity reaches zero (to a sufficient precision). This is however only possible for fully controllable systems; otherwise it is hard (if not impossible) to know that the minimum possible infidelity has been achieved. In the hill walking analogy the step size is roughly fixed to a stride, however, in computations the step size must be chosen. Clearly there is a trade-off here between the number of steps (or iterations) required to reach the minima and the possibility that we might step over a minima. In practice it is difficult to determine an efficient and effective step size.; The second order differentials of the infidelity with respect to the variables can be used to approximate the local landscape to a parabola. This way a step (or jump) can be made to where the minima would be if it were parabolic. This typically vastly reduces the number of iterations, and removes the need to guess a step size. The method where all the second differentials are calculated explicitly is called the Newton-Raphson method. However, calculating the second-order differentials (the Hessian matrix) can be computationally expensive, and so there are a class of methods known as quasi-Newton that approximate the Hessian based on successive iterations. The most popular of these (in quantum optimal control) is the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm (BFGS). The default method in the QuTiP Qtrl GRAPE implementation is the L-BFGS-B method in Scipy, which is a wrapper to the implementation described in [Byrd95].

Performance,perform,performing,"o store the entire Hessian, which reduces the computer memory required, and allows bounds to be set for variable values, which considering these are field amplitudes is often physical.; The pulse optimisation is typically far more efficient if the gradients can be calculated exactly, rather than approximated. For simple fidelity measures such as \(f_{PSU}\) this is possible. Firstly the propagator gradient for each timeslot with respect to the control amplitudes is calculated. For closed systems, with unitary dynamics, a method using the eigendecomposition is used, which is efficient as it is also used in the propagator calculation (to exponentiate the combined Hamiltonian). More generally (for example open systems and symplectic dynamics) the Frechet derivative (or augmented matrix) method is used, which is described in [Flo12]. For other optimisation goals it may not be possible to calculate analytic gradients. In these cases it is necessary to approximate the gradients, but this can be very expensive, and can lead to other algorithms out-performing GRAPE. The CRAB Algorithm¶; It has been shown [Lloyd14], the dimension of a quantum optimal control problem is a polynomial function of the dimension of the manifold of the time-polynomial reachable states, when allowing for a finite control precision and evolution time. You can think of this as the information content of the pulse (as being the only effective input) being very limited e.g. the pulse is compressible to a few bytes without loosing the target.; This is where the Chopped RAndom Basis (CRAB) algorithm [Doria11], [Caneva11] comes into play: Since the pulse complexity is usually very low, it is sufficient to transform the optimal control problem to a few parameter search by introducing a physically motivated function basis that builds up the pulse.

Two-time correlation functions¶; With the QuTiP time-evolution functions (for example qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve), a state vector or density matrix can be evolved from an initial state at \(t_0\) to an arbitrary time \(t\), \(\rho(t)=V(t, t_0)\left\{\rho(t_0)\right\}\), where \(V(t, t_0)\) is the propagator defined by the equation of motion. The resulting density matrix can then be used to evaluate the expectation values of arbitrary combinations of same-time operators.; To calculate two-time correlation functions on the form \(\left<A(t+\tau)B(t)\right>\), we can use the quantum regression theorem (see, e.g., [Gar03]) to write. \[\left<A(t+\tau)B(t)\right> = {\rm Tr}\left[A V(t+\tau, t)\left\{B\rho(t)\right\}\right]; = {\rm Tr}\left[A V(t+\tau, t)\left\{BV(t, 0)\left\{\rho(0)\right\}\right\}\right]\]; We therefore first calculate \(\rho(t)=V(t, 0)\left\{\rho(0)\right\}\) using one of the QuTiP evolution solvers with \(\rho(0)\) as initial state, and then again use the same solver to calculate \(V(t+\tau, t)\left\{B\rho(t)\right\}\) using \(B\rho(t)\) as initial state.; Note that if the initial state is the steady state, then \(\rho(t)=V(t, 0)\left\{\rho_{\rm ss}\right\}=\rho_{\rm ss}\) and. \[\left<A(t+\",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/guide-correlation.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/guide-correlation.html

Parallel processing is useful for repeated tasks such as generating plots corresponding to the dynamical evolution of your system, or simultaneously simulating different parameter configurations. IPython-based parallel_map¶. Note; New in QuTiP 3. When QuTiP is used with IPython interpreter, there is an alternative parallel for-loop implementation in the QuTiP module qutip.ipynbtools, see qutip.ipynbtools.parallel_map. The advantage of this parallel_map implementation is based on IPythons powerful framework for parallelization, so the compute processes are not confined to run on the same host as the main process.

Saving QuTiP Objects and Data Sets¶; With time-consuming calculations it is often necessary to store the results to files on disk, so it can be post-processed and archived. In QuTiP there are two facilities for storing data: Quantum objects can be stored to files and later read back as python pickles, and numerical data (vectors and matrices) can be exported as plain text files in for example CSV (comma-separated values), TSV (tab-separated values), etc. The former method is preferred when further calculations will be performed with the data, and the latter when the calculations are completed and data is to be imported into a post-processing tool (e.g. for generating figures). Storing and loading QuTiP objects¶; To store and load arbitrary QuTiP related objects (qutip.Qobj, qutip.solver.Result, etc.) there are two functions: qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload. The function qutip.fileio.qsave takes an arbitrary object as first parameter and an optional filename as second parameter (default filename is qutip_data.qu). The filename extension is always .qu.

The function qutip.fileio.qload takes a mandatory filename as first argument and loads and returns the objects in the file.; To illustrate how these functions can be used, consider a simple calculation of the steadystate of the harmonic oscillator:; In [1]: a = destroy(10); H = a.dag() * a ; c_ops = [np.sqrt(0.5) * a, np.sqrt(0.25) * a.dag()]. In [2]: rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops). The steadystate density matrix rho_ss is an instance of qutip.Qobj. It can be stored to a file steadystate.qu using; In [3]: qsave(rho_ss, 'steadystate'). In [4]: ls *.qu; density_matrix_vs_time.qu steadystate.qu. and it can later be loaded again, and used in further calculations:; In [5]: rho_ss_loaded = qload('steadystate'); Loaded Qobj object:; Quantum object: dims = [[10], [10]], shape = (10, 10), type = oper, isHerm = True. In [6]: a = destroy(10). In [7]: expect(a.dag() * a, rho_ss_loaded); Out[7]: 0.9902248289345063. The nice thing about the qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload functions is that almost any object can be stored and load again later on.

Setting; Description; Options. auto_herm; Automatically calculate the hermicity of; quantum objects.; True / False. auto_tidyup; Automatically tidyup quantum objects.; True / False. auto_tidyup_atol; Tolerance used by tidyup; any float value > 0. atol; General tolerance; any float value > 0. num_cpus; Number of CPU’s used for multiprocessing.; int between 1 and # cpu’s. debug; Show debug printouts.; True / False. openmp_thresh; NNZ matrix must have for OPENMP.; Int. Example: Changing Settings¶; The two most important settings are auto_tidyup and auto_tidyup_atol as they control whether the small elements of a quantum object should be removed, and what number should be considered as the cut-off tolerance. Modifying these, or any other parameters, is quite simple:; >>> qutip.settings.auto_tidyup = False. These settings will be used for the current QuTiP session only and will need to be modified again when restarting QuTiP. If running QuTiP from a script file, then place the qutip.setings.xxxx commands immediately after from qutip import * at the top of the script file. If you want to reset the parameters back to their default values then call the reset command:; >>> qutip.settings.reset(). Persistent Settings¶; When QuTiP is imported, it looks for a file named qutiprc in a folder called .qutip user’s home directory. If this file is found, it will be loaded and overwrite the QuTiP default settings, which allows for persistent changes in the QuTiP settings to be made. A sample qutiprc file is show below. The syntax is a simple key-value format, where the keys and possible values are described in the table above:; [qutip]; auto_tidyup=True; auto_herm=True; auto_tidyup_atol=1e-12; num_cpus=4; debug=False.

As an example, notice that the snippet above already calculates; the Choi matrix of the transpose map by acting it on half of an entangled; pair. We simply need to manually set the dims and superrep attributes to reflect the; structure of the underlying Hilbert space and the chosen representation.; In [130]: J = rho_out. In [131]: J.dims = [[[2], [2]], [[2], [2]]]; .....: J.superrep = 'choi'; .....: . In [132]: print(J.iscp); False. This confirms that the transpose map is not completely positive. On the other hand,; the transpose map does satisfy a weaker condition, namely that it is hermicity preserving.; That is, \(\Lambda(\rho) = (\Lambda(\rho))^\dagger\) for all \(\rho\) such that; \(\rho = \rho^\dagger\). To see this, we note that \((\rho^{\mathrm{T}})^\dagger; = \rho^*\), the complex conjugate of \(\rho\). By assumption, \(\rho = \rho^\dagger; = (\rho^*)^{\mathrm{T}}\), though, such that \(\Lambda(\rho) = \Lambda(\rho^\dagger) = \rho^*\).; We can confirm this by checking the ishp attribute:; In [133]: print(J.ishp); True. Next, we note that the transpose map does preserve the trace of its inputs, such that; \(\operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda[\rho]) = \operatorname{Tr}(\rho)\) for all \(\rho\).; This can be confirmed by the istp attribute:; In [134]: print(J.istp); False. Finally, a map is called a quantum channel if it always maps valid states to valid; states. Formally, a map is a channel if it is both completely positive and trace preserving.; Thus, QuTiP provides a single attribute to quickly check that this is true.; In [135]: print(J.iscptp); False.

Qubit (two-level) systems¶; Having spent a fair amount of time on basis states that represent harmonic oscillator states, we now move on to qubit, or two-level quantum systems (for example a spin-1/2). To create a state vector corresponding to a qubit system, we use the same qutip.states.basis, or qutip.states.fock, function with only two levels:; In [45]: spin = basis(2, 0). Now at this point one may ask how this state is different than that of a harmonic oscillator in the vacuum state truncated to two energy levels?; In [46]: vac = basis(2, 0). At this stage, there is no difference. This should not be surprising as we called the exact same function twice. The difference between the two comes from the action of the spin operators qutip.operators.sigmax, qutip.operators.sigmay, qutip.operators.sigmaz, qutip.operators.sigmap, and qutip.operators.sigmam on these two-level states. For example, if vac corresponds to the vacuum state of a harmonic oscillator, then, as we have already seen, we can use the raising operator to get the \(\left|1\right>\) state:; In [47]: vac; Out[47]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[1.]; [0.]]. In [48]: c = create(2). In [49]: c * vac; Out[49]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [1.]].

Integrability,depend,dependence," [0.]; [0.]; [0.]]. The raising operator has in indeed raised the state vec from the vacuum to the \(\left| 1\right>\) state. Instead of using the dagger Qobj.dag() method to raise the state, we could have also used the built in qutip.operators.create function to make a raising operator:; In [7]: c = create(5). In [8]: c * vac; Out[8]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [1.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]]. which does the same thing. We can raise the vacuum state more than once by successively apply the raising operator:; In [9]: c * c * vac; Out[9]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0. ]; [0. ]; [1.41421356]; [0. ]; [0. ]]. or just taking the square of the raising operator \(\left(\hat{a}^\dagger\right)^{2}\):; In [10]: c ** 2 * vac; Out[10]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0. ]; [0. ]; [1.41421356]; [0. ]; [0. ]]. Applying the raising operator twice gives the expected \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) dependence. We can use the product of \(c * a\) to also apply the number operator to the state vector vac:; In [11]: c * a * vac; Out[11]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]]. or on the \(\left| 1\right>\) state:; In [12]: c * a * (c * vac); Out[12]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [1.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]]. or the \(\left| 2\right>\) state:; In [13]: c * a * (c**2 * vac); Out[13]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0. ]; [0. ]; [2.82842712]; [0. ]; [0. ]]. Notice how in this last example, application of the number operator does not give the expected value \(n=2\), but rather \(2\sqrt{2}\). This is because this last state is not normalized to unity as \(c\left| n\right> = \sqrt{n+1}\left| n+1\right>\). Therefore, we should normalize our vector first:; In [14]: c * a * (c**2 * vac).unit(); ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/guide-states.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/guide-states.html

Additional parameters may be used by calling the steady-state solver as:; rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops, method='power', use_rcm=True). where method='power' indicates that we are using the inverse-power solution method, and use_rcm=True turns on a bandwidth minimization routine.; Although it is not obvious, the 'direct', eigen, and 'power' methods all use an LU decomposition internally and thus suffer from a large memory overhead.

The downside is that these methods can take much longer than the direct method as the condition number of the Liouvillian matrix is large, indicating that these iterative methods require a large number of iterations for convergence. To overcome this, one can use a preconditioner \(M\) that solves for an approximate inverse for the (modified) Liouvillian, thus better conditioning the problem, leading to faster convergence. The use of a preconditioner can actually make these iterative methods faster than the other solution methods. The problem with precondioning is that it is only well defined for Hermitian matrices. Since the Liouvillian is non-Hermitian, the ability to find a good preconditioner is not guaranteed. And moreover, if a preconditioner is found, it is not guaranteed to have a good condition number. QuTiP can make use of an incomplete LU preconditioner when using the iterative 'gmres', 'lgmres', and 'bicgstab' solvers by setting use_precond=True.

Energy Efficiency,power,power,"-independent Hamiltonian. For many these systems, solving for the asymptotic density matrix \(\hat{\rho}_{ss}\) can be achieved using direct or iterative solution methods faster than using master equation or Monte Carlo simulations. Although the steady state equation has a simple mathematical form, the properties of the Liouvillian operator are such that the solutions to this equation are anything but straightforward to find. Steady State solvers in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, the steady-state solution for a system Hamiltonian or Liouvillian is given by qutip.steadystate.steadystate. This function implements a number of different methods for finding the steady state, each with their own pros and cons, where the method used can be chosen using the method keyword argument. Method; Keyword; Description. Direct (default); ‘direct’; Direct solution solving \(Ax=b\) via sparse LU decomposition. Eigenvalue; ‘eigen’; Iteratively find the zero eigenvalue of \(\mathcal{L}\). Inverse-Power; ‘power’; Solve using the inverse-power method. GMRES; ‘iterative-gmres’; Solve using the GMRES method and optional preconditioner. LGMRES; ‘iterative-lgmres’; Solve using the LGMRES method and optional preconditioner. BICGSTAB; ‘iterative-bicgstab’; Solve using the BICGSTAB method and optional preconditioner. SVD; ‘svd’; Steady-state solution via the dense SVD of the Liouvillian. The function qutip.steadystate.steadystate can take either a Hamiltonian and a list of collapse operators as input, generating internally the corresponding Liouvillian super operator in Lindblad form, or alternatively, a Liouvillian passed by the user. When possible, we recommend passing the Hamiltonian and collapse operators to qutip.steadystate.steadystate, and letting the function automatically build the Liouvillian (in Lindblad form) for the system.; As of QuTiP 3.2, the direct and power methods can take advantage of the Intel Pardiso LU solver in the Intel Math Kernel library that comes with the Anacoda (2.5+) and Intel",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/guide-steady.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/guide-steady.html

The output, labeled as rho_ss, is the steady-state solution for the systems. If no other keywords are passed to the solver, the default ‘direct’ method is used, generating a solution that is exact to machine precision at the expense of a large memory requirement. The large amount of memory need for the direct LU decomposition method stems from the large bandwidth of the system Liouvillian and the correspondingly large fill-in (extra nonzero elements) generated in the LU factors. This fill-in can be reduced by using bandwidth minimization algorithms such as those discussed in Additional Solver Arguments. However, in most cases, the default fill-in reducing algorithm is nearly optimal. Additional parameters may be used by calling the steady-state solver as:; rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops, method='power', use_rcm=True). where method='power' indicates that we are using the inverse-power solution method, and use_rcm=True turns on a bandwidth minimization routine.; Although it is not obvious, the 'direct', eigen, and 'power' methods all use an LU decomposition internally and thus suffer from a large memory overhead.

The function qutip.steadystate.steadystate can take either a Hamiltonian and a list of collapse operators as input, generating internally the corresponding Liouvillian super operator in Lindblad form, or alternatively, a Liouvillian passed by the user. When possible, we recommend passing the Hamiltonian and collapse operators to qutip.steadystate.steadystate, and letting the function automatically build the Liouvillian (in Lindblad form) for the system.; As of QuTiP 3.2, the direct and power methods can take advantage of the Intel Pardiso LU solver in the Intel Math Kernel library that comes with the Anacoda (2.5+) and Intel Python distributions. This gives a substantial increase in performance compared with the standard SuperLU method used by SciPy. To verify that QuTiP can find the necessary libraries, one can check for INTEL MKL Ext: True in the QuTiP about box (qutip.about). Using the Steadystate Solver¶; Solving for the steady state solution to the Lindblad master equation for a general system with qutip.steadystate.steadystate can be accomplished using:; >>> rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops). where H is a quantum object representing the system Hamiltonian, and c_ops is a list of quantum objects for the system collapse operators. The output, labeled as rho_ss, is the steady-state solution for the systems. If no other keywords are passed to the solver, the default ‘direct’ method is used, generating a solution that is exact to machine precision at the expense of a large memory requirement. The large amount of memory need for the direct LU decomposition method stems from the large bandwidth of the system Liouvillian and the correspondingly large fill-in (extra nonzero elements) ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/guide-steady.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/guide-steady.html

Solving for Steady-State Solutions¶. Important; Updated in QuTiP 3.2. Introduction¶; For time-independent open quantum systems with decay rates larger than the corresponding excitation rates, the system will tend toward a steady state as \(t\rightarrow\infty\) that satisfies the equation. \[\frac{d\hat{\rho}_{ss}}{dt}=\mathcal{L}\hat{\rho}_{ss}=0.\]; Although the requirement for time-independence seems quite resitrictive, one can often employ a transformation to the interaction picture that yields a time-independent Hamiltonian. For many these systems, solving for the asymptotic density matrix \(\hat{\rho}_{ss}\) can be achieved using direct or iterative solution methods faster than using master equation or Monte Carlo simulations. Although the steady state equation has a simple mathematical form, the properties of the Liouvillian operator are such that the solutions to this equation are anything but straightforward to find. Steady State solvers in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, the steady-state solution for a system Hamiltonian or Liouvillian is given by qutip.steadystate.steadystate. This function implements a number of different methods for finding the steady state, each with their own pros and cons, where the method used can be chosen using the method keyword argument.

Quantum process tomography¶; Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a useful technique for characterizing experimental implementations of quantum gates involving a small number of qubits. It can also be a useful theoretical tool that can give insight in how a process transforms states, and it can be used for example to study how noise or other imperfections deteriorate a gate. Whereas a fidelity or distance measure can give a single number that indicates how far from ideal a gate is, a quantum process tomography analysis can give detailed information about exactly what kind of errors various imperfections introduce.; The idea is to construct a transformation matrix for a quantum process (for example a quantum gate) that describes how the density matrix of a system is transformed by the process. We can then decompose the transformation in some operator basis that represent well-defined and easily interpreted transformations of the input states.; To see how this works (see e.g. [Moh08] for more details), consider a process that is described by quantum map \(\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out}\), which can be written. (1)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix).

Visualization of quantum states and processes¶; Visualization is often an important complement to a simulation of a quantum; mechanical system. The first method of visualization that come to mind might be; to plot the expectation values of a few selected operators. But on top of that,; it can often be instructive to visualize for example the state vectors or; density matices that describe the state of the system, or how the state is; transformed as a function of time (see process tomography below). In this; section we demonstrate how QuTiP and matplotlib can be used to perform a few; types of visualizations that often can provide additional understanding of; quantum system. Fock-basis probability distribution¶; In quantum mechanics probability distributions plays an important role, and as; in statistics, the expectation values computed from a probability distribution; does not reveal the full story. For example, consider an quantum harmonic; oscillator mode with Hamiltonian \(H = \hbar\omega a^\dagger a\), which is; in a state described by its density matrix \(\rho\), and which on average; is occupied by two photons, \(\mathrm{Tr}[\rho a^\dagger a] = 2\). Given; this information we cannot say whether the oscillator is in a Fock state,; a thermal state, a coherent state, etc. By visualizing the photon distribution; in the Fock state basis important clues about the underlying state can be; obtained.; One convenient way to visualize a probability distribution is to use histograms.; Consider the following histogram visualization of the number-basis probability; distribut",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/guide-visualization.html
Security,access,access,"terpreted transformations of the input states.; To see how this works (see e.g. [Moh08] for more details), consider a process that is described by quantum map \(\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out}\), which can be written. (1)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix). Given an orthogonal operator basis of our choice \(\{B_i\}_i^{N^2}\), which satisfies \({\rm Tr}[B_i^\dagger B_j] = N\delta_{ij}\), we can write the map as. (2)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger.\]; where \(\chi_{mn} = \sum_{ij} b_{im}b_{jn}^*\) and \(A_i = \sum_{m} b_{im}B_{m}\). Here, matrix \(\chi\) is the transformation matrix we are after, since it describes how much \(B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger\) contributes to \(\rho_{\rm out}\).; In a numerical simulation of a quantum process we usually do not have access to the quantum map in the form Eq. (1). Instead, what we usually can do is to calculate the propagator \(U\) for the density matrix in superoperator form, using for example the QuTiP function qutip.propagator.propagator. We can then write. \[\epsilon(\tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}) = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = \tilde{\rho}_{\rm out}\]; where \(\tilde{\rho}\) is the vector representation of the density matrix \(\rho\). If we write Eq. (2) in superoperator form as well we obtain. \[\tilde{\rho}_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}.\]; so we can identify. \[U = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger.\]; Now this is a linear equation systems for the \(N^2 \times N^2\) elements in \(\chi\). We can solve it by writing \(\chi\) and the superoperator propagator as \([N^4]\) vectors, and likewise write the superoperator product \(\tilde{B}_m\tilde{B}_n^\dagger\) as a \([N^4\times N^4]\) matrix \(",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/guide-visualization.html

It starts from a combined system-environment perspective, and derives a perturbative master equation for the system alone, under the assumption of weak system-environment coupling. One advantage of this approach is that the dissipation processes and rates are obtained directly from the properties of the environment. On the downside, it does not intrinsically guarantee that the resulting master equation unconditionally preserves the physical properties of the density matrix (because it is a perturbative method). The Bloch-Redfield master equation must therefore be used with care, and the assumptions made in the derivation must be honored. (The Lindblad master equation is in a sense more robust – it always results in a physical density matrix – although some collapse operators might not be physically justified). For a full derivation of the Bloch Redfield master equation, see e.g. [Coh92] or [Bre02]. Here we present only a brief version of the derivation, with the intention of introducing the notation and how it relates to the implementation in QuTiP. Brief Derivation and Definitions¶; The starting point of the Bloch-Redfield formalism is the total Hamiltonian for the system and the environment (bath): \(H = H_{\rm S} + H_{\rm B} + H_{\rm I}\), where \(H\) is the total system+bath Hamiltonian, \(H_{\rm S}\) and \(H_{\rm B}\) are the system and bath Hamiltonians, respectively, and \(H_{\rm I}\) is",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html
Deployability,integrat,integration,"ho_B\). This assumption is known as the Born approximation, and it implies that there never is any entanglement between the system and the bath, neither in the initial state nor at any time during the evolution. It is justified for weak system-bath interaction.; The master equation (1) is non-Markovian, i.e., the change in the density matrix at a time \(t\) depends on states at all times \(\tau < t\), making it intractable to solve both theoretically and numerically. To make progress towards a manageable master equation, we now introduce the Markovian approximation, in which \(\rho(s)\) is replaced by \(\rho(t)\) in Eq. (1). The result is the Redfield equation. (2)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^t d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]],\]; which is local in time with respect the density matrix, but still not Markovian since it contains an implicit dependence on the initial state. By extending the integration to infinity and substituting \(\tau \rightarrow t-\tau\), a fully Markovian master equation is obtained:. (3)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^\infty d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(t-\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]].\]; The two Markovian approximations introduced above are valid if the time-scale with which the system dynamics changes is large compared to the time-scale with which correlations in the bath decays (corresponding to a “short-memory” bath, which results in Markovian system dynamics).; The master equation (3) is still on a too general form to be suitable for numerical implementation. We therefore assume that the system-bath interaction takes the form \(H_I = \sum_\alpha A_\alpha \otimes B_\alpha\) and where \(A_\alpha\) are system operators and \(B_\alpha\) are bath operators. This allows us to write master equation in terms of system operators and bath correlation functions:. \[\begin{split}\frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) =; -\hbar^{-2}; \sum_{\alpha\beta}; \int_0^\infty d\tau\;; \left\{; g_{\alpha\beta}(\",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html

Note; New in QuTiP 4.2. Warning; It takes ~3-5 seconds (~30 if using Visual Studio) to compile a time-dependent Bloch-Redfield problem. Therefore,; if you are doing repeated simulations by varying parameters, then it is best to pass; options = Options(rhs_reuse=True) to the solver. If you have not done so already, please read the section: Solving Problems with Time-dependent Hamiltonians.; As we have already discussed, the Bloch-Redfield master equation requires transforming into the eigenbasis of the system Hamiltonian. For time-independent systems, this transformation need only be done once. However, for time-dependent systems, one must move to the instantaneous eigenbasis at each time-step in the evolution, thus greatly increasing the computational complexity of the dynamics. In addition, the requirement for computing all the eigenvalues severely limits the scalability of the method. Fortunately, this eigen decomposition occurs at the Hamiltonian level, as opposed to the super-operator level, and thus, with efficient programming, one can tackle many systems that are commonly encountered.; The time-dependent Bloch-Redfield solver in QuTiP relies on the efficient numerical computations afforded by the string-based time-dependent format, and Cython compilation. As such, all the time-dependent terms, and noise power spectra must be expressed in the string format. To begin, lets consider the previous example, but formatted to call the time-dependent solver:; In [18]: ohmic = ""{gamma1} / 2.0 * (w / (2 * pi)) * (w > 0.0)"".format(gamma1=gamma1).

Although the problem itself is time-independent, the use of a string as the noise power spectrum tells the solver to go into time-dependent mode. The string is nearly identical to the Python function format, except that we replaced np.pi with pi to avoid calling Python in our Cython code, and we have hard coded the gamma1 argument into the string as limitations prevent passing arguments into the time-dependent Bloch-Redfield solver.; For actual time-dependent Hamiltonians, the Hamiltonian itself can be passed into the solver like any other string-based Hamiltonian, as thus we will not discuss this topic further. Instead, here the focus is on time-dependent bath coupling terms. To this end, suppose that we have a dissipative harmonic oscillator, where the white-noise dissipation rate decreases exponentially with time \(\kappa(t) = \kappa(0)\exp(-t)\). In the Lindblad or monte-carlo solvers, this could be implemented as a time-dependent collapse operator list c_ops = [[a, 'sqrt(kappa*exp(-t))']].

Bloch-Redfield master equation¶. Introduction¶; The Lindblad master equation introduced earlier is constructed so that it describes a physical evolution of the density matrix (i.e., trace and positivity preserving), but it does not provide a connection to any underlaying microscopic physical model. The Lindblad operators (collapse operators) describe phenomenological processes, such as for example dephasing and spin flips, and the rates of these processes are arbitrary parameters in the model. In many situations the collapse operators and their corresponding rates have clear physical interpretation, such as dephasing and relaxation rates, and in those cases the Lindblad master equation is usually the method of choice.; However, in some cases, for example systems with varying energy biases and eigenstates and that couple to an environment in some well-defined manner (through a physically motivated system-environment interaction operator), it is often desirable to derive the master equation from more fundamental physical principles, and relate it to for example the noise-power spectrum of the environment.; The Bloch-Redfield formalism is one such approach to derive a master equation from a microscopic system. It starts from a combined system-environment perspective, and derives a perturbative master equation for the system alone, under the assumption of weak system-environment coupling. One advantage of this approach is that the dissipation processes and rates are obtained directly from the properties of the environment. On the downside, it does not intrinsically guarantee that the result",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html

State vectors, or density matrices, as well as col_times and col_which, are accessed in a similar manner, although typically one does not need an index (i.e [0]) since there is only one list for each of these components. The one exception to this rule is if you choose to output state vectors from the Monte Carlo solver, in which case there are ntraj number of state vector arrays. Saving and Loading Result Objects¶; The main advantage in using the Result class as a data storage object comes from the simplicity in which simulation data can be stored and later retrieved. The qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload functions are designed for this task. To begin, let us save the data object from the previous section into a file called “cavity+qubit-data” in the current working directory by calling:; >>> qsave(result, 'cavity+qubit-data'). All of the data results are then stored in a single file of the same name with a “.qu” extension. Therefore, everything needed to later this data is stored in a single file. Loading the file is just as easy as saving:; >>> stored_result = qload('cavity+qubit-data'); Loaded Result object:; Result object with mcsolve data.; ---------------------------------; expect = True; num_expect = 2, num_collapse = 2, ntraj = 500. where stored_result is the new name of the Result object. We can then extract the data and plot in the same manner as before:; expt0 = stored_result.expect[0]; expt1 = stored_result.expect[1]; times = stored_result.times; plot(times, expt0, times, expt1); show().

Modifiability,coupling,coupling,"pendent due to the driving. In such cases a rigorious approach would be to take the driving into account when deriving the master equation. This can be done in many different ways, but one way common approach is to derive the master equation in the Floquet basis. That approach results in the so-called Floquet-Markov master equation, see Grifoni et al., Physics Reports 304, 299 (1998) for details. The Floquet-Markov master equation in QuTiP¶; The QuTiP function qutip.floquet.fmmesolve implements the Floquet-Markov master equation. It calculates the dynamics of a system given its initial state, a time-dependent hamiltonian, a list of operators through which the system couples to its environment and a list of corresponding spectral-density functions that describes the environment. In contrast to the qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, and the qutip.floquet.fmmesolve does characterize the environment with dissipation rates, but extract the strength of the coupling to the environment from the noise spectral-density functions and the instantaneous Hamiltonian parameters (similar to the Bloch-Redfield master equation solver qutip.bloch_redfield.brmesolve). Note; Currently the qutip.floquet.fmmesolve can only accept a single environment coupling operator and spectral-density function. The noise spectral-density function of the environment is implemented as a Python callback function that is passed to the solver. For example:; >>> gamma1 = 0.1; >>> def noise_spectrum(omega):; >>> return 0.5 * gamma1 * omega/(2*pi). The other parameters are similar to the qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, and the same format for the return value is used qutip.solver.Result. The following example extends the example studied above, and uses qutip.floquet.fmmesolve to introduce dissipation into the calculation; from qutip import *; from scipy import *. delta = 0.0 * 2*pi; eps0 = 1.0 * 2*pi; A = 0.25 * 2*pi; omega = 1.0 * 2*pi; T = (2*pi)/omega; tlist = linspace(0.0, 20 * T, 101); psi0 = basis(2,0).

Availability,error,errors," are on the order of a couple of hundred states or smaller.; Like the master equation solver qutip.mesolve, the Monte Carlo solver returns a qutip.solver.Result object consisting of expectation values, if the user has defined expectation value operators in the 5th argument to mcsolve, or state vectors if no expectation value operators are given. If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively. Changing the Number of Trajectories¶; As mentioned earlier, by default, the mcsolve function runs 500 trajectories. This value was chosen because it gives good accuracy, Monte Carlo errors scale as \(1/n\) where \(n\) is the number of trajectories, and simultaneously does not take an excessive amount of time to run.

The Monte Carlo solver also has many available options that can be set using the qutip.solver.Options class as discussed in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Reusing Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. In order to solve a given simulation as fast as possible, the solvers in QuTiP take the given input operators and break them down into simpler components before passing them on to the ODE solvers. Although these operations are reasonably fast, the time spent organizing data can become appreciable when repeatedly solving a system over, for example, many different initial conditions. In cases such as this, the Hamiltonian and other operators may be reused after the initial configuration, thus speeding up calculations. Note that, unless you are planning to reuse the data many times, this functionality will not be very useful.; To turn on the “reuse” functionality we must set the rhs_reuse=True flag in the qutip.solver.Options:; In [21]: options = Options(rhs_reuse=True). A full account of this feature is given in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. Using the previous example, we will calculate the dynamics for two different initial states, with the Hamiltonian data being reused on the second call; In [22]: times = np.linspace(0.0, 10.0, 200). In [23]: psi0 = tensor(fock(2, 0), fock(10, 5)). In [24]: a = tensor(qeye(2), destroy(10)). In [25]: sm = tensor(destroy(2), qeye(10)).

The corresponding collapse operator \(C_{n}\) is chosen such that \(n\) is the smallest integer satisfying:. (5)¶\[\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{n}(\tau) \ge r\]; where the individual \(P_{n}\) are given by Eq. (4). Note that the left hand side of Eq. (5) is, by definition, normalized to unity. IV: Using the renormalized state from step III as the new initial condition at time \(\tau\), draw a new random number, and repeat the above procedure until the final simulation time is reached. Monte Carlo in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, Monte Carlo evolution is implemented with the qutip.mcsolve function. It takes nearly the same arguments as the qutip.mesolve; function for master-equation evolution, except that the initial state must be a ket vector, as oppose to a density matrix, and there is an optional keyword parameter ntraj that defines the number of stochastic trajectories to be simulated. By default, ntraj=500 indicating that 500 Monte Carlo trajectories will be performed.; To illustrate the use of the Monte Carlo evolution of quantum systems in QuTiP, let’s again consider the case of a two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity. The only differences to the master-equation treatment is that in this case we invoke the qutip.mcsolve function instead of qutip.mesolve; In [1]: times = np.linspace(0.0, 10.0, 200). In [2]: psi0 = tensor(fock(2, 0), fock(10, 5)). In [3]: a = tensor(qeye(2), destroy(10)). In [4]: sm = tensor(destroy(2), qeye(10)). In [5]: H = 2 * np.pi * a.dag() * a + 2 * np.pi * sm.dag() * sm + 2 * np.pi * 0.25 * (sm * a.dag() + sm.dag() * a).

Usability,simpl,simply,"r state vectors if no expectation value operators are given. If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively. Changing the Number of Trajectories¶; As mentioned earlier, by default, the mcsolve function runs 500 trajectories. This value was chosen because it gives good accuracy, Monte Carlo errors scale as \(1/n\) where \(n\) is the number of trajectories, and simultaneously does not take an excessive amount of time to run. However, like many other options in QuTiP you are free to change the number of trajectories to fit your needs. If we want to run 1000 trajectories in the above example, we can simply modify the call to mcsolve like:; In [14]: data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [np.sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm], ntraj=1000); 10.0%.

Permutational Invariance¶. Permutational Invariant Quantum Solver (PIQS)¶; The Permutational Invariant Quantum Solver (PIQS) is a QuTiP module that allows to study the dynamics of an open quantum system consisting of an ensemble of identical qubits that can dissipate through local and collective baths according to a Lindblad master equation.; The Liouvillian of an ensemble of \(N\) qubits, or two-level systems (TLSs), \(\mathcal{D}_{TLS}(\rho)\), can be built using only polynomial – instead of exponential – resources.; This has many applications for the study of realistic quantum optics models of many TLSs and in general as a tool in cavity QED.; Consider a system evolving according to the equation. \[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\dot{\rho} = \mathcal{D}_\text{TLS}(\rho)=-\fr",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-piqs.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-piqs.html

The collective spin operators are \(J_{\alpha} = \sum_{n}J_{\alpha,n}\) . The Lindblad super-operators are \(\mathcal{L}_{A} = 2A\rho A^\dagger - A^\dagger A \rho - \rho A^\dagger A\).; The inclusion of local processes in the dynamics lead to using a Liouvillian space of dimension \(4^N\). By exploiting the permutational invariance of identical particles [2-8], the Liouvillian \(\mathcal{D}_\text{TLS}(\rho)\) can be built as a block-diagonal matrix in the basis of Dicke states \(|j, m \rangle\).; The system under study is defined by creating an object of the; Dicke class, e.g. simply named; system, whose first attribute is. system.N, the number of TLSs of the system \(N\). The rates for collective and local processes are simply defined as. collective_emission defines \(\gamma_\text{CE}\), collective (superradiant) emission; collective_dephasing defines \(\gamma_\text{CD}\), collective dephasing; collective_pumping defines \(\gamma_\text{CP}\), collective pumping.; emission defines \(\gamma_\text{E}\), incoherent emission (losses); dephasing defines \(\gamma_\text{D}\), local dephasing; pumping defines \(\gamma_\text{P}\), incoherent pumping. Then the system.lindbladian() creates the total TLS Lindbladian superoperator matrix. Similarly, system.hamiltonian defines the TLS hamiltonian of the system \(H_\text{TLS}\).; The system’s Liouvillian can be built using system.liouvillian(). The properties of a Piqs object can be visualized by simply calling; system. We give two basic examples on the use of PIQS. In the first example the incoherent emission of N driven TLSs is considered.; fr",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-piqs.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-piqs.html

Availability,error,errors,"problems, or when simulating over long intervals.; Like the previous method, the string-based format uses a list pair format [Op, str] where str is now a string representing the time-dependent coefficient. For our first example, this string would be '9 * exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2)'. The Hamiltonian in this format would take the form:; In [42]: H = [H0, [H1, '9 * exp(-(t / 5) ** 2)']]. Notice that this is a valid Hamiltonian for the string-based format as exp is included in the above list of suitable functions. Calling the solvers is the same as before:; In [43]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, [a.dag() * a]). We can also use the args variable in the same manner as before, however we must rewrite our string term to read: 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)'; In [44]: H = [H0, [H1, 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)']]. In [45]: args = {'A': 9, 'sig': 5}. In [46]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag()*a], args=args). Important; Naming your args variables exp, sin, pi etc. will cause errors when using the string-based format. Collapse operators are handled in the exact same way. Modeling Non-Analytic and/or Experimental Time-Dependent Parameters using Interpolating Functions¶. Note; New in QuTiP 4.1. Sometimes it is necessary to model a system where the time-dependent parameters are non-analytic functions, or are derived from experimental data (i.e. a collection of data points). In these situations, one can use interpolating functions as an approximate functional form for input into a time-dependent solver. QuTiP includes it own custom cubic spline interpolation class qutip.interpolate.Cubic_Spline to provide this functionality. To see how this works, lets first generate some noisy data:; In [47]: t = np.linspace(-15, 15, 100). In [48]: func = lambda t: 9*np.exp(-(t / 5)** 2). In [49]: noisy_func = lambda t: func(t)+(0.05*func(t))*np.random.randn(t.shape[0]). In [50]: noisy_data = noisy_func(t). In [51]: plt.figure(); Out[51]: <Figure size 640x480 with 0 Axes>.

Of course, we can always hardcode the values in the dictionary as well args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}, but there is much more flexibility by using variables in args. To let the solvers know that we have a set of args to pass we append the args to the end of the solver input:; In [39]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args={'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}). or to keep things looking pretty; In [40]: args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}. In [41]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args=args). Once again, the Monte Carlo solver qutip.mcsolve works in an identical manner. String Format Method¶. Note; You must have Cython installed on your computer to use this format. See Installation for instructions on installing Cython. The string-based time-dependent format works in a similar manner as the previously discussed Python function method. That being said, the underlying code does something completely different. When using this format, the strings used to represent the time-dependent coefficients, as well as Hamiltonian and collapse operators, are rewritten as Cython code using a code generator class and then compiled into C code. The details of this meta-programming will be published in due course. however, in short, this can lead to a substantial reduction in time for complex time-dependent problems, or when simulating over long intervals.; Like the previous method, the string-based format uses a list pair format [Op, str] where str is now a string representing the time-dependent coefficient. For our first example, this string would be '9 * exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2)'. The Hamiltonian in this format would take the form",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html
Energy Efficiency,efficient,efficient,"ring] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients are represented as strings. The resulting Hamiltonian is then compiled into C code using Cython and executed.; Array Based: The Hamiltonian and/or collapse operators are expressed as a list of [qobj, np.array] pairs. The arrays are 1 dimensional and dtype are complex or float. They must contain one value for each time in the tlist given to the solver. Cubic spline interpolation will be used between the given times.; Hamiltonian function (outdated): The Hamiltonian is itself a Python function with time-dependence. Collapse operators must be time independent using this input format. Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose?; In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general,; allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions.; However, by automatically compiling your system into C++ code,; the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster; [This is also the only format that is supported in the qutip.brmesolve solver].; Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor.; Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of,; it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter.; Time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions,; or combinations thereof (including constants) can be compiled directly into C++-code:; 'abs', 'acos', 'acosh', 'arg', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atanh', 'conj',; 'cos', 'cosh','exp', 'erf', 'zerf', 'imag', 'log', 'log10', 'norm', 'pi',; 'proj', 'real', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh'.

Methods for Writing Time-Dependent Operators¶; In the previous examples of quantum evolution,; we assumed that the systems under consideration were described by time-independent Hamiltonians.; However, many systems have explicit time dependence in either the Hamiltonian,; or the collapse operators describing coupling to the environment, and sometimes both components might depend on time.; The time-evolutions solvers; qutip.mesolve, qutip.mcsolve, qutip.sesolve, qutip.brmesolve; qutip.ssesolve, qutip.photocurrent_sesolve, qutip.smesolve, and qutip.photocurrent_mesolve; are all capable of handling time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse terms.; There are, in general, three different ways to implement time-dependent problems in QuTiP:. Function based: Hamiltonian / collapse operators expressed using [qobj, func] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients of the Hamiltonian (or collapse operators) are expressed using Python functions.; String (Cython) based: The Hamiltonian and/or collapse operators are expressed as a list of [qobj, string] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients are represented as strings. The resulting Hamiltonian is then compiled into C code using Cython and executed.; Array Based: The Hamiltonian and/or collapse operators are expressed as a list ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html
Safety,avoid,avoid,"interpolation function is compiled into c-code, and thus is quite fast. This is the default method if no other time-dependent terms are present. Accesing the state from solver¶; New in QuTiP 4.4; The state of the system, the ket vector or the density matrix,; is available to time-dependent Hamiltonian and collapse operators in args.; Some keys of the argument dictionary are understood by the solver to be values; to be updated with the evolution of the system.; The state can be obtained in 3 forms: Qobj, vector (1d np.array), matrix (2d np.array),; expectation values and collapse can also be obtained.; Here psi0 is the initial value used for tests before the evolution begins.; qutip.brmesolve does not support these arguments. Reusing Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. When repeatedly simulating a system where only the time-dependent variables, or initial state change, it is possible to reuse the Hamiltonian data stored in QuTiP and there by avoid spending time needlessly preparing the Hamiltonian and collapse terms for simulation. To turn on the the reuse features, we must pass a qutip.Options object with the rhs_reuse flag turned on. Instructions on setting flags are found in Setting Options for the Dynamics Solvers. For example, we can do; In [61]: H = [H0, [H1, 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)']]. In [62]: args = {'A': 9, 'sig': 5}. In [63]: output = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag()*a], args=args); 10.0%.

Testability,log,log,"ependence. Collapse operators must be time independent using this input format. Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose?; In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general,; allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions.; However, by automatically compiling your system into C++ code,; the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster; [This is also the only format that is supported in the qutip.brmesolve solver].; Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor.; Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of,; it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter.; Time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions,; or combinations thereof (including constants) can be compiled directly into C++-code:; 'abs', 'acos', 'acosh', 'arg', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atanh', 'conj',; 'cos', 'cosh','exp', 'erf', 'zerf', 'imag', 'log', 'log10', 'norm', 'pi',; 'proj', 'real', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh'. In addition, QuTiP supports cubic spline based interpolation functions [Modeling Non-Analytic and/or Experimental Time-Dependent Parameters using Interpolating Functions].; If you require mathematical functions other than those listed above,; it is possible to call any of the functions in the NumPy library using the prefix np.; before the function name in the string, i.e 'np.sin(t)' and scipy.special imported as spe.; This includes a wide range of functionality, but comes with a small overhead created by going from C++->Python->C++.; Finally option #4, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function,; is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x.; However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods.; However, in contrast to the other options; this method can be use",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

In [13]: c_ops.append(np.sqrt(5*gamma/9) * sigma_ue) # Use Rb branching ratio of 5/9 e->u. In [14]: c_ops.append(np.sqrt(4*gamma/9) * sigma_ge) # 4/9 e->g. In [15]: t = np.linspace(-15, 15, 100) # Define time vector. In [16]: psi0 = tensor(basis(N, 0), ustate) # Define initial state. In [17]: state_GG = tensor(basis(N, 1), ground) # Define states onto which to project. In [18]: sigma_GG = state_GG * state_GG.dag(). In [19]: state_UU = tensor(basis(N, 0), ustate). In [20]: sigma_UU = state_UU * state_UU.dag(). In [21]: g = 5 # coupling strength. In [22]: H0 = -g * (sigma_ge.dag() * a + a.dag() * sigma_ge) # time-independent term. In [23]: H1 = (sigma_ue.dag() + sigma_ue) # time-dependent term. Given that we have a single time-dependent Hamiltonian term, and constant collapse terms, we need to specify a single Python function for the coefficient \(f(t)\). In this case, one can simply do; In [24]: def H1_coeff(t, args):; ....: return 9 * np.exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2); ....: . In this case, the return value dependents only on time. However, when specifying Python functions for coefficients, the function must have (t,args) as the input variables, in that order. Having specified our coefficient function, we can now specify the Hamiltonian in list format and call the solver (in this case qutip.mesolve); In [25]: H = [H0,[H1,H1_coeff]]. In [26]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, [ada, sigma_UU, sigma_GG]). We can call the Monte Carlo solver in the exact same way (if using the default ntraj=500):; In [27]: output = mcsolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, [ada, sigma_UU, sigma_GG]); 10.0%. Run time: 0.25s.
