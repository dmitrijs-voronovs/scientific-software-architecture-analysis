How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. >>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner. Issue make VERBOSE=1 to display the full; compilation commands and errors. How to highlight git merge conflicts in vi¶; Edit your ~/.vimrc file to include the lines below. Hitting the F7; key will toggle highlighting of git’s conflict markers.; >>> cat ~/.vimrc; set hlsearch; map ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_planning.html
https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_planning.html:52553,Performance,queue,queue,52553,". Some of these libraries may not be found correctly. How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; >>> ctest -L smoke -j`getc",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_planning.html

How to see CTest testing errors¶; >>> ctest; Test project /your/path/2/psi4/build/directory/tests; Start 248: tu1-h2o-energy; 1/2 Test #248: tu1-h2o-energy ................... Passed 1.73 sec; Start 6: cc1; 2/2 Test #6: cc1 ..............................***Failed 0.07 sec; ... When ctest reports that some (or all) tests have failed, look in your; build directory for file; objdir/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log. It may have a; .tmp extension, depending on whether the last test was interrupted and; a few other factors. Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation. From the executable; # smoke tests only in serial; psi4 --test; # smoke tests only in parallel; psi4 --test -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; # most tests; psi4 --test full. From the library (PSI4 must be detectable as a Python; module. See setup at How to configure paths for PsiAPI; if needed.); # smoke tests only; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test('smoke')""; # most tests; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test()"". From pytest directly. If package pytest-xdist is installed, can run in parallel.; # smoke tests only; pytest {prefix}/lib/{PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/psi4/tests/ -m smoke -n auto; # all tests; pytest {prefix}/lib/{PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/psi4/tests/ -n auto.

Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself .; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4.

And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn. This should; re-clone the Add-On, rebuild and install it, rebuild any parts of; PSI4 that interface to it, and relink the main core.so.; If you’re modifying the Add-On’s file or directory structure, be; smart and rm all traces of it within {objdir}/stage/,; especially any *.pyc files.; Alternatively and preferentially to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the PSI4 repository. This; is especially useful if you want to avoid full recompiles of the; Add-On at each change to the Add-On’s source. Build the Add-On; library dynamically (-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON) and mind any; “Psi4 wants” in the Add-On’s top-level CMakeLists.txt. Install the; Add-On and note the full path to AddOnConfig.cmake. Pass; the path containing that file to PSI4‘s CMake as; -DAddon_DIR=/path/to/config/usually/ending/in/share/cmake/AddON; and build PSI4. The main core.so should be dynamically linked; to your dev AddOn dynamic lib and update automatically when you rebuild; the AddOn lib. Naturally, you may need to delete core.so and remake; as needed. How to use logging in Psi4¶; A log file is generated alongside the output file and has extension; .log. Selected key information is sent to it. The log file contents; are provisional and haphazard, so don’t start relying upon them. It is; tentatively envisioned that log files will have much of the same results as output; files but more as structured data than narrative, nicely formatted data.; In some c",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_planning.html

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.9.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always n",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_planning.html

What C and C++ compilers and versions are approved¶; On Linux, the following work nicely. GNU: gcc, g++; Intel: icc, icpc; Clang: clang, clang++. On Mac, the following work nicely. Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++20 compliance.; This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers on Linux also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked.; Intel OneAPI Classic compilers work fine, as do OneAPI Clang icpx compilers. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_o",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_planning.html

How to get a Psi4 logo file¶; All image files are stored in https://github.com/psi4/psi4media. How to use a local Add-On repository in the Psi4 build¶; For each Add-On, PSI4 pulls source from a specific online Git; repository and a specific tag/branch/commit in it.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to configure a Psi4 build on Cray¶; Cray systems strongly prefer to build static libraries, but PSI4; needs to be dynamic to function as a Python module. Courtesy of @misha; at the forum and various supercomputer guides, building PSI4 on; Cray requires setting environment variables before running cmake.; CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes cmake ... CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE¶; Set to allow PSI4 to build as shared library on Cray supercomputers. CRAY_ADD_RPATH¶; Set to true to allow PSI4 to build on Cray supercomputers. How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies.

PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables.

The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.9.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable.

Capabilities and Alternate Implementations¶; Depending on the reference (e.g., RHF, UHF, ROHF), the integral treatment; (conventional CONV, density-fitted DF, and Cholesky-decomposed CD),; active orbitals, and derivative level, computational methods are; sometimes assembled from implementations by multiple coders. Conversely,; some capabilities may be implemented multiple times. Capabilities,; modules, algorithm types, and defaults are detailed for many ground-state; methods at Table Module Capabilities. Its; analogous summary table (with modules collapsed) is at Summary; Capabilities. PSI4 transparently selects the; most efficient implementation, so one generally needn’t consult this; table. However, to understand the details of what combinations are; accessible or what alternate implementations are available, read on.; Note that HF, DFT, and MPn (n<=3); default to density-fitted integrals, while all higher methods default to; conventional integrals.

Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation; Complete Basis Set. Complete Basis Set¶. Code author: Lori A. Burns, Daniel G. A. Smith and Peter Kraus; Section author: Lori A. Burns and Peter Kraus; The psi4.driver.cbs() function described below is; powerful but complicated, requiring many options. For most common; calculations, a shorthand can be accessed directly though; psi4.driver.energy(), psi4.driver.gradient(), etc. For example,; a MP2 single-point DT extrapolation can be accessed through the first item; below more conveniently than the equivalent second or third items. energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'); energy(""cbs"", corl_wfn='mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z'); energy(""cbs"", cbs_metadata=[{""wfn"": ""hf"", ""basis"": ""cc-pvtz""}, {""wfn"": ""mp2"", ""basis"": ""cc-pv[dt]z"", ""scheme"": ""corl_xtpl_helgaker_2""}]).

For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems.

Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd codes. A value of LOW selects a “low priority” scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities. A value of LRU selects a “least recently used” scheme in which the oldest item in the cache will be the first one deleted. Type: string; Possible Values: LOW, LRU; Default: LOW. NUM_AMPS_PRINT¶.

Do print the MP2 amplitudes which are the starting guesses for RHF and UHF reference functions?. Type: boolean; Default: false. Larger Calculations¶; Here are a few recommendations for carrying out large-basis-set coupled; cluster calculations with PSI4:. In most cases it is reasonable to set the memory keyword to 90% of; the available physical memory, at most. There is a small amount of overhead; associated with the; coupled cluster modules that is not accounted for by the internal CC memory; handling routines. Thus, the user should not specify the entire; physical memory of the system, or swapping is likely. However, for especially large; calculations, it is better to set the memory keyword to a value less than 16 GB.; Set the CACHELEVEL keyword to 0.; This will turn off cacheing, which, for very large calculations, can; lead to heap fragmentation and memory faults, even when sufficient; physical memory exists.; Set the PRINT keyword to 2.

To preferentially use your own GENBAS,; place it in PATH or PSIPATH. The line calling; energy() with argument 'cfour' invokes; xcfour.; After execution of the energy('cfour') line completes, Cfour results; are read back into PSI4 format and are thereafter accessible for; further processing in the input file. See Output for; details. This storage of results in variables and arrays in memory for; the duration of the PSI4 instance (as opposed to solely in files); is the only advantage thus far incurred by the P4C4 interface. We’ll call; this mode of basic utility the “sandwich” mode.; Molecule specification in PSI4 allows Cartesians, Z-matrices, mixed; Cartesian/Z-matrix, negation of variables, delayed specification of; variables, specification of fragments, etc., all in a whitespace-tolerant; format.

All of these features are available to Cfour by; using the BASIS keyword instead of CFOUR_BASIS; (accompanied, of course, by specifying the molecule PSI4-style).; Internally, PSI4 processes the basis set as usual, then translates; the basis set format and writes out a GENBAS file with an entry for; each atom.

Specification Details¶; The above narrative introduction to the P4C4 interface should be; sufficient to get started. Issues of competition between PSI4 and; Cfour specification format are generally resolved behind the scenes:; not according to a simple rule but according to sensible, sometimes; intricate, rules governed by user intent (and integration of Cfour to; behave like a PSI4 module). Much can be gleaned by just running; inputs and inspecting the ZMAT passed to Cfour, but when questions; arise, here are the specifics, the governing laws. Specifying a piece of input in PSI4 format is entering into; a contract that you mean it. In particular this applies to; molecule (including charge/multiplicity through molecule; optional_molecule_name {...}), memory (through memory; value unit), computational method (through . If Cfour keywords; are specified with values that contradict the PSI4 input,; execution is halted.; As an example, the input below is set up to fail in four ways:; contradictory specification of memory, multiplicity, computational; method, and derivative level.

Misc. Running¶; Naturally, in PSI4 multiple jobs can be run in succession from the input file.; Control optimizations with optking keywords HERE. Cfour GRD file is; written to PSI4 output file. Gradient transformed back into the frame; in which it was shipped off to Cfour is also written to the PSI4; output file and is available from input as gradient().; sandwich mode := molecule and cfour list within; Naturally, additional jobs can follow in the input file.; Depending on the nature of preceding or following jobs, it is prudent to; separate them with the following:; clean() # removes Psi4 scratch files; clean_variables() # empties the PSI variables list; cfour {} # empties. In this scheme, the contents of the cfour {...} block are tacked onto; the end of the ZMAT file that is otherwise written from psi style; format. It is by this route that, for example %excite* sections can at; present be specified.; The execution of xcfour can be modified by a few parameters. Setting; the option CFOUR_OMP_NUM_THREADS sets the environment variable; OMP_NUM_THREADS for only the duration of the Cfour computation.; That is, portions of an input file that run PSI4 modules are; unaffected.

Issues of competition between PSI4 and; Cfour specification format are generally resolved behind the scenes:; not according to a simple rule but according to sensible, sometimes; intricate, rules governed by user intent (and integration of Cfour to; behave like a PSI4 module). Much can be gleaned by just running; inputs and inspecting the ZMAT passed to Cfour, but when questions; arise, here are the specifics, the governing laws. Specifying a piece of input in PSI4 format is entering into; a contract that you mean it. In particular this applies to; molecule (including charge/multiplicity through molecule; optional_molecule_name {...}), memory (through memory; value unit), computational method (through . If Cfour keywords; are specified with values that contradict the PSI4 input,; execution is halted.; As an example, the input below is set up to fail in four ways:; contradictory specification of memory, multiplicity, computational; method, and derivative level.

Specifying anything in PSI4 format (molecule, basis, options,; method call) starts building a *CFOUR(...) directive for the; ZMAT file. Since the contents of the cfour {...} block are; blindly appended to any input interpreted from PSI4 format, mixing; of PSI4 and Cfour input formats likely will give rise to multiple; *CFOUR(...) directives in the prospective ZMAT, execution of; which will be trapped and halted. Proper uses for the cfour {...}; block are for the sandwich mode, where the entire ZMAT is enclosed,; or for extra directives like %excite*, which presently have no other; specification route.; Specifying the basis is perhaps the regulated piece of input. Since; basis set names differ between PSI4 and Cfour and it’s not; practical to compare exponent-to-exponent, any input file with both; BASIS and CFOUR_BASIS keywords present will halt. Once; a basis set has been requested through BASIS, overriding the; default spherical/Cartesian setting must be done through; PUREAM (as opposed to CFOUR_SPHERICAL).; Specifying keywords that control geometry optimization is; straightforward. Unless the optimization is invoked in sandwich mode,; all Cfour optimization keywords (e.g., CFOUR_GEO_MAXCYC) are; ineffective, as the Cfour optimizer is never invoked. PSI4; optimization keywords (e.g., GEOM_MAXITER) instead fill; these roles.; Specifying the computational method (through, for instance,; energy('c4-ccsd') instead of energy('cfour')) often; sets additional keywords consistent with best practices (e.g.,; C",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/cfour.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/cfour.html

Specifying certain keywords that are nominally applicable for pure-PSI4 modules directs them to fulfil analogous roles; in the Cfour program (e.g., MAXITER is used to set; CFOUR_SCF_MAXCYC). This keyword translation only takes place; if the keywords are explicitly set in the input file (part of that; contract that you mean it), meaning that PSI4‘s defaults don’t; get imposed on Cfour. Also, in the case where a translatable pure-PSI4 keyword and its translation Cfour keyword are both set,; the value attached to the latter is always used.

Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples; PSI4 contains code to interface to the Cfour quantum chemistry suite of; John F. Stanton (U. Texas, Austin) and Jürgen Gauss (U. Mainz),; which is available after a license agreement from; http://www.cfour.de/. Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH. If PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error; will be reported. Caution; The p4c4 interface hasn’t been fully adapted for the new March 2014 version. Cfour for PSI4 Users¶. Set memory as usual; Set molecule as usual; Set basis set as usual (Cfour only cares about orbital basis, no fitting; bases); Set the task as usual, indicating Cfour as the intended code by; prepending “c4-” to the method argument. So energy('scf') becomes; energy('c4-scf') and optimize('ccsd(t)') becomes; optimize('c4-ccsd(t)').

(Though be aware that common; abbreviations like CALC and REF must be fully spelled out as; CFOUR_CALC_LEVEL and CFOUR_REFERENCE when used in; PSI4.); In limited trial cases, keywords nominally directed at non-Cfour modules; are translated into their Cfour counterparts.

In order to function; correctly, the Cfour executable xcfour must be present in; PATH or PSIPATH.

Here, note that none of capitalization, equals sign, or whitespace matter; for the keyword commands. Specification of strings and integers requires no; translation; booleans have extended freedom of; format; arrays must be translated into Python-style (square-bracket; bounded and comma delimited) of appropriate dimension. There are many; sample inputs in psi4/tests/cfour/ starting with sp- that take; examples from the Cfour manual and first run them in sandwich mode and; then run them as translated into PSI4 format. Note; PSI4 only recognizes keywords by their full name, so the common; Cfour keyword abbreviations CALC, REF, etc. must be replaced by their; proper names of CFOUR_CALC_LEVEL, CFOUR_REFERENCE, etc. Whenever the molecule is supplied in PSI4 format, it is possible to; perform geometry optimizations where Cfour supplies the gradient and the; PSI4 module optking drives the structural; changes. Because of the limitations on geometry specification for; optimizations in Cfour, optking-driven optimizations are the only; optimizations allowed in the P4C4 interface.

Warning; Because p4c4 does not inspect the contents of the cfour {...}; block, once the user specifies a PSI4-style molecule, the; interface cannot judge whether a sandwich mode (drop the PSI4 molecule; and use the cfour block as the entirety of the ZMAT) or a standard mode; (translate the PSI4 molecule and append additional input from the; cfour block) is intended. The latter is what actually occurs. If; there is both a PSI4 molecule and a molecule in the cfour block,; ZMAT will end up with multiple molecules and multiple *CFOUR(...); blocks, and it will not run. Therefore, if mixing sandwich and; standard or pure-PSI4 computations in an input file, place all; the sandwich jobs at the beginning before declaring PSI4; molecules. If necessary, clear the cfour block with cfour {} before; commencing standard P4C4 jobs.

Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples. Note; As of late June 2016, DMRG keywords in PSI4 have been; realigned with those of the chemps2 executable, plus a; “dmrg_” prefix. The only exceptions are the orbital space; PSI4 keywords RESTRICTED_DOCC (formerly; CheMPS2 used FROZEN_DOCC, contrary to its; definition) and ACTIVE which are passed along to; CheMPS2 keywords NOCC and NACT. A translation table; is available. Installation¶; Binary. CheMPS2 is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).; If using the PSI4 binary, CheMPS2 has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; CheMPS2 can be obtained through conda install chemps2.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect CheMPS2 and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove chemps2. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want CheMPS2 built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code.

The following commands will format only the files that have been; modified:. ::clang-format -style=file -i git diff –relative –name-only HEAD – *.cc *.h; yapf -i git diff –relative –name-only HEAD – *.py.

Code style conventions. Code style conventions¶; It is important to keep a consistent formatting of the C++ and Python code; to avoid hard-to-read diffs and merge conflicts.; clang-format and yapf can be used to format C++ and Python code,; respectively, according to a predefined style file.; PSI4 provides the psi4/.clang-format and psi4/.style.yapf files in the root; folder of the project.; It is recommended that modifications and/or new files checked into the; repository are formatted according to these style files using clang-format; and yapf. It is then helpful if these tools be part of your development toolchain.; Once clang-format and yapf are installed, there are three ways in which; formatting of the code can be accomplished, in decreasing order of automation:. By integrating the formatters into your editor.; By installing Git hooks to run the formatters when committing.; By running the formatters manually on the modified files. How to impose code style through your editor¶; Both clang-format and yapf can be integrated into widely used editors.; The Neoformat plugin can be configured; to format files when saving them to disk. How to impose code style through Git hooks¶; Git hooks are scripts that are run before or after certain Git events.; In this particular case, we want to make sure that all files that have been; added to the staging area with git add are formatted according to the style; before they committing them with git commit.; The hook to be modified is then the pre-commit hook.; PSI4 uses the pre-commit framework, with configuration file psi4/.pre-commit-config.yaml.; To take advantage of pre-commit hooks, you will need to install the pre-commit utility:. ::pip install pre-commit. or using Conda:. ::conda install pre_commit -c conda-forge. Finally, you need to install the actual hooks:. ::pre-commit install. Pre-commit hooks will be run on every ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/code_style.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/code_style.html

Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda. This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH.

Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals).

Isocontour range for 85% of the density: (0.0787495,-0.0787495). The second line reports the isocontour values that capture 85% of the probability density using; the least amount of grid points. This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option CUBEPROP_ISOCONTOUR_THRESHOLD. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals). DENSITYThis task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\r",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/cubeprop.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/cubeprop.html

BASIS_FUNCTIONSThis task is useful to produce cube files of the atomic orbital basis; functions \(\chi_\mu(\mathbf{r})\). ESPCalculates the total (nuclear + electronic) electrostatic potential; \(V(\mathbf{r})\). DUAL_DESCRIPTORCalculates the dual descriptor from frontier orbitals:; \(f^2(\mathbf{r})=\rho_{\mathrm{LUMO}}(\mathbf{r})-\rho_{\mathrm{HOMO}}(\mathbf{r})\).; The dual descriptor is a good measure of nucleophilicity and electrophilicity,; containing information essentially equivalent to both Fukui functions combined.; More details on the dual descriptor itself can be found in [Morell:2005:205],; while the current implementation is described in [Martinez-Araya:2015:451].; This feature is currently only supported for closed shell systems. Note; The ESP task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis; via the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword. Warning; It is important to specify the CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option when; dealing with large molecules to avoid running out of disk space.; For example, using the default grid spacing of; 0.2 Ångström, the size of a single cube file for a molecule like water; is of the order of 1.4 MB. For a molecule with 200 basis functions, the cube; files for all the orbitals occupy more than half a GB. Keywords¶. CUBEPROP_TASKS¶. Properties to compute.

Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the; AO_BASIS DISK option is recommended (set by default).; In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the AO_BASIS DISK option; is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm fo",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/dct.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/dct.html

Sokolov; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DCT. Theory¶; Density cumulant theory (DCT) is a density-based ab initio theory; that can compute electronic energies without the use of a wavefunction. The; theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and; two-particle density matrices (\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)):. \[E = h_p^q \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{2} g_{pq}^{rs} \gamma_{rs}^{pq}\]; Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices.; \(h_p^q\) and \(g_{pq}^{rs}\) are the standard one- and two-electron integrals, and; \(\gamma_p^q\) and \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) are the elements of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\),; respectively. Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements \(\gamma_p^q\) and; \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is se",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/dct.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/dct.html

The; theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and; two-particle density matrices (\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)):. \[E = h_p^q \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{2} g_{pq}^{rs} \gamma_{rs}^{pq}\]; Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices.; \(h_p^q\) and \(g_{pq}^{rs}\) are the standard one- and two-electron integrals, and; \(\gamma_p^q\) and \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) are the elements of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\),; respectively. Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements \(\gamma_p^q\) and; \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; \(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\) and a correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\):. \[\ga",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/dct.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/dct.html

The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive \({\cal O}(N^5)\) integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive \({\cal O}(N^6)\); cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis.

As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,; which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability; problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) is; N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\).; In order to obtain the DCT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:. The energy must be stationary with respect to a set of orbitals. This can be done by; diagonalizing the generalized Fock operator (as in the DC-06 and DC-12 methods, see below),; which introduces partial orbital relaxation, or by fully relaxing the orbitals and minimizing the entire energy expression; (as in the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods).; The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density; cumulant \(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\), constrained to N-representability conditions.

However,; the current version of the code does include an interface to; Kallay’s MRCC code.; The DETCI module is also capable of computing arbitrary-order; coupled-cluster energies, using an approach similar to that of Hirata; and Bartlett [Hirata:2000:216], or of Olsen [Olsen:2000:7140].; Notably, the approach in DETCI also allows arbitrary-order; active space coupled-cluster procedures. The general algorithm; for doing this in DETCI is inefficient compared to optimized; lower-order coupled-cluster codes and should not be used for CCSD,; where the CCENERGY module is much more efficient.

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate res",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/detci.html

For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are particularly inefficient for CISD and may result in the program; running out of memory and crashing for CISD except on very small molecules.; Instead, DETCI was designed to be efficient; in handling more highly correlated CI wavefunctions that can be helpful in more; challenging cases such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions.

For larger computations, additional keywords may be required, as; described in the DETCI section of the Appendix DETCI. Spin Multiplicities of Higher Roots¶; As mentioned above, DETCI works in a basis of Slater determinants, rather than; configuration state functions. The correct value of \(M_s\) is easily enforced; by fixing the number of alpha and beta electrons to be constant across all determinants; selected for the CI computation. However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/detci.html

This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy. The program then; sets MAX_NUM_VECS to the required order in the; wavefunction.; By default, the requested n-th order energy is saved as the current; energy to the process environment.

However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)), the program; will typically return singlets and not triplets. However, if enough roots are sought,; higher-multiplicities may enter in. This can be avoided by ensuring that all the guess; vectors have the correct spin multiplicity, by setting CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE).; It is also possible to ask DETCI to compute roots of higher multiplicities. The desired value of spin may be; provided by setting S = \(S\). Typically, it would be a good idea in this context to also set; CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE to ensure the guess roots have the right spin.

Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI].

An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. It can also perform approximate; CASSCF computations in which one uses RAS restrictions on the CI excitations,; rather than doing a full CI in the active space. This is called a; RASSCF.

Arbitrary Order Perturbation Theory¶; The DETCI module is capable of computing energies for arbitrary; order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MPn, for closed-shell; systems with an RHF reference) and for Z-averaged perturbation theory; (ZAPTn, open-shell systems with a ROHF reference). However, please; note that these computations are essentially doing high-order CI (up to; full CI) computations to obtain these results, and hence they will only; be possible for very small systems (generally a dozen electrons or less).; The simplest way to run high-order perturbation theory computations is to; call, e.g., energy('mp10') to invoke a MP10 computation or; energy('zapt25') to invoke a ZAPT25 computation. This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy. The program then; sets MAX_NUM_VECS to the required order in the; wavefunction.; By default, the requested n-th order energy is saved as the current; energy to the process environment. ZAPTN works essentially the same; way for an ROHF reference.

Introduction¶; Second-order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor \({\cal O}(N^5)\) treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic \(ov\) products in the; bra- and ket- of the \((ov|ov)\)-type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference. An efficient,; threaded, disk-based DF-MP2 code is available in PSI4 for all single; reference types available in the SCF module.; MP2 defaults in PSI4 to the density-fitted code.; The support for MP2 by the DFMP2 module in PSI4 is detailed in; Table DFMP2 Capabilities.

Recommendations¶; All-in-all, DFMP2 should be a simple module to use, with few keywords (fully; documented in the Appendix DFMP2). Some basic recommendations are included below:. DFMP2 should be run with the \(ov\)-type RI or MP2FIT auxiliary; basis sets, not the -JKFIT basis sets. The automatic basis selector; should work fine for most all bases (exceptions are less common elements; at higher than quadruple-zeta). Generally, it is always better to specify; only the orbital basis set and let the auxiliary bases be chosen; automatically.

Note that these are; only available with density-fitted, not conventional, MP2 algorithms. -D FunctionalsWe have several -D2 functionals implemented. -D3 functionls are available; with the installation of Grimme’s DFTD3 program.; For now, the pure-GGA B97-D; functional of Grimme is remarkably accurate, and the hybrid B3LYP-D; functional is also quite reliable. Note: we have made a sincere effort to rigorously test all functionals; implemented in PSI4 for correctness. If you find an error in a DFT; functional or have a request for a new functional, please let us know on our; forum or GitHub page. Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131.

If inaccurate; integration is suspected in systems with anions or very diffuse basis functions,; the DFT_BS_RADIUS_ALPHA option may be increased from 1.0 to a larger value to force the radial grid to span a larger extent in space.; The atomic weighting scheme is controlled by the DFT_NUCLEAR_SCHEME; option, which may be one of TREUTLER, BECKE, STRATMANN, NAIVE,; or SBECKE. The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid). Our implementation of the TREUTLER scheme shows an; error of 0.02 kcal/mol for the same benchmark. Both also reduce the grid order by 1 for H; and He atoms and avoid any pruning of heavy atoms (Z >= 36) Other schemes mentioned in; the keyword documentation (e.g. P_SLATER) are experimental and should be considered expert-only.; Once the molecular quadrature grid is built, the points are partitioned into; blocks of points which are spatially close to each other. We use an octree; algorithm for this procedure, which produces a good balance between spatial; compactness of each block (which helps achieve linear scaling due to the; exponential decay of the basis functions), and retaining a large number of; points in each block (which helps keep the FLOP rate up by allowing for a; reasonably large amount of BLAS3/BLAS2 work to form the densities and potentials; in each block).

Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code.

LRC FunctionalsLRC functionals are a particular area of interest of the PSI4 DFT team.; LRC functionals are all denoted by a lower-case “w” in front of the standard DFA; functional, such as wPBE.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:.

The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integer (typically 50-100). The radial grids are “centered” on the Bragg-Slater; radius of each atom, as described in Becke’s 1988 paper. If inaccurate; integration is suspected in systems with anions or very diffuse basis functions,; the DFT_BS_RADIUS_ALPHA option may be increased from 1.0 to a larger value to force the radial grid to span a larger extent in space.; The atomic weighting scheme is controlled by the DFT_NUCLEAR_SCHEME; option, which may be one of TREUTLER, BECKE, STRATMANN, NAIVE,; or SBECKE. The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid).

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion.

Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131. The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/dft.html

The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid). Our implementation of the TREUTLER scheme shows an; error of 0.02 kcal/mol for the same benchmark. Both also reduce the grid order by 1 for H; and He atoms and avoid any pruning of heavy atoms (Z >= 36) Other schemes mentioned in; the keyword documentation (e.g. P_SLATER) are experimental and should be considered expert-only.; Once the molecular quadrature grid is built, the points are partitioned into; blocks of points which are spatially close to each other. We use an octree; algorithm for this procedure, which produces a good balance between spatial; compactness of each block (which helps achieve linear scaling due to the; exponential decay of the basis functions), and retaining a large number of; points in each block (which helps keep the FLOP rate up by allowing for a; reasonably large amount of BLAS3/BLAS2 work to form the densities and potentials; in each block). For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/dft.html

On the correlation; side, this is primarily observed in the inability of KS-DFT to treat dispersion; interactions.; Generalized Kohn–Sham (GKS) functionals incorporate long-range information into; the functional through orbital-dependent contributions, and are designed to; combat the failures of local KS-DFT, particularly the MSIE on the exchange side.; Note that these functionals are often referred to as “implicit” density; functionals, as the orbitals are themselves functionals of the Kohn–Sham; potential.; The simplest form of an exchange-side GKS is the global hybrid ansatz, in which; some fraction of the exact Hartree–Fock exchange of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is added to the functional, with the local part of the exchange; functional decreased by the corresponding amount.

Don’t worry, it; will definitely NaN on you if you try to use it. Meta FunctionalsWe have recently implemented the M05 classes of meta functionals in; PSI4. Note that these functionals are not appropriate for modeling; dispersion interactions, as they lack dispersion physics. A -D functional (Such; as the much cheaper B97-D) should be used instead. Hybrid FunctionalsMany common hybrid functionals, including the ubiquitous B3LYP. PBE0 and the; B97 series are also quite good for many thermochemical problems. LRC FunctionalsLRC functionals are a particular area of interest of the PSI4 DFT team.; LRC functionals are all denoted by a lower-case “w” in front of the standard DFA; functional, such as wPBE. We offer a stable implementation of the Gill; association function for wS and Head-Gordon’s wB97/wB97X functionals.; Additionally, we are pleased to have recently completed a heavily conditioned; implementation of the HJS exchange-hole model, which provides an analytical form; for the short-range enhancement factor for wPBE, wPBEsol, and wB88. From a; physics perspective, this implementation of wPBE is extremely useful for; theoretical investigations, as it is parameter free, and properly integrated; against the partition function in the exchange hole. We would like to thank Dr.; Scuseria for providing helpful advice and a reference implementations of the; older HSE exchange-hole model which led to the successful implementation of the; HJS model. Double-Hybrid FunctionalsDouble hybrids are percolating into PSI4. Note that these are; only available with density-fitted, not conventional, MP2 algorithms. -D FunctionalsWe have several -D2 functionals implemented. -D3 functionls are available; with the installation of Grimme’s DFTD3 program.; For now, the pure-GGA B97-D; functional of Grimme is remarkably accurate, and the hybrid B3LYP-D; functional is also quite reliable.

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D.

PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral.

Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the \(\omega\) is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between \(N-1\)-electron and \(N\)-electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz.

IP-fitting is found to be particularly critical for the qualitative; determination of excited state ordering in many low band-gap systems.; For dispersion-bound complexes, a very simple additive empirical dispersion; potential, based on a damped Lennard-Jones potential can often produce; remarkably accurate results with KS-DFT. This approach was championed by Grimme,; whose “-D2” and more modern “-D3” approaches are a de facto industry standards. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a KS-DFT computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('b3lyp') (or other valid functional name):; molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('b3lyp').

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS. This; is because ROHF is implicitly assumed to be followed by a correlated method; which can break the positive definiteness of the spin polarization. KS-DFT with; the true functional is expected to be the final step, thus restricting the; solution to positive definite spin polarization is not physical. See the; section in [Szabo:1982] on methyl radical for an example. Functional Selection¶; PSI4 features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call:; energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; REFERENCE option before the call to energy:; set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by calling energy (or any driver function); with a dft_functional argument:; energy('scf', dft_functional = 'b3lyp').

IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation.

This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0.

During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds.

Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces. Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, \(E_{disp} = -C_6/R^6; -C_8/R^8 -C_{10}/R^{10}-\cdots\).

The parameters; fit for individual functionals are now \(s_6\), \(s_8\),; \(a_1\), and \(a_2\). \[E_{disp}^{\text{D3BJ}}=-\sum_{n=6,8} s_n \sum_{i,j>i}^{N_{at}}; \frac{C_n^{ij}}{(R_{ij})^n + (f_{damp})^n}\]. \[f_{damp} = a_1 \sqrt{\frac{C_8^{ij}}{C_6^{ij}}} + a_2\]; All parameters characterizing the dispersion correction are taken from; Grimme’s website; or else from the literature.; With s-dftd3, parameters are also tabulated in the program source. Running DFTD3 or DFTD4¶; A number of a posteriori dispersion corrections are available in; PSI4. While some are computed within PSI4‘s codebase (-D1, -D2,; -CHG, -DAS2009, -DAS2010), the -D3 or -D4 corrections and their variants are; available only through the DFTD3 or DFTD4 programs.

Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces. Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, \(E_{disp} = -C_6/R^6; -C_8/R^8 -C_{10}/R^{10}-\cdots\). The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; \(C_6^{ij}\), obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, \(R_{ij}\), modulated; by a damping function, \(f_{damp}(R_{ij})\), that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by \(\alpha_6\)); over a distance characterized by the sum of the two atomic vdW radii,; \(R_{vdW}\), while an overall scaling term, \(s_6\), is optimized; to be unique to each \(E_{xc}\) functional. (\(\alpha_6\) is; sometimes allowed to vary as well.). (1)¶\[E_{disp}^{\text{D2}}=-s_6 \sum_{i,j>i}^{N_{at}} \frac{C_6^{ij}}{(R_{ij})^6} f_{damp}(R_{ij})\]. \[f_{damp}(R_{ij}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{- \alpha_6 (R_{ij}/R_{vdW} - 1)}}\]; Grimme recently presented a refin",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/dftd3.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/dftd3.html

The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; \(C_6^{ij}\), obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, \(R_{ij}\), modulated; by a damping function, \(f_{damp}(R_{ij})\), that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by \(\alpha_6\)); over a distance c",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/dftd3.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/dftd3.html
