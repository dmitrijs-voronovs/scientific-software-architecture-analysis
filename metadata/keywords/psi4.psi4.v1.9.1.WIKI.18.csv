Overview¶; PSI4 provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods using; state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms. Several parts of; the code feature shared-memory parallelization to run efficiently on; multi-core machines (see Sec. Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; PSI4 is, in many ways, a whole new package compared to Psi3.; While some libraries and modules remain the same, the majority of the code has; been rewritten from scratch based on a powerful set of new libraries written; in C++. A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec.

Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec.

Architectures; The majority of PSI4 was developed on Mac and Linux machines; in; principle, it should work on any Unix system. The latest version of the; PSI4 program package may be obtained at psicode.org.; The package is available as a binary (Installing from Binary) for Linux, macOS, or Windows (via Windows Subsystem for; Linux aka Bash on Ubuntu on Windows); or as source code (git repository or zipped archive from; https://github.com/psi4/psi4).; Compilers; PSI4 has been successfully compiled using Intel, GCC, and Clang; compilers. Compiler requirements are primarily; C++11 compliance (i.e., GCC version 4.9 or above).; For some architectures, a precompiled binary is available. See Compiling and Installing for details.; Python; PSI4 1.1 and 1.2 are supported on Python 2.7, 3.5,; and 3.6. After 1.2, only Python 3 will be supported; in accordance with other scientific software projects). Once Python 3.7 is released,; the plan is to support >=3.6 or at least two Python versions.

Overview¶; PSI4 provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods using; state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms. Several parts of; the code feature shared-memory parallelization to run efficiently on; multi-core machines (see Sec. Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; PSI4 is, in many ways, a whole new package compared to Psi3.; While some libraries and modules remain the same, the majority of the code has; been rewritten from scratch based on a powerful set of new libraries written; in C++. A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec.

Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; PSI4 is, in many ways, a whole new package compared to Psi3.; While some libraries and modules remain the same, the majority of the code has; been rewritten from scratch based on a powerful set of new libraries written; in C++. A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec.

Architectures; The majority of PSI4 was developed on Mac and Linux machines; in; principle, it should work on any Unix system. The latest version of the; PSI4 program package may be obtained at psicode.org.; The package is available as a binary (Installing from Binary) for Linux, macOS, or Windows (via Windows Subsystem for; Linux aka Bash on Ubuntu on Windows); or as source code (git repository or zipped archive from; https://github.com/psi4/psi4).; Compilers; PSI4 has been successfully compiled using Intel, GCC, and Clang; compilers. Compiler requirements are primarily; C++11 compliance (i.e., GCC version 4.9 or above).; For some architectures, a precompiled binary is available. See Compiling and Installing for details.; Python; PSI4 1.1 and 1.2 are supported on Python 2.7, 3.5,; and 3.6. After 1.2, only Python 3 will be supported; in accordance with other scientific software projects). Once Python 3.7 is released,; the plan is to support >=3.6 or at least two Python versions.

Overview¶; PSI4 provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods using; state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms. Several parts of; the code feature shared-memory parallelization to run efficiently on; multi-core machines (see Sec. Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; PSI4 is, in many ways, a whole new package compared to Psi3.; While some libraries and modules remain the same, the majority of the code has; been rewritten from scratch based on a powerful set of new libraries written; in C++. A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec. Tutorial provides a brief tutorial to help new users; get started.

Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; PSI4 is, in many ways, a whole new package compared to Psi3.; While some libraries and modules remain the same, the majority of the code has; been rewritten from scratch based on a powerful set of new libraries written; in C++. A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec.

Szalewicz, Chem. Rev. 94, 1887-1930 (1994).; (doi: 10.1021/cr00031a008). PSI4 benefits enormously from the introduction of density fitting (DF); into SAPT. There are several SAPT truncations available in PSI4. For; guidance on which one to choose, see the SAPT section of the manual; and refer to the following systematic study:. “Levels of Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). I.

Szalewicz, Chem. Rev. 94, 1887-1930 (1994).; (doi: 10.1021/cr00031a008). PSI4 benefits enormously from the introduction of density fitting (DF); into SAPT. There are several SAPT truncations available in PSI4. For; guidance on which one to choose, see the SAPT section of the manual; and refer to the following systematic study:. “Levels of Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). I.

Each EFP fragment has its own; fragment section that includes the label efp, the name of the file; fragname from which EFP parameters are to be read, and the position; specification for the fragment in one of two ways, XYZABC or POINTS. For; XYZABC, the fragment specification is all on one line: efp and; fragname are followed by two sets of three numbers: the coordinates; of the center of mass of the fragment and the three Euler angles that; specify orientation about the center of mass.

Note; When constructing new fragment files, the name of the name of the; file should be lowercase and have extension .efp. The molecule name; within the file, e.g., $NH3 must correspond to the name of the; fragment file. Molecule Specification¶; EFP fragment geometries are specified alongside the quantum mechanical; (QM) molecule and make use of the -- fragment separation scheme; described here. Each EFP fragment has its own; fragment section that includes the label efp, the name of the file; fragname from which EFP parameters are to be read, and the position; specification for the fragment in one of two ways, XYZABC or POINTS.

Role — In PSI4, libefp is a library that provides additional; molecular modeling capabilities (EFP).; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) libefp; Upstream Dependencies — libefp \(\Leftarrow\) BLAS/LAPACK. CMake Variables. ENABLE_libefp — CMake variable toggling whether Psi4 builds with libefp; CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For libefp, set to an installation directory containing include/efp.h; libefp_DIR — CMake variable to specify where pre-built libefp can be found. Set to installation directory containing share/cmake/libefp/libefpConfig.cmake; CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_libefp — CMake variable to force internal build of libefp instead of detecting pre-built; CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_libefp — CMake variable to force detecting pre-built libefp and not falling back on i",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/libefp-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/libefp-1.html

This computation involves purely EFP/EFP fragment interactions and is; performed entirely by the LIBEFP library. PSI4 can also handle mixed; systems of quantum mechanical (QM) and EFP fragments through the native; SCF code augmented by calls to the LIBEFP library.

Needn’t start with “lib”, even if a library.; GitHub repository name should be AddOn_name or; AddOn_name.lower() (hereafter, addon_name. For example: CheMPS2, libefp, pcmsolver,; v2rdm_casscf.; CMake project name should be AddOn_name. For example:; project(libefp), project(CheMPS2), project(PCMSolver),; project(v2rdm_casscf). Namespacing in the directory structure used; to detect the addon should have this name (e.g.,; share/cmake/CheMPS2).; Restricted by the CMake project name, add-ons return CMake variables; and compile definitions of FOUND_AddOn_name and; USING_AddOn_name. For example: FOUND_libefp,; USING_CheMPS2, PCMSolver_LIBRARIES, USING_v2rdm_casscf.; The CMake target(s) formed use the full add-on name as the namespace,; AddOn_name::lib_name_without_lib.lower().

Namespacing in the directory structure used; to detect the addon should have this name (e.g.,; share/cmake/CheMPS2).; Restricted by the CMake project name, add-ons return CMake variables; and compile definitions of FOUND_AddOn_name and; USING_AddOn_name. For example: FOUND_libefp,; USING_CheMPS2, PCMSolver_LIBRARIES, USING_v2rdm_casscf.; The CMake target(s) formed use the full add-on name as the namespace,; AddOn_name::lib_name_without_lib.lower().

All of these should be doubles- let the input; parser handle the flexible input format.; Diis should have a boolean DIIS (not do_diis, not use_diis) to turn; on/off diis extrapolation, a DIIS_MIN_VECS and DIIS_MAX_VECS for; minimum and maximum number of diis vectors to use, and a DIIS_START; which is the iteration at which to start saving vectors for diis. Not all; modules conform to all these at present, but they’re as standardized as; they can be without changing code.; AMPS (not amplitude, not amp) for amplitudes; NUM_ (not n) for number (e.g., NUM_AMPS_PRINT, MAX_NUM_VECS,; NUM_THREADS); Some names that could be split into multiple words are staying ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/manage_addon.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/manage_addon.html

Use WRITE; options to indicate printing to another file. This probably isn’t; entirely valid now but should be observed in future. The complement to; WRITE is READ.

How to fix “cannot import name ‘core’ from {top-level-psi4-dir}¶; First, what’s happening? sys.path (where modules can be imported from in python) starts with ''. If you export PYTHONPATH={objdir}/stage/{prefix}/lib/{pymod_lib_dir}:$PYTHONPATH to make PsiAPI easy, that inserts starting in pos’n 1 (0-indexed), so '' still at the head of sys.path. Now, if you try to run a psiapi/python file from {top-level-psi4-dir} that contains import psi4, it will find the source tree psi4/__init__.py and fail because there’s no core.so around. That is, it’s finding what looks to be the psi4 module dir structure . when the one it wants is what you inserted into PYTHONPATH at pos’n 1.; The way around this is to move the python file you’re running to any other directory. Or, within the file, do sys.path.insert(0, {objdir}/stage/{prefix}/lib/{pymod_lib_dir}. How to find tests without output.ref¶; Ideally, each new test or much-altered test should add its own; output.ref.

How to fix “cannot import name ‘core’ from {top-level-psi4-dir}¶; First, what’s happening? sys.path (where modules can be imported from in python) starts with ''. If you export PYTHONPATH={objdir}/stage/{prefix}/lib/{pymod_lib_dir}:$PYTHONPATH to make PsiAPI easy, that inserts starting in pos’n 1 (0-indexed), so '' still at the head of sys.path. Now, if you try to run a psiapi/python file from {top-level-psi4-dir} that contains import psi4, it will find the source tree psi4/__init__.py and fail because there’s no core.so around. That is, it’s finding what looks to be the psi4 module dir structure . when the one it wants is what you inserted into PYTHONPATH at pos’n 1.; The way around this is to move the python file you’re running to any other directory. Or, within the file, do sys.path.insert(0, {objdir}/stage/{prefix}/lib/{pymod_lib_dir}. How to find tests without output.ref¶; Ideally, each new test or much-altered test should add its own; output.ref. When that doesn’t happen, this command helps.; 1find tests/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d '!' -exec test -e ""{}/output.ref"" "";"" -print. table of contents.

Theoretical Methods: SCF to FCI. Notes on Options¶. Note; The options referred to in the Theoretical Methods: SCF to FCI section below; and indexed in Keywords by Module are placed in set blocks as; described in Job Control Keywords, not as arguments to a Python function; (like energy()). Note; All PSI4 keyword names and values are insensitive to case, both; those that are placed in set blocks and as Python function arguments.; The few exceptions are documented for the database() function,; where case structure must match the database file. Note; Boolean options can be specified by yes, on, true, or 1; for affirmative and no, off, false, or 0 for negative,; all insensitive to case. Note; Certain convergence and tolerance keywords, of type double (real numbers),; may be specified using either a real number or an integer; and integer X is then; treated as the number of converged decimal digits required. For example, to request; as energy converged to \(10^{-6} E_h\), the user may set the e_convergence; keyword to 0.000001, 1.0e-6, or 6. Alternate Implementations¶; Depending on the reference (RHF, UHF, ROHF) and the integral treatment; (conventional CONV, density-fitted DF, and Cholesky-decomposed CD),; computational methods are sometimes implemented by multiple coders or even; multiple times. PSI4 transparently selects the most efficient; implementation, so one generally needn’t consult this table.

Note; The Python options referred to in the Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation section below; are placed as arguments to a Python; function (like energy()), not in set blocks or commands. Note; All PSI4 keyword names and values are insensitive to case, both; those that are placed in set blocks and as Python function arguments.; The one exception is documented for the subset option in the database(); function, where case structure must match the database file. Note; Boolean options can be specified by yes, on, true, or 1; for affirmative and no, off, false, or 0 for negative,; all insensitive to case. Note; The derivative level type for optimize() and frequency() functions can be specified by energy, none, or 0 for 0th derivative, gradient, first, or 1 for 1st derivative, and hessian, second, or 2 for 2nd derivative. For finite difference, as opposed to analytic, derivatives, the POINTS option can be increased to 5 for greater accuracy at increased cost. Note; Function option for the Psithon function called by the current function;; the default is usually energy(). See Sec. Function Intercalls; for a fuller description. Note that the value of the keyword is a Python object; and so is not wrapped in quotes like a string. Note; The molecule to be acted upon by the current function; the default is the; “active” molecule, which is the nearest preceeding molecule declared in a; molecule mymol {...} block or in an activate(mymol) statement.

NumPy Views¶; Copying the data between NumPy and Psi4 objects can lead to excessive data; movement and convoluted code. Here we introduce the idea of “Views” where the; same data can be viewed by multiple objects. However, this can lead to very; subtle errors if used incorrectly and care needs to be taken when using these; views. Views can be created in two ways:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9>>> numpy_mat_view = np.asarray(mat). # Access the NumPy object and set all values to 1 through broadcasting; >>> numpy_mat_view[:] = 1. >>> print(np.array(mat)); [[ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]]. Secondly, these objects have a .np attribute for easy access to the underlying data:; 1>>> mat.np[:] = 1. this operation is identical to the above. PSI4 Data Objects with Irreps¶; PSI4 data objects natively support multiple irreducible representations; which is quite useful for Quantum Chemistry. However, this is not fundamental; to NumPy and some work around are required to natively support these; operations.

We will follow our previous presentations ([Bozkaya:2011:omp2],; [Bozkaya:2011:omp3], and [Bozkaya:2012:odtl]); The orbital variations may be expressed by means of an exponential unitary operator. \[\begin{split}\widetilde{\hat{p}}^{\dagger} &= e^{\hat{K}} \hat{p}^{\dagger} e^{-\hat{K}}\\; \widetilde{\hat{p}} &= e^{\hat{K}} \ \hat{p} \ e^{-\hat{K}} \\; | \widetilde{p} \rangle &= e^{\hat{K}} \ | p \rangle\end{split}\]; where \(\hat{K}\) is the orbital rotation operator. \[\begin{split}\hat{K} &= \sum_{p,q}^{} K_{pq} \ \hat{E}_{pq} = \sum_{p>q}^{} \kappa_{pq} \ \hat{E}_{pq}^{-} \\; \hat{E}_{pq} &= \hat{p}^{\dagger} \hat{q} \\; \hat{E}_{pq}^{-} &= \hat{E}_{pq} \ - \ \hat{E}_{qp} \\; {\bf K} &= Skew({\bf \kappa})\end{split}\]; The effect of the orbital rotations on the MO coefficients can be written as. \[{\bf C({\bf \kappa})} = {\bf C^{(0)}} \ e^{{\bf K}}\]; where \({\bf C^{(0)}}\) is the initial MO coefficient matrix and \",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/occ-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/occ-1.html

Then,; first and second derivatives of the energy with respect to the \({\bf \kappa}\) parameter at \({\bf \kappa} = 0\). \[w_{pq} = \frac{\partial \widetilde{E}}{\partial \kappa_{pq}}\]. \[A_{pq,rs} = \frac{\partial^2 \widetilde{E}}{\partial \kappa_{pq} \partial \kappa_{rs}}\]; Then the energy can be expanded up to second-order as follows. \[\widetilde{E}^{(2)}({\bf \kappa}) = \widetilde{E}^{(0)} + {\bf \kappa^{\dagger} w} + \frac{1}{2}~{\bf \kappa^{\dagger} A \kappa}\]; where \({\bf w}\) is the MO gradient vector, \({\bf \kappa}\) is the MO rotation vector,; and \({\bf A}\) is the MO Hessian matrix. Therefore, minimizing the energy with respect to \({\bf \kappa}\); yields. \[{\bf \kappa} = -{\bf A^{-1}w}\]; This final equation corresponds to the usual Newton-Raphson step.; Publications resulting from the use of the orbital-optimized code should cite the following publications:.

Convergence Problems¶; For problematic open-shell systems, we recommend to use the ROHF or DFT orbitals as an initial guess for orbital-optimized methods. Both ROHF and; DFT orbitals may provide better initial guesses than UHF orbitals, hence convergence may be significantly speeded up with ROHF or DFT orbitals.; In order to use ROHF orbitals, simply set reference rohf.

Introduction¶; Orbital-optimized methods have several advantages over their non-optimized counterparts.; Once the orbitals are optimized, the wave function will obey the Hellmann–Feynman theorem; for orbital rotation parameters. Therefore, there is no need for orbital response terms; in the evaluation of analytic gradients. In other words, it is unnecessary to solve the; first order coupled-perturbed CC and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) equations.; Further, computation of one-electron properties is easier because there are no response contributions to the particle; density matrices (PDMs). Moreover, active space approximations can be readily incorporated into the CC methods; [Krylov:2000:vod]. Additionally, orbital-optimized coupled-cluster avoids spurious second-order; poles in its response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge invariant [Pedersen:1999:od].; Another advantage is that the orbital-optimized methods do not suffer from artifactual symmetry-breaking; instabilities [Crawford:1997:instability], [Sherrill:1998:od], [Bozkaya:2011:omp2], and [Bozkaya:2011:omp3].; Furthermore, Kurlancheek and Head-Gordon [Kurlancek:2009] demonstrated that first order properties such as; forces or dipole moments are discontinuous along nuclear coordinates when such a symmetry breaking occurs.; They also observed that although the energy appears well behaved, the MP2 method can have natural occupation; numbers greater than 2 or less than 0, hence may violate the N-representability condition.

We will follow our previous presentations ([Bozkaya:2011:omp2],; [Bozkaya:2011:omp3], and [Bozkaya:2012:odtl]); The orbital variations may be expressed by means of an exponential unitary operator. \[\begin{split}\widetilde{\hat{p}}^{\dagger} &= e^{\hat{K}} \hat{p}^{\dagger} e^{-\hat{K}}\\; \widetilde{\hat{p}} &= e^{\hat{K}} \ \hat{p} \ e^{-\hat{K}} \\; | \widetilde{p} \rangle &= e^{\hat{K}} \ | p \rangle\end{split}\]; where \(\hat{K}\) is the orbital rotation operator. \[\begin{split}\hat{K} &= \sum_{p,q}^{} K_{pq} \ \hat{E}_{pq} = \sum_{p>q}^{} \kappa_{pq} \ \hat{E}_{pq}^{-} \\; \hat{E}_{pq} &= \hat{p}^{\dagger} \hat{q} \\; \hat{E}_{pq}^{-} &= \hat{E}_{pq} \ - \ \hat{E}_{qp} \\; {\bf K} &= Skew({\bf \kappa})\end{split}\]; The effect of the orbital rotations on the MO coefficients can be written as. \[{\bf C({\bf \kappa})} = {\bf C^{(0)}} \ e^{{\bf K}}\]; where \({\bf C^{(0)}}\) is the initial MO coefficient matrix and \",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/occ.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/occ.html

Then,; first and second derivatives of the energy with respect to the \({\bf \kappa}\) parameter at \({\bf \kappa} = 0\). \[w_{pq} = \frac{\partial \widetilde{E}}{\partial \kappa_{pq}}\]. \[A_{pq,rs} = \frac{\partial^2 \widetilde{E}}{\partial \kappa_{pq} \partial \kappa_{rs}}\]; Then the energy can be expanded up to second-order as follows. \[\widetilde{E}^{(2)}({\bf \kappa}) = \widetilde{E}^{(0)} + {\bf \kappa^{\dagger} w} + \frac{1}{2}~{\bf \kappa^{\dagger} A \kappa}\]; where \({\bf w}\) is the MO gradient vector, \({\bf \kappa}\) is the MO rotation vector,; and \({\bf A}\) is the MO Hessian matrix. Therefore, minimizing the energy with respect to \({\bf \kappa}\); yields. \[{\bf \kappa} = -{\bf A^{-1}w}\]; This final equation corresponds to the usual Newton-Raphson step.; Publications resulting from the use of the orbital-optimized code should cite the following publications:.

Convergence Problems¶; For problematic open-shell systems, we recommend to use the ROHF or DFT orbitals as an initial guess for orbital-optimized methods. Both ROHF and; DFT orbitals may provide better initial guesses than UHF orbitals, hence convergence may be significantly speeded up with ROHF or DFT orbitals.; In order to use ROHF orbitals, simply set reference rohf.

Introduction¶; Orbital-optimized methods have several advantages over their non-optimized counterparts.; Once the orbitals are optimized, the wave function will obey the Hellmann–Feynman theorem; for orbital rotation parameters. Therefore, there is no need for orbital response terms; in the evaluation of analytic gradients. In other words, it is unnecessary to solve the; first order coupled-perturbed CC and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) equations.; Further, computation of one-electron properties is easier because there are no response contributions to the particle; density matrices (PDMs). Moreover, active space approximations can be readily incorporated into the CC methods; [Krylov:2000:vod]. Additionally, orbital-optimized coupled-cluster avoids spurious second-order; poles in its response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge invariant [Pedersen:1999:od].; Another advantage is that the orbital-optimized methods do not suffer from artifactual symmetry-breaking; instabilities [Crawford:1997:instability], [Sherrill:1998:od], [Bozkaya:2011:omp2], and [Bozkaya:2011:omp3].; Furthermore, Kurlancheek and Head-Gordon [Kurlancek:2009] demonstrated that first order properties such as; forces or dipole moments are discontinuous along nuclear coordinates when such a symmetry breaking occurs.; They also observed that although the energy appears well behaved, the MP2 method can have natural occupation; numbers greater than 2 or less than 0, hence may violate the N-representability condition. They further; discussed that the orbital response equations generally have a singularity problem at the unrestriction point; where spin-restricted orbitals become unstable to unrestriction.

Therefore, minimizing the energy with respect to \({\bf \kappa}\); yields. \[{\bf \kappa} = -{\bf A^{-1}w}\]; This final equation corresponds to the usual Newton-Raphson step.; Publications resulting from the use of the orbital-optimized code should cite the following publications:. OMP2 [Bozkaya:2011:omp2] and [Bozkaya:2013:omp2grad]; OMP3 [Bozkaya:2011:omp3] , [Bozkaya:2013:omp3], and [Bozkaya:2013:omp3grad]; OMP2.5 [Bozkaya:2011:omp3]; OLCCD [Bozkaya:2013:ocepa]; LCCD [Bozkaya:2013:ocepa]. Convergence Problems¶; For problematic open-shell systems, we recommend to use the ROHF or DFT orbitals as an initial guess for orbital-optimized methods. Both ROHF and; DFT orbitals may provide better initial guesses than UHF orbitals, hence convergence may be significantly speeded up with ROHF or DFT orbitals.; In order to use ROHF orbitals, simply set reference rohf. For DFT orbitals, set reference uks and set dft_functional b3lyp. Of; course users can use any DFT functional available in PSI4. Methods¶; The orbital-optimized MPn and OLCCD methods currently supported in; PSI4 are outlined in Table Orbital-Optimzed OCC/DFOCC; Methods. The following methods are available; and can be controlled through OCC (conventional integrals CONV); and DFOCC (density-fitted DF and Cholesky-decomposed CD); keywords.

The optking program takes as input nuclear gradients and,; optionally, nuclear second derivatives — both in Cartesian coordinates.; The default minimization algorithm employs an empirical model Hessian,; redundant internal coordinates, an RFO step, and the BFGS Hessian update.; The principal literature references include the introduction of redundant; internal coordinates by Peng et al. [Peng:1996:49].; The general approach employed in this code; is similar to the “model Hessian plus RF method” described and tested by Bakken and; Helgaker [Bakken:2002:9160]. (However, for separated; fragments, we have chosen not to employ by default their “extra-redundant”; coordinates defined by their “auxiliary interfragment” bonds. These can be; included via the option ADD_AUXILIARY_BONDS).; The internal coordinates are generated automatically based on an assumed bond; connectivity. The connectivity is determined by testing if the interatomic; distance is less than the sum of atomic radii times the value of; COVALENT_CONNECT. If the user finds that some; connectivity is lacking by default, then this value may be increased.; Otherwise, the internal coordinate definitions may be modified directly. If one; desires to see or modify the internal coordinates being used, then one can set; INTCOS_GENERATE_EXIT to true. The internal coordinate; definitions are provided in the file with extension “.intco”. See the Optimizing Minima; section for more detail. Warning; The selection of a Z-matrix input, and in particular the inclusion; of dummy atoms, has no effect on the behavior of the optimizer, which begins; from a Cartesian representation of the sy",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/optking-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/optking-1.html

Hessian¶; If Cartesian second derivatives are available, optking can read them; and transform them into internal coordinates to make an initial Hessian in; internal coordinates. Otherwise, several empirical Hessians are available,; including those of Schlegel [Schlegel:1984:333] and Fischer and Almlof; [Fischer:1992:9770].; Either of these or a simple diagonal Hessian may be selected using the; INTRAFRAG_HESS keyword.; All the common Hessian update schemes are available. For formulas, see; Schlegel [Schlegel:1987:AIMQC] and Bofill [Bofill:1994:1].; The Hessian may be computed during an optimization using the; FULL_HESS_EVERY keyword.

Dealing with problematic optimizations¶; Although optking is continuously improved with robustness in mind, some; attempted optimizations will inevitably fail to converge to the desired minima.; For difficult cases, the following suggestions are made. As for any optimizer, computing the Hessian and limiting the step size will; successfully converge a higher percentage of cases. The default settings have; been chosen because they perform efficiently for common, representative test sets.; More restrictive, cautious steps are sometimes necessary.; DYNAMIC_LEVEL allows optking to change the method of optimization; toward algorithms that, while often less efficient, may help to converge difficult; cases. If this is initially set to 1, then optking, as poor steps are detected,; will increase the level through several forms of more robust and cautious algorithms.; The changes will reduce the trust radius, allow backward steps (partial line; searching), add cartesian coordinates, switch to cartesian coordinates, and take; steepest-descent steps.; The developers have found the OPT_COORDIN",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/optking-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/optking-1.html

[6](1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Normal convergence achieved when all four criteria (Max Force, RMS Force,; Max Disp, and RMS Disp) are fulfilled.

[7]Compensates for difficulties in converging geometry optmizations of supermolecular complexes; tightly, where large rms disp and max disp may result from flat potential surfaces even when; max force and/or rms force are small.

Dealing with problematic optimizations¶; Although optking is continuously improved with robustness in mind, some; attempted optimizations will inevitably fail to converge to the desired minima.; For difficult cases, the following suggestions are made. As for any optimizer, computing the Hessian and limiting the step size will; successfully converge a higher percentage of cases. The default settings have; been chosen because they perform efficiently for common, representative test sets.; More restrictive, cautious steps are sometimes necessary.; DYNAMIC_LEVEL allows optking to change the method of optimization; toward algorithms that, while often less efficient, may help to converge difficult; cases. If this is initially set to 1, then optking, as poor steps are detected,; will increase the level through several forms of more robust and cautious algorithms.; The changes will reduce the trust radius, allow backward steps (partial line; searching), add cartesian coordinates, switch to cartesian coordinates, and take; steepest-descent steps.; The developers have found the OPT_COORDINATES set to “BOTH” which; includes both the redundant internal coordinate set, as well as cartesian coordinates,; works well for systems with long ‘arms’ or floppy portions of a molecule poorly; described by local internals.

Theoretical Methods: SCF to FCI. Geometry Optimization¶; Code author: Rollin A. King; Section author: Rollin A. King and Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, OPTKING; PSI4 carries out molecular optimizations using a module called; optking. The optking program takes as input nuclear gradients and,; optionally, nuclear second derivatives — both in Cartesian coordinates.; The default minimization algorithm employs an empirical model Hessian,; redundant internal coordinates, an RFO step, and the BFGS Hessian update.; The principal literature references include the introduction of redundant; internal coordinates by Peng et al. [Peng:1996:49].; The general approach employed in this code; is similar to the “model Hessian plus RF method” described and tested by Bakken and; Helgaker [Bakken:2002:9160]. (However, for separated; fragments, we have chosen not to employ by default their “extra-redundant”; coordinates defined by their “auxiliary interfragment” bonds. These can be; included via the option ADD_AUXILIARY_BONDS).; The internal coordinates are generated automatically based on an assumed bond; connectivity. The connectivity is determined by testing if the interatomic; distance is less than the sum of atomic radii times the value of; COVALENT_CONNECT. If the user finds that some; connectivity is lacking by default, then this value may be increased.; Otherwise, the internal coordinate definitions may be modified directly. If one; desires to see or modify the internal coordinates being used, then one can set; INTCOS_GENERATE_EXIT to true. The internal coordinate; definitions are provided in the file with extension “.intco”. See the Optimizing Minima; section for more detail.

Theoretical Methods: SCF to FCI. Geometry Optimization¶; Code author: Rollin A. King; Section author: Rollin A. King and Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, OPTKING; PSI4 carries out molecular optimizations using a module called; optking. The optking program takes as input nuclear gradients and,; optionally, nuclear second derivatives — both in Cartesian coordinates.; The default minimization algorithm employs an empirical model Hessian,; redundant internal coordinates, an RFO step, and the BFGS Hessian update.; The principal literature references include the introduction of redundant; internal coordinates by Peng et al. [Peng:1996:49].; The general approach employed in this code; is similar to the “model Hessian plus RF method” described and tested by Bakken and; Helgaker [Bakken:2002:9160]. (However, for separated; fragments, we have chosen not to employ by default their “extra-redundant”; coordinates defined by their “auxiliary interfragment” bonds. These can be; included via the option ADD_AUXILIARY_BONDS).; The internal coordinates are generated automatically based on an assumed bond; connectivity. The connectivity is determined by testing if the interatomic; distance is less than the sum of atomic radii times the value of; COVALENT_CONNECT. If the user finds that some; connectivity is lacking by default, then this value may be increased.; Otherwise, the internal coordinate definitions may be modified directly. If one; desires to see or modify the internal coordinates being used, then one can set; INTCOS_GENERATE_EXIT to true.
