To compensate for these deviations, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommended to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; and recommended using the ratio with exponent \(\alpha = 1\).

[Parker:2014:094106] empirically discovered that; SAPT0 energies for van der Waals dimers with close contacts benefit from a slightly modified; recipe that involves an empirically adjusted exponent \(\alpha = 3.0\).; To distinguish it from its unscaled counterpart, this energy is denoted sSAPT0 (see [Parker:2014:094106]). (9)¶\[E_{sSAPT0} = E_{elst}^{(10)} + E_{exch}^{(10)} + E_{ind,resp}^{(20)} +; p_{EX}(3.0) E_{exch-ind,resp}^{(20)} + E_{disp}^{(20)} + p_{EX}(3.0) E_{exch-disp}^{(20)}; + \delta_{HF}^{(2)}\]; where \(\delta_{HF}^{(2)}\) is computed without any scaling.

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions.

Interior option to clean up printing. Type: boolean; Default: false. Higher-Order SAPT¶; For smaller systems (up to the size of a nucleic acid base pair), more; accurate interaction energies can be obtained through higher-order SAPT; computations. The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies for closed-shell systems; only. Publications resulting from the use of the higher-order SAPT code; should cite the following:; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].; For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106], whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors. Thanks to; natural orbital methods [Parrish:2013:174102], the SAPT code; is able to include CCD dispersion with only a modest additional cost.; Computations employing CCD dispersion should cite [Parrish:2013:174102].; To request CCD dispersion treatment in a SAPT computation, simply append; (ccd) to the name of the method, as in the following examples; energy('sapt2+(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)'). The \(\delta_{MP2}\) corrections can also be computed automatically; by appending dmp2 to the name of the method, with or without CCD dispersion; energy('sapt2+dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)dmp2').

Type: conv double; Default: 1.0e-6. Charge-Transfer in SAPT¶; It is possible to obtain the stabilization energy of a complex due to; charge-transfer effects from a SAPT computation. The charge-transfer energy; can be computed with the SAPT module as described by Stone; and Misquitta [Misquitta:2009:201].; Charge-transfer energies can be obtained from the following calls to the; energy function.; energy('sapt0-ct'); energy('sapt2-ct'); energy('sapt2+-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3-ct'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)-ct'). For now, charge transfer computations are not available with open-shell SAPT0.; A SAPT charge-transfer analysis will perform 5 HF computations: the dimer; in the dimer basis, monomer A in the dimer basis, monomer B in the dimer; basis, monomer A in the monomer A basis, and monomer B in the monomer B; basis. Next, it performs two SAPT computations, one in the dimer basis and; one in the monomer basis.

It is also possible to run a closed-shell SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set. Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example; molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation. Note that an error will be thrown if each atom in the; third monomer is not a ghost to prevent confusion with three-body SAPT which is; not currently supported by Psi4. Interpreting SAPT Results¶; We will examine the results of a SAPT2+3/aug-cc-pVDZ computation on the; water dimer. This computation can be performed with the following; input:; molecule water_dimer {; 0 1; O -1.551007 -0.114520 0.000000; H -1.934259 0.762503 0.000000; H -0.599677 0.040712 0.000000; --; 0 1; O 1.350625 0.111469 0.000000; H 1.680398 -0.373741 -0.758561; H 1.680398 -0.373741 0.758561; units angstrom; }. set globals {; basis aug-cc-pvdz; guess sad; scf_type df; }. set sapt {; print 1; nat_orbs_t2 true; freeze_core true; }. energy('sapt2+3').

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions. Publications resulting from the use of the SAPT0 code; should cite the following publications: [Hohenstein:2010:184111] and; [Hohenstein:2011:174107]. If the open-shell SAPT0 code is used,; [Gonthier:2016:134106] should be additionally cited. Basic SAPT0 Keywords¶. SAPT_LEVEL¶. The level of theory for SAPT.

Specifies how many core orbitals to freeze in correlated computations. TRUE or 1 will default to freezing the previous noble gas shell on each atom. In case of positive charges on fragments, an additional shell may be unfrozen, to ensure there are valence electrons in each fragment. With FALSE or 0, no electrons are frozen (with the exception of electrons treated by an ECP). With -1, -2, and -3, the user might request strict freezing of the previous first/second/third noble gas shell on every atom.

MP2 Natural Orbitals¶; One of the unique features of the SAPT module is its ability to use; MP2 natural orbitals (NOs) to speed up the evaluation of the triples; contribution to dispersion. By transforming to the MP2 NO basis, we can; throw away virtual orbitals that are expected to contribute little to the; dispersion energy. Speedups in excess of \(50 \times\) are possible. In; practice, this approximation is very good and should always be applied.; Publications resulting from the use of MP2 NO-based approximations should; cite the following: [Hohenstein:2010:104107].

The monomer Fock operators, \(F_A+F_B\), are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of \(V\), \(W_A\), and \(W_B\).; Through first-order in \(V\), electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in \(V\).

The factorization of the SAPT energy; expressions, as implemented in PSI4, assumes the use of density-fitted; two-electron integrals, therefore, the closed-shell SAPT module cannot be run with; exact integrals. In practice, we have found that the density-fitting; approximation introduces negligible errors into the SAPT energy; (often less than 0.01 kcal/mol for small dimers) and greatly; improves efficiency.; The latest addition to the SAPT code is the SAPT0 method for open-shell; monomers [Gonthier:2016:134106]. This code is available for both exact and density fitted integrals,; except for the dispersion terms which implementation relies on a density fitting; factorization. Both UHF and ROHF REFERENCE can be used, but coupled; induction computations are currently not supported with ROHF. This means that orbital; relaxation is not included for ROHF and the uncoupled induction term is computed instead.; If both monomers are open-shell, their coupling is assumed to be high spin, i.e.; two doublets would interact to form a triplet. The S2 approximation and scaling¶; All exchange terms in SAPT arise from the antisymmetrization; of the wavefunctions of monomers A and B. Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the \(S^{2}\); approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron; pair between monomers.; The \(S^{2}\) approximation is usually pretty good, but may; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate for these deviations, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommended to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; and recommended using the ratio with exponent \(\alpha = 1\).

Like higher-order SAPT, SAPT(DFT) requires; sufficient memory to hold \(2ovN_aux\) doubles.; SAPT(DFT) requires a few special treatments to obtain accurate; result. The DFT functionals used in SAPT(DFT) need to be asymptotically; corrected with Gradient Regulated Asymptotic Correction scheme (GRAC),; in order to recover the correct long-range asymptotic behavior; (approaching \(-1/r\) as \(r\) approaches infinity). The program; requires manual input of GRAC shift parameter for each monomer through; keywords SAPT_DFT_GRAC_SHIFT_A and SAPT_DFT_GRAC_SHIFT_B,; which should be equal to the difference of the actual ionization; potential and the corresponding Kohn-Sham HOMO energy.

Higher-Order SAPT¶; For smaller systems (up to the size of a nucleic acid base pair), more; accurate interaction energies can be obtained through higher-order SAPT; computations. The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies for closed-shell systems; only. Publications resulting from the use of the higher-order SAPT code; should cite the following:; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].; For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106], whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors.

A brief note on memory usage: the higher-order SAPT code assumes that; certain quantities can be held in core. This code requires sufficient; memory to hold \(3o^2v^2+v^2N_{aux}\) arrays in core. With this; requirement computations on the adenine-thymine complex can be performed; with an aug-cc-pVTZ basis in less than 64GB of memory.; Higher-order SAPT is treated separately from the highly optimized SAPT0; code, therefore, higher-order SAPT uses a separate set of keywords.; The following keywords are relevant for higher-order SAPT.

A brief note on memory usage: the higher-order SAPT code assumes that; certain quantities can be held in core. This code requires sufficient; memory to hold \(3o^2v^2+v^2N_{aux}\) arrays in core. With this; requirement computations on the adenine-thymine complex can be performed; with an aug-cc-pVTZ basis in less than 64GB of memory.; Higher-order SAPT is treated separately from the highly optimized SAPT0; code, therefore, higher-order SAPT uses a separate set of keywords.; The following keywords are relevant for higher-order SAPT. Basic Keywords for Higher-order SAPT¶. BASIS¶. Primary basis set, describes the monomer molecular orbitals. Type: string; Possible Values: basis string; Default: No Default. DF_BASIS_SAPT¶. Auxiliary basis set for SAPT density fitting computations. Defaults to a RI basis. Type: string; Possible Values: basis string; Default: No Default. FREEZE_CORE¶.

In case of positive charges on fragments, an additional shell may be unfrozen, to ensure there are valence electrons in each fragment.

Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example; molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation.

Interpreting SAPT Results¶; We will examine the results of a SAPT2+3/aug-cc-pVDZ computation on the; water dimer.

SAPT(DFT)¶; In general, SAPT(DFT) should provide more accurate interaction energy; components, and overall interaction energies, than SAPT0. The drawback; is SAPT(DFT) method is more computationally demanding than SAPT0,; SAPT(DFT) can still be applied to medium-sized or large systems.

Like higher-order SAPT, SAPT(DFT) requires; sufficient memory to hold \(2ovN_aux\) doubles.; SAPT(DFT) requires a few special treatments to obtain accurate; result. The DFT functionals used in SAPT(DFT) need to be asymptotically; corrected with Gradient Regulated Asymptotic Correction scheme (GRAC),; in order to recover the correct long-range asymptotic behavior; (approaching \(-1/r\) as \(r\) approaches infinity). The program; requires manual input of GRAC shift parameter for each monomer through; keywords SAPT_DFT_GRAC_SHIFT_A and SAPT_DFT_GRAC_SHIFT_B,; which should be equal to the difference of the actual ionization; potential and the corresponding Kohn-Sham HOMO energy. The dispersion; term needs to be computed with orbital response for good accuracy,; and it is recommended to enable SAPT_DFT_DO_HYBRID (set to; True by default). The coupled exchange-dispersion energy is usually; estimated by scaling from the uncoupled value either by a fitted fixed; value (suggested initially by [Hesselmann:2014:094107] for a local Hartree–Fock (LHF) formulation and then revised; by [Xie:2022:024801] for non-LHF) or; by the ratio of; coupled and uncoupled dispersion energy (suggested by [Podeszwa:2006:400] ).; This can be controlled by keyword SAPT_DFT_EXCH_DISP_SCALE_SCHEME,; with ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/sapt.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/sapt.html

We regard the groupings; used in PSI4 as a “chemist’s grouping” as opposed to a more; mathematically based grouping, which would group all exchange terms; (i.e. \(E_{exch-ind,resp}^{(20)}\), \(E_{exch-disp}^{(20)}\), etc.) in; the exchange component.

For; a complete description of SAPT, the reader is referred to the excellent; review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz [Jeziorski:1994:1887].; Several truncations of the closed-shell SAPT expansion are available in the SAPT; module of PSI4.

The S2 approximation and scaling¶; All exchange terms in SAPT arise from the antisymmetrization; of the wavefunctions of monomers A and B. Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the \(S^{2}\); approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron; pair between monomers.; The \(S^{2}\) approximation is usually pretty good, but may; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate for these deviations, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommended to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; and recommended using the ratio with exponent \(\alpha = 1\). To obtain SAPT energies with this scaling,; simply set the keyword exch_scale_alpha true. Alternatively, another value for \(\alpha\); can be specified by setting EXCH_SCALE_ALPHA to a value. For example,; set exch_scale_alpha 1.0. will set \(\alpha = 1.0\) and scale exchange energies with \(p_{EX}(1.0)\).; However, as pointed out by Schaffer and Jansen [Schaffer:2013:2570]; in the context of DFT-based SAPT, the ratios \(E_{exch}^{(1)}(S^{2})/E_{exch}^{(1)}\),; \(E_{\rm exch-ind}^{(2)}(S^2)/E_{\rm exch-ind}^{(2)}\), and; \(E_{\rm exch-disp}^{(2)}(S^2)/E_{\rm exch-disp}^{(2)}\) are not very similar to; each other. Hence, in 2016 universal scaling of all \(S^{2}\) approximated terms; was turned off by default.; Finally, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106] empirically discovered that; SAPT0 energies for van der Waals dimers with close contacts benefit from a slightly modified; recipe that involves an empirically adjusted exponent \(\alpha = 3.0\).; To distinguish it from its unscaled counterpart, this energy is denoted sSAPT",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/sapt.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/sapt.html

These results are for the water dimer geometry shown above computed with; SAPT0/aug-cc-pVDZ. Monomer-Centered Basis Computations¶; The charge-transfer analysis above is carried out by taking the; difference between SAPT induction as calculated in the dimer-centered; basis (i.e., each monomer sees the basis functions on both monomers); vs. the monomer-centered basis (i.e., each monomer utilizes only its; own basis set). It is also possible to run a closed-shell SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set. Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example; molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation.

Initial Guess¶; In each step of the SCF procedure, a new Fock or Kohn–Sham potential is built; according to the previous density, following which the potential is diagonalized; to produce new molecular orbitals, from which a new density is computed. This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. COREDiagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems.

Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is typically visible in the output as a non-converging; SCF which eventually settles down to steady oscillation between two (or more); different total energies.

The closely-related EDIIS procedure; may be used instead by setting SCF_INITIAL_ACCELERATOR. This is formally identical; to ADIIS for HF, but the methods will differ for more general DFT. MOM [Off by Default]MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations. Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is typically visible in the output as a non-converging; SCF which eventually settles down to steady oscillation between two (or more); different total energies. This behavior can be ameliorated by choosing occupied; orbitals by “shape” instead of by orbital eigenvalue, i.e., by choosing the set; of new orbitals which looks most like some previously known “good” set. The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations \(N,N+2,\ldots\), invoking; MOM_START N can often rescue the convergence of the SCF.

Integral-Direct Density-Fitted Coulomb Construction¶; The Resolution of the Identity (RI) can be used to decompose the normally 4-center ERI tensor into a combination of 3-center and 2-center components.; By reducing the dimensionality of the ERI tensor, application of the RI (often referred to as density-fitting, or DF) can be used to greatly speed up; SCF calculations. The reduction in ERI tensor rank also makes DF an appealing option for conventional SCF calculations, where the ERIs are stored; in core or on disk. However, even when using DF, I/O becomes a significant bottleneck for systems of a sufficient size when performing conventional SCF; calculations. In principle, though, DF approaches can be utilized in an integral-direct context, gaining the benefits of DF methods without suffering the; I/O bottlenecks that conventional DF methods will eventually run into. One such approach, outlined by Weigend in [Weigend:2002:4285],; is available for use in Psi4 for the separate construction of the Coulomb contribution to the Fock matrix. This implementation can be used alongside; Psi4’s separate Exchange construction algorithms for composite Fock matrix construction by using the keyword DFDIRJ as the Coulomb construction; algorithm when specifying SCF_TYPE to use a composite algorithm combination (DFDIRJ+K_alg in general,; or DFDIRJ for DFT with non-hybrid functionals).; DFDIRJ supports multiple capabilities to improve performance. Specifically, DFDIRJ allows for a combination of density-matrix based ERI; screening (set SCREENING to DENSITY) and incremental Fock matrix construction (set INCFOCK to TRUE). These two, when combined,; enable more aggressive screening of ERI contributions to the Coulomb matrix and thus greatly improve performance.

COSX Exchange¶; The semi-numerical COSX algorithm described in [Neese:2009:98] evaluates; two-electron ERIs analytically over one electron coordinate and numerically; over the other electron coordinate, and belongs to the family of pseudospectral; methods originally suggested by Friesner. In COSX, numerical integration is performed on standard; DFT quadrature grids, which are described in DFT: Density Functional Theory.; Both the accuracy of the COSX algorithm and also the computational; cost are directly determined by the size of the integration grid, so selection; of the grid is important. This COSX implementation uses two separate grids.; By default, the SCF algorithm is first converged on a smaller grid, followed by a; number of SCF iterations up to a maximum value (controlled by the COSX_MAXITER_FINAL keyword); on a larger grid. By default, COSX_MAXITER_FINAL is set to 1, a single; SCF iteration, which results in numerical errors comparable to; performing the entire SCF on the expensive larger grid at a computational cost; much closer to the smaller grid. Setting COSX_MAXITER_FINAL to 0 disables the; larger grid entirely. Setting COSX_MAXITER_FINAL to -1 allows; for the SCF to fully converge on the larger grid, useful for the study of wavefunction; properties such as gradients. The size of the initial grid is controlled by the keywords; COSX_RADIAL_POINTS_INITIAL and COSX_SPHERICAL_POINTS_INITIAL.; The final grid is controlled by COSX_RADIAL_POINTS_FINAL and; COSX_SPHERICAL_POINTS_FINAL.

This keyword is; used to determine the radial extent of the each basis shell, and it is the; COSX analogue to DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE.; The INCFOCK keyword (defaults to false) increases performance; by constructing the Fock matrix from differences in the density matrix, which; are more amenable to screening.

Specifically, LinK exploits the fact that the Exchange term; requires only a linear-scaling number of significant elements through reformulating the; shell quartet screening process to scale linearly with system size.; LinK is most competitive when used with non-diffuse orbital basis sets, since orbital and density overlaps decay slower with diffuse functions.; LinK is especially powerful when combined with density-matrix based ERI ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

This option is disabled by default because of; potential SCF convergence issues, particularly when using diffuse basis functions.; The COSX_OVERLAP_FITTING keyword (defaults to true) reduces numerical; integration errors using the method described in [Izsak:2011:144105] and is; always recommended. Linear Exchange¶; Large SCF calculations can benefit from specialized screening procedures that further reduce the scaling of the ERI contribution to the Fock matrix.; LinK, the linear-scaling exchange method described in [Ochsenfeld:1998:1663], is available in Psi4 in conjunction with composite algorithms that build J (SCF_TYPE set to J_alg+LINK).; LinK achieves linear-scaling by exploiting shell pair sparsity in the density matrix and overlap sparsity between shell pairs. Specifically, LinK exploits the fact that the Exchange term; requires only a linear-scaling number of significant elements through reformulating the; shell quartet screening process to scale linearly with system size.; LinK is most competitive when used with non-diffuse orbital basis sets, since orbital and density overlaps decay slower with diffuse functions.; LinK is especially powerful when combined with density-matrix based ERI screening (set SCREENING to DENSITY) and incremental Fock builds (set INCFOCK to TRUE), which decrease the number of significant two-electron integrals to calculate.; To control the LinK algorithm, here are the list of options provided.

The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations \(N,N+2,\ldots\), invoking; MOM_START N can often rescue the convergence of the SCF. MOM can; be used in concert with DIIS, though care should be taken to not turn MOM on; until the oscillatory behavior begins. Damping [Off by Default]In some cases, a static mixing of Fock Matrices from adjacent; iterations can quench oscillations. This mixing, known as; “damping” can be activated by setting the; DAMPING_PERCENTAGE keyword to a nonzero percent. Damping is; turned off when the DIIS error is smaller than; DAMPING_CONVERGENCE. Level shifting [Off by default]A commonly used alternative to damping is to use level shifting,; which decreases the mixing of occupied and unoccupied orbitals in; the SCF update by moving the unoccupied orbitals up in energy. It; can be shown that the SCF procedure always converges with a; suitably large level shift; however, the larger the shift is, the; slower the convergence becomes, and the calculation may end up; converging onto a higher lying SCF solution. Because of this, in; practice level shifting is most useful in the initial phase of the; calculation to reduce the orbital error enough for DIIS to work; well. The level shift is controlled by the parameter; LEVEL_SHIFT, and it is turned off when the DIIS error is; smaller than LEVEL_SHIFT_CUTOFF. Reasonable values for; the shift and convergence threshold are 5.0 and 1e-2,; respectively. SOSCF [Off by Default]See Second-order Convergence.

COSXAn algorithm based on the semi-numerical “chain of spheres exchange” (COSX); approach described in [Neese:2009:98]. The coulomb term is computed with a; direct density-fitting algorithm. The COSX algorithm uses no I/O, scales; well with system size, and requires minimal memory, making it ideal for; large systems and multi-core CPUs. See COSX Exchange for more information. LINKAn implementation of the linear-scaling “Linear Exchange” (LinK); algorithm described in [Ochsenfeld:1998:1663]. The LINK algorithm provides; many of the benefits of integral-direct SCF algorithms, including no disk I/O,; low memory usage, and effective parallelization. Additionally, the; LINK implementation scales well with system size; while simultaneously providing a formally-exact computation of the; Exchange term. See Linear Exchange for more information. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used.

At; this point, the code switches on the requested Direct integrals technology, which; requires only four full iterations to reach convergence, starting from the DF; guess. This hybrid DF/Direct procedure can significantly accelerate SCF; computations requiring exact integrals.; After the iterations are completed, a number of one-electron properties are; printed, and some bookkeeping is performed to set up possible correlated; computations. Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; PRINT option. Also printed are the occupied and virtual orbital energies,; which are useful in elucidating the stability and reactivity of the system. Theory¶; The objective of Hartree–Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) \(\{\psi_i\}\),. \[\psi_i(\vec x_1) = C_{\mu i} \phi_{\mu} (\vec x_1).\]; Here, \(\{\phi_{\mu}\}\) are the basis functions, which, in PSI4 are; contracted Cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs). The matrix \(C_{\mu i}\) contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree–Fock. The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. \[\begin{split}| \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |\end{split}\]; This form for the Hartree–Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; \(\mathbb{R}^6\) instead of a more complicated effect in; \(\mathbb{R}^N\).; Considering the electronic Hamiltonian,. \[\hat H = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

Because of this, SCF is a nonlinear procedure, which; terminates when the generating orbitals are self-consistent with the Fock matrix; they generate.; The formation of the Coulomb matrix \(J\) and the exchange matrix; \(K^{\alpha}\) dominate the computational effort of the SCF procedure. For; very large systems, diagonalization of the Fock matrix can also present a; significant hurdle. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a Hartree–Fock computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('scf'):; molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('scf').

As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:134108].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; option S_TOLERANCE, which defaults to 1E-7.

SAPSuperposition of Atomic Potentials. This is essentially a; modification of the core Hamiltonian, which includes screening; effects by using a radially screened effective atomic charge. The; screening effects have been calculated at the complete basis set; limit with finite-element calculations, see [Lehtola:2019:25945]; and [Lehtola:2020:012516]. The guess and its implementation have; been described in [Lehtola:2019:1593]. The guess is evaluated on a; DFT quadrature grid, so the guess energy depends slightly on the; used DFT quadrature. The current implementation is based on; exchange-only local density calculations that are but nanohartree; away from the complete basis set limit [Lehtola:2020:012516].

In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword “DF”; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; PSI4‘s internal routines. Expert users can manually switch between MEM_DF and; DISK_DF; however, they may find documented exceptions during use as several; post SCF algorithms require a specific implementation. Additionally, expert users; can manually switch between the in-memory and on-disk options within MEM_DF or DISK_DF using; the SCF_SUBTYPE option.

This keyword is; used to determine the radial extent of the each basis shell, and it is the; COSX analogue to DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE.; The INCFOCK keyword (defaults to false) increases performance; by constructing the Fock matrix from differences in the density matrix, which; are more amenable to screening.

Linear Exchange¶; Large SCF calculations can benefit from specialized screening procedures that further reduce the scaling of the ERI contribution to the Fock matrix.; LinK, the linear-scaling exchange method described in [Ochsenfeld:1998:1663], is available in Psi4 in conjunction with composite algorithms that build J (SCF_TYPE set to J_alg+LINK).; LinK achieves linear-scaling by exploiting shell pair sparsity in the density matrix and overlap sparsity between shell pairs. Specifically, LinK exploits the fact that the Exchange term; requires only a linear-scaling number of significant elements through reformulating the; shell quartet screening process to scale linearly with system size.; LinK is most competitive when used with non-diffuse orbital basis sets, since orbital and density overlaps decay slower with diffuse functions.; LinK is especially powerful when combined with density-matrix based ERI ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used.; This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:134108].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; optio",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

The resulting unrestricted wavefunction; will often provide superior energetics, due to the increased flexibility,; but it will suffer non-physical spin contamination from higher multiplicity states.; A convenient approach to break symmetry is to perform a UHF or UKS calculation; with the guess HOMO and LUMO orbitals mixed.; Mixing of the guess orbitals can be requested by setting the GUESS_MIX; keyword to true:; set reference uhf; set guess_mix true; energy('scf'). Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. COREDiagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems. This is the default for single atoms. SAD [Default]Superposition of Atomic Densities. Builds the initial density as the; spin-averaged sum of atomic UHF computations in the current basis. If an; open-shell system, uniform scaling of the spin-averaged density matrices is; performed. If orbitals are needed (e.g., in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems. This is the default for; systems of more than one atom. SADNONatural orbitals from Superposition of Atomic Densities.

READRead the previous orbitals from a wfn file, casting from; one basis to another if needed. Useful for starting anion; computations from neutral orbitals, or after small geometry; changes. At present, casting from a different molecular point; group is not supported. This becomes the default for the second; and later iterations of geometry optimizations. SAPSuperposition of Atomic Potentials. This is essentially a; modification of the core Hamiltonian, which includes screening; effects by using a radially screened effective atomic charge. The; screening effects have been calculated at the complete basis set; limit with finite-element calculations, see [Lehtola:2019:25945]; and [Lehtola:2020:012516]. The guess and its implementation have; been described in [Lehtola:2019:1593]. The guess is evaluated on a; DFT quadrature grid, so the guess energy depends slightly on the; used DFT quadrature.

The potential in; the SAPGAU scheme is passed with the SAPGAU_BASIS; keyword. The default potential is given by the large fit to the; HelFEM potential, sap_helfem_large, described in; [Lehtola:2020:144105]. Note that this guess is known in the DIRAC; program as .SCRPOT and in the ERKALE program as SAPFIT. These are all set by the GUESS keyword. Also, an automatic Python; procedure has been developed for converging the SCF in a small basis, and then; casting up to the true basis. This can be done by adding; BASIS_GUESS = SMALL_BASIS to the options list. We recommend the; 3-21G or pcseg-0 basis for the small basis due to its efficient mix of flexibility and; compactness. An example of performing an RHF solution of water by SAD guessing; in a 3-21G basis and then casting up to cc-pVTZ is shown below:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set {; basis cc-pvtz; basis_guess 3-21G; guess sad; }. energy('scf'). Restarting the SCF¶; Reading orbital data from a previous calculations is done via the restart_file option,; where the actual file is a serialized wfn object (see saving the wfn); By default, the orbital data file of the converged SCF(psi.PID.name.180.npy) is deleted; after PSI4 exits or the clean() function is called. The orbital guess is automatically; set to READ when restart_file is given a wfn file.; To write the orbitals after every iteration and keep the orbitals from the last iteration, the write_orbitals options is available:; energy('scf', write_orbitals='my_mos'),. which writes a Wavefunction object converted (serialized) to a numpy file called my_mos.npy.; The restart can then be done as follows:; energy('scf', restart_file='my_mos').

For advanced users manipulating or writing custom wavefunction files, note; that PSI4 expects the numpy file on disk to have the .npy extension, not, e.g., .npz. Convergence Stabilization¶; A summary of Psi’s supported convergence stabilization techniques is presented below:. DIIS [On by Default]DIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock matrix together; with an error criterion based on the orbital gradient to produce an informed; estimate of the next Fock Matrix. DIIS is almost always necessary to converge; the SCF procedure and is therefore turned on by default. In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via options. ADIIS [On by Default]ADIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock and density matrices to produce an; informed estimate of the next Fock matrix. ADIIS estimates are based on minimizing; an energy estimate rather than zeroing the residual, so this performs best in the early; iterations. By default, Psi will start using ADIIS before blending the ADIIS step with; the DIIS step, eventually using the pure DIIS step. The closely-related EDIIS procedure; may be used instead by setting SCF_INITIAL_ACCELERATOR. This is formally identical; to ADIIS for HF, but the methods will differ for more general DFT. MOM [Off by Default]MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations. Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is typically v",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is typically visible in the output as a non-converging; SCF which eventually settles down to steady oscillation between two (or more); different total energies. This behavior can be ameliorated by choosing occupied; orbitals by “shape” instead of by orbital eigenvalue, i.e., by choosing the set; of new orbitals which looks most like some previously known “good” set. The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations \(N,N+2,\ldots\), invoking; MOM_START N can often rescue the convergence of",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

ERI Algorithms¶; The key difficulty in the SCF procedure is treatment of the four-index ERI; contributions to the Fock Matrix. A number of algorithms are available in; PSI4 for these terms. The algorithm is selected by the SCF_TYPE; keyword. Most consist of a single algorithm applied to; the construction of both the Coulomb and Exchange parts; of the Fock Matrix:.

Restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) [Default]Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical. Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF)Appropriate for most open-shell systems and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the \(\hat S^2\) operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to a; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem. Restricted Open-Shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF)Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical). Constrained Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (CUHF)A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used.; This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:134108].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; optio",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

If the smallest; eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical orthogonalization is; forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues below the; cutoff are eliminated.; If the eigendecomposition is detected to be numerically unstable - the; reciprocal condition number of the overlap matrix to be smaller than; the machine epsilon - the partial Cholesky decomposition is undertaken; until S_CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE, which defaults to 1E-8.; Use of symmetric, canonical, and partial Cholesky orthogonalization; can be forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to; SYMMETRIC, CANONICAL, or PARTIALCHOLESKY,; respectively.; Note that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within; each irrep from the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as; Unique Symmetry Orbitals (USOs).

CDA threaded algorithm using approximate ERIs obtained by Cholesky; decomposition of the ERI tensor. The accuracy of the Cholesky; decomposition is controlled by the keyword CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE.; This algorithm is similar to the DF algorithm, but it is not suitable; for gradient computations. The algorithm to obtain the Cholesky; vectors is not designed for computations with thousands of basis; functions. PSI4 also features the capability to use “composite” Fock matrix build; algorithms - arbitrary combinations of specialized algorithms that construct; either the Coulomb or the Exchange matrix separately. In general, since; separate Coulomb and Exchange matrix build algorithms exploit properties specific to; their respective matrix, composite algorithms display lower; scaling factors than their combined Fock build counterparts. However, composite algorithms also; introduce redundant ERI computations into the calculation. Therefore, composite Fock build; algorithms tend to perform better for larger systems, but worse for smaller systems. Arbitrary; composite algorithms can be accessed by setting SCF_TYPE to J_alg+K_alg,; where J_alg and K_alg are the names of the separate Coulomb; and Exchange construction algorithms to use, respectively. Alternatively, if one is using; DFT with non-hybrid functionals, a composite Coulomb construction algorithm can be; specified solo by setting SCF_TYPE to J_alg, without the need to set; an associated K_alg.; Specialized algorithms available to construct the Coulomb term within a composite framework; are as follows:. DFDIRJAn integral-direct algorithm constructing the Coulomb term based on [Weigend:2002:4285]; The DFDIRJ algorithm combines the benefits of integral-direct SCF approaches; with that of density-fitting.

The COSX algorithm uses no I/O, scales; well with system size, and requires minimal memory, making it ideal for; large systems and multi-core CPUs. See COSX Exchange for more information. LINKAn implementation of the linear-scaling “Linear Exchange” (LinK); algorithm described in [Ochsenfeld:1998:1663]. The LINK algorithm provides; many of the benefits of integral-direct SCF algorithms, including no disk I/O,; low memory usage, and effective parallelization. Additionally, the; LINK implementation scales well with system size; while simultaneously providing a formally-exact computation of the; Exchange term. See Linear Exchange for more information. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword “DF”; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; PSI4‘s internal routines. Expert users can manually switch between MEM_DF and; DISK_DF; however, they may find documented exceptions during use as several; post SCF algorithms require a spec",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

To turn on this option, set INCFOCK to true.; We have added the automatic capability to use the extremely fast DF; code for intermediate convergence of the orbitals, for SCF_TYPE; DIRECT. At the moment, the code defaults to cc-pVDZ-JKFIT as the; auxiliary basis, unless the user specifies DF_BASIS_SCF manually. For; some atoms, cc-pVDZ-JKFIT is not defined, so a very large fitting basis of last; resort will be used.; To avoid this, either set DF_BASIS_SCF to an auxiliary; basis set defined for all atoms in the system, or set DF_SCF_GUESS; to false, which disables this acceleration entirely. Integral-Direct Density-Fitted Coulomb Construction¶; The Resolution of the Identity (RI) can be used to decompose the normally 4-center ERI tensor into a combination of 3-center and 2-center components.; By reducing the dimensionality of the ERI tensor, application of the RI (often referred to as density-fitting, or DF) can be used to greatly speed up; SCF calculations. The reduction in ERI tensor rank also makes DF an appealing option for conventional SCF calculations, where the ERIs are stored; in core or on disk. However, even when using DF, I/O becomes a significant bottleneck for systems of a sufficient size when performing conventional SCF; calculations. In principle, though, DF approaches can be utilized in an integral-direct context, gaining the benefits of DF methods without suffering the; I/O bottlenecks that conventional DF methods will eventually run into. One such approach, outlined ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess, and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS;; the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS. Note; Setting the option STABILITY_ANALYSIS to FOLLOW is only avalible for UHF. When using; RHF and ROHF instabilities can be checked, but not followed. If you want to attempt to find a lower energy solution; you should re-run the calculation with REFERENCE set to UHF. The main algorithm available in PSI4 is the Direct Inversion algorithm. It can only; work with SCF_TYPE PK, and it explicitly builds the full electronic Hessian; matrix before explicitly inverting it. As such, this algorithm is very slow and it should; be avoided whenever possible. Direct Inversion is automatically invoked if the newer algorithm; is not available.; The Davidson algorithm for stability analysis was implemented recently.; Only the lowest eigenvalues of the electronic Hessian are computed, and Hessian-vector; products are computed instead of the full Hessian.

The; rows are composed of the atomic charge, x coordinate, y coordinate,; and z coordinate in that order. The atomic charge and coordinates are; specified in atomic units, [e] and [a0]. Add as many particle rows as; needed to describe the full MM region. Caution; In PSI4 previous to Spring 2022 and v1.6, setting an; external potential like the above looked like; Chrgfield = QMMM(); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge(-0.834, 1.649232019048, 0.0, -2.356023604706); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge( 0.417, 0.",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; PRINT option. Also printed are the occupied and virtual orbital energies,; which are useful in elucidating the stability and reactivity of the system. Theory¶; The objective of Hartree–Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) \(\{\psi_i\}\),. \[\psi_i(\vec x_1) = C_{\mu i} \phi_{\mu} (\vec x_1).\]; Here, \(\{\phi_{\mu}\}\) are the basis functions, which, in PSI4 are; contracted Cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs). The matrix \(C_{\mu i}\) contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree–Fock. The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. \[\begin{split}| \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |\end{split}\]; This form for the Hartree–Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; \(\mathbb{R}^6\) instead of a more complicated effect in; \(\mathbb{R}^N\).; Considering the electronic Hamiltonian,. \[\hat H = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \sum_{i} \sum_{A} -; \frac{Z_A}{r_{iA}} + \sum_{i>j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}},\]; the Hartree–Fock energy is, by Slater’s rules,. \[E_{\mathrm{HF}} =; \langle \Psi_0 | \hat H | \Psi_0 \rangle; = \sum_{i} \langle i | \hat h | i \rangle; + \frac 1 2 \sum_{i,j} [ii|jj] - [ij",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

Warning; Prior to Dec 2022, v1.7, Psi4 had a different set of keywords controlling instability analysis, and those were included in the CPHF module rather than the SCF module. Warning; Extending Davidson instability analysis to Kohn-Sham references is under development. As of 1.7, only LDA functionals are currently supported. In case convergence problems are encountered during the Davidson procedure, file a bug report.; If the solver seems to converge on the wrong eigenvalue, try increasing SOLVER_N_GUESS.; Otherwise, if the solver is almost converged but reaches the maximum number of iterations, try increasing; SOLVER_MAXITER. Effective core potentials (ECPs)¶; PSI4 supports the use of effective core potentials to describe the; innermost electrons in heavy elements.; ECPs are only available if PSI4 is compiled with the LibECPInt library.; If a basis set is designed to use an; effective core potential, the ECP definition should be simply placed alongside; the orbital basis set definition, c.f. Inputting effective core potentials (ECPs). All; information related to the definition and number of core electrons will; automatically be detected and no further input is required to use the; ECP-containing basis set. See scf-ecp and dfmp2-ecp; for examples of computations with ECP-containing basis sets. Warning; Prior to May 2022, v1.6, Psi4 used a built-in ECP code. Analytic derivatives of ECPs were not available. The HF and DFT derivatives were implemented in a semi-numerical scheme, where numerical ECP gradients were added to analytic SCF gradients. For post-SCF methods, the entire gradient computation needed to be run as finite difference of energies. Warning; As of May 2022, v1.6, Psi4 uses the LibECPInt library, and analytic derivatives and Hessians of ECPs are available. Analytic derivatives of molecular systems including ECPs should be available whenever the method has analytic derivatives, but t",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/scf.html

Recommendations¶; The SCF code is quite flexible and powerful.; We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your orbital basis/atom type. Then use; DIRECT.; Don’t mess with the DIIS convergence options unless convergence is a problem.; We have optimized the parameters for efficiency over a wide array of system; types.; Buy a developer a beer!.

Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation; Embarrassing Parallelism. Embarrassing Parallelism¶; Many of the tasks automated by Python wrappers consist of a number of; independent PSI4 calculations and are thus suited to an embarrassingly; parallel mode of operation. In Psithon, these have been dubbed sow/reap; procedures and have the following general structure. Prepare an input file, simply adding mode='sow' to the; argument list of an available Python function. Run this quick job to; produce input files for lengthier calculations.; According to the instructions in the output file of the above step,; run the generated input files in any order on any variety of computers; and architectures.

Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #! Optimize H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'). This should perform a series of gradient computations. The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation and grep-able with ~), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; Step Total Energy Delta E MAX Force RMS Force MAX Disp RMS Disp ~; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; 1 -76.026632734857 -76.026632734857 0.01523505 0.01245744 0.02742199 0.02277500 ~; 2 -76.027022668419 -0.000389933562 0.00178749 0.00142923 0.01007985 0.00594840 ~; 3 -76.027032729361 -0.000010060942 0.00014016 0.00008485 0.00077279 0",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/tutorial.html

However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True, dertype=1). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements. From this, it can obtain the harmonic vibrational; frequencies, given below (roundoff errors of around 0.1 cm-1; may exist):; Irrep Harmonic Frequency; (cm-1); -----------------------------------------------; A1 1775.6480; A1 4113.3794; B2 4212.1826; -----------------------------------------------. Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1775.65; Force constant: 0.1193; X Y Z mass; O 0.000 0.000 -0.270 15.994915; H 0.000 0.417 0.538 1.007825; H 0.000 -0.417 0.538 1.007825. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate.

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1775.65; Force constant: 0.1193; X Y Z mass; O 0.000 0.000 -0.270 15.994915; H 0.000 0.417 0.538 1.007825; H 0.000 -0.417 0.538 1.007825. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate.

Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”.

A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want.

Note; Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with PSI4. In; Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language; (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then; submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into; pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure; Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind; the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any “.in” or “.dat” extension by “.out”).

This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together.

The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements.

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

If it works, it should print; the final energy as; @UHF Final Energy: -38.92533462456894. Notice we added a new keyword, set reference uhf, to the input. For; open-shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree–Fock, or UHF), or restricted orbitals (restricted; open-shell Hartree–Fock, or ROHF).

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics; analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation.; You can see this in the next section of the output file. The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases.

This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = energy('ccsd(t)', bsse_type='cp'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index. Note we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. The built-in; Psithon function nbody() does it all for us, automatically.; Near the very end of the output file, the counterpoise correction Python; function will print a nice summary of the results of the counterpoise; computation (the energies of the dimer, of monomer 1 with the ghost functions; of monomer 2, of monomer 2 with the ghost functions of monomer 1, and the; overall counterpoise-corrected interaction energy):; N-Body: Computing complex (1/2) with fragments (2,) in the basis of fragments (1, 2).; ...; N-Body: Complex Energy (fragments = (2,), basis = (1, 2): -128.70932405488924); ...; N-Body: Computing complex (2/2) with fragments (1,",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/tutorial.html

Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse \(d\) functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10]. So,; we’ll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to; use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors; while providing much faster computations [Hohenstein:2010:184111]; [Hohenstein:2010:014101]. Since we’re using density fitting for the SAPT,; we might as well also use it for the Hartree–Fock computations that are; performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that with; scf_type DF.; Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that; pair with the primary basis set. Fortunately, PSI4 is usually smart; enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given; computation. In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set; (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set); that PSI4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT; auxiliary basis for the Hartree–Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set; for the SAPT procedure.; To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to; freeze the core electrons with freeze_core True.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances.

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it’s important to keep in mind that; the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular; geometry. Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies; at the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We could set up a second input file to perform; the vibrational frequency analysis, being very careful to copy over the; optimized geometry from the bottom of the output file for the geometry; optimization. This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True, dertype=1). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements. From this, it can obtain the harmonic vibrational; frequencies, given below (roundoff errors of around 0.1 cm-1; may exist):; Irrep Harmonic Frequency; (cm-1); -----------------------------------------------; A1 1775.6480; A1 4113.3794; B2 4212.1826; -----------------------------------------------.

Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals.

Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name.

Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples. A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory.

If everything goes well, the computation should complete and should report; a final restricted Hartree–Fock energy in a section like this:; Energy converged. @RHF Final Energy: -76.02663273410671. By default, the energy should be converged to about \(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\), so agreement; is only expected for about the first 6 digits after the decimal. If the; computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the; compilation or installation of the program (see the installation; instructions in Sec. Compiling and Installing from Source).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3).

Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B.

In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as . In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation. As a consequence,; the pre-factor in the polynomial scaling becomes far larger than that; of the CIS(D) even though the quasi-degeneracy of the excited state is; properly accounted for in the ADC(2) model.; In PSI4 the quite efficient and flexible integral-transformation; library named libtrans is newly equipped and utilized in the; production level DCFT code. The ADC code is also based on; libtrans, and it is also based on libdpd, a library to; utilize molecular symmetry in the tensorial manipulations in framework; of the direct-product decomposition algorithm. By this feature, the Ritz; space and intermediate tensors are blocked according to the irreducible; representations of the point group, and the excited states that belong; to different symmetry are sought separately.; In the output of ADC, the ADC(2) results may look as follows:; -> 1 B1 state : 0.2565095 (a.u.), 6.9799824 (eV); Non-iterative: 0.2565636 (a.u.), 6.9814532 (eV); Occ Vir Coefficient; ---------------------------------------------; 3 0 -0.9017047264; 3 2 0.3038332241; 3 1 0.2907567119; 3 5 -0.0790167706; 3 4 -0.0425829926.
