as agreed, merging since master was green

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Data:

Content: of prefixing messages with a string to indicate the origin, e.g. when you logged from MnHesse, messages would be prefixed with ""MnHesse:"". Inside ``MnHesse``, to stay with the example, you might have seen code like this; ```c++; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some foo happened"");; [...]; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; Setting the prefix by hand was error prone and repetetive and made the logging code more distractive from the actual code. Especially now, since all the debug messages should also have this prefix, I wanted to automate this. So I turned MnPrint into a class that one can instantiate with a prefix for a given scope.; ```c++; MnPrint print(""MnHesse""); // appears once at the beginning of a long method; [...]; print.Info(""Some foo happened"");; [...]; print.Info(""Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; print.Info(""Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; The method ``MnPrint::Info`` uses the prefix set in the MnPrint ctor. The ctor of MnPrint also has an optional argument to print with a local print level. If this is not set, the global print level is used. In the long run (not in this patch), we should get rid of the global print level, because global mutable variables are difficult to reason about and in particular do not play nice with multi-threading. This design prepares for that step.; * I generally made sure that the logging messages contain the same information as the previous ones, but I reduced excess whitespace and improved the formatting. Some debug messages added several empty lines to the output, which made the logs hard to read.; * In very few isolated cases I removed redundant messages. I did this only when two messages printed the same information in succession.; * In a few cases, I changed debug output so that variables are printed in one line that were printed in several lines. A log is easier to grep and scroll through when variables are on the same line as the prefix.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing architecture tactics in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to categorize text according to software architecture tactics, quality attributes, and responses.

Given a piece of text related to software architecture, your task is to:
1. Identify the specific tactic being described
2. Provide a clear ""response"" which in the context of software architecture refers to the activity undertaken by the system (for runtime qualities) or the developers (for development-time qualities) as a result of the arrival of a stimulus

Analyze the following text:
> I'd prefer to put the message last, because the message might be multi-line. That's a good argument. Thinking about [what I'm using RLogger for in RDF](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6828) I tend to agree with @pcanal, users won't care about what source code line the `Info` messages come from (and if they really do, they are one grep away) but devs would hate to have to grep for a given Error/Fatal/Warning every time.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

If I do not set the affinity, Linux puts them both on the same CPU and thus the DAQ readout performance is reduced. (That being said, it's true that this feature could be expanded to Windows and MacOS, however I do not have any of these OS to test it.)

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

",True,"The discussion focuses on performance optimizations in random number generators, which is a low-level concern. However, this directly impacts the design and implementation of algorithms that might be used in larger systems, affecting their overall performance, scalability, and maintainability. Such optimizations are part of software architecture considerations when designing high-performance applications.","
You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing architecture tactics in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to categorize text according to software architecture tactics, quality attributes, and responses.

Given a piece of text related to software architecture, your task is to:
1. Identify the specific tactic being described
2. Provide a clear ""response"" which in the context of software architecture refers to the activity undertaken by the system (for runtime qualities) or the developers (for development-time qualities) as a result of the arrival of a stimulus

Analyze the following text:
@Axel-Naumann yes, testing is one of the motivations, in particular continuous testing to prevent future regressions (now we can check against an external implementation, instead of just copying the current values and declaring them ""known-good""). The other reason, and why I think this might provide benefit for users, is performance: The original RANLUX implementation by James (at least its implementation in GSL) needs 40 seconds to sum 1 million numbers at luxury level 3, `gsl_rng_ranlux389` (luxury level 4) takes a bit more than 1 minute. The same sequence takes less than 8 seconds with `RanluxppCompatEngineJamesP[34]`, respectively (due to the LCG, you don't even pay for higher decorrelation!).; The difference is even larger for `std::ranlux48` (used directly, not through `std::uniform_real_distribution` which eats up more than one number per iteration): 2m55s compared to 12 seconds with `RanluxppCompatEngineStdRanlux48`. And because we can generate the same sequence, switching the generator won't change the output of a simulation / analysis / ... (only the interface is slightly different).

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
