Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Supposing the geometry was loaded into memory, besides the first method that still applies one can also edit drawn geometry objects. For this, the menu entry View/Editor of the canvas containing for instance a drawn volume must be activated. For starting the volume editor one can click on a volume. The GUI of the TGeoManager class can be started by clicking on the top-right 40x40 pixels corner of the pad with a drawn geometry.; This is the main entry point for editing the geometry or creating new objects. Once the interface is created (using one of the methods described above), several categories can be accessed via a shutter GUI widget:. General. This allows changing the name/title of the geometry, setting the top volume, closing the geometry and saving the geometry in a file. The file name is formed by geometry_name.C or .root depending if the geometry need to be saved as a C macro or a .root file.; Shapes. The category provides buttons for creation of all supported shapes. The new shape name is chosen by the interface, but can be changed from the shape editor GUI. Existing shapes can be browsed and edited from the same category.; Volumes. The category allows the creation of a new volume having a given name, shape and medium. For creating a volume assembly only the name is relevant. Existing volumes can be browsed or edited from this category.; Materials. Allows creation of new materials/mixtures or editing existing ones.; Media. The same for creation/editing of tracking media (materials having a set of properties related to tracking); Matrices.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Tactic descriptions:
- Ping/Echo: (quality attribute 'Availability', category 'Detect Faults') An asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes to determine reachability and responsiveness.
