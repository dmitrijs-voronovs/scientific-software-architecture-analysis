Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Security,"re identified in the folder hierarchy by an “UNIX-like” naming convention. The base of all folders is //root. It is visible at the top of the left panel in the browser. The browser shows several folders under //root.; New folders can be added and removed to/from a folder.; 10.2 Why Use Folders?; One reason to use folders is to reduce class dependencies and improve modularity.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.

- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Concept of Tactic, Quality Attribute, and Response:
- An architectural tactic is a design decision that directly affects a system's response to a stimulus, influencing the achievement of a quality attribute. The primary purpose of tactics is to achieve desired quality attributes by imparting specific qualities to a design.
- The concept of ""response"" is central to this relationship. When a stimulus occurs, quality attribute requirements define the desired response. Tactics are employed to control these responses, ensuring the system exhibits behavior that satisfies particular quality attribute requirements.
- Different tactics can achieve different quality attributes, sometimes with multiple tactics improving a single quality attribute. Architectural patterns can be viewed as ""packages"" of tactics that work together to address recurring design problems.

Available Quality Attributes:
- Availability: the ability of a system to be available for use, particularly by masking or repairing faults to minimize service outage.
- Interoperability: the ability of a system to exchange information and function with other systems in a shared environment.
- Modifiability: the ease with which changes can be made to a system to accommodate new features, adapt to new environments, or fix bugs.
- Performance: concerns the timing behavior of a system and its ability to meet timing requirements in response to events.
- Security: the degree to which a system protects information and data from unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Testability: the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through testing.
- Usability: describes how easy it is for users to accomplish desired tasks with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- Energy Efficiency: relates to the minimization of energy consumption by the software system and its underlying hardware.
