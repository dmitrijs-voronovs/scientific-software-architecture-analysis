QuTiP 5 is a redesign of many of the core components of QuTiP (``Qobj``,; ``QobjEvo``, solvers) to make them more consistent and more flexible. ``Qobj`` may now be stored in either sparse or dense representations,; and the two may be mixed sensibly as needed. ``QobjEvo`` is now used; consistently throughout QuTiP, and the implementation has been; substantially cleaned up. A new ``Coefficient`` class is used to; represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``.

Previously ``Qobj`` data was stored in a SciPy-like sparse matrix. Now the; representation is flexible. Implementations for dense and sparse formats are; included in QuTiP and custom implementations are possible. QuTiP's performance; on dense states and operators is significantly improved as a result. Some highlights:. - The data is still acessible via the ``.data`` attribute, but is now an; instance of the underlying data type instead of a SciPy-like sparse matrix.; The operations available in ``qutip.core.data`` may be used on ``.data``,; regardless of the data type.; - ``Qobj`` with different data types may be mixed in arithmetic and other; operations. A sensible output type will be automatically determined.; - The new ``.to(...)`` method may be used to convert a ``Qobj`` from one data type; to another. E.g. ``.to(""dense"")`` will convert to the dense representation and; ``.to(""csr"")`` will convert to the sparse type.; - Many ``Qobj`` methods and methods that create ``Qobj`` now accepted a ``dtype``; parameter that allows the data type of the returned ``Qobj`` to specified.; - The new ``&`` operator may be used to obtain the tensor product.; - The new ``@`` operator may be used to obtain the matrix / operator product.; ``bar @ ket`` re",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0

Once installed, qutip-qip is available as either ``qutip.qip`` or ``qutip_qip``. Some widely useful gates have been retained in ``qutip.gates``.; - ``qutip.control`` has been moved to qutip-qtrl and once installed qutip-qtrl is available as either ``qutip.control`` or ``qutip_qtrl``. Note that ``quitp_qtrl`` is provided primarily for backwards compatibility. Improvements to optimal control will take place in the new ``qutip_qoc`` package.; - ``qutip.lattice`` has been moved into its own package, qutip-lattice. It is available from `<https://github.com/qutip/qutip-lattice>`.; - ``qutip.sparse`` has been removed. It contained the old sparse matrix representation and is replaced by the new implementation in ``qutip.data``.; - ``qutip.piqs`` functions are no longer available from the ``qutip`` namespace. They are accessible from ``qutip.piqs`` instead. ## Miscellaneous. - Support has been added for 64-bit integer sparse matrix indices, allowing; sparse matrices with up to 2**63 rows and columns. This support needs to; be enabled at compilation time by calling ``setup.py`` and passing; ``--with-idxint-64``. ### Feature removals. - Support for OpenMP has been removed. If there is enough demand and a good plan for how to organize it, OpenMP support may return in a future QuTiP release.; - The ``qutip.parfor`` function has been removed. Use ``qutip.parallel_map`` instead.; - ``qutip.graph`` has been removed and replaced by SciPy's graph functions.; - ``qutip.topology`` has been removed. It contained only one function ``berry_curvature``.; - The ``~/.qutip/qutiprc`` config file is no longer supported.

Qobj changes; ------------. Previously ``Qobj`` data was stored in a SciPy-like sparse matrix. Now the representation is flexible. Implementations for dense and sparse formats are included in QuTiP and custom implementations are possible. QuTiP's performance on dense states and operators is significantly improved as a result. Some highlights:. - The data is still acessible via the ``.data`` attribute, but is now an instance of the underlying data type instead of a SciPy-like sparse matrix. The operations available in ``qutip.core.data`` may be used on ``.data``, regardless of the data type.; - ``Qobj`` with different data types may be mixed in arithmetic and other operations. A sensible output type will be automatically determined.; - The new ``.to(...)`` method may be used to convert a ``Qobj`` from one data type to another. E.g. ``.to(""dense"")`` will convert to the dense representation and ``.to(""csr"")`` will convert to the sparse type.; - Many ``Qobj`` methods and methods that create ``Qobj`` now accepted a ``dtype`` parameter that allows the data type of the returned ``Qobj`` to specified.; - The new ``&`` operator may be used to obtain the tensor product.; - The new ``@`` operator may be used to obtain the matrix / operator product. ``bar @ ket`` returns a scalar.; - The new ``.contract()`` method will collapse 1D subspaces of the dimensions of the ``Qobj``.; - The new ``.logm()`` method returns the matrix logarithm of an operator.; - The methods ``.set_data``, ``.get_data``, ``.extr",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0a1

Qobj changes; ------------. Previously ``Qobj`` data was stored in a SciPy-like sparse matrix. Now the representation is flexible. Implementations for dense and sparse formats are included in QuTiP and custom implementations are possible. QuTiP's performance on dense states and operators is significantly improved as a result. Some highlights:. - The data is still acessible via the ``.data`` attribute, but is now an instance of the underlying data type instead of a SciPy-like sparse matrix. The operations available in ``qutip.core.data`` may be used on ``.data``, regardless of the data type.; - ``Qobj`` with different data types may be mixed in arithmetic and other operations. A sensible output type will be automatically determined.; - The new ``.to(...)`` method may be used to convert a ``Qobj`` from one data type to another. E.g. ``.to(""dense"")`` will convert to the dense representation and ``.to(""csr"")`` will convert to the sparse type.; - Many ``Qobj`` methods and methods that create ``Qobj`` now accepted a ``dtype`` parameter that allows the data type of the returned ``Qobj`` to specified.; - The new ``&`` operator may be used to obtain the tensor product.; - The new ``@`` operator may be used to obtain the matrix / operator product. ``bar @ ket`` returns a s",MatchSource.RELEASES,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases/tag/v5.0.0a1

It only works on time-independent systems and is slow to setup, but once the diagonalization is complete, it generates solutions very quickly.; - QuTiP's own implementatoin of an approximate Krylov subspace integrator is available as ``krylov``. This integrator is only usable with ``sesolve``. Result class:. - A new ``.e_data`` attribute provides expectation values as a dictionary. Unlike ``.expect``, the values are provided in a Python list rather than a numpy array, which better supports non-numeric types.; - The contents of the ``.stats`` attribute changed significantly and is now more consistent across solvers. Monte-Carlo Solver (mcsolve):. - The system, H, may now be a super-operator.; - The ``seed`` parameter now supports supplying numpy ``SeedSequence`` or ``Generator`` types.; - The new ``timeout`` and ``target_tol`` parameters allow the solver to exit early if a timeout or target tolerance is reached.; - The ntraj option no longer supports a list of numbers of trajectories. Instead, just run the solver multiple times and use the class ``MCSolver`` if setting up the solver uses a significant amount of time.; - The ``map_func`` parameter has been replaced by the ``map`` option. In addition to the existing ``serial`` and ``parallel`` values, the value ``loky`` may be supplied to use the loky package to parallelize trajectories.; - The result returned by ``mcsolve`` now supports calculating photocurrents and calculating the steady state over N trajectories.; - The old ``parfor`` parallel execution function has been removed from ``qutip.parallel``.

Package reorganization; ----------------------. - ``qutip.qip`` has been moved into its own package, qutip-qip. Once installed, qutip-qip is available as either ``qutip.qip`` or ``qutip_qip``. Some widely useful gates have been retained in ``qutip.gates``.; - ``qutip.lattice`` has been moved into its own package, qutip-lattice.

It contained the old sparse matrix representation and is replaced by the new implementation in ``qutip.data``.; - ``qutip.piqs`` functions are no longer available from the ``qutip`` namespace. They are accessible from ``qutip.piqs`` instead. Miscellaneous; -------------. - Support has been added for 64-bit integer sparse matrix indices, allowing sparse matrices with up to 2**63 rows and columns. This support needs to be enabled at compilation time by calling ``setup.py`` and passing ``--with-idxint-64``. Feature removals; ----------------. - Support for OpenMP has been removed.

Testability,test,testing,"`` class is used to represent the time-dependent factors inside ``QobjEvo``. The solvers have been rewritten to work well with the new data layer and the concept of ``Integrators`` which solve ODEs has been introduced. In future, new data layers may provide their own ``Integrators`` specialized to their representation of the underlying data. Much of the user-facing API of QuTiP remains familiar, but there have had to be many small breaking changes. If we can make changes to easy migrating code from QuTiP 4 to QuTiP 5, please let us know. Any extensive list of changes follows. Contributors; ------------. QuTiP 5 has been a large effort by many people over the last three years. In particular:. - Jake Lishman led the implementation of the new data layer and coefficients.; - Eric Giguère led the implementation of the new QobjEvo interface and solvers.; - Boxi Li led the updating of QuTiP's QIP support and the creation of ``qutip_qip``. Other members of the QuTiP Admin team have been heavily involved in reviewing, testing and designing QuTiP 5:. - Alexander Pitchford; - Asier Galicia; - Nathan Shammah; - Shahnawaz Ahmed; - Neill Lambert; - Simon Cross. Two Google Summer of Code contributors updated the tutorials and benchmarks to QuTiP 5:. - Christian Staufenbiel updated many of the tutorials (https://github.com/qutip/qutip-tutorials/).; - Xavier Sproken update the benchmarks (https://github.com/qutip/qutip-benchmark/).

Usability,progress bar,progress bar,"e been heavily reworked and standardized. Under the hood solvers now make use of swappable ODE ``Integrators``. Many ``Integrators`` are included (see the list below) and custom implementations are possible. Solvers now consistently accept a ``QobjEvo`` instance at the Hamiltonian or Liouvillian, or any object which can be passed to the ``QobjEvo`` constructor. A breakdown of highlights follows. All solvers:. - Solver options are now supplied in an ordinary Python dict. ``qutip.Options`` is deprecated and returns a dict for backwards compatibility.; - A specific ODE integrator may be selected by supplying a ``method`` option.; - Each solver provides a class interface. Creating an instance of the class allows a solver to be run multiple times for the same system without having to repeatedly reconstruct the right-hand side of the ODE to be integrated.; - A ``QobjEvo`` instance is accepted for most operators, e.g., ``H``, ``c_ops``, ``e_ops``, ``a_ops``.; - The progress bar is now selected using the ``progress_bar`` option. A new progess bar using the ``tqdm`` Python library is provided.; - Dynamic arguments, where the value of an operator depends on the current state of the evolution, have been removed. They may be re-implemented later if there is demand for them. Integrators:. - The SciPy zvode integrator is available with the BDF and Adams methods as ``bdf`` and ``adams``.; - The SciPy dop853 integrator (an eighth order Runge-Kutta method by Dormand & Prince) is available as ``dop853``.; - The SciPy lsoda integrator is available as ``lsoda``.; - QuTiP's own implementation of Verner's ""most efficient"" Runge-Kutta methods of order 7 and 9 are available as ``vern7`` and ``vern9``. See http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jverner/ for a description of the methods.; - QuTiP's own implementation of a solver that directly diagonalizes the the system to be integrated is available as ``diag``.

Availability,fault,faults,"This minor release adds support for numpy 1.22 and Python 3.10 and removes some blockers for running QuTiP on the Apple M1. The performance of the ``enr_destroy``, ``state_number_enumerate`` and ``hadamard_transform`` functions was drastically improved (up to 70x or 200x faster in some common cases), and support for the drift Hamiltonian was added to the ``qutip.qip`` ``Processor``. The ``qutip.hardware_info`` module was removed as part of adding support for the Apple M1. We hope the removal of this little-used module does not adversely affect many users -- it was largely unrelated to QuTiP's core functionality and its presence was a continual source of blockers to importing ``qutip`` on new or changed platforms. A new check on the dimensions of ``Qobj``'s were added to prevent segmentation faults when invalid shape and dimension combinations were passed to Cython code. In addition, there were many small bugfixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to our building and testing processes.

Performance,load,loading,"This release brings improvements for qubit circuits, including a pulse scheduler, measurement statistics, reading/writing OpenQASM and optimisations in the circuit simulations. This is the first release to have full binary wheel releases on pip; you can now do ``pip install qutip`` on almost any machine to get a correct version of the package without needing any compilers set up. The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too.

(by **Jake Lishman**). Deprecations; ------------; - ``eseries``, ``essolve`` and ``ode2es`` are all deprecated, pending removal in QuTiP 5.0. These are legacy functions and classes that have been left unmaintained for a long time, and their functionality is now better achieved with ``QobjEvo`` or ``mesolve``. Developer Changes; -----------------; - **MAJOR** Overhaul of setup and packaging code to make it satisfy PEP 517, and move the build to a matrix on GitHub Actions in order to release binary wheels on pip for all major platforms and supported Python versions. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Default arguments in ``Qobj`` are now ``None`` rather than mutable types. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Fixed comsumable iterators being used to parametrise some tests, preventing the testing suite from being re-run within the same session. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Remove unused imports, simplify some floats and remove unnecessary list conversions. (by **jakobjakobson13**); - Improve Travis jobs matrix for specifying the testing containers. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Fix coverage reporting on Travis. (by **Jake Lishman**); - Added a ``pyproject.toml`` file. (by **Simon Humpohl** and **Eric Giguère**); - Add doctests to documentation.
