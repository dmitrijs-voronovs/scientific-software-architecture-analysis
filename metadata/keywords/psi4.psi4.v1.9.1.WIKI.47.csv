Test Suite. Test SuiteÂ¶; A test suite plays a vital role in open-source software use and development. For a PSI4 user, tests provide models of inputs that should work; âas-isâ and a searchable collection of syntax and capabilities.; The test suite also allows high-quality development snapshots of the; codebase to be built automatically for users.; For a user who has PSI4 as part of a complex computational molecular software environment, a test suite alongside installed PSI4 can be used to show that the PSI4 piece is working.; For a feature developer, adding tests provides confidence that you; can leave your code untouched and still advertise that the feature works; years later. With tests, proposed changes to PSI4 that break your; code fall upon the change proposer to fix, rather than being merged; silently and lying in wait for a concientious user to detect and report; and then likely falling upon you to fix.; For a general developer, the test suite allows confidence in refactoring, switching out underlying libraries, maintenance, and upgrading. CTest and pytest, PSIthon and PsiAPIÂ¶; In designing a test, sometimes you want it to be a model input for the user in a single file or you donât want a lot of psi4. or Python syntax cluttering the input.; In this case, follow Adding PSIthon Test Cases to prepare as PSIthon (psi4 input.dat) for, roughly speaking, running through ctest.; The PSIthon/CTest test suite occupies the whole of psi4/tests except psi4/tests/pytests.; At other times you want the test to check several variations of a template job or you want to test error handling or you want to focus on PsiAPI rather than PSIthon or you want to control the compute conditions with environment variables.; In this case, follow Adding PsiAPI Test Cases to prepare as PsiAPI (import psi4) for, roughly speaking, running through pytest.; The PsiAPI/pytest test suite occupies psi4/tests/pytests.;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html

Test ContentsÂ¶. Most PSI4 tests will be integration tests focusing on non-regression of user input to answers, and we insist on having these.; But if you find unit tests helpful, by all means add them to the test suite.; Most tests should store reference results (from literature or another implementation or a carefully run PSI4 calculation),; run quantum chemistry, then apply one or more of the Comparison Functions so that the test will fail if the answer is unexpected.; The functions are the same in CTest and pytest, but in the former they are, for example, compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...) while in the latter itâs asserted, like assert compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...).; The main advantage of the testing functions is that they provide helpful error printing upon failure. Deep down, theyâre NumPy functions.; In preparing the test case reference values, aim for the converged value rather than many digits from your computer under default convergence conditions.; This will make the test more robust for different OS, different BLAS libraries, and variations in SC",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html

Test SuiteÂ¶; A test suite plays a vital role in open-source software use and development. For a PSI4 user, tests provide models of inputs that should work; âas-isâ and a searchable collection of syntax and capabilities.; The test suite also allows high-quality development snapshots of the; codebase to be built automatically for users.; For a user who has PSI4 as part of a complex computational molecular software environment, a test suite alongside installed PSI4 can be used to show that the PSI4 piece is working.; For a feature developer, adding tests provides confidence that you; can leave your code untouched and still advertise that the feature works; years later. With tests, proposed changes to PSI4 that break your; code fall upon the change proposer to fix, rather than being merged; silently and lying in wait for a concientious user to detect and report; and then likely falling upon you to fix.; For a general developer, the test suite allows confidence in refactoring, switching out underlying libraries, maintenance, and upgrading.

Test ContentsÂ¶. Most PSI4 tests will be integration tests focusing on non-regression of user input to answers, and we insist on having these.; But if you find unit tests helpful, by all means add them to the test suite.; Most tests should store reference results (from literature or another implementation or a carefully run PSI4 calculation),; run quantum chemistry, then apply one or more of the Comparison Functions so that the test will fail if the answer is unexpected.; The functions are the same in CTest and pytest, but in the former they are, for example, compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...) while in the latter itâs asserted, like assert compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...).; The main advantage of the testing functions is that they provide helpful error printing upon failure.

If you see labels to add or rename, please do.; A test requiring over 15 minutes should be labeled longtests. A short test under 30 seconds used for general bug checking should be labeled quicktests. A test that confirms PSI4 is operational should be labeled smoketests.; If a test needs extra input files like grid.dat or extra reference files for checking against, like fchk, specify these in the CMakeLists.txt as shown above. Such tests must be run through ctest and donât usually work when run âby handâ from the objdir via stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/directory_name/input.dat.; If a test is multiple minutes long, load-balancing a parallel CTest run requires the test to be started early.

This file contains much the same information as the CMakeLists.txt.; The def test_ci_property contains the name of the test, now with underscores rather than hyphens.; def test_ identifies it to pytest as a test.; That part of the function name and the name of the file, test_input.py are required, but no further registration with CMake is necessary.; Most tests need only the simple form of the runner line ctest_runner(__file__).; This uses QCEngine machinery to execute python psi4 input.dat.; If additional input files are needed from the test directory, their names can be added to the the second argument list as shown above.; Those additional input files do need to be registered in psi4/psi4/CMakeLists.txt.; Finally, the label string passed to CTest is here handed to pytest, with a few changes:. psi added automatically, so exclude it when copying from CTest CMakeLists.txt; cli added automatically to distinguish CTest origin from deliberate pytest origin, which have api added; smoke used instead of CTest smoketests; quick used instead of CTest quicktests; long used instead of CTest longtests; addon and <name-of-addon> added automatically when @uusing(""<name-of-addon>"") decorates the test or marks=using(""<name-of-addon>"") marks the test.

CFOUR_METHOD (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies the geometry optimization strategy. Four values are permitted: NR (=0) â Straightforward Newton-Raphson search for minimum; RFA (=1) â Rational Function Approximation search for minimum (this method can be used to find minima when the initial structure is in a region where the Hessian index is nonzero); TS (=2) Cerjan-Miller eigenvector following search for a transition state (can be started in a region where the Hessian index is not equal to unity); MANR (=3) â Morse-adjusted Newton-Raphson search for minimum (very efficient minimization scheme, particularly if the Hessian is available); 4 is currently unavailable; SINGLE_POINT (=5) is a single point calculation.

CFOUR_NACOUPLING (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Calculation of non-adiabatic coupling. In case of ON (=1) the method by Ichino, Gauss, Stanton is used to obtain the lambda coupling, while in case of LVC (=3) the lambda coupling is computed by means of the algorithm by Tajti and Szalay. Furthermore, NACV (=2) requests the computation of the full non-adiabatic coupling.

For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0. It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed.

These are sufficient to determine the vibration-rotation interaction constants needed to calculate vibrational corrections to rotational constants, but are not sufficient to generate the corresponding cubic constants of isotopologs that have a lower point-group symmetry (i.e. HOD isotopolog of water). VPT2 (=1, note that the old value CUBIC can be still used and is equivalent to VPT2) generates all cubic constants and all quartic constants apart from those of the form \(\phi_{ijkl}\), which is enough for: 1) generation of cubic constants of isotopologs (see manual entries associated with anharmonic calculations for an example); 2) calculation of vibrational energy levels with VPT2. This keyword also directs the program to analyze resonances and calculate intensities of one- and two-quantum transitions. FULLQUARTIC (=2) (not part of the public release) is largely self-explanatory; it directs the program to calculate all quartic constants.

The default for all calculations is currently VCC which requests usage of xvcc, but in many cases (e.g., for CCSD and CCSD(T)) ECC should be preferred due to the better performance of xecc (available currently for CCSD, CCSD+T, CCSD(T), and closed-shell CCSDT-n, CC3, and CCSDT).

VPT2 (=1, note that the old value CUBIC can be still used and is equivalent to VPT2) generates all cubic constants and all quartic constants apart from those of the form \(\phi_{ijkl}\), which is enough for: 1) generation of cubic constants of isotopologs (see manual entries associated with anharmonic calculations for an example); 2) calculation of vibrational energy levels with VPT2.

This feature can help with numerical convergence issues if AO integrals are involved. Currently only working for single-point energy calculations. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_NONHF (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies whether the reference function used in the correlation energy calculation satisfies the (spin-orbital) HF equations or not. Usually there is no need to set this parameter (OFF = 0 and ON =1), since standard non-HF reference functions (QRHF and ROHF) set this flag automatically. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_NTOP_TAMP (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies how many t amplitudes will be printed for each spin case and excitation level. For =N, The largest N amplitudes for each spin case and excitation level will be printed. Type: integer; Default: 15. CFOUR_OCCUPATION (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies the orbital occupancy of the reference function in terms of the occupation numbers of the orbitals and their irreducible representations. The occupancy is specified by either NIRREP or 2*NIRREP integers specifying the number of occupied orbitals of each symmetry type, where NIRREP is the number of irreducible representations in the computational point group. If there are no orbitals of a particular symmetry type a zero must be entered. If the ref",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html

If the reference function is for an open-shell system, two strings of NIRREP occupation numbers separated by a slash are input for the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) sets of orbitals. An example of the use of the OCCUPATION keyword for the water molecule would be OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0. For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0. It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed. (Default: The occupation is given by the core Hamiltonian initial guess). Psi4 Interface: The arrays above are specified in PSI as (white space tolerant) [3,1,1,0] and [[3,1,1,0],[3,0,1,0]].

CFOUR_OPEN-SHELL (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies which kind of open-shell CC treatment is employed. The default is a spin-orbital CC treatment (SPIN-ORBITAL =1) which is the only possible choice for UHF-CC schemes anyways. For ROHF-CC treatments, the possible options are beside the standard spin-orbital scheme a spin-restricted CC approach (SR-CC=3), as well as a corresponding linear approximation (which in the literature usually is referred to as partially-spin-adapted CC scheme) (PSA-CC=1). SR-CC and PSA-CC are within the CCSD approximation restricted to excitations defined by the first-order interacting space arguments. With the keywords PSA-CC_FULL (=2) or SR-CC_FULL (=6) inclusion of the so called âpseudo-triplesâ beyond the first-order interacting space is also possible. The two-determinant CC method for open-shell singlet states can be activated by TD-CC (=8). Type: string; Possible Values: SPIN-ORBITAL, SR-CC, PSA-CC_FULL, SR-CC_FULL, TD-CC; Default: SPIN-ORBITAL.

SEMICANONICAL (=1) forces in ROHF type calculations a transformation to so-called semicanonical orbitals which diagonalize the occupied-occupied and virtual-virtual blocks of the usual Fock-matrices. The use of semicanonical orbitals is, for example, required for ROHF-CCSD(T) calculations and for those calculations also automatically set. LOCAL requests a localization of the HF orbitals and this is currently done according to the Pipek-Mezey localization criterion. Note that it is strongly recommended not to use this keyword unless you know what are you doing. Default: STANDARD except for ROHF-CCSD(T) and ROHF-MP4 calculations for which SEMICANONICAL is the default. Type: string; Possible Values: STANDARD, SEMICANONICAL; Default: STANDARD. CFOUR_PERT_ORB (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies the type of perturbed orbitals used in energy derivative calculations. STANDARD means that the gradient formulation assumes that the perturbed orbitals are not those in which the (perturbed) Fock matrix is diagonal. CANONICAL means that the perturbed orbitals are assumed to be canonical. This keyword is set automatically to CANONICAL in derivative calculations with methods which include triple excitations (MBPT[4]/MP4, CCSD+T[CCSD], CCSD[T], QCISD[T] and all iterative schemes like CCSDT-n and CC3) apart from CCSDT. IJ_CANONICAL requests a canonical perturbed-orbital treatment only for the occupied-occupied block of the unperturbed density matrix in analytic derivative calculations.

For RHF stability checks, only those instabilities which correspond to RHF solutions will be considered. It is important to understand that following non-symmetric eigenvectors lowers the symmetry of the wavefunction and that following RHF â> UHF stabilities leads to a UHF solution.

This can be an extremely useful way to converge âdifficultâ SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry. Note that when this option is used, the calculation that is performed is not a QRHF-CC calculation; it is instead a UHF-based or ROHF-based calculation, depending on what type of reference is specified by the CFOUR_REFERENCE keyword.

CFOUR_RES_RAMAN (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â This option can be used to convert an analytically calculated gradient vector to a particular normal coordinate representation. A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations.

A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations.

CFOUR_LOCK_ORBOCC (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â This keyword is used by the SCF program to determine if the orbital occupancy (by symmetry block) is allowed to change in the course of the calculation.

CFOUR_OCCUPATION (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies the orbital occupancy of the reference function in terms of the occupation numbers of the orbitals and their irreducible representations. The occupancy is specified by either NIRREP or 2*NIRREP integers specifying the number of occupied orbitals of each symmetry type, where NIRREP is the number of irreducible representations in the computational point group. If there are no orbitals of a particular symmetry type a zero must be entered. If the reference function is for an open-shell system, two strings of NIRREP occupation numbers separated by a slash are input for the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) sets of orbitals. An example of the use of the OCCUPATION keyword for the water molecule would be OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0. For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0. It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed. (Default: The occupation is given by the core Hamiltonian initial guess). Psi4 Interface: The arrays above are specified in PSI as (white space tolerant) [3,1,1,0] and [[3,1,1,0],[3,0,1,0]].

CFOUR_PERT_ORB (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies the type of perturbed orbitals used in energy derivative calculations. STANDARD means that the gradient formulation assumes that the perturbed orbitals are not those in which the (perturbed) Fock matrix is diagonal. CANONICAL means that the perturbed orbitals are assumed to be canonical. This keyword is set automatically to CANONICAL in derivative calculations with methods which include triple excitations (MBPT[4]/MP4, CCSD+T[CCSD], CCSD[T], QCISD[T] and all iterative schemes like CCSDT-n and CC3) apart from CCSDT. IJ_CANONICAL requests a canonical perturbed-orbital treatment only for the occupied-occupied block of the unperturbed density matrix in analytic derivative calculations. For testing purposes, it is possible to force the use standard perturbed orbitals even in case of iterative triple excitations via the option FORCE_STANDA (dne?). Note also that in case of unrelaxed derivatives standard orbitals must be used. Default : STANDARD for all methods without triples (except CCSDT), CANONICAL for all methods with triples in case of relaxed derivatives.

Type: string; Possible Values: STANDARD, AOBASIS; Default: STANDARD. CFOUR_ACTIVE_ORBI (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies the active orbitals used in a TCSCF calculation and has to be used in combination with the keyword CFOUR_CORE_ORBITALS. The active orbitals are specified by either NIRREP or 2*NIRREP integers specifying the number of active orbitals of each symmetry type, where NIRREP is the number of irreducible representations in the computational point group. If there are no orbitals of a particular symmetry type a zero must be entered. For more information and an example see CFOUR_OCCUPATION . Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_ANH_ALGORITHM (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies which algorithm is used for CFOUR_ANHARMONIC =VIBROT, VPT2, and FULLQUARTIC calculations. If STANDARD (=0) is chosen, then simply invoking xcfour will cause a complete job to be run with all second-derivative calculations being done in series. If PARALLEL (=1), then the job stops after the second-derivative calculation at the reference geometry and generates out all input geometries for the remaining calculation. These can be then processed in âparallelâ (currently not recommended). Note that it is recommended to carry out all calculations with PARALLEL, even when the actual calculation is carried out in a sequential mode. Type: string; Possible Values: STANDARD, PARALLEL; Default: STANDARD. CFOUR_ANH_DERIVATIVES (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies whether the anharmonic force field is calculated using analytic gradients (=FIRST) or analytic Hessians (=SECOND). Type: string; Possible Values: FIRST, SECOND; Default: SECOND. CFOUR_ANH_STEPSIZE (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Controls the stepsize used in anharmonic force field calculations. The value is specified in reduced normal coordinates, which are dimensionless. The actual stepsize used in the calculation is \(\times 10",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html
https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html:37422,Usability,clear,clearly,37422,"eyword is slightly complicated. For TDA calculations, the default is EXPECTATION since the evaluation of transition moments involves only a negligible amount of additional computation relative to the evaluation of the excitation energies. For EOMCC, the default is OFF since evaluation of any transition moments or properties requires approximately twice the computational time. Transition moments and dipole strengths are evaluated by default for all values of ESTATE_PROP other than OFF. Type: string; Possible Values: OFF, EXPECTATION, UNRELAXED, RESPONSE; Default: No Default. CFOUR_ESTATE_SYM (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies the number of excited states which are to be determined in each irreducible representation of the computational subgroup. The program attempts to find all of the lowest roots, but this is not guaranteed because the eigenvalue problem is not solved by direct matrix diagonalization, but rather by an iterative (modified Davidson) algorithm. For excited state gradient calculations, only one root (clearly) is used. In such a case, one and only one non-zero entry in the string can be used, and this value is usually set to one (i.e. 0/1/0/0). (However sometimes one wants to calculate the gradient for, say, the second root of a given symmetry, and in such a case, one could use 0/2/0/0. What happens is that both roots are calculated, but only the second one is used in the subsequent density matrix and gradient calculation.) The format used for this keyword is identical to that used in CFOUR_OCCUPATION. For example, for a computational subgroup having four symmetry species, the string 3/1/0/2 specifies that 6 total roots should be searched for, three in the first block, one in the second block, and two in the fourth block. It is also important to note that the %excite* input, if present, takes precedence over this keyword. Default: All zeros. Psi4 Interface: The array above is specified in PSI as (white space tolerant) [3,1,0,2]. Type: array; Default: No Default.

Examples given later in this manual further illustrate the QRHF input options and may help to clarify any confusion resulting from this documentation. (Default : 1). Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_QRHFGUES (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â If this keyword is set to ON (=1), then the QRHF orbitals specified by the CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL, CFOUR_QRHF_ORBITAL and CFOUR_QRHF_SPIN (nyi?) keywords are used as a starting guess for a restarted SCF procedure. This can be an extremely useful way to converge âdifficultâ SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry. Note that when this option is used, the calculation that is performed is not a QRHF-CC calculation; it is instead a UHF-based or ROHF-based calculation, depending on what type of reference is specified by the CFOUR_REFERENCE keyword. The QRHF aspect of the calculation is used simply as a device to converge the orbitals. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RAMAN_INT (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â ON (=1) requests a calculation of Raman intensities based on the geometrical derivatives of the static polarizability tensor, while DYN (=2) requests a calculation of Raman intensities based on the derivatives of the dynamical polarizability tensor. Type: string; Possible Values: ON, DYN, OFF; Default: OFF. CFOUR_RAMAN_ORB (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies whether Raman intensities are calculated with orbital relaxation with respect to the electric field perturbation (RELAXED, = 1) or without orbital relaxation (UNRELAXED, = 0). Type: string; Possible Values: RELAXED, UNRELAXED; Default: UNRELAXED. CFOUR_RDO (CFOUR)Â¶CFOUR â Specifies whether or not relaxed density natural orbitals are to be computed. This option only has meaning for a correlated calculation. For =0, Do not compute. For =1, compute. Type: boolean; Default: true.

JKFIT sets are appropriate for fitting \((oo|\)-type products,; such as encountered in SCF theory and the electrostatics/exchange terms of SAPT.; RI sets are appropriate for fitting \((ov|\)-type products, such as encountered in; MP2 and most SAPT terms. Citations for basis sets can be found in their; definition files at psi4/psi4/share/psi4/basis in the source. For basis set availability by; element and the default value for keyword PUREAM, consult; Appendix Basis Sets by Element.; PSI4 uses the angular momentum convention below that; skips the letter J. Note that Gaussian94 convention is; not to skip this letter.; PSI4 can use either convention for .gbs import (assuming; angular momentum levels are not skipped), but it will always output; in the HIK sequence. Another portion of the G94 format, labeling; angular momentum with L=l syntax is newly (August 2020); implemented, and this is preferred for L=7 and above to; avoid ambiguity.; L: 0123456789...; Psi4: SPDFGHIKLM...; G94: SPDFGHIJKL... Mixing Basis SetsÂ¶; While the above syntax will suffice for specifying basis sets in most cases,; the user may need to assign basis sets to specific atoms. To achieve this, a; basis âblockâ can be used. We use a snippet from the mints2 sample; input file, which performs a benzene SCF computation, to demonstrate this; feature.; basis {; assign DZ; assign C 3-21G; assign H1 sto-3g; assign C1 sto-3g; }.

Multiple basis sets can be; specified by adding additional sections within the surrounding brackets.; Use assign statements to actually request the basis set. This; basis {...} section replaces the usual set basis XXX line.; In a more complex input, if the user needs to call the user-defined; basis by name, this can be achieved using the syntax basis mybas {...},; and then the basis can be recalled later as set basis mybas.; To use a custom basis set as described in this section, it must be; defined prior to its use in a function that performs a computation.; basis {. # assign basset to all atoms and addl to hydrogens; assign basset; assign H addl. # basis set section like in snippet above goes here; [basset]; ... # additional basis set sections follow; [addl]; ...; }. The test case mints2 provides a complete example of; user-specified basis sets. Inputting effective core potentials (ECPs)Â¶; For ECP containing basis sets, all of the above mechanisms may still be used to; input the basis set; simply place the ECP definitions (in G94 format) in the; same file or input section as the orbital basis definition. Because the ECP; appears in the same section as the orbital basis, it will be parsed; automatically and the number of core electrons the ECP represents will be; detected, so no further input is required to use a core potential. See; Effective core potentials (ECPs) for more information about using ECPs and the; Def2-TZVP basis set definition; for an example of their input syntax. table of contents.
