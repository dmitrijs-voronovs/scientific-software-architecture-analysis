Metagenomic Pathogen Detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known.; Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease.; This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/023a743ff0be77e551f0b0dfe603f497f99ed242.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/023a743ff0be77e551f0b0dfe603f497f99ed242.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy.; Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?; Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.; Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?; Assigning taxonomic labels; We already placed a FASTA file at pathogens/reads.fasta containing the; reads.[^1]; First, change to the exercise directory: cd pathogens. Here you will; see the previously mentioned reads.fasta file and a couple files; starting with uniprot_sprot. This contains all the reference proteins; from Swiss-Prot which is the manually curated, high-quality part of the; Uniprot(Consortium 2014) protein reference database.

To; filter the result database, we will need the pathogen's numeric; taxonomic identifier. Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name.; What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?; Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?; Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen.; Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet.; We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta.; How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?; Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins.

Both the default MMseqs2 clustering and Linclust link two sequences by; an edge based on three local alignment criteria:. a maximum E-value threshold (option -e, default 10^-3); computed according to the gap-corrected Karlin-Altschul statistics;. a minimum coverage (option -c, which is defined by the number of; aligned residue pairs divided by either the maximum of the length of; query/centre and target/non-centre sequences alnRes/max(qLen,tLen); (default mode, --cov-mode 0), by the length of the; target/non-centre se",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/023a743ff0be77e551f0b0dfe603f497f99ed242.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/023a743ff0be77e551f0b0dfe603f497f99ed242.html

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file.

Let's re-run the clustering of the catalogue database with our fresh; database:; mmseqs cluster plass_proteins_db plass_proteins_db_clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1 .

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/1193fac23a7561b0eeeae770a6b1c7089e3d36f1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/1193fac23a7561b0eeeae770a6b1c7089e3d36f1.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8.

Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta.

To run this protein-level; assembly, use the command; plass assemble ERR1384114_1.fastq ERR1384114_2.fastq plass_proteins.fasta tmp. or type plass assemble -h to see all available options.; As a matter of comparison, run the usual pipeline using MegaHit for; genomic assembly:; megahit -1 ERR1384114_1.fastq -2 ERR1384114_2.fastq -o megahit_assembly. Then extract proteins using Prodigal in metagenomics mode:; prodigal -i megahit_assembly/final.contigs.fa -a prodigal_proteins.fasta -p meta. Take a look at the FASTA files produced by Plass and Prodigal. To check; the number of detected proteins, you can count the number of FASTA; headers (lines beginning with the > character):; grep -c ""^>"" file.faa. Redundancy reduction; Since Plass assembles with replacement of reads, the catalogue will; contain some redundancy. You can reduce this catalogue by clustering it,; for instance, to 90% of sequence identity, and asking for the; representative sequence that cover at least 95% of the members. For; this, you can either use the easy-cluster (sensitive clustering) or; easy-linclust (linear time fast clustering) modules of MMseqs2:; mmseqs easy-cluster pla",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html

The score per residue equivalent; to a certain sequence identity is obtained by a linear regression; using thousands of local alignments as training set. You can count the number of cluster representatives in the FASTA file; clustered_proteins_rep_seqs.faa again using the previous grep command.; Learn how to deal with MMseqs2's indexed databases; The previous easy-cluster command is a shorthand to deal directly with; FASTA files as input and output. However, MMseqs2's modules do not; use the FASTA format internally. Since the goal of this tutorial is to; make you an expert in using MMseqs2 workflows, we will explain and use; the MMseqs2 database formats and create FASTA files only for downstream; tools.; You can convert a FASTA file to the MMseqs2 database format using:; mmseqs createdb plass_proteins.faa plass_proteins_db. This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file. MMseqs2 database format, through which all MMseqs2 modules can be easily; and efficiently chained.; The corresponding headers are stored in a separate database with a _h; suffix (plass_proteins_db_h).; The .dbtype file helps to keep track of the database type (amino-acid,; nucleic, profile, etc.).; The .lookup file is a lookup file linking the keys to their sequence; accession as specified in their FASTA header.; The format of this index file",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins. For this we will use the; Swiss-Prot which is the m",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

This; file contains all representative sequences, meaning the sequence that; the algorithm chose as the most representative within this cluster. How many sequences remain now?; How well does this agree with what you expected according to your internet search?.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file. MMseqs2 database format, through which all MMseqs2 modules can be easily; and efficiently chained.; The corresponding headers are stored in a separate database with a _h; suffix (plass_proteins_db_h).; The .dbtype file helps to keep track of the database type (amino-acid,; nucleic, profile, etc.).; The .lookup file is a lookup file linking the keys to their sequence; accession as specified in their FASTA header.; The format of this index file is tab-separated and reports one line per; entry in the database, specifying a unique key (column 1), the offset; and the length of the corresponding data (columns 2 and 3 respectively).; As we will make use of the efficient structure later on in the tutorial,; you can already take a look at the index file structure with:; head plass_proteins_db.index. Let's re-run the clustering of the catalogue database with our fresh; database:; mmseqs cluster plass_proteins_db plass_proteins_db_clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1 . This creates a cluster database where each entry has the key of its; representative sequence, and whose data consists of the list of keys; of its members:; # the index file contains entries whose; # keys are of those of their representative sequence; head plass_proteins_db_clu.index . # you will see the keys belonging to different clusters; # (one per line) and such that ever",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html

Analysis of a human gut metagenomics dataset; Getting a protein catalogue of a metagenome; We use Plass to assemble a catalogue of protein sequences directly from; the reads, without the nucleic assembly step. It recovers 2 to 10 times; more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other; state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets.; First we will load the dataset from the SRA with sra-tools:; prefetch ERR1384114; fasterq-dump ERR1384114. The standard genomic assemblies prevent many reads to assemble due to; low coverage and micro-diversity. To run this protein-level; assembly, use the command; plass assemble ERR1384114_1.fastq ERR1384114_2.fastq plass_proteins.fasta tmp. or type plass assemble -h to see all available options.; As a matter of comparison, run the usual pipeline using MegaHit for; genomic assembly:; megahit -1 ERR1384114_1.fastq -2 ERR1384114_2.fastq -o megahit_assembly. Then extract proteins using Prodigal in metagenomics mode:; prodigal -i megahit_assembly/final.contigs.fa -a prodigal_proteins.fasta -p meta. Take a look at the FASTA files produced by Plass and Prodigal. To check; the number of detected proteins, you can count the number of FASTA; headers (lines beginning with the > character):; grep -c ""^>"" file.faa. Redundancy reduction; Since Plass assembles with replacement of reads, the catalogue will; contain some redundancy. You can reduce this catalogue by clustering it,; for instance, to 90% of sequence identity, and asking for the; representative sequence that cover at least 95% of the members. For; this, you can either use the easy-cluster (sensitive clustering) or; easy-linclust (linear time fast clustering) modules of MMseqs2:; mmseqs easy-cluster plass_proteins.fasta clustered_proteins tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1.

Metagenomic Pathogen Detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known.; Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease.; This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length $k$, also called; $k$-mers, and compares them to a reference database where $k$-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy.; Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?; Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.; Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?; Assigning taxonomic labels; We already placed a FASTA file at pathogens/reads.fasta containing the; reads.[^1]; First, change to the exercise directory: cd pathogens. Here you will; see the previously mentioned reads.fasta file and a couple files; starting with uniprot_sprot.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file. MMseqs2 database format, through which all MMseqs2 modules can be easily; and efficiently chained.; The corresponding headers are stored in a separate database with a _h; suffix (plass_proteins_db_h).; The .dbtype file helps to keep track of the database type (amino-acid,; nucleic, profile, etc.).; The .lookup file is a lookup file linking the keys to their sequence; accession as specified in their FASTA header.; The format of this index file is tab-separated and reports one line per; entry in the database, specifying a unique key (column 1), the offset; and the length of the corresponding data (columns 2 and 3 respectively).; As we will make use of the efficient structure later on in the tutorial,; you can already take a look at the index file structure with:; head plass_proteins_db.index. Let's re-run the clustering of the catalogue database with our fresh; database:; mmseqs cluster plass_proteins_db plass_proteins_db_clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1 . This creates a cluster database where each entry has the key of its; representative sequence, and whose data consists of the list of keys; of its members:; # the index file contains entries whose; # keys are of those of their representative sequence; head plass_proteins_db_clu.index . # you will see the keys belonging to different clusters; # (one per line) and such that ever",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/3344d112dd8786d3846fc08b622c2d7cba55e1aa.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/3344d112dd8786d3846fc08b622c2d7cba55e1aa.html

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/340fd55f92f0c8a1da9145d8d126ed441d107868.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/340fd55f92f0c8a1da9145d8d126ed441d107868.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?.

The standard genomic assemblies prevent many reads to assemble due to; low coverage and micro-diversity.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file.

Metagenomic Pathogen Detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi).

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8.

MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.; Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens?

The standard genomic assemblies prevent many reads to assemble due to; low coverage and micro-diversity. To run this protein-level; assembly, use the command; plass assemble ERR1384114_1.fastq ERR1384114_2.fastq plass_proteins.fasta tmp. or type plass assemble -h to see all available options.; As a matter of comparison, run the usual pipeline using MegaHit for; genomic assembly:; megahit -1 ERR1384114_1.fastq -2 ERR1384114_2.fastq -o megahit_assembly.

Metagenomic Pathogen Detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known.; Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease.; This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8.

As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?.

Re-create the linclust workflow...; Based on the explanation of the Linclust algorithm, try to code its; workflow using:. kmermatcher. rescorediagonal. clust. Take a look at the real Linclust workflow.; This version is slightly more involved as it integrates a redundancy; reduction step (the pre_clust prefiltering by high Hamming distance),; and uses a trick using filterdb with the flag –filter-file to apply; the workflow you just built only on the non-redundant entries. At; the end of the file, you can also spot a merging step to recover the; redundant part in the final clustering.; Conclusion; We hope that you are more familiar with the MMseqs2 environment, and; that you enjoy its modularity and flexibility for creating new; workflows.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy.

For; this, you can either use the easy-cluster (sensitive clustering) or; easy-linclust (linear time fast clustering) modules of MMseqs2:; mmseqs easy-cluster plass_proteins.fasta clustered_proteins tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/7c93264fa1e1222bbf273a703b5645a227727928.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/7c93264fa1e1222bbf273a703b5645a227727928.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file. MMseqs2 database format, through which all MMseqs2 modules can be easily; and efficiently chained.; The corresponding headers are stored in a separate database with a _h; suffix (plass_proteins_db_h).; The .dbtype file helps to keep track of the database type (amino-acid,; nucleic, profile, etc.).; The .lookup file is a lookup file linking the keys to their sequence; accession as specified in their FASTA header.; The format of this index file is tab-separated and reports one line per; entry in the database, specifying a unique key (column 1), the offset; and the length of the corresponding data (columns 2 and 3 respectively).; As we will make use of the efficient structure later on in the tutorial,; you can already take a look at the index file structure with:; head plass_proteins_db.index. Let's re-run the clustering of the catalogue database with our fresh; database:; mmseqs cluster plass_proteins_db plass_proteins_db_clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1 . This creates a cluster database where each entry has the key of its; representative sequence, and whose data consists of the list of keys; of its members:; # the index file contains entries whose; # keys are of those of their representative sequence; head plass_proteins_db_clu.index . # you will see the keys belonging to different clusters; # (one per line) and such that ever",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/7c93264fa1e1222bbf273a703b5645a227727928.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/7c93264fa1e1222bbf273a703b5645a227727928.html

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/8776b1fb0e730cabb5d297164e6f14be0c9a5dc5.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/8776b1fb0e730cabb5d297164e6f14be0c9a5dc5.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins. For this we will use the; Swiss-Prot which is the ",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/8776b1fb0e730cabb5d297164e6f14be0c9a5dc5.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/8776b1fb0e730cabb5d297164e6f14be0c9a5dc5.html

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?.

If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?.

Learn more...; The MMseqs2 Wiki provides further information about other taxonomic modules in MMseqs2 (e.g., creating subdbs of a seqTaxDb) and the various parameter values (e.g., controlling the LCA modes).; Writing large scale sequence analysis workflows; We will show on a human gut metagenomic dataset (SRA run ERR1384114); what the advantages of using Linclust; (linear time clustering algorithm, (Steinegger and Söding 2018)), Plass; (Protein Level Assembly, (Steinegger, Mirdita, and Söding 2018)) and; MMseqs2 are over the more conventional pipeline with MegaHit(Li et al.; 2015), Prodigal (Hyatt et al. 2010) and HMMER (Eddy 2009).; Analysis of a human gut metagenomics dataset; Getting a protein catalogue of a metagenome; We use Plass to assemble a catalogue of protein sequences directly from; the reads, without the nucleic assembly step. It recovers 2 to 10 times; more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other; state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets.; First we will load the dataset from the SRA with sra-tools:; prefetch ERR1384114; fasterq-dump ERR1384114. Alternatively, the reads can be downloaded directly from the European Nucleotide Archives's download server:; wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR138/004/ERR1384114/ERR1384114_1.fastq.gz; wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR138/004/ERR1384114/ERR1384114_2.fastq.gz. The standard genomic assemblies prevent many reads to assemble due to; low coverage and micro-diversity. To run this protein-level; assembly, use the command; plass assemble ERR1384114_1.fastq ERR1384114_2.fastq plass_proteins.fasta tmp. or type plass assemble -h to see all available options.; As a matter of comparison, run the usual pipeline using MegaHit for; genomic assembly:; megahit -1 ERR1384114_1.fastq -2 ERR1384114_2.fastq -o megahit_assembly.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0.

Let's re-run the clustering of the catalogue database with our fresh; database:; mmseqs cluster plass_proteins_db plass_proteins_db_clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1 . This creates a cluster database where each entry has the key of its; representative sequence, and whose data consists of the list of keys; of its members:; # the index file contains entries whose; # keys are of those of their representative sequence; head plass_proteins_db_clu.index . # you will see the keys belonging to different clusters; # (one per line) and such that ever",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/8776b1fb0e730cabb5d297164e6f14be0c9a5dc5.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/8776b1fb0e730cabb5d297164e6f14be0c9a5dc5.html

As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?.

Re-create the linclust workflow...; Based on the explanation of the Linclust algorithm, try to code its; workflow using:. kmermatcher. rescorediagonal. clust. Take a look at the real Linclust workflow.; This version is slightly more involved as it integrates a redundancy; reduction step (the pre_clust prefiltering by high Hamming distance),; and uses a trick using filterdb with the flag –filter-file to apply; the workflow you just built only on the non-redundant entries. At; the end of the file, you can also spot a merging step to recover the; redundant part in the final clustering.; Conclusion; We hope that you are more familiar with the MMseqs2 environment, and; that you enjoy its modularity and flexibility for creating new; workflows.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion.

Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures.

As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/965fb9a6047ac065a59b10aca91a6a97959493e6.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/965fb9a6047ac065a59b10aca91a6a97959493e6.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins. For this we will use the; Swiss-Prot which is the ",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/965fb9a6047ac065a59b10aca91a6a97959493e6.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/965fb9a6047ac065a59b10aca91a6a97959493e6.html

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet.

It recovers 2 to 10 times; more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other; state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets.; First we will load the dataset from the SRA with sra-tools:; prefetch ERR1384114; fasterq-dump ERR1384114. Alternatively, the reads can be downloaded directly from the European Nucleotide Archives's download server:; wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR138/004/ERR1384114/ERR1384114_1.fastq.gz; wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR138/004/ERR1384114/ERR1384114_2.fastq.gz; gunzip ERR1384114_1.fastq.gz; gunzip ERR1384114_2.fastq.gz.

Take a look at the FASTA files produced by Plass and Prodigal. To check; the number of detected proteins, you can count the number of FASTA; headers (lines beginning with the > character):; grep -c ""^>"" file.faa.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0. We coin more generally; any data record an entry, and each entry is associated with a unique; key (integer number) that is stored in the index file.

Let's re-run the clustering of the catalogue database with our fresh; database:; mmseqs cluster plass_proteins_db plass_proteins_db_clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1 .

Investigating the pathogen; We now want to take a closer look only at the reads of the pathogen. To; filter the result database, we will need the pathogen's numeric; taxonomic identifier. Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?. Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found.

MMseqs2 ultra fast and sensitive protein search,; Linclust clustering huge protein sequence sets in linear time and; Plass Protein-level assembly to increases protein sequence recovery; from complex metagenomes.; Here you will learn the basic usage of MMseqs2 as well as expert tricks; to take advantage of the ability of chaining different MMseqs2 modules; to produce custom workflows.; Required software for the tutorials; We will use Conda; to setup all required software for this tutorial. If you haven't setup; Conda yet, please do so first and then execute:; conda create -n tutorial mmseqs2 plass megahit prodigal hmmer sra-tools; conda activate tutorial; The generic syntax for mmseqs and plass calls is always the; following:; mmseqs <command> <db1> [<db2> ...] --flag --parameter 42. The help text of mmseqs shows, by default, only the most important; parameters and modules.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy.; Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?; Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.; Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?; Assigning taxonomic labels; We already placed a FASTA file at pathogens/reads.fasta containing the; reads.[^1]; First, change to the exercise directory: cd pathogens. Here you will; see the previously mentioned reads.fasta file and a couple files; starting with uniprot_sprot. This contains all the reference proteins; from Swiss-Prot which is the manually curated, high-quality part of the; Uniprot(Consortium 2014) protein reference database.

To; filter the result database, we will need the pathogen's numeric; taxonomic identifier. Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name.; What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?; Now we can call a different MMseqs2 module to retrieve only the reads; that belong to this pathogen. Replace XXX with the number(s) you; just found. If you found multiple, concatenate them with a comma; character.; mmseqs filtertaxdb uniprot_sprot lca_result lca_only_pathogen --taxon-list XXX. We now get a list of all queries that were filtered out, meaning; they were annotated as pathogenic.; grep -Pv '\t1$' lca_only_pathogen.index > pathogenic_read_ids. With a few more commands we can convert our taxonomic labels back into a; FASTA file:; mmseqs createsubdb pathogenic_read_ids reads reads_pathogen. mmseqs convert2fasta reads_pathogen reads_pathogen.fasta. How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?; Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen.; Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet.; We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta.; How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?; Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.
