Hi, we are security researchers from the Advanced Research Center at [Trellix](https://www.trellix.com). We have began a campaign to patch a widespread bug named CVE-2007-4559. CVE-2007-4559 is a 15 year old bug in the Python tarfile package. By using extract() or extractall() on a tarfile object without sanitizing input, a maliciously crafted .tar file could perform a directory path traversal attack. We found at least one unsantized extractall() in your codebase and are providing a patch for you via pull request. The patch essentially checks to see if all tarfile members will be extracted safely and throws an exception otherwise. We encourage you to use this patch or your own solution to secure against CVE-2007-4559. Further technical information about the vulnerability can be found in this [blog](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/tarfile-exploiting-the-world.html).

A better technique is required which provides reasonably good accuracy without increasing the computation time and costs much. Vorticity confinement technique is a proven procedure that helps in reducing numerical diffusion offered by the scheme. Results from the literature shows that using the vorticity confinement technique, a better resolution is achieved in the problems like flow behind bluff bodies, rotors, wings etc. References. J.

The first change this PR makes is that a call to `SU2Driver.Preprocess(nIter)` will overwrite the number of inner iterations when the case is not time dependent. We can now do `SU2Driver.Run()` for a single iteration by setting `SU2Driver.Preprocess(1)`. A call to `SU2Driver.Monitor(Iter)` will check the stopping criteria, including the maximum number of iterations. When you have set this to 1 using `SU2Driver.Preprocess(1)`, a call to `SU2Driver.Monitor(0)` will still stop the calculations because we are checking if (iter+1)>=nIter.

The same issue was experienced both in version 7.5.0 and 7.5.1 regardless of running a pre-compiled version (Microsoft) or the built-from-source version (Ubuntu). **To reproduce**.

The case setup is:; 1. NACA0012 airfoil, structured grid; 2. Freestream condition: Re=1E6, AoA=5, Mach=0.1; 3. Solver: RANS with S-A model, Roe upwind scheme. Every other thing can be default. The drag coefficients I got are:; REF_DIMENSIONALIZATION=DIMENSIOAL: 0.005; REF_DIMENSIONALIZATION=FREESTREAM_VEL_EQ_MACH: -0.025. It is interesting.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1991:124,Integrability,Message,Message,124,"There is a lot of boilerplate code in the code base for screen output like. ```cpp; if (rank == MASTER_NODE) {; cout << ""My Message"" << endl;; }; ```; This is not a good example from many points of view. From performance-wise overly used `std::endl` is a killer. If one needs to redirect output to file it is additional loss etc. ; From the user's perspective, it is not possible to set the logging level. At least a three-level logging would be nice (INFO/WARNING/DEBUG) this also makes life easier for developers too. It is also nice to have a rotating log file if one runs longer cases on the HPC systems. After a while the log files getting so bloating . **Describe the solution you'd like**. A configurable logger would be better with defaults not changing the current system. ```text; % LOGGING LOCATIONS default is SCREEN; LOG= (SCREEN, FILE); % Default is SU2.log; LOG_FILE = ""myLog.log""; % Logging level INFO/DEBUG ; LOG_LEVEL = ""DEBUG"" ; ```; In the code . For general messages ; ```cpp; INFO << ""My useful information"";; DEBUG << ""Operation done in "" << time << "" seconds"";; ```.

The aim was to optimize the blade leading edge with respect to outlet static pressure (_please note that the mesh is rotating_):. ![Screenshot (157)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96534491/236707270-c9de2899-1a72-4876-975c-eabaec826c4f.png). The mesh is deliberately coarse being the intention to firstly perform the simulation utilizing Euler's convective scheme. ; Subsequently, the flow field is computed correctly and the solution is converged. The solution was obtained setting up the turbomachinery simulation options available in SU2. After this initial procedure the FFD Box was successfully generated ( FFD_DEGREE = 2,2,2 ) and attached to the domain as explained in the tutorials ( *using SU2_DEF* ).

The solution was obtained setting up the turbomachinery simulation options available in SU2. After this initial procedure the FFD Box was successfully generated ( FFD_DEGREE = 2,2,2 ) and attached to the domain as explained in the tutorials ( *using SU2_DEF* ). The FFD box appears as follows:. *FFD box edges: green ; FFD box control point: yellow; There is no intersection between FFD edges and periodic boundaries*. ![Screenshot (158)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96534491/236707553-92fb9e5a-3808-4ea0-a02e-43b574de44c0.png).

Similarly, SU2_DOT_AD behaved in the same manner even if adjoint solution was tightly converged. To exclude any non-dependency from the objective function, different options were investigated (DRAG, LIFT, SURFACE_MACH, SURFACE_TOTAL_PRESSURE, ENTROPY_GENERATION) and nothing changed. Moreover, the vaned diffuser scenario (_not visualized in here for simplicity_) seems to be affected too, even if very similar to basic flow scenarios (_basically, it is just an internal 3D-flow over airfoil case_). I thought this behavior could be traced to a bug since my previous mesh deformation always proceeded smoothly (_from flow past cylinder to other internal flow scenarios_), either with arbitrary or gradient based deformation.

In any event, /usr/bin is not where Python modules belong. Minor problem, I know, but the fix is probably pretty easy: Install these modules using pip. I believe pip is supposed to know the correct place to install modules. For example, on my system, pip installs them to /usr/lib64/python<version>/site-packages, which seems to be on the default module search path. Side benefit: one can dispense with setting SU2_RUN and PYTHONPATH in ~/.bashrc. And PATH in any event, since /usr/bin should already be in the path except in rare cases. I would offer to implement this but surely there are others more familiar with meson+ninja ... but if need be, I'll give it my best shot. - JM. **Bug report checklist**; *Please make sure that you have followed the checklist below, many common problems can be solved by:*. - [x] Consulting the build instructions (https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-Linux-MacOS/).; - [x] Looking for similar problems on GitHub or CFD-Online (https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2/).; - [x] Updating to the newest version of SU2 (either develop, master, or the pre-built executables https://su2code.github.io/download.html). **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: Linux Slackware 15.0; - C++ compiler and version: gcc 11.2; - MPI implementation and version: mpich 4.1.2; - SU2 Version: v7.5.1",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2075

I have used both the early version of SU2 with pyAMG (python2) and the latest SU2-feature_adap branch with python3. We have even ported its mesh adaptation implementation to the GAMMA mesh format due to geometry topology issues. ; ; However, there are two adapt options in the python implementation (ADAP_BACK, ADAP_SOURCE) and l could not still figure out how to use it because l don't know what kind of data file l should provide. For ADAP_BACK I have tried to use mesh files similar to the original volume mesh file with edges/corners in binary format (meshb) and it generally fails on complex geometries (with no ADAP_BACK option, it works nicely). Therefore, l am not sure whether l am providing the correct data file. This data file has to be only surface file with high order elements or just a volume mesh? . ADAP_SOURCE is completely mistery to me. Not much explanation inside the python code. I should also say that l don't understand the following command either. config_amg['options'] = config_amg['options'] + ' -inv-back'. Can someone please explain these plainly.

I have used both the early version of SU2 with pyAMG (python2) and the latest SU2-feature_adap branch with python3. We have even ported its mesh adaptation implementation to the GAMMA mesh format due to geometry topology issues. ; ; However, there are two adapt options in the python implementation (ADAP_BACK, ADAP_SOURCE) and l could not still figure out how to use it because l don't know what kind of data file l should provide. For ADAP_BACK I have tried to use mesh files similar to the original volume mesh file with edges/corners in binary format (meshb) and it generally fails on complex geometries (with no ADAP_BACK option, it works nicely). Therefore, l am not sure whether l am providing the correct data file. This data file has to be only surface file with high order elements or just a volume mesh? .

The present work is on modifications to the actuator disk model. Variable load actuator disk (VLAD) [Saetta, 2020] uses the given blade loading (which is fixed for the entire duration of the simulation) to impose axial and tangential jumps at the interface. Propeller loading depends on many different parameters and is affected by the surrounding structures and angle of attack (AoA). A method that updates the blade loading at run time is required to take care of the interactions and installation effects. . In the present approach, the Blade Element Method (BEM) is used to calculate the pressure jump and swirl distributions across the propeller disc and is coupled to the SU2 solver. The blade loading and changes to the flow-field are calculated recursively. Propeller geometry details, airfoil characteristics, propeller speed and set blade angle are required as inputs. Using the thrust and power along the blade from BEM, and following the procedure of VLAD, axial and tangential velocities are imposed at the interface. BEM method is verified against the experimental results [Veldhuis, 2005] and found to be performing well. ## Related Work.

In the present approach, the Blade Element Method (BEM) is used to calculate the pressure jump and swirl distributions across the propeller disc and is coupled to the SU2 solver. The blade loading and changes to the flow-field are calculated recursively. Propeller geometry details, airfoil characteristics, propeller speed and set blade angle are required as inputs. Using the thrust and power along the blade from BEM, and following the procedure of VLAD, axial and tangential velocities are imposed at the interface. BEM method is verified against the experimental results [Veldhuis, 2005] and found to be performing well. ## Related Work.

I have been working on the implementation of the DDES formulations for the SST model, following the work in ""Development of DDES and IDDES Formulations for the k-ω Shear Stress Transport Model"" (DOI:10.1007/s10494-011-9378-4). The implementation is easy, whereas the validation may take some time. I am currently working on the backward facing step and I will work on the flatplate too. The choice of the validation test cases is key since the computational cost is quite large, thus if you have any suggestions that may speed up this part then feel free to write them down. . Implemented versions:; - SST-DDES; - SST-IDDES; - SST-SIDDES. I am also working on the Scale Adaptive Simulations (SAS) implementations for SST, following the work in ""ON URANS SOLUTIONS WITH LES-LIKE BEHAVIOUR"", Travis et al., and ""[Evaluation of scale-adaptive simulation for transonic cavity flows"", Babu et al., (https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJESMS.2016.075510). The last one, especially, is quite tricky due to the computation of the velocity laplacian. I tried computing it in Paraview as the divergence of the gradient field and it seems quite similar, but it is the first time that I've touched that section of the code, thus some work might still be needed.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2194:689,Energy Efficiency,Green,Green-Gauss,689,"## Proposed Changes; The implementation of the symmetry plane is incomplete. We follow here the book of Blazek, _Computational Fluid Dynamics: Principles and Applications_ . According to Blazek, (chapter 8.6) 4 conditions have to be met on a symmetry plane:. 1. No flux across the boundary; 2. $\overline n \cdot \nabla \phi = 0$ (gradient of scalars are zero); 3. $\overline n \cdot \nabla (\overline U \cdot \overline t) = 0$ (gradient of tangential velocity normal to boundary); 4. $\overline t \cdot \nabla (\overline U \cdot \overline n) = 0$ (gradient of normal velocity along the boundary). Points 2-4 all deal with gradients and can be dealt with in the gradient computation, i.e. Green-Gauss or Least Squares. According to Blazek, 2 approaches can be followed.

Addition of mass flow outlet to Giles BC. ## Related Work; This issue solves a problem reported by a number of users, when simulating radial turbomachinery cases a second-order accurate solution cannot be achieved in some cases when using mixing plane interfaces. This is due to circumfrential averaging in regions where the flow exhibits large circumfrential nonuniformity and/or interspace gaps between adjacent blade-rows/zones small. This issue has been reported by @LorenzoFabris, in a presentation at the SU2 Conference 2022 ""Performance Analysis and Shape Optimization of a Radial Compressor with the Open-Source Software SU2"" and by myself. Mass flow outlet included in the PR as requested by users.
