These are not; normalized and so aren't a valid probabilities distribution. To add even more complexity, probabilities are often represented in three; semi-equivalent spaces:. -- Real-space: the classic space, with values ranging from [0.0, 1.0]; inclusive.; -- log10-space: If p is the real-space value, in log10-space this would be; represented as log10(p). How the p == 0 case is handled is often function; dependent, which may accept/return -Inf or not handle the case entirely.; -- Phred-scaled: See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score for; more information. Briefly, the Phred-scale maintains resolution in the lower; parts of the probability space using integer quality scores (though using; ints is optional, really). The phred-scale is defined as. `phred(p) = -10 * log10(p)`. where p is a real-space probability. The functions in math.h dealing with probabilities are very explicit about what; kinds of probability and representation they expect and return, as unfortunately; these are all commonly represented as doubles in C++. Though it is tempting to; address this issue with classic software engineering practices like creating; a Probability class, in practice this is extremely difficult to do as this; code is often performance critical and the low-level mathematical operations; used in this code (e.g., log10) don't distiguish themselves among the types; of probabilities.; """"""

4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.

The; # algorithm does the following:; #; # Indel SNP Joint prob; # 0/0 0/0 0.01 * 0.02 = 0.0002; # 0/0 0/1 0.01 * 0.48 = 0.0048; # 0/0 1/1 0.01 * 0.50 = 0.0050; # 0/1 0/0 0.90 * 0.02 = 0.0180; # 0/1 0/1 0.90 * 0.48 = 0.4320*; # 0/1 1/1 <invalid> = 0; # 1/1 0/0 0.09 * 0.02 = 0.0018; # 1/1 0/1 <invalid> = 0; # 1/1 1/1 <invalid> = 0; #; # So using the highest joint likelihood, we predict het indel and het SNP.; #; # The marginal probability of each genotype for the indel is:; # 0/0: 0.0002 + 0.0048 + 0.0050 = 0.01; # 0/1: 0.0180 + 0.4320 = 0.45; # 1/1: 0.0018 = 0.0018; #; # which after normalizing to sum to 1 is roughly 0.022, 0.974, 0.004.; # The marginal probability for the SNP, after performing similar; # calculations, is 0.043, 0.946, 0.011. So the marginals also predict a het; # indel and a het SNP. Since the two calculations agree, we use this; # genotype call and modified likelihoods.; #; # First, we find all non-reference count configurations that are compatible.; # This represents each variant solely based on its number of non-reference; # genotypes, and assumes that variants are compatible if the total number of; # non-reference genotypes at a single position is at most two. By using; # non-reference counts, we avoid testing multiple allele configurations that; # will return the same result (e.g. a variant with two possible alternate; # alleles has three allele configurations that are homozygous alternate; # [1/1, 1/2, 2/2] and either all or none of them will be valid depending on; # the variants it interacts with).
