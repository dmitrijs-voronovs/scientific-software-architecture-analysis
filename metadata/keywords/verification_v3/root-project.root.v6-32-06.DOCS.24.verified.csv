As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures).

The ``-harness`` option may be of interest to people who want to perform some; very late testing on build products to verify that compiled code behaves as; expected. On basic C test cases this is relatively straightforward. Mocks for; more complicated languages (e.g. C++) are much trickier: Any code involving; classes tends to have a lot of non-trivial surface area (e.g. vtables) that; would require great care to mock. Tips for JITLink backend developers; -----------------------------------. #. Make liberal use of assert and ``llvm::Error``. Do *not* assume that the input; object is well formed: Return any errors produced by libObject (or your own; object parsing code) and validate as you construct. Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures). In debug builds of LLVM, the ``-debug-only=jitlink`` option dumps logs from the; JITLink library during the link process. These can be useful for spotting some bugs at; a glance. The ``-debug-only=llvm_jitlink`` option dumps logs from the ``llvm-jitlink``; tool, which can be useful for debugging both testcases (it is often less verbose than; ``-debug-only=jitl

Its interoperability with other programming; languages, both for extending Python as well as embedding it, is; excellent and many existing third-party applications and libraries have; therefore so-called ""Python bindings."" PyROOT provides Python bindings; for ROOT: it enables cross-calls from ROOT/Cling into Python and vice; versa, the intermingling of the two interpreters, and the transport of; user-level objects from one interpreter to the other.

In case you want to store large quantities of same-class objects,; ROOT has designed the **`TTree`** and **`TNtuple`** classes specifically; for that purpose. The **`TTree`** class is optimized to reduce disk; space and enhance access speed. A **`TNtuple`** is a **`TTree`** that is; limited to only hold floating-point numbers; a **`TTree`** on the other; hand can hold all kind of data, such as objects or arrays in addition to; all the simple types. When using a **`TTree`**, we fill its branch buffers with leaf data and; the buffers are written to disk when it is full. Branches, buffers, and; leafs, are explained a little later in this chapter, but for now, it is; important to realize that each object is not written individually, but; rather collected and written a bunch at a time. This is where the **`TTree`** takes advantage of compression and will; produce a much smaller file than if the objects were written; individually. Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the; **`TTree`** contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects; can be compressed. The **`TTree`** reduces the header of each object, but it still contains; the class name.

Security,"## Configuration for the address sanitizer.; When built with `-Dasan=ON`, build flags for address sanitizer are added to ROOT's build setup. In this directory, an additional library is created; that holds default sanitizer configs for ROOT executables. It e.g. contains suppressions for leak sanitizer, which automatically runs with address; sanitizer. When asan starts up, it checks if somebody defined the symbols in `SanitizerConfig.cxx`. In the standard asan runtime, these; functions are weak symbols, i.e. one can just override them with the desired configuration. That's what's happening here.

Content: ## Configuration for the address sanitizer.; When built with `-Dasan=ON`, build flags for address sanitizer are added to ROOT's build setup. In this directory, an additional library is created; that holds default sanitizer configs for ROOT executables. It e.g. contains suppressions for leak sanitizer, which automatically runs with address; sanitizer. When asan starts up, it checks if somebody defined the symbols in `SanitizerConfig.cxx`. In the standard asan runtime, these; functions are weak symbols, i.e. one can just override them with the desired configuration. That's what's happening here. This can be achieved in two ways:; 1. `LD_PRELOAD`: A micro library `libROOTSanitizerConfig.<dylib|so>` is created with the setup in this folder, and can be found in `<builddir>/lib/`.; Loading it with `LD_PRELOAD` will bring ROOT's default sanitiser config into any non-sanitised executable, e.g. python.; 2.

Quality Attribute: Security
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.
Content: #. Speed: The CommandLine library is very quick and uses little resources. The; parsing time of the library is directly proportional to the number of; arguments parsed, not the number of options recognized. Additionally,; command line argument values are captured transparently into user defined; global variables, which can be accessed like any other variable (and with the; same performance). #. Type Safe: As a user of CommandLine, you don't have to worry about; remembering the type of arguments that you want (is it an int? a string? a; bool? an enum?) and keep casting it around. Not only does this help prevent; error prone constructs, it also leads to dramatically cleaner source code. #. No subclasses required: To use CommandLine, you instantiate variables that; correspond to the arguments that you would like to capture, you don't; subclass a parser. This means that you don't have to write **any**; boilerplate code. #. Globally accessible: Libraries can specify command line arguments that are; automatically enabled in any tool that links to the library. This is; possible because the application doesn't have to keep a list of arguments to; pass to the parser. This also makes supporting `dynamically loaded options`_; trivial. #.

1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content discusses various aspects of the CommandLine library's functionality, such as speed, type safety, no subclasses required, globally accessible options, cleaner code, power, extensibility, and custom parsers. These points relate to how well the system handles command-line arguments efficiently, which indirectly affects security by ensuring that arguments are parsed correctly without exposing potential vulnerabilities. However, there is no direct mention of security features like data protection, encryption, or access control mechanisms. Therefore, while it relates to aspects that could impact security, it does not specifically address the primary aspects outlined in the security attribute description. Thus, this should be marked as a false positive for security."

Security,"++ does not garbage; collect, so there is never a danger that a pointer to an object; becomes invalid for that reason. However, having created an object,; it is the user's responsibility to ensure that it is deleted when no; longer needed, or to pass that responsibility onto to some other; object. Failing to do that will result in a memory leak, one of the; most common and most hard-to-find C++ bugs. To send a message to an object via a pointer to it, you need to use; the ""`->`"" operator e.g.:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; ```. Although we chose to call our pointer `my_objptr`, to emphasize that; it is a pointer, heap objects are so common in an object-oriented; program that pointer names rarely reflect the fact - you have to be; careful that you know if you are dealing with an object or its; pointer!

Quality Attribute: Security
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.
Content: ++ does not garbage; collect, so there is never a danger that a pointer to an object; becomes invalid for that reason. However, having created an object,; it is the user's responsibility to ensure that it is deleted when no; longer needed, or to pass that responsibility onto to some other; object. Failing to do that will result in a memory leak, one of the; most common and most hard-to-find C++ bugs. To send a message to an object via a pointer to it, you need to use; the ""`->`"" operator e.g.:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; ```. Although we chose to call our pointer `my_objptr`, to emphasize that; it is a pointer, heap objects are so common in an object-oriented; program that pointer names rarely reflect the fact - you have to be; careful that you know if you are dealing with an object or its; pointer! Fortunately, the compiler won't tolerate an attempt to do; something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr.Solve();; ```. As we have seen, heap objects; have to be accessed via pointers, whereas stack objects can be; accessed directly.

Security,", and can be; coupled with a good choice of :ref:`sequential container <ds_sequential>`. This combination provides the several nice properties: the result data is; contiguous in memory (good for cache locality), has few allocations, is easy to; address (iterators in the final vector are just indices or pointers), and can be; efficiently queried with a standard binary search (e.g.; ``std::lower_bound``; if you want the whole range of elements comparing; equal, use ``std::equal_range``). .. _dss_smallset:. llvm/ADT/SmallSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you have a set-like data structure that is usually small and whose elements; are reasonably small, a ``SmallSet<Type, N>`` is a good choice. This set has; space for N elements in place (thus, if the set is dynamically smaller than N,; no malloc traffic is required) and accesses them with a simple linear search.; When the set grows beyond N elements, it allocates a more expensive; representation that guarantees efficient access (for most types, it falls back; to :ref:`std::set <dss_set>`, but for pointers it uses something far better,; :ref:`SmallPtrSet <dss_smallptrset>`. The magic of this class is that it handles small sets extremely efficiently, but; gracefully handles extremely large sets without loss of efficiency. .. _dss_smallptrset:. llvm/ADT/SmallPtrSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``SmallPtrSet`` has all the advantages of ``SmallSet`` (and a ``SmallSet`` of; pointers is transparently implemented with a ``SmallPtrSet``).

Content: , and can be; coupled with a good choice of :ref:`sequential container <ds_sequential>`. This combination provides the several nice properties: the result data is; contiguous in memory (good for cache locality), has few allocations, is easy to; address (iterators in the final vector are just indices or pointers), and can be; efficiently queried with a standard binary search (e.g.; ``std::lower_bound``; if you want the whole range of elements comparing; equal, use ``std::equal_range``). .. _dss_smallset:. llvm/ADT/SmallSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you have a set-like data structure that is usually small and whose elements; are reasonably small, a ``SmallSet<Type, N>`` is a good choice. This set has; space for N elements in place (thus, if the set is dynamically smaller than N,; no malloc traffic is required) and accesses them with a simple linear search.; When the set grows beyond N elements, it allocates a more expensive; representation that guarantees efficient access (for most types, it falls back; to :ref:`std::set <dss_set>`, but for pointers it uses something far better,; :ref:`SmallPtrSet <dss_smallptrset>`. The magic of this class is that it handles small sets extremely efficiently, but; gracefully handles extremely large sets without loss of efficiency. .. _dss_smallptrset:. llvm/ADT/SmallPtrSet.h; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``SmallPtrSet`` has all the advantages of ``SmallSet`` (and a ``SmallSet`` of; pointers is transparently implemented with a ``SmallPtrSet``).

The target offload entries are used by the runtime to access the device kernels; and globals that will be provided by the final device image. Each offloading; entry is set to use the ``omp_offloading_entries`` section. When the final; application is created the linker will provide the; ``__start_omp_offloading_entries`` and ``__stop_omp_offloading_entries`` symbols; which are used to create the :ref:`final image <Device Binary Wrapping>`. This information is used by the device compilation stage to determine which; symbols need to be exported from the device. We use the ``omp_offload.info``; metadata node to pass this information device compilation stage. Accessing Entries on the Device; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Accessing the entries in the device is done using the address field in the; :ref:`offload entry<table-tgt_offload_entry_structure>`.

Content: -merge testing*. When a user uploads a patch to Phabricator, Phabricator triggers the checks and; then displays the results. This way bugs in a patch are contained during the; code review stage and do not pollute the main branch. Our goal with pre-merge testing is to report most true problems while strongly; minimizing the number of false positive reports. Our goal is that problems; reported are always actionable. If you notice a false positive, please report; it so that we can identify the cause. If you notice issues or have an idea on how to improve pre-merge checks, please; `create a new issue <https://github.com/google/llvm-premerge-checks/issues/new>`_; or give a ❤️ to an existing one. Requirements; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. To get a patch on Phabricator tested, the build server must be able to apply the; patch to the checked out git repository. Please make sure that either:. * You set a git hash as ``sourceControlBaseRevision`` in Phabricator which is; available on the GitHub repository,; * **or** you define the dependencies of your patch in Phabricator,; * **or** your patch can be applied to the main branch. Only then can the build server apply the patch locally and run the builds and; tests. Accessing build results; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Phabricator will automatically trigger a build for every new patch you upload or; modify. Phabricator shows the build results at the top of the entry. Clicking on; the links (in the red box) will show more details:. .. image:: Phabricator_premerge_results.png. The CI will compile and run tests, run clang-format and clang-tidy on lines; changed. If a unit test failed, this is shown below the build status. You can also expand; the unit test to see the details:. .. image:: Phabricator_premerge_unit_tests.png. Opting Out; ^^^^^^^^^^. In case you want to opt-out entirely of pre-merge testing, add yourself to the; `OPT OUT project <https://reviews.llvm.org/project/view/83/>`_. If you decide; to opt-out, please let us know why, so we might b

The minimiser can use this to compute a gradient to find its way out of the undefined region.; This can drastically improve its ability to recover when unstable fit models are used, for example RooPolynomial. For details, see the RooFit tutorial [rf612_recoverFromInvalidParameters.C](https://root.cern/doc/v624/rf612__recoverFromInvalidParameters_8C.html); and [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### Modernised RooDataHist. RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated. This holds especially for direct accesses to `_curWeight`,; `_curWeightErrLo`, etc, which have been removed. (It doesn't make sense to write to these members from const functions when the same information; can be retrieved using an index access operator of an array.) All similar accesses in derived classes should be replaced by the getters `get_curWeight()`; or better `get_wgt(i)`, which were also supported in ROOT \<v6.24. More details on what happened:. - Reduced side effects. This code produces undefined behaviour because the side effect of `get(i)`, i.e., loading the new weight into `_curWeight`; is not guaranteed to happen before `weight()` is called:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight()); // Dangerous! Order of evaluation is not guaranteed.; ```; With the modernised interface, one would use:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight(i));; ```; To modernise old code, one should replace patterns like `h.get(i); h.func()` by `h.func(i);`.

The minimiser can use this to compute a gradient to find its way out of the undefined region.; This can drastically improve its ability to recover when unstable fit models are used, for example RooPolynomial. For details, see the RooFit tutorial [rf612_recoverFromInvalidParameters.C](https://root.cern/doc/v624/rf612__recoverFromInvalidParameters_8C.html); and [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### Modernised RooDataHist. RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated. This holds especially for direct accesses to `_curWeight`,; `_curWeightErrLo`, etc, which have been removed. (It doesn't make sense to write to these members from const functions when the same information; can be retrieved using an index access operator of an array.) All similar accesses in derived classes should be replaced by the getters `get_curWeight()`; or better `get_wgt(i)`, which were also supported in ROOT \<v6.24. More details on what happened:. - Reduced side effects. This code produces undefined behaviour because the side effect of `get(i)`, i.e., loading the new weight into `_curWeight`; is not guaranteed to happen before `weight()` is called:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight()); // Dangerous! Order of evaluation is not guaranteed.; ```; With the modernised interface, one would use:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight(i));; ```; To modernise old code, one should replace patterns like `h.get(i); h.func()` by `h.func(i);`. One may `#define R__SUGGEST_NEW_INTERFACE` to switch on; deprecation wa

Writing a custom parser; -----------------------. One of the simplest and most common extensions is the use of a custom parser.; As `discussed previously`_, parsers are the portion of the CommandLine library; that turns string input from the user into a particular parsed data type,; validating the input in the process. There are two ways to use a new parser:. #. Specialize the `cl::parser`_ template for your custom data type. This approach has the advantage that users of your custom data type will; automatically use your custom parser whenever they define an option with a; value type of your data type. The disadvantage of this approach is that it; doesn't work if your fundamental data type is something that is already; supported. #. Write an independent class, using it explicitly from options that need it.

Content: . _float:; .. _double:. * The **parser<double>** and **parser<float> specializations** use the standard; C ``strtod`` function to convert floating point strings into floating point; values. As such, a broad range of string formats is supported, including; exponential notation (ex: ``1.7e15``) and properly supports locales. .. _Extension Guide:; .. _extending the library:. Extension Guide; ===============. Although the CommandLine library has a lot of functionality built into it; already (as discussed previously), one of its true strengths lie in its; extensibility. This section discusses how the CommandLine library works under; the covers and illustrates how to do some simple, common, extensions. .. _Custom parsers:; .. _custom parser:; .. _Writing a Custom Parser:. Writing a custom parser; -----------------------. One of the simplest and most common extensions is the use of a custom parser.; As `discussed previously`_, parsers are the portion of the CommandLine library; that turns string input from the user into a particular parsed data type,; validating the input in the process. There are two ways to use a new parser:. #. Specialize the `cl::parser`_ template for your custom data type. This approach has the advantage that users of your custom data type will; automatically use your custom parser whenever they define an option with a; value type of your data type. The disadvantage of this approach is that it; doesn't work if your fundamental data type is something that is already; supported. #. Write an independent class, using it explicitly from options that need it. This approach works well in situations where you would line to parse an; option using special syntax for a not-very-special data-type. The drawback; of this approach is that users of your parser have to be aware that they are; using your parser instead of the builtin ones. To guide the discussion, we will discuss a custom parser that accepts file; sizes, specified with an optional unit after the numeric

Content: .. _classes:. Classes; =======. Both Python and C++ support object-oriented code through classes and thus; it is logical to expose C++ classes as Python ones, including the full; inheritance hierarchy. The C++ code used for the examples below can be found; :doc:`here <cppyy_features_header>`, and it is assumed that that code is; loaded at the start of any session.; Download it, save it under the name ``features.h``, and load it:. .. code-block:: python. >>> import cppyy; >>> cppyy.include('features.h'); >>>. `Basics`; --------. All bound C++ code starts off from the global C++ namespace, represented in; Python by ``gbl``.; This namespace, as any other namespace, is treated as a module after it has; been loaded.; Thus, we can import C++ classes that live underneath it:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.gbl import Concrete; >>> Concrete; <class cppyy.gbl.Concrete at 0x2058e30>; >>>. Placing classes in the same structure as imposed by C++ guarantees identity,; even if multiple Python modules bind the same class.; There is, however, no necessity to expose that structure to end-users: when; developing a Python package that exposes C++ classes through ``cppyy``,; consider ``cppyy.gbl`` an ""internal"" module, and expose the classes in any; structure you see fit.; The C++ names will continue to follow the C++ structure, however, as is needed; for e.g. pickling:. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.gbl import Namespace; >>> Concrete == Namespace.Concrete; False; >>> n = Namespace.Concrete.NestedClass(); >>> type(n); <class cppyy.gbl.Namespace.Concrete.NestedClass at 0x22114c0>; >>> type(n).__name__; NestedClass; >>> type(n).__module__; cppyy.gbl.Namespace.Concrete; >>> type(n).__cpp_name__; Namespace::Concrete::NestedClass; >>>. `Constructors`; --------------. Python and C++ both make a distinction between allocation (``__new__`` in; Python, ``operator new`` in C++) and initialization (``__init__`` in Python,; the constructor call in C++).; When binding, however, ther

Security,".. code-block:: c++. AType *Foo;; ...; X = &Foo->F;. it is natural to think that there is only one index, the selection of the field; ``F``. However, in this example, ``Foo`` is a pointer. That pointer; must be indexed explicitly in LLVM. C, on the other hand, indices through it; transparently. To arrive at the same address location as the C code, you would; provide the GEP instruction with two index operands. The first operand indexes; through the pointer; the second operand indexes the field ``F`` of the; structure, just as if you wrote:. .. code-block:: c++. X = &Foo[0].F;. Sometimes this question gets rephrased as:. .. _GEP index through first pointer:. *Why is it okay to index through the first pointer, but subsequent pointers; won't be dereferenced?*. The answer is simply because memory does not have to be accessed to perform the; computation. The second operand to the GEP instruction must be a value of a; pointer type. The value of the pointer is provided directly to the GEP; instruction as an operand without any need for accessing memory. It must,; therefore be indexed and requires an index operand. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: c++. struct munger_struct {; int f1;; int f2;; };; void munge(struct munger_struct *P) {; P[0].f1 = P[1].f1 + P[2].f2;; }; ...; struct munger_struct Array[3];; ...; munge(Array);. In this ""C"" example, the front end compiler (Clang) will generate three GEP; instructions for the three indices through ""P"" in the assignment statement. The; function argument ``P`` will be the second operand of each of these GEP; instructions. The third operand indexes through that pointer. The fourth; operand will be the field offset into the ``struct munger_struct`` type, for; either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field. So, in LLVM assembly the ``munge`` function; looks like:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @munge(ptr %P) {; entry:; %tmp = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 1, i32 0; %tmp1 = load i32, ptr %tmp; %tmp2 = getelementptr %str",access,MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:2338,accessing,2338,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['access'],['accessing'],"The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access.

The first operand indexes; through the pointer; the second operand indexes the field ``F`` of the; structure, just as if you wrote:. .. code-block:: c++. X = &Foo[0].F;. Sometimes this question gets rephrased as:. .. _GEP index through first pointer:. *Why is it okay to index through the first pointer, but subsequent pointers; won't be dereferenced?*. The answer is simply because memory does not have to be accessed to perform the; computation. The second operand to the GEP instruction must be a value of a; pointer type. The value of the pointer is provided directly to the GEP; instruction as an operand without any need for accessing memory. It must,; therefore be indexed and requires an index operand. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: c++. struct munger_struct {; int f1;; int f2;; };; void munge(struct munger_struct *P) {; P[0].f1 = P[1].f1 + P[2].f2;; }; ...; struct munger_struct Array[3];; ...; munge(Array);. In this ""C"" example, the front end compiler (Clang) will generate three GEP; instructions for the three indices through ""P"" in the assignment statement. The; function argument ``P`` will be the second operand of each of these GEP; instructions. The third operand indexes through that pointer. The fourth; operand will be the field offset into the ``struct munger_struct`` type, for; either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field. So, in LLVM assembly the ``munge`` function; looks like:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @munge(ptr %P) {; entry:; %tmp = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 1, i32 0; %tmp1 = load i32, ptr %tmp; %tmp2 = getelementptr %str

Security,".h`, so that it can; retained in the original file. For more complicated scenarios, the `code` variable can be used to identify; use cases (parts of the mathematical code in `evaluate()`) that should be; supported, while other parts that are explicitly not be supported (e.g., using; `if code==1 {...} else if code==2 {...}`). ### Can classes using Numerical Integration support AD?. So far, no. This needs further exploration. Hint: classes using Numerical; Integration can be identified with the absence of the `analyticalIntegral()`; function. ### Why is my code falling back to Numeric Differentiation?. If you call in to an external Math library, and you use a function that has a; customized variant with an already defined custom derivative, then you may see; a warning like ""falling back to Numeric Differentiation"". In most such cases,; your derivative should still work, since Numeric Differentiation is already; well-tested in Clad. To handle this, either define a custom derivative for that external function,; or find a way to expose it to Clad. An example of this can be seen with `gamma_cdf()` in MathFuncs.h`,; for which the custom derivative is not supported, but in this specific; instance, it falls back to Numeric Differentiation and works fine, since `; gamma_cdf()` doesn't have a lot of parameters. > In such cases, Numeric Differentiation fallback is only used for that; specific function. In above example, `gamma_cdf()` falls back to Numeric; Differentiation but other functions in `MathFuncs.h` will still be; able to use AD.

So far, no. This needs further exploration. Hint: classes using Numerical; Integration can be identified with the absence of the `analyticalIntegral()`; function. ### Why is my code falling back to Numeric Differentiation?. If you call in to an external Math library, and you use a function that has a; customized variant with an already defined custom derivative, then you may see; a warning like ""falling back to Numeric Differentiation"". In most such cases,; your derivative should still work, since Numeric Differentiation is already; well-tested in Clad. To handle this, either define a custom derivative for that external function,; or find a way to expose it to Clad. An example of this can be seen with `gamma_cdf()` in MathFuncs.h`,; for which the custom derivative is not supported, but in this specific; instance, it falls back to Numeric Differentiation and works fine, since `; gamma_cdf()` doesn't have a lot of parameters. > In such cases, Numeric Differentiation fallback is only used for that; specific function. In above example, `gamma_cdf()` falls back to Numeric; Differentiation but other functions in `MathFuncs.h` will still be; able to use AD. This is because Clad is going to assume that you have a; derivative for this `gamma_cdf()` function, and the remaining functions will; use AD as expected. In the end, the remaining functions (including; `gamma_cdf()`) will try to fall back to Numeric Differentiation. However, if you want to add pure AD support, you need to make sure that all; your external functions are supported by Clad (meaning there is a custom; derivative defined for each o

This gives us a way of ensuring; that certain functions are either always or never instrumented by not having to; add the attribute to the source. To use this feature, you can define one file for the functions to always; instrument, and another for functions to never instrument. The format of these; files are exactly the same as the SanitizerLists files that control similar; things for the sanitizer implementations. For example:. ::. # xray-attr-list.txt; # always instrument functions that match the following filters:; [always]; fun:main. # never instrument functions that match the following filters:; [never]; fun:__cxx_*. Given the file above we can re-build by providing it to the; ``-fxray-attr-list=`` flag to clang. You can have multiple files, each defining; different sets of attribute sets, to be combined into a single list by clang. The XRay stack tool; -------------------.
