Any information; contained in the gzip header is not retained, so applications that need that; information should instead use raw inflate, see inflateInit2() below, or; inflateBack() and perform their own processing of the gzip header and; trailer. inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed; or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has; been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a; preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was; corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect check; value), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example; if next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory,; Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible or if there was not enough room in the; output buffer when Z_FINISH is used.

Here the signal and background likelihoods, \f$ L_S \f$,; \f$ L_B \f$, are products of the corresponding probability; densities, \f$ p_S \f$, \f$ p_B \f$, of the; \f$ N_{var} \f$ discriminating variables used in the MVA:. \f[; L_S(i) \ \prod_{j=1}^{N_{var}} p_{Sj} (i); \f]. and accordingly for \f$ L_B \f$.; In practise, TMVA uses polynomial splines to estimate the probability; density functions (PDF) obtained from the distributions of the; training variables. Note that in TMVA the output of the likelihood ratio is transformed by:. \f[; R_L(i) \to R'_L(i) = -\frac{1}{\tau} ln(R_L^{-1}(i) -1); \f]. to avoid the occurrence of heavy peaks at \f$ R_L = 0.1 \f$ . #### Decorrelated (or ""diagonalized"") Likelihood. The biggest drawback of the Likelihood approach is that it assumes; that the discriminant variables are uncorrelated. If it were the case,; it can be proven that the discrimination obtained by the above likelihood; ratio is optimal, ie, no other method can beat it. However, in most; practical applications of MVAs correlations are present. </p>. Linear correlations, measured from the training sample, can be taken; into account in a straightforward manner through the square-root; of the covariance matrix. The square-root of a matrix; \f$ C \f$ is the matrix \f$ C&prime; \f$ that multiplied with itself; yields \f$ C \f$: \f$ C \f$=\f$ C&prime;C&prime; \f$. We compute the; square-root matrix (SQM) by means of diagonalising (\f$ D \f$) the; covariance matrix:. \f[; D = S^TCS \Rightarrow C' = S \sqrt{DS^T}; \f]. and the linear transformation of the linearly correlated into the; uncorrelated variables space i

Content: h can be performed with RDataFrame. ### Transformations; Transformations are a way to manipulate the data. | **Transformation** | **Description** |; |------------------|--------------------|; | Alias() | Introduce an alias for a particular column name. |; | DefaultValueFor() | If the value of the input column is missing, provide a default value instead. |; | Define() | Create a new column in the dataset. Example usages include adding a column that contains the invariant mass of a particle, or a selection of elements of an array (e.g. only the `pt`s of ""good"" muons). |; | DefinePerSample() | Define a new column that is updated when the input sample changes, e.g. when switching tree being processed in a chain. |; | DefineSlot() | Same as Define(), but the user-defined function must take an extra `unsigned int slot` as its first parameter. `slot` will take a different value, `0` to `nThreads - 1`, for each thread of execution. This is meant as a helper in writing thread-safe Define() transformation when using RDataFrame after ROOT::EnableImplicitMT(). DefineSlot() works just as well with single-thread execution: in that case `slot` will always be `0`. |; | DefineSlotEntry() | Same as DefineSlot(), but the entry number is passed in addition to the slot number.

The tolerance parameter (which is a member of this base class) plays; a crucial role in all operations of the decomposition classes . It; gives the user a powerful tool to monitor and steer the operations; Its default value is sqrt(epsilon) where 1+epsilon = 1. If you do not want to be bothered by the following considerations,; like in most other linear algebra packages, just set the tolerance; with SetTol to an arbitrary small number . The tolerance number is used by each decomposition method to decide; whether the matrix is near singular, except of course SVD which can; handle singular matrices .; For each decomposition this will be checked in a different way; in LU; the matrix is considered singular when, at some point in the; decomposition, a diagonal element < fTol . Therefore, we had to set in; the example above of the (10x10) Hilbert, which is near singular, the; tolerance on 10e-12 . (The fact that we have to set the tolerance <; sqrt(epsilon) is a clear indication that we are losing precision .). If the matrix is flagged as being singular, operations with the; decomposition will fail and will return matrices/vectors that are; invalid . The observant reader will notice that by scaling the complete matrix; by some small number the decomposition will detect a singular matrix .; In this case the user will have to reduce the tolerance number by this; factor . (For CPU time saving we decided not to make this an automatic; procedure) . Code for this could look as follows:; ~~~; const Double_t max_abs = Abs(a).Max();; const Double_t scale = TMath::Min(max_abs,1.);; a.SetTol(a.GetTol()*scale);; ~~~.

That is to say that, summing up the \f${\rm N}_{\rm s}\f$ \f$\hbox {$_s$}{\cal P}lots\f$,; one recovers the data sample distribution in \f$x\f$, and summing up the number of events; entering in a \f$\hbox{$_s$}{\cal P}lot\f$ for a given species, one recovers the yield of the; species, as provided by the fit.; The property 4 is implemented in the TSPlot class as a check. - the sum of the statistical uncertainties per bin. \f[; \sigma[N_{\rm n}\ _s\tilde{\rm M}_{\rm n}(x) {\delta x}]~=~\sqrt{\sum_{e \subset {\delta x}} ({_s{\cal P}}_{\rm n})^2} ~. \tag{6}; \f]. reproduces the statistical uncertainty on the yield \f$N_{\rm n}\f$, as provided by the fit:; \f$\sigma[N_{\rm n}]\equiv\sqrt{\hbox{ V}_{{\rm n}{\rm n}}}\f$ .; Because of that and since the determination of the yields is optimal; when obtained using a Likelihood fit, one can conclude that the \f$\hbox{$_s$}{\cal P}lot\f$; technique is itself an optimal method to reconstruct distributions of control variables. ### Different steps followed by TSPlot. 1. A maximum Likelihood fit is performed to obtain the yields \f$N_i\f$; of the various species.The fit relies on discriminating variab

Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: ifferences are:; // 1. Separate vftable and vbtable.; //; // 2. Each subobject with a vfptr gets its own vftable rather than an address; // point in a single vtable shared between all the subobjects.; // Each vftable is represented by a separate section and virtual calls; // must be done using the vftable which has a slot for the function to be; // called.; //; // 3. Virtual method definitions expect their 'this' parameter to point to the; // first vfptr whose table provides a compatible overridden method. In many; // cases, this permits the original vf-table entry to directly call; // the method instead of passing through a thunk.; // See example before VFTableBuilder::ComputeThisOffset below.; //; // A compatible overridden method is one which does not have a non-trivial; // covariant-return adjustment.; //; // The first vfptr is the one with the lowest offset in the complete-object; // layout of the defining class, and the method definition will subtract; // that constant offset from the parameter value to get the real 'this'; // value. Therefore, if the offset isn't really constant (e.g. if a virtual; // function defined in a virtual base is overridden in a more derived; // virtual base and these bases have a reverse order in the complete; // object), the vf-table may require a this-adjustment thunk.; //; // 4. vftables do not contain new entries for overrides that merely require; // this-adjustment. Together with #3, this keeps vf-tables smaller and; // eliminates the need for this-adjustment thunks in many cases, at the cost; // of often requiring redundant work to adjust the ""this"" pointer.; //; // 5. Instead of VTT and constructor vtables, vbtables and vtordisps are used.; // Vtordisps are emitted into the class layout if a class has; // a) a user-defined ctor/dtor; // and; // b) a method overriding a method in a virtual base.; //; // To get a better understanding of this code,; // you might want to see examples in test/CodeGenCXX/microsoft-abi-vtables-*.cpp

Safety,"ionary(), this param can be set on the CCtx to control; * whether the CDict that is created internally can use the feature or not.; *; * What it does:; *; * Normally, the internal data structures of the CDict are analogous to what; * would be stored in a CCtx after compressing the contents of a dictionary.; * To an approximation, a compression using a dictionary can then use those; * data structures to simply continue what is effectively a streaming; * compression where the simulated compression of the dictionary left off.; * Which is to say, the search structures in the CDict are normally the same; * format as in the CCtx.; *; * It is possible to do better, since the CDict is not like a CCtx: the search; * structures are written once during CDict creation, and then are only read; * after that, while the search structures in the CCtx are both read and; * written as the compression goes along. This means we can choose a search; * structure for the dictionary that is read-optimized.; *; * This feature enables the use of that different structure.; *; * Note that some of the members of the ZSTD_compressionParameters struct have; * different semantics and constraints in the dedicated search structure. It is; * highly recommended that you simply set a compression level in the CCtxParams; * you pass into the CDict creation call, and avoid messing with the cParams; * directly.; *; * Effects:; *; * This will only have any effect when the selected ZSTD_strategy; * implementation supports this feature.

This means we can choose a search; * structure for the dictionary that is read-optimized.; *; * This feature enables the use of that different structure.; *; * Note that some of the members of the ZSTD_compressionParameters struct have; * different semantics and constraints in the dedicated search structure.

Quality Attribute: Safety
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: l not compute an adler32 check value. windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip encoding. Add; 16 to windowBits to write a simple gzip header and trailer around the; compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper. The gzip header will have no; file name, no extra data, no comment, no modification time (set to zero),; no header crc, and the operating system will be set to 255 (unknown). If a; gzip stream is being written, strm->adler is a crc32 instead of an adler32. The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated; for the internal compression state. memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but; is slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory; for optimal speed. The default value is 8. See zconf.h for total memory; usage as a function of windowBits and memLevel. The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the; value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a; filter (or predictor), Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no; string match), or Z_RLE to limit match distances to one (run-length; encoding). Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat; random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to; compress them better. The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman; coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between; Z_DEFAULT and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY. Z_RLE is designed to be almost as fast as; Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY, but give better compression for PNG image data. The strategy; parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the correctness of the; compressed output even if it is not set appropriately. Z_FIXED prevents the; use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler decoder for special; applications. deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough; memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as an invalid; method). msg is set to null if there is no error message. def

The mode parameter is as; in fopen (""rb"" or ""wb"") but can also include a compression level (""wb9"") or; a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in ""wb6f"", 'h' for Huffman-only; compression as in ""wb1h"", 'R' for run-length encoding as in ""wb1R"", or 'F'; for fixed code compression as in ""wb9F"". (See the description of; deflateInit2 for more information about the strategy parameter.) 'T' will; request transparent writing or appending with no compression and not using; the gzip format. ""a"" can be used instead of ""w"" to request that the gzip stream that will; be written be appended to the file. ""+"" will result in an error, since; reading and writing to the same gzip file is not supported. The addition of; ""x"" when writing will create the file exclusively, which fails if the file; already exists. On systems that support it, the addition of ""e"" when; reading or writing will set the flag to close the file on an execve() call. These functions, as well as gzip, will read and decode a sequence of gzip; streams in a file. The append function of gzopen() can be used to create; such a file.

In particular, normalisation constants; can be omitted to speed up the function evaluations, and included later; in the integration of the PDF (see below), which is rarely called in; comparison to the `evaluate()` function. In addition, RooAbsPdf objects do not have a static concept of what; variables are parameters, and what variables are dependents (which; need to be integrated over for a correct PDF normalization).; Instead, the choice of normalization is always specified each time a; normalized value is requested from the PDF via the getVal(); method. RooAbsPdf manages the entire normalization logic of each PDF with; the help of a RooRealIntegral object, which coordinates the integration; of a given choice of normalization. By default, RooRealIntegral will; perform an entirely numeric integration of all dependents. However,; PDFs can advertise one or more (partial) analytical integrals of; their function, and these will be used by RooRealIntegral, if it; determines that this is safe (i.e., no hidden Jacobian terms,; multiplication with other PDFs that have one or more dependents in; common, etc). #### Implementing analytical integrals; To implement analytical integrals, two functions must be implemented. First,. ```; Int_t getAnalyticalIntegral(const RooArgSet& integSet, RooArgSet& anaIntSet); ```; should return the analytical integrals that are supported. `integSet`; is the set of dependents for which integration is requested. The; function should copy the subset of dependents it can analytically; integrate to `anaIntSet`, and return a unique identification code for; this integration configuration. If no integration can be; performed, zero should be returned. Second,. ```; double analyticalIntegral(Int_t code); ```. implements the actual analytical integral(s) advertised by; `getAnalyticalIntegral()`. This function will only be called with; codes returned by `getAnalyticalIntegral

Content: ts, but the number of row; * groups does not. Some garbage sample rows may be included in the last iMCU; * row at the bottom of the image.; *; * Depending on the vertical scaling algorithm used, the upsampler may need; * access to the sample row(s) above and below its current input row group.; * The upsampler is required to set need_context_rows TRUE at global selection; * time if so. When need_context_rows is FALSE, this controller can simply; * obtain one iMCU row at a time from the coefficient controller and dole it; * out as row groups to the postprocessor.; *; * When need_context_rows is TRUE, this controller guarantees that the buffer; * passed to postprocessing contains at least one row group's worth of samples; * above and below the row group(s) being processed. Note that the context; * rows ""above"" the first passed row group appear at negative row offsets in; * the passed buffer. At the top and bottom of the image, the required; * context rows are manufactured by duplicating the first or last real sample; * row; this avoids having special cases in the upsampling inner loops.; *; * The amount of context is fixed at one row group just because that's a; * convenient number for this controller to work with. The existing; * upsamplers really only need one sample row of context. An upsampler; * supporting arbitrary output rescaling might wish for more than one row; * group of context when shrinking the image; tough, we don't handle that.; * (This is justified by the assumption that downsizing will be handled mostly; * by adjusting the DCT_scaled_size values, so that the actual scale factor at; * the upsample step needn't be much less than one.); *; * To provide the desired context, we have to retain the last two row groups; * of one iMCU row while reading in the next iMCU row.

Quality Attribute: Security
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.

The adjusted time stamp is split into three fields, and the; clockSeq is split into two fields. The timestamp is a 60-bit value. For UUID version 1, this; is represented by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC/GMT) as; a count of 100-nanosecond intervals since 00:00:00.00,; 15 October 1582 (the date of Gregorian reform to the; Christian calendar). The version number is multiplexed in the 4 most significant; bits of the 'fTimeHiAndVersion' field. There are two defined; versions:; ~~~ {.cpp}; MSB <---; Version 4-Bit Code Description; ------------------------------------------------------------; | 1 0 0 0 1 DCE version, as specified herein.; | 2 0 0 1 0 DCE Security version, with; | embedded POSIX UIDs.; | 3 0 0 1 1 node id is a random value; ------------------------------------------------------------; ~~~. ## Clock Sequence. The clock sequence value must be changed whenever:. The UUID generator detects that the local value of UTC; has gone backward; this may be due to re-syncing of the system; clock. While a node is operational, the UUID service always saves; the last UTC used to create a UUID. Each time a new UUID; is created, the current UTC is compared to the saved value; and if either the current value is less or the saved value; was lost, then the clock sequence is incremented modulo; 16,384, thus avoiding production of duplicated UUIDs. The clock sequence must be initialized to a random number; to minimize the correlation across system. This provides; maximum protection against node identifiers that may move; or switch from system to system rapidly. ## Clock Adjustment. UUIDs may be created at a rate greater than the system clock; resolution. T

Content:  `SURF`, `LEGO`, `CONT` etc..). When a TGraph2D is drawn with one of the 2D histogram drawing option,; an intermediate 2D histogram is filled using the Delaunay triangles; to interpolate the data set. The 2D histogram has equidistant bins along the X; and Y directions. The number of bins along each direction can be change using; `SetNpx()` and `SetNpy()`. Each bin is filled with the Z; value found via a linear interpolation on the plane defined by the triangle above; the (X,Y) coordinates of the bin center. The existing (X,Y,Z) points can be randomly scattered.; The Delaunay triangles are build in the (X,Y) plane. These 2D triangles are then; used to define flat planes in (X,Y,Z) over which the interpolation is done to fill; the 2D histogram. The 3D triangles int takes build a 3D surface in; the form of tessellating triangles at various angles. The triangles found can be; drawn in 3D with one of the TGraph2D specific drawing options. The histogram generated by the Delaunay interpolation can be accessed using the; `GetHistogram()` method. The axis settings (title, ranges etc ...) can be changed accessing the axis via; the GetXaxis GetYaxis and GetZaxis methods. They access the histogram axis created; at drawing time only.

The archive format is used among others by; PKZip and Info-ZIP. The compression algorithm is also used by; GZIP and the PNG graphics standard. The format of the archives is; explained briefly below. This class provides an interface to read; such archives.; A ZIP archive contains a prefix, series of archive members; (sub-files), and a central directory. In theory the archive could; span multiple disks (or files) with the central directory of the; whole archive on the last disk, but this class does not support; such multi-part archives. The prefix is only used in self-extracting; executable archive files.; The members are stored in the archive sequentially, each with a; local header followed by the (optionally) compressed data; the local; header describes the member, including its file name and compressed; and real sizes. The central directory includes the member details; again, plus allows an extra member comment to be added. The last; member in the central directory is an end marker that can contain; a comment for the whole archive. Both the local header and the; central directory can also carry extra member-specific data; the; data in the local and global parts can be different.; The fact that the archive has a global directory makes it efficient; and allows for only the reading of the desired data, one does not; have to scan through the whole file to find the desired sub-file.; The Zip64 extensions are supported so files larger than 2GB can be; stored in archives larger than 4 GB.; Once the archive has been opened, the client can query the members; and read their contents by asking the archive for an offset where; the sub-file starts. The members can be accessed in any order.; */

This global gbin is useful; to access the bin content/error information independently of the dimension.; Note that to access the information other than bin content and errors; one should use the TAxis object directly with e.g.:; ~~~ {.cpp}; Double_t xcenter = h3->GetZaxis()->GetBinCenter(27);; ~~~; returns the center along z of bin number 27 (not the global bin); in the 3-D histogra

The number of clusters in a TTree can be retrieved by typing `rootls -lt myfile.root` at a command line. ### Distributed Snapshot. The Snapshot operation behaves slightly differently when executed distributedly. First off, it requires the path; supplied to the Snapshot call to be accessible from any worker of the cluster and from the client machine (in general; it should be provided as an absolute path). Another important difference is that `n` separate files will be produced,; where `n` is the number of dataset partitions. As with local RDataFrame, the result of a Snapshot on a distributed; RDataFrame is another distributed RDataFrame on which we can define a new computation graph and run more distributed; computations. ### Distributed RunGraphs.

Quality Attribute: Security
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.
Content: . This parameter is accepted irrespectively of the; backend used:. ~~~{.py}; import ROOT. # Define correct imports and access the distributed RDataFrame appropriate for the; # backend used in the analysis; RDataFrame = ROOT.RDF.Experimental.Distributed.[BACKEND].RDataFrame. if __name__ == ""__main__"":; # The `npartitions` optional argument tells the RDataFrame how many tasks are desired; df = RDataFrame(""mytree"",""myfile.root"", npartitions=NPARTITIONS); # Proceed as usual; df.Define(""x"",""someoperation"").Histo1D((""name"", ""title"", 10, 0, 10), ""x""); ~~~. Note that when processing a TTree or TChain dataset, the `npartitions` value should not exceed the number of clusters in; the dataset. The number of clusters in a TTree can be retrieved by typing `rootls -lt myfile.root` at a command line. ### Distributed Snapshot. The Snapshot operation behaves slightly differently when executed distributedly. First off, it requires the path; supplied to the Snapshot call to be accessible from any worker of the cluster and from the client machine (in general; it should be provided as an absolute path). Another important difference is that `n` separate files will be produced,; where `n` is the number of dataset partitions. As with local RDataFrame, the result of a Snapshot on a distributed; RDataFrame is another distributed RDataFrame on which we can define a new computation graph and run more distributed; computations. ### Distributed RunGraphs. Submitting multiple distributed RDataFrame executions is supported through the RunGraphs function. Similarly to its; local counterpart, the function expects an iterable of objects representing an RDataFrame action. Each action will be; triggered concurrently to send multiple computation graphs to a distributed cluster at the same time:. ~~~{.py}; import ROOT; RDataFrame = ROOT.RDF.Experimental.Distributed.Dask.RDataFrame; RunGraphs = ROOT.RDF.Experimental.Distributed.RunGraphs. # Create 3 different dataframes and book an histogram on each one; h

This method doesn't depend on the compiler but; * violates the C standard.; * It can generate buggy code on targets which do not support unaligned; * memory accesses.; * But in some circumstances, it's the only known way to get the most; * performance (example: GCC + ARMv6); * Method 3:; * Byteshift. This can generate the best code on old compilers which don't; * inline small `memcpy()` calls, and it might also be faster on big-endian; * systems which lack a native byteswap instruction.; * See https://stackoverflow.com/a/32095106/646947 for details.; * Prefer these methods in priority order (0 > 1 > 2 > 3); */

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",False,"The content discusses memory access optimization techniques which are related to performance rather than security. While it touches on compiler-specific features and potential portability issues, there's no mention of safeguarding information, unauthorized access, or any aspect of confidentiality, integrity, or availability as described in the Security attribute. Instead, it focuses on code tuning for better performance."
