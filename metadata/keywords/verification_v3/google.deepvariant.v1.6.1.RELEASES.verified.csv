[Case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6/docs/deepvariant-vg-case-study.md) demonstrates improved accuracy; * Substantial improvements to DeepTrio de novo accuracy by specifically training DeepTrio for this use case (for chr20 at 30x HG002-HG003-HG004, false negatives reduced from 8 to 0 with DeepTrio v1.4, false positives reduced from 5 to 0).; * We have added multi-processing ability in `postprocess_variants` which reduces 48 minutes to 30 minutes for Illumina WGS and 56 minutes to 33 minutes with PacBio.; * We have added new models trained with Complete genomics data, and added case studies.; * We have added NovaSeqX to the training data for the WGS model.; * We have migrated our training and inference platform from Slim to Keras.; * Force calling with approximate phasing is now available. We are sincerely grateful to ; * @wkwan and @paulinesho for the contribution to helping in Keras move.; * @lucasbrambrink for enabling multiprocessing in `postprocess_variants`.; * @msamman, @akiraly1 for their contributions.; * PacBio: William Rowell (@williamrowell), Nathaniel Echols for their feedback and testing.; * UCSC: Benedict Paten(@benedictpaten), Shloka Negi (@shlokanegi), Jimin Park (@jimin001), Mobin Asri (@mobinasri) for the feedback.

",False,"The provided content discusses technical updates and performance improvements related to computational tools and workflows in genomics (e.g., improved support for haploid regions, addition of pangenome workflow, enhanced accuracy of DeepTrio de novo assembly, multi-processing ability). While these are significant improvements, they primarily relate to the technical aspects of software implementation rather than directly addressing usability. Usability concerns typically involve user interface design, accessibility, ease of use, and user satisfaction, which are not explicitly mentioned here. The content focuses more on functionality, performance, and underlying system enhancements than on how users interact with or perceive the tool. Therefore, it does not accurately reflect the intended quality attribute of Usability."
Usability,"* New model datatype: `--model_type ONT_R104` is a new option.

In our evaluations this single model performs well on both Sequel II and Revio datatypes. Please use DeepVariant v1.5 and later for Revio data. ; * Incorporated Element Biosciences data in WGS models. We found that we could jointly train a short-read WGS model with both Illumina and Element data. Inclusion of Element data improves accuracy on Element without negative effect on Illumina. Please use the WGS model for best results on either Illumina or Element data.; * Added vg/Giraffe-mapped BAMs to DeepVariant WGS training data (alongside existing BWA). We observed that a single model can be trained for strong results with both BWA and vg/Giraffe. ; * Improved DeepVariant WES model for 100bps exome sequencing thanks to user-reported issues (including https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/586 and https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/592).; * Thanks to Tong Zhu from Nvidia for his suggestion to [improve the logic for shuffling reads](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/commit/249e318470395fcc55fd5377f77a67e988288021).; * Thanks to Doron Shem-Tov (@doron-st) and Ilya Soifer (@ilyasoifer) from Ultima Genomics for adding new functionalities enabled by flags `--enable_joint_realignment` and `--p_error`.; * Thanks to Dennis Yelizarov for improving Google-internal infrastructure for running make_examples.; * Updated TensorFlow version to 2.11.0.

Usability,"This release has a new WGS model that has major accuracy improvement on PCR+ data. We also released a new WES model that has some minor accuracy improvement. A few important changes in this release:; 1.

This time we found that it didn’t help with WGS accuracy, so we removed them); 1. Improved training data labels. See [haplotype_labeler.py](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/tree/r0.6/deepvariant/labeler/haplotype_labeler.py); 1.
