For other targets that have ms_struct enabled; // (most probably via a pragma or attribute), trigger a diagnostic; // that defaults to an error.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: // Break the block into scheduling regions [I, RegionEnd). RegionEnd; // points to the scheduling boundary at the bottom of the region. The DAG; // does not include RegionEnd, but the region does (i.e. the next; // RegionEnd is above the previous RegionBegin). If the current block has; // no terminator then RegionEnd == MBB->end() for the bottom region.; //; // All the regions of MBB are first found and stored in MBBRegions, which; // will be processed (MBB) top-down if initialized with true.; //; // The Scheduler may insert instructions during either schedule() or; // exitRegion(), even for empty regions. So the local iterators 'I' and; // 'RegionEnd' are invalid across these calls. Instructions must not be; // added to other regions than the current one without updating MBBRegions.
