The user describes problems when saving and reading .h5ad files, noting that `adata.uns['log1p']` becomes an empty dictionary after certain operations. The issue seems to be related to data persistence between preprocessing steps and downstream analyses. The discussion centers on debugging and troubleshooting specific technical issues in data handling rather than the usability of the software or application itself.

",True,"The content provided by the user is related to an error they encountered while using scanpy. The error message indicates that the 'sum' method is not available on a 'SparseDataset' object, which suggests issues with how data is being handled in the code. This problem is likely due to changes in the library's expectations regarding data formats, such as switching from sparse to dense datasets. The user also mentions their environment and specific packages, providing context for debugging. While the main focus is on resolving an error, the underlying issue relates to data handling practices, which indirectly contributes to the overall usability of the software by ensuring proper functionality.

",False,"The given content includes a list of package versions and their corresponding version numbers (e.g., 'numpy 1.19.4').

Usability typically refers to how well a system can be used by users to achieve tasks, which includes aspects like design, navigation, and accessibility. The content here does not discuss any of these elements but instead focuses on the technical state of packages and their versions. Therefore, this content does not align with the usability quality attribute."
Usability,"ll the LOBPCG code. Moreover, if one calls the LOBPCG algorithm for 5k > n, it would likely break internally, so the code calls the standard function eigh instead. It is not that n should be large for the LOBPCG to work, but rather the ratio n / k should be large. It you call LOBPCG with k=1 and n=10, it works though n is small. The method is intended for extremely large n / k. The workaround was to rerun failed tests until the fixture randomly returned another solver, which isn’t great. I therefore simply `xfail` that test for now to not block PRs in https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/pull/2745. ### Minimal code sample. ```bash; # try one of the following to reproduce (if necessary multiple times); pytest --runxfail 'scanpy/tests/test_pca.py::test_pca_warnings[scipy_csr-zero_center-valid]'; pytest --runxfail 'scanpy/tests/test_pca.py::test_pca_warnings[scipy_csc-zero_center-valid]'; ```. ### Error output. (note that since the code is run with `warnings.simplefilter('error')`, the below is an error that fails the test). ```pytb; UserWarning: The problem size 5 minus the constraints size 0 is too small relative to the block size 4. Using a dense eigensolver instead of LOBPCG iterations.No output of the history of the iterations.; ```. ### Versions. <details>. ```; -----; anndata 0.10.2; scanpy 1.10.0.dev156+gd1a2c8f8.d20231110; -----; PIL 10.0.1; asciitree NA; cloudpickle 3.0.0; cycler 0.12.1; cython_runtime NA; dask 2023.10.0; dateutil 2.8.2; fasteners 0.19; h5py 3.10.0; igraph 0.10.8; iniconfig NA; jinja2 3.1.2; joblib 1.3.2; kiwisolver 1.4.5; leidenalg 0.10.1; llvmlite 0.41.1; markupsafe 2.1.3; matplotlib 3.8.0; mpl_toolkits NA; msgpack 1.0.7; natsort 8.4.0; numba 0.58.1; numcodecs 0.12.1; numpy 1.26.1; packaging 23.2; pandas 2.1.1; pluggy 1.3.0; psutil 5.9.6; py NA; pyparsing 3.1.1; pytest 7.4.3; pytz 2023.3.post1; scipy 1.11.3; session_info 1.0.0; setuptools 68.2.2; setuptools_scm NA; six 1.16.0; sklearn 1.3.2; sparse 0.14.0; tblib 3.0.0; texttable 1.7.0; threadpo",simpl,MatchSource.ISSUE,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/2744:1710,simplefilter,1710,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/2744,1,['simpl'],['simplefilter'],"The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: ll the LOBPCG code. Moreover, if one calls the LOBPCG algorithm for 5k > n, it would likely break internally, so the code calls the standard function eigh instead. It is not that n should be large for the LOBPCG to work, but rather the ratio n / k should be large. It you call LOBPCG with k=1 and n=10, it works though n is small. The method is intended for extremely large n / k. The workaround was to rerun failed tests until the fixture randomly returned another solver, which isn’t great. I therefore simply `xfail` that test for now to not block PRs in https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/pull/2745. ### Minimal code sample. ```bash; # try one of the following to reproduce (if necessary multiple times); pytest --runxfail 'scanpy/tests/test_pca.py::test_pca_warnings[scipy_csr-zero_center-valid]'; pytest --runxfail 'scanpy/tests/test_pca.py::test_pca_warnings[scipy_csc-zero_center-valid]'; ```. ### Error output. (note that since the code is run with `warnings.simplefilter('error')`, the below is an error that fails the test). ```pytb; UserWarning: The problem size 5 minus the constraints size 0 is too small relative to the block size 4. Using a dense eigensolver instead of LOBPCG iterations.No output of the history of the iterations.; ```. ### Versions. <details>. ```; -----; anndata 0.10.2; scanpy 1.10.0.dev156+gd1a2c8f8.d20231110; -----; PIL 10.0.1; asciitree NA; cloudpickle 3.0.0; cycler 0.12.1; cython_runtime NA; dask 2023.10.0; dateutil 2.8.2; fasteners 0.19; h5py 3.10.0; igraph 0.10.8; iniconfig NA; jinja2 3.1.2; joblib 1.3.2; kiwisolver 1.4.5; leidenalg 0.10.1; llvmlite 0.41.1; markupsafe 2.1.3; matplotlib 3.8.0; mpl_toolkits NA; msgpack 1.0.7; natsort 8.4.0; numba 0.58.1; numcodecs 0.12.1; numpy 1.26.1; packaging 23.2; pandas 2.1.1; pluggy 1.3.0; psutil 5.9.6; py NA; pyparsing 3.1.1; pytest 7.4.3; pytz 2023.3.post1; scipy 1.11.3; session_info 1.0.0; setuptools 68.2.2; setuptools_scm NA; six 1.16.0; sklearn 1.3.2; sparse 0.14.0; tblib 3.0.0; texttable 1.7.0; threadpo

Usability,"nfirmed this bug exists on the latest version of scanpy.; - [ ] (optional) I have confirmed this bug exists on the main branch of scanpy. ### What happened?. Hi!. I am new to scanpy and I am facing some trouble reading my data in an appropriate way. I noticed that anndata objects in memory require roughly 4x the space they require on disk, so working with large datasets (>50GB on disk) is prohibitive in most scenarios. The USP of h5 files, however, is that you can index and slice them on disk as if they were in memory. This way I could greatly reduce the data size before loading it into memory. However, when I attempt to filter on a backed anndata object, I encounter a TypeError. The case of gene filtering should be just a column-sum, comparing it against a threshold and then saving it as a boolean index mask. It seems like the case that the data is backed and not in memory - which should be the default when dealing with h5 files - is not considered in the scanpy API. Am I simply missing something here?. ### Minimal code sample. ```python; from urllib.request import urlretrieve; import scanpy as sc. # We are downloading a small dataset here, 43MB. url = ""https://datasets.cellxgene.cziscience.com/7fb8b010-50bd-4238-a466-7c598f16d061.h5ad""; filename = ""testfile.h5ad"". urlretrieve(url, filename). adata = sc.read_h5ad(filename, backed=""r+""). sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_cells=100); ```. ### Error output. ```pytb; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/home/ubuntu/test_scanpy.py"", line 11, in <module>; sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_cells=100); File ""/mnt/storage/anaconda3/envs/scanpy/lib/python3.12/site-packages/scanpy/preprocessing/_simple.py"", line 237, in filter_genes; filter_genes(; File ""/mnt/storage/anaconda3/envs/scanpy/lib/python3.12/site-packages/scanpy/preprocessing/_simple.py"", line 258, in filter_genes; X if min_cells is None and max_cells is None else X > 0, axis=0; ^^^^^; TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'CSRDataset' and 'int'; ```. ###",simpl,MatchSource.ISSUE,scverse,scanpy,1.10.2,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/2894:1119,simply,1119,https://scanpy.readthedocs.io,https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/2894,1,['simpl'],['simply'],"The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction.

",True,"The content discusses an issue where a specific feature (dca learning rate selection) in scanpy does not allow for adjustment, leading to potential convergence problems. This relates directly to usability because it addresses an aspect of how effectively the software can be used. By preventing users from adjusting parameters that affect training processes, it hinders the efficiency and effectiveness of the tool. Additionally, the mention of convergence issues when trained on CPU but not GPU suggests that there might be underlying performance or resource management problems, which could further impact usability by creating unreliable or inconsistent behavior for users."

I had included a call to `scanpy.logging.print_versions()` for debugging purposes. I just ran the code using the the current main branch of scanpy, and it errored out. See below for output. ### Minimal code sample. ```python; import scanpy; scanpy.logging.print_versions(); ```. ### Error output. ```pytb; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------; KeyError Traceback (most recent call last); Cell In[44], line 1; ----> 1 sc.logging.print_versions(). File ~/Documents/Projects/githubPackages/scanpy/scanpy/logging.py:180, in print_versions(file); 178 print_versions(); 179 else:; --> 180 session_info.show(; 181 dependencies=True,; 182 html=False,; 183 excludes=[; 184 'builtins',; 185 'stdlib_list',; 186 'importlib_metadata',; 187 # Special module present if test coverage being calculated; 188 # https://gitlab.com/joelostblom/session_info/-/issues/10; 189 ""$coverage"",; 190 ],; 191 ).

As an alternative, I'm pasting the output of `scanpy.settings.set_figure_params(dpi=80, facecolor='white')`, which includes several versions in the output. ```; scanpy==1.10.0.dev88+gedd61302 anndata==0.9.2 umap==0.5.3 numpy==1.24.4 scipy==1.11.1 pandas==2.0.3 scikit-learn==1.3.0 statsmodels==0.14.0 igraph==0.10.6 pynndescent==0.5.10; ```. </details>

Hi all!. My use case for scanpy is analysis of whole-body data from a weird marine annelid. We sort of have an idea of what to expect, but a lot of the analysis is exploratory, and my main job is helping canalize the knowledge that is available in the lab into making sense of the data. In this context, dotplots are our best friend, as it provides a very nice summary of gene expression over the whole (clustered) dataset. However, yesterday we noticed a confusing edge case: let’s say gene $g$ is expressed in the same number of cells in two clusters, 4 and 23. Cluster 4 has many, many more cells than 23, therefore on the dotplot it will look like $g$; is barely expressed in 4, but a great marker for 23. Of course, combining a dotplot with a feature plot helps you see that, but you get no sense of how many cells those are (more/less/the same). To alleviate this I am proposing an extension of dotplots: instead of circles, boxes, that have a height proportional to $log(#cells_{cluster})$, are filled proportionally to how many cells express gene $g$, and are colored according to the average expression. I think this works better than violinplots. Sadly I see no good way to multiplex this and plot multiple genes at once.

Content: ve figures with all elements showing with the help of ; `fig1.savefig(""name.svg"" bbox_inches='tight')`, which solves 90% of the issue I had. I also noticed that these functions have a built in save function where I found the answer. I added a question at the bottom which is still of interest to me.
