",True,"The provided code snippet is from the RooFit library's header file, which includes information about classes and their methods. It mentions RooCustomizer, a factory class used for cloning composite PDF objects. The description of the quality attribute 'Integrability' refers to the ease of combining systems or components, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment. While the content discusses code structure, integration of components through cloning (as in splitArg) could relate to integrability. However, the direct connection is not explicit, as it focuses more on code internals rather than system integration. Therefore, this might be a false positive."

",True,"The provided content is related to RooFit's core functionality, specifically regarding its ability to integrate with other systems through shared interfaces and common components.

",True,"The content provided is a file header comment in a C++ project. The file is part of the RooFit library, which is a framework for data analysis in particle physics. The comment describes the purpose of the class, specifically mentioning that it's an abstract base class for cache management elements. This indicates that the code is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing components to be combined easily. The mention of 'abstract base class' suggests good encapsulation practices, which contribute to integrability by defining clear interfaces between classes. Additionally, the fact that it's part of a cache manager implies that the system is designed with integration in mind, as caches often serve as intermediaries between different parts of a larger system.

",True,"The content discusses finding registers that can be used as scratch registers in function prologues and epilogues, which relates to integrability as it pertains to how well systems can integrate by managing shared resources like registers. The method described is about identifying available registers for use within a basic block, which contributes to the overall integrability of the system by ensuring compatibility and reducing technical risks associated with register usage conflicts."
