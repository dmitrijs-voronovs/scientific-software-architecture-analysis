For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantities with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., \(\langle ij | ab \rangle\) integrals) may be held in the cache. Type: integer; Default: 2.

This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4’s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The conda activate command (conda >=4.4; December 2017) works in all shells, but if you’re using old source activate that only works for bash; adjust as needed for csh/tcsh.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> conda activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4.

Introduction¶; PSI4 has the ability to export cube files that store information about; basis functions, molecular orbitals, the electron density, and; the electrostatic potential (ESP). Cube files store the value of a scalar; quantity on a regular Cartesian grid, and can be visualized with several; visualization programs, some of which are free, like VMD; (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).; An example utilization of the code is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set scf_type df; set freeze_core True; set cubeprop_tasks ['orbitals']; set cubeprop_orbitals [5,6,-5,-6]. E, wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True); cubeprop(wfn). In this example, the cubeprop(); call after the energy('scf') command; executes the cubeprop code. The array CUBEPROP_TASKS specifies which; tasks should be executed. In this case the task 'orbitals' generates cube; files for orbitals.

Examples:. >>> # [1] Cube files for all orbitals; >>> E, wfn = energy('b3lyp', return_wfn=True); >>> cubeprop(wfn). >>> # [2] Cube files for density (alpha, beta, total, spin) and four orbitals; >>> # (two alpha, two beta); >>> set cubeprop_tasks ['orbitals', 'density']; >>> set cubeprop_orbitals [5, 6, -5, -6]; >>> E, wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True); >>> cubeprop(wfn). Introduction¶; PSI4 has the ability to export cube files that store information about; basis functions, molecular orbitals, the electron density, and; the electrostatic potential (ESP). Cube files store the value of a scalar; quantity on a regular Cartesian grid, and can be visualized with several; visualization programs, some of which are free, like VMD; (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).; An example utilization of the code is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set scf_type df; set freeze_core True; set cubeprop_tasks ['orbitals']; set cubeprop_orbitals [5,6,-5,-6]. E, wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True); cubeprop(wfn). In this example, the cubeprop(); call after the energy('scf') command; executes the cubeprop code. The array CUBEPROP_TASKS specifies which; tasks should be executed. In this case the task 'orbitals' generates cube; files for orbitals. The CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option specifies that cube files; should be generated only for a",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/cubeprop.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/cubeprop.html

Orbital Visualization with VMD¶; Included in PSI4 is functionality to automatically render specified surfaces, including molecular orbitals,; densities, and basis functions, using VMD. The vmd_cube.py script takes the .cube files generated; in a calculation and generates images aligned with user-input specifications. The script is located; in psi4/psi4/share/psi4/scripts/vmd_cube.py. Script Prerequisites¶. VMD must be installed, and it can be downloaded for free at (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Additionally,; the script needs to know where to find the VMD executable, and this is defined as VMDPATH. VMDPATH must be defined as; an environment variable.; To generate images with multiple surfaces, ImageMagick must also be installed. ImageMagick is a free program which; can be installed using homebrew/pip or from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php .; With ImageMagick installed, an environment variable called MONTAGE needs to be created which points to the montage executable.; This executable can be found in the /bin/ sub-directory wherever ImageMagick was installed. Running the Script¶. Run a PSI4 calculation, generating .cube files as detailed in the above documentation. Add vmd_cube.py to your path. Call vmd_cube.py and pass the directory containing; the .cube files as an argument:; 1python vmd_cube.py /path/to/cube/files/. By default the script will search for cube files in the directory in which it is called.; In addition to individual image files for each orbital, vmd_cube will also generate an image containing all surfaces in an array; (very useful for hand-picking orbital spaces).

The first number (5) is the index of the; orbital while 1-B1 indicates that this is the first orbital that belongs to the B1 irrep.; The file Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube begins with two comment lines:; 1; 2Psi4 Gaussian Cube File.; Property: Psi_a_5_1-B1. Isocontour range for 85% of the density: (0.0787495,-0.0787495). The second line reports the isocontour values that capture 85% of the probability density using; the least amount of grid points. This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option CUBEPROP_ISOCONTOUR_THRESHOLD. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]; Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry.; FRONTIER_ORBITALS; Produces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals).; DENSITY; This task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/cubeprop.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/cubeprop.html

Note; The ESP task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis; via the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword. Warning; It is important to specify the CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option when; dealing with large molecules to avoid running out of disk space.; For example, using the default grid spacing of; 0.2 Ångström, the size of a single cube file for a molecule like water; is of the order of 1.4 MB. For a molecule with 200 basis functions, the cube; files for all the orbitals occupy more than half a GB. Keywords¶. CUBEPROP_TASKS¶. Properties to compute.

One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\).; In order to obtain the DCFT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:. The energy must be stationary with respect to a set of orbitals. This can be done by; diagonalizing the generalized Fock operator (as in the DC-06 and DC-12 methods, see below),; which introduces partial orbital relaxation, or by fully relaxing the orbitals and minimizing the entire energy expression; (as in the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods).; The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density; cumulant \(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\), constrained to N-representability conditions. Making the energy stationary requires solution of two sets of coupled; equations for orbitals and density cumulant, respectively (also known as; residual equations). At the present moment, three different algorithms for the; solution of the system of coupled equations are available (see; Iterative Algorithms for details).; Publications resulting from the use of the DCFT code should cite contributions; listed here. Methods¶; Currently five DCFT methods (functionals) are available: DC-06, DC-12, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13. The first four; methods use approximate N-representability conditions derived from; second-order perturbation theory and differ in the description of the; correlated (non-idempotent) part \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\) of the one-particle density; matrix and orbital optimization. While in the DC-06 and ODC-06 methods \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\) is derived from the density cumulant; in an approximate way (labelled by ‘06’), the DC-12 and ODC-12 methods derive this contribution exactly, and; take full advantage of the N-representability conditions (which is denoted by ‘12’). The corresponding DC and ODC methods; have similar description of the \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) N-representability, but differ in describing the orbital",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/dcft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/dcft-1.html

Theory¶; Density cumulant functional theory (DCFT) is a density-based ab initio theory; that can compute electronic energies without the use of a wavefunction. The; theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and; two-particle density matrices (\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)):. \[E = h_p^q \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{2} g_{pq}^{rs} \gamma_{rs}^{pq}\]; Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices.; \(h_p^q\) and \(g_{pq}^{rs}\) are the standard one- and two-electron integrals, and; \(\gamma_p^q\) and \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) are the elements of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\),; respectively. Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements \(\gamma_p^q\) and; \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCFT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is s",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/dcft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/dcft-1.html

In addition to five methods listed; above, DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option can be set to CEPA0 (coupled electron; pair approximation zero, equivalent to linearized coupled cluster doubles; method, LCCD). CEPA0 can be considered as a particular case of the DC-06 and DC-12; methods in the limit of zero non-idempotency of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\). This option has a limited; functionality and should only be used for test purposes. For the production-level CEPA0 code, see the; OCC module. The DCFT code can also be used to; compute the \((\lambda_3)\) energy correction that perturbatively accounts; for three-particle correlation effects, similarly to the (T) correction in coupled; cluster theory. Computation of the \((\lambda_3)\) correction can be; requested by setting the THREE_PARTICLE option to PERTURBATIVE. A; combination of the ODC-13 functional with the \((\lambda_3)\) correction; [denoted as \(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)] has been shown to provide highly; accurate results for open-shell molecules near equilibrium geometries.; At the present moment, all of the DCFT methods support unrestricted reference; orbitals (REFERENCE UHF), which can be used to perform energy and; gradient computations for both closed- and open-shell molecules.

Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity.

Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DFMP2. Introduction¶; Second-order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor \({\cal O}(N^5)\) treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic \(ov\) products in the; bra- and ket- of the \((ov|ov)\)-type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference. An efficient,; threaded, disk-based DF-MP2 code is available in PSI4 for all single; reference types available in the SCF module.; MP2 defaults in PSI4 to the density-fitted code.

Energy Efficiency,energy,energy,"les.; To circumvent difficulties with running multiple jobs in the same scratch, the; process ID (PID) of the PSI4 instance is incorporated into the full file; name; therefore, it is safe to use the same scratch directory for calculations; running simultaneously. This also means that if the user wants PSI4 to use; information from a previous file, like molecular orbitals, he needs to provide the; name of the file. This can be done through the restart_file option; 1energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content. Only the filenumber; is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the file for the next PSI4; job, and if none is found it defaults to 32, a checkpoint file. If two or more files; are to be read, they need to be provided as a Python list; 1energy('scf',restart_file=['./file1.filenumber','./file2.filenumber']). Note that the restart_file options is only available for energy procedures as of now.; Executing PSI4 with the psi4 -m (for; messy) flag will prevent files being deleted at the end of the run:; 1psi4 -m. ~/.psi4rc File¶.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/external-1.html

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/external.html

Usability,guid,guide,"manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; 1psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; 1; 2; 3; 4import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) for restart purposes. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). # equivalent to above; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_CHKPT, True). A guide to the contents of individual scratch files may be found at PSIOH Intermediate Files.; To circumvent difficulties with running multiple jobs in the same scratch, the; process ID (PID) of the PSI4 instance is incorporated into the full file; name; therefore, it is safe to use the same scratch directory for calculations; running simultaneously. This also means that if the user wants PSI4 to use; information from a previous file, like molecular orbitals, he needs to provide the; name of the file. This can be done through the restart_file option; 1energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content. Only the filenumber; is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the file for the next PSI4; job, and if none is found it defaults to 32, a checkpoint file. If two or more files; are to be read, they need to be provided as a Python list; 1energy('scf',restart_file=['./file1.filenumber','./file2.filenumber']).",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/external.html

Running gCP¶; At present there is a limited interface to gCP that is used; only to implement the “HF-3c” [Sure:2013:1672] and “PBEh-3c”; [Grimme:2015:054107] methods (both energy and gradient). The DFTD3 executable must also be available for these methods to; run. Unlike every other method in PSI4, if a basis set has not been; set, these will default to their intended basis sets: MINIX for HF-3c; and def2-mSVP for PBEh-3c. If a basis has previously been set, but you; want to use the default basis, use the slash syntax to “empty” the basis; option for the scope of the current calculation, energy(""hf3c/"").; A few practical examples:. HF-3c single point with default minix basis; 1energy('hf3c'). PBEh-3c optimization with default def2-mSVP basis; 1optimize('pbeh3c'). HF-3c with non-standard basis; 1; 2set basis cc-pvdz; energy('hf3c'). PBEh-3c with default basis after basis set; 1; 2set basis cc-pvdz; energy('pbeh3c/').

Input¶; The distributed multipole analysis (DMA) technique, developed by Anthony J.; Stone and implemented by him into the GDMA package, is available in PSI4.; The current implementation simply embeds Stone’s GDMA code into the main; executable, and generates the appropriate input files automatically. The; program takes as input a data file, and a Gaussian formatted checkpoint (see; Section FCHK) file. The simplest usage of the GDMA code is; demonstrated below, along with a listing of the options supported; these; options correspond to the options described in the; GDMA manual.; If more advanced usage is desired, which is not is permitted by the options; listed below, the user may provide their own data file containing keywords to; control the GDMA code. Simply place the data file in the directory PSI4; is called from, and provide the file name as the datafile argument to the; gdma() routine. For example, if GDMA data file is called; control.dma, the GDMA code is called as follows:; 1; 2grad, wfn = gradient('mp2', return_wfn=True); gdma(wfn, datafile='control.dma'). An FCHK file will be generated for the GDMA code to read; this file will have; the prefix given by WRITER_FILE_LABEL (if set), or else by the name;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/gdma.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/gdma.html

If using PSI4 built from source and you want libefp built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_libefp,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code. EFP Fragments¶; LIBEFP comes with a couple dozen ready-to-use fragments (water, benzene,; common solvents, etc.) listed here; with source psi4/psi4/share/psi4/efpfrag. Any of these may be used directly in; a PSI4 input file as described here.; Creating new efp fragments requires the GAMESS quantum chemistry package.; Instructions on building new fragments are here.; Once your new fragment is ready, make it accessible to PSI4 by; including the directory in which the .efp file is located to the colon; separated environment variable PSIPATH. Fragments are searched; for first in the current directory, next in the paths of PSIPATH, and; finally in built-in library. If PSI4 is unable to find the; fragment, an error will be reported. Note; When constructing new fragment files, the name of the name of the; file should be lowercase and have extension .efp. The molecule name; within the file, e.g., $NH3 must correspond to the name of the; fragment file. Molecule Specification¶; EFP fragment geometries are specified alongside the quantum mechanical; (QM) molecule and make use of the -- fragment separation scheme; described here. Each EFP fragment has its own; fragment section that includes the label efp, the name of the file; fragname from which EFP parameters are to be read, and the position; specification for the fragment in one of two ways, XYZABC or POINTS. For; XYZABC, the fragment specification is all",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/libefp.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/libefp.html
Usability,simpl,simply," mass; coordinates in the XYZABC format and all coordinates in the POINTS format are; taken to be in Angstroms by default or in Bohr if units au is present.; Charge and multiplicity specifications are encoded in the fragment file; and so are not read from input.; Any combination of EFP and QM fragments can be placed in a molecule; even; the oddity below is legitimate. Note that symmetry and reorientation are; automatically turned off when EFP fragments are present (symmetry c1; and no_com and no_reorient are implied).; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17molecule qmefp {; efp nh3 0.0 0.0 5.0 5 2 8; --; C 0.0 0.0 0.0; O 0.0 1.5 0.0; O 0.0 -1.5 0.0; --; efp h2o 5.0 0.0 0.0 5 2 8; --; He -3.0 4.0 4.0; He -4.0 5.0 4.0; --; efp ch3oh; 1.275 -2.447 -4.673; 0.709 -3.191 -3.592; 2.213 -1.978 -4.343; }. Running EFP¶; EFP can be invoked in similar fashion as other theories provided in PSI4.; For example, if you want to obtain the EFP interaction energy for benzene and two waters,; simply provide the following:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9molecule {; efp c6h6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; --; efp h2o 4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; --; efp h2o -4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; }. energy('efp'). This computation involves purely EFP/EFP fragment interactions and is; performed entirely by the LIBEFP library. PSI4 can also handle mixed; systems of quantum mechanical (QM) and EFP fragments through the native; SCF code augmented by calls to the LIBEFP library. For; example, turning one of the waters in the example above into a QM; fragment is shown below.; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12molecule {; efp c6h6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; --; O 4.0 0.0 0.0; H 4.7 0.7 0.0; H 3.3 -0.7 0.0; --; efp h2o -4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; }. set basis 6-31g; energy('scf').

If PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an; error will be reported. Running MRCC¶; MRCC can be invoked in similar fashion as other theories provided in PSI4.; For example, if you want to obtain the CCSDT energy for water with cc-pVDZ using; MRCC simply provide the following:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9molecule h2o {; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }; set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }; energy('mrccsdt'). 'mrccsdt' in the call to energy() instructs PSI4 to first; perform an RHF calculation and then call MRCC to compute the CCSDT energy.; For a CCSDT(Q) energy, simply use 'mrccsdt(q)' in the call to; energy(). MRCC can be used to perform geometry optimization and; frequency calculations for electronic ground states only.; At this time, PSI4 is only able to automatically generate the proper; input file for MRCC for the methods listed in table below.; To utilize any method described in the table, you must prefix; the method name with MR. For other methods, you will be required to; use the MRCC keywords described in Appendix MRCC.; Perturbative methods (ccsd(t), ccsdtqp(h)_l, etc.); are available with REFERENCE ROHF in versions of MRCC published; at least after July 1, 2014.; When using ROHF-CCSDT(Q), MRCC will compute and report two variants:; CCSDT(Q)/A and CCSDT(Q)/B.[Kallay:2008:144101]_ Psi4 will save both en",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/mrcc-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/mrcc-1.html

Availability,error,errors,"e found here. In addition,; numerous example of hybrid NumPy and Psi4 can be found at the Psi4Numpy; project. Currently only the Matrix; and Vector objects support NumPy interfacing. Let us begin with a simple; conversion from these objects to a NumPy array:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10>>> import psi4; >>> import numpy as np. # Build the Psi4 data objects; >>> mat = psi4.Matrix(3, 3); >>> vec = psi4.Vector(3). # Convert to a NumPy array; >>> numpy_mat = np.array(mat); >>> numpy_vec = np.array(vec). Here the data is copied into new NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays can be converted; back to PSI4 objects using the from_array interface:; 1; 2>>> new_mat = psi4.Matrix.from_array(mat); >>> new_vec = psi4.Vector.from_array(vec). NumPy Views¶; Copying the data between NumPy and Psi4 objects can lead to excessive data; movement and convoluted code. Here we introduce the idea of “Views” where the; same data can be viewed by multiple objects. However, this can lead to very; subtle errors if used incorrectly and care needs to be taken when using these; views. Views can be created in two ways:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9>>> numpy_mat_view = np.asarray(mat). # Access the NumPy object and set all values to 1 through broadcasting; >>> numpy_mat_view[:] = 1. >>> print(np.array(mat)); [[ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]]. Secondly, these objects have a .np attribute for easy access to the underlying data:; 1>>> mat.np[:] = 1. this operation is identical to the above.

Availability,avail,available,"zed orbitals. Mayer bond indices; MAYER_INDICES;  . Natural orbital occupations; NO_OCCUPATIONS;  . There are two ways the computation of one-electron properties can be requested.; Firstly, the properties can be evaluated from the last; computed one-particle density, using the following syntax:; 1oeprop(""MO_EXTENTS"", ""MULTIPOLE(4)"", title = ""hello!""). Note that it is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the relaxed density; matrix is computed using the method of interest, which may require setting; additional keywords (see the method’s manual section for details). The named; argument, title, is completely optional and is prepended to any; globals variables set during the computation. The unnamed arguments are the; properties to be computed. These can appear in any order, and multiple; properties may be requested, as in the example above. Note that, due to Python; syntax restrictions, the title argument must appear after the list of; properties to compute. The available properties are shown in the table above.; The syntax above works well for computing properties using the SCF; wavefunction, however, may be difficult (or impossible) to use for some of the; correlated levels of theory. Alternatively, one-electron properties can be; computed using the built-in property() function, e.g.:; 1property('ccsd', properties=['dipole']). The property() function provides limited functionality, but is a lot easier to; use for correlated methods. For capabilities of property() see the; corresponding section of the manual. Basic Keywords¶; Multipole moments may be computed at any origin, which is controlled by the; global PROPERTIES_ORIGIN keyword. The keyword takes an array with; the following possible values:.

Note that it is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the relaxed density; matrix is computed using the method of interest, which may require setting; additional keywords (see the method’s manual section for details). The named; argument, title, is completely optional and is prepended to any; globals variables set during the computation. The unnamed arguments are the; properties to be computed. These can appear in any order, and multiple; properties may be requested, as in the example above. Note that, due to Python; syntax restrictions, the title argument must appear after the list of; properties to compute. The available properties are shown in the table above.; The syntax above works well for computing properties using the SCF; wavefunction, however, may be difficult (or impossible) to use for some of the; correlated levels of theory. Alternatively, one-electron properties can be; computed using the built-in property() function, e.g.:; 1property('ccsd', properties=['dipole']). The property() function provides limited functionality, but is a lot easier to; use for correlated methods. For capabilities of property() see the; corresponding section of the manual.

LibOptions: globals, locals, has_changed and all that¶; To simplify parsing of options and handling of defaults, the Options class; was created. It functions in the following way:. Each module (or plugin) declares which options it will look for in the; input: their name, type (string, int, double, array, etc.), and any; default value they take.; The input is parsed for these options, and defaults are assigned for; those keywords not specified by the user.; The c-side module or plugin can then query the Options object for the; values associated with each keyword.; The options will also be accessible py-side to the procedures that drive; the modules. Array-type options are not available in python. Declaring Options¶; Each module needs to make itself known to the Options object, via a; read_options function. For plugins, this routine is provided by the user; in the plugin code. For native PSI4 modules, the entries need to; be appended to the read_options code in psi4/src/bin/psi4/read_options.cc.; An example of such a routine is; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17if (name == ""MYMODULE""|| options.read_globals()) {; /*- The amount of information printed; to the output file -*/; options.add_int(""PRINT"", 1);; /*- Do save information to |mymodule__data_file| at the end of the computation? -*/; options.add_bool(""SAVE_INFO"", true);; /*- An array containing the number of doubly occupied orbitals per irrep; (in :ref:`Cotton order <table:irrepOrdering>`) -*/; options.add(""DOCC"", new ArrayType());; /*- The factor by which the harmonic vibrational frequencies are multiplied to; obtain an approximation to the fundamental vibrational frequencies -*/; options.add_double(""FREQUENCY_SCALE_FACTOR"", 1.0);; /*- The filename to which data is dumped. !expert -*/; options.add_str(""DATA_FILE"", ""data.dat"");; /",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/optionshandling-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/optionshandling-1.html

Same for FREEZE_CORE. Setting-Up Calculations; The other types of options calls in python driver functions are (a); those to query what option value an upcoming c++ module is going to use; (determined by user and defaults) and (b) those to set options to govern; the course of a procedure. Finding out the intended option value for a; molecule should employ the get_option() command; (and has_option_changed() for has_changed), which; (newly) requires a module for scope. (Previously, this command used the; “active module”, which isn’t well-defined in the context of the python; driver, and consequently, the command gave variable results, depending; on whether a get_local/set_local command had been previously executed to; define the active module.); 1; 2if (psi4.get_option('SCF', 'REFERENCE') == 'RHF'):; psi4.set_local_option('SCF', 'REFERENCE', 'RKS'). Setting of options in python should use the; set_local_option() command. Using the local, rather; than global, scope will ensure that the newly set option will be used by; the module. Otherwise, if the python procedure set in the global scope; and the user had happened to set that option in local scope, the local; user option will take precedence against the programmer’s intent.; (Anyone who has heard advice to “query local, set global” should forget; that and follow the new scheme outlined here.). table of contents.

The optking program takes as input nuclear gradients and,; optionally, nuclear second derivatives — both in Cartesian coordinates.; The default minimization algorithm employs an empirical model Hessian,; redundant internal coordinates, an RFO step, and the BFGS Hessian update.; The principal literature references include the introduction of redundant; internal coordinates by Peng et al. [Peng:1996:49].; The general approach employed in this code; is similar to the “model Hessian plus RF method” described and tested by Bakken and; Helgaker [Bakken:2002:9160]. (However, for separated; fragments, we have chosen not to employ by default their “extra-redundant”; coordinates defined by their “auxiliary interfragment” bonds.

The library allows for calculations in solution with the; polarizable continuum model (PCM), a continuum solvation model [Tomasi:2005:2999]. Installation¶; Binary. PCMSolver is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell). If using the PSI4 binary, PCMSolver has already been installed alongside. If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; PCMSolver can be obtained through conda install pcmsolver -c psi4.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_PCMSolver,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect PCMSolver and activate dependent code.

Modular Approach to Development¶; It is slightly cumbersome to the development cycle to recompile PSI4; every time a change is made to the C++ code.; It’s also daunting to new developers if they’re required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with Psi3 due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, PSI4 now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi’s vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. Creating a New Plugin¶; PSI4 can create basic plugins for you and automatically tailor them; to your compilation environment. To create a basic plugin, run the; following while replacing myplugin with the name of your great code.; If the name you provide is not valid, PSI4 will complain.; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin. PSI4 will create a new directory with the name you specify for the; plugin. In this example, a directory named myplugin will be created.; All you need to do is cd into the directory, use PSI4 to generate; a Makefile, and type make. Then execute psi4 in the directory on the; default input file.; 1; 2; 3; 4>>> cd myplugin; >>> `psi4 --plugin-compile`; >>> make; >>> psi4. PSI4 comes with a few templates that provide an excellent starting; point. These include code that demonstrates AO, MO, and SO integrals.

Security,access,accessed,"ctory to recompile the; myplugin.so executable, but recompiling the main PSI4 code; is not necessary. Should you add additional (non-header) files to; the plugin or need to link to additional external libraries, add that; information here.; input.dat — Sample input file for the plugin.; Since the __init__.py file makes the plugin directory look like a; Python module, the plugin can be treated as such in an input file. The; location of the plugin directory must be included in PYTHONPATH,; either externally in the calling shell or defined in the input file.; This is usually done by manipulating PSIPATH. Then,; the plugin can be loaded as import myplugin and executed as; energy('myplugin'). Any other Python functions are also available from; the input file, e.g. myplugin.testfunction(), note the namespace; protection.; pymodule.py — Python component of the plugin.; By encoding the sequence of PSI4 module; calls needed to run the plugin in the run_myplugin() function in this; file, the plugin is hooked into the main PSI4 driver function; energy() and so can be accessed through; energy('myplugin') in an input file. Any other Python functions can; also be placed in this file.; __init__.py — Init script for the plugin (in the sense that; the whole plugin directory is a Python module). This file generally won’t; need editing unless additional Python files are added to the plugin; directory (add additional lines to the # Load Python modules section); or the plugin depends on .so codes in other plugin directories (add; additional plugin_load lines relative to the current plugin directory to; the # Load C++ plugin section). doc.rst — Documentation file. Place in this file any notes,; equations, warnings to users, todo lists, etc.. Plain text is fine,; though reStructuredText is the ultimate goal.

Psi4 is now able to be controlled directly from Python.

[2]:. psi4.core.set_output_file('output.dat', False). Additionally, output may be suppressed by instead setting psi4.core.be_quiet() API. II. Running a Basic Hartree-Fock Calculation¶; In our first example, we will consider a Hartree-Fock SCF computation for the water molecule using a cc-pVDZ basis set. First, we will set the available memory for Psi4 to use with the psi4.set_memory() API function, which takes either a string like '30 GB' (with units!) or an integer number of bytes of memory as its argument. Next, our molecular geometry is passed as a string into; psi4.geometry() API. We may input this geometry in either Z-matrix or Cartesian format; to allow the string to break over multiple lines, use Python’s triple-quote """"""string"""""" syntax. Finally, we will compute the Hartree-Fock SCF energy with the cc-pVDZ basis set by passing the method/basis set as a string ('scf/cc-pvdz') into the function psi4.energy(); API:. [3]:. #!

PsiAPI Tutorial: Using Psi4 as a Python Module¶; transcribed by D. A. Sirianni. Note: Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with Psi4. In Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode. Warning: Although the developers have been using PsiAPI mode stably for months before the 1.1 release and while we believe we’ve gotten everything nicely arranged within the psi4. namespace, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Unlike in the past, where Psi4 was executable software which could only be called via input files like input.dat, it is now interactive, able to be loaded directly as a Python module.

Since we’re still in the Python shell, as long as you executed that block of code, we can reuse the h2o molecule object in our optimization without redefining it, by adding the molecule=h2o argument to the psi4.optimize(); API function:.

Note: Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with Psi4. In Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode. Warning: Although the developers have been using PsiAPI mode stably for months before the 1.1 release and while we believe we’ve gotten everything nicely arranged within the psi4. namespace, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Unlike in the past, where Psi4 was executable software which could only be called via input files like input.dat, it is now interactive, able to be loaded directly as a Python module.

Please note that memory can be specified both in IEC binary units (1 KiB = 1024 bytes) and SI units (1 kB = 1000 bytes). PSI4 recognizes and obeys both of them correctly. The units are not case sensitive (Kb and KB are equivalent to kB).; By default, PSI4 performs a “sanity check” when parsing Psithon input files, enforcing a minimum memory requirement of 250 MiB. While it is generally not recomennded to do so, expert users can bypass this check by directly setting the number of bytes availble to PSI4:; 1; 2# setting available memory to 2 MB; set_memory_bytes(2000000). Please note that this memory setting only governs the maximal memory; usage of the major data structures, and actual total memory usage; is slightly higher. This is usually a negligible amount, except when; setting tiny memory allowances.; One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. ~/.psi4rc File). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 GB.; 1set_memory(2000000000).

The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; 1SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; 1SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/psithonmol-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/psithonmol-1.html

See dfmp2_1; and ghosts for a demonstration of both mechanisms for specifying; ghost atoms. Isotopic Substitution¶. Caution; Use of isotopic substitution in PSI4 is not well; developed, and the syntax is subject to change. At present, isotopes can only be specified at creation-time of the molecule; The syntax for a deuterium- and tritium-substituted water is below.

Availability,reliab,reliable,"on, we can specify; 1SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; 1SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; 1SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; 1SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; 1SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; 1SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/psithonmol.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/psithonmol.html

For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. extract_subsets(2,[1,3]):; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'). clean(). mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf'). If the molecule contains fragments but is not conveniently ordered for the; -- marker, the auto_fragments() function can be applied, as shown in; pywrap-basis, to return as active molecule the previous; active molecule, only fragmented. Advanced Python¶; A named molecule in an input file is a full-fledged instance of the; powerful C++ Molecule class.

Usability,simpl,simply,"the PSI program is necessary for changes made to; files in $PSIDATADIR, including those described below. A necessary consideration in constructing a database is the distinction; between reagents and reactions. A reagent is a single molecular system; (may be a dimer) whose geometry you are possession of and whose electronic; energy may be of interest. A reaction is a combination of one or more; reagent energies whose value you are interested in and a reference value; for which you may or may not be in possession of. A few examples follow.; In a database of interaction energies, the reagents are dimers and their; component monomers (usually derived from the dimer geometry), and the; reactions are the dimer less monomers energies. In a database of barrier; heights, the reagents are reactants, products, and transition-state; structures, and the reactions are the transition-states less; minimum-energy structures. Possibly you may have a collection of; structures to simply be acted upon in parallel, in which case the; structures are both the reagents and the reactions. The role of the; database.py file is to collect arrays and dictionaries that define the; geometries of reagents (GEOS), their combination into reactions (RXNM &; ACTV), available reference values for reactions (BIND), and brief comments; for reagents and reactions (TAGL). The journey from reagent geometries to; functional database.py file is largely automated, in a process described; below. Prepare geometry files; Assemble xyz files for all intended reagent systems in a directory.; Follow the rules below for best results. The filename for each xyz; file should be the name of the system. lowercase or MixedCase is; preferable (according to Sherrill lab convention). Avoid dashes and; dots in the name as python won’t allow them. If you’re determined to; have dashes and dots, they must be replaced by other characters in the; process_input line, then translated back in the GEOS section; see; NBC10.py for an examp",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/quickadddatabase.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/quickadddatabase.html

The matrix \(C_{\mu i}\) contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree–Fock. The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. \[\begin{split}| \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |\end{split}\]; This form for the Hartree–Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; \(\mathbb{R}^6\) instead of a more complicated effect in; \(\mathbb{R}^N\).; Considering the electronic Hamiltonian,. \[\hat H = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/scf-1.html
Modifiability,enhance,enhanced,"hf; set guess_mix true; energy('scf'). Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated.

Modifiability,enhance,enhanced,"hf; set guess_mix true; energy('scf'). Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/scf.html

The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. \[\begin{split}| \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |\end{split}\]; This form for the Hartree–Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; \(\mathbb{R}^6\) instead of a more complicated effect in; \(\mathbb{R}^N\).; Considering the electronic Hamiltonian,. \[\hat H = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \sum_{i} \sum_{A} -; \frac{Z_A}{r_{iA}} + \sum_{i>j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}},\]; the Hartree–Fock energy is, by Slater’s rules,. \[E_{\mathrm{HF}} =; \langle \Psi_0 | \hat H | \Psi_0 \rangle; = \sum_{i} \langle i | \hat h | i \rangle; + \frac 1 2 \sum_{i,j} [ii|jj] - [ij",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/scf.html

In; Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language; (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then; submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into; pure Python and runs it internally.

Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor.

Testability,test,test,"----------------------------------------------------------- ~. To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it’s important to keep in mind that; the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular; geometry. Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies; at the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We could set up a second input file to perform; the vibrational frequency analysis, being very careful to copy over the; optimized geometry from the bottom of the output file for the geometry; optimization. This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #!

The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements.

Psithon Tutorial: Using PSI4 as an Executable¶. Note; Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with PSI4. In; Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language; (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then; submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into; pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure; Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind; the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any “.in” or “.dat” extension by “.out”).

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it’s important to keep in mind that; the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular; geometry. Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies; at the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We could set up a second input file to perform; the vibrational frequency analysis, being very careful to copy over the; optimized geometry from the bottom of the output file for the geometry; optimization. This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #!

Deployability,configurat,configurations," the effective secular equation is solved for; several times for the specific state due to the eigenvalue dependence of; the effective response matrix. Only the S component of the transition; amplitude is obtained explicitly and the squared norm of the S block; and the rotation angle from the corresponding CIS vector are given; below the element of the amplitude. The difference between the ADC(2); value and its non-iterative counterpart is mostly negligible if the; mixture among the CIS excited states is small and the quasi-degeneracy; in the excited state is tolerably weak. But if there is a significant; discrepancy in these energies, or the rotation angle is visibly large,; special care may have to be taken for the strong effects caused by the; higher excited states.; Partial Renormalization Scheme; The built-in ADC code is capable of performing the partially-renormalized; ADC(2) computation, termed PR-ADC(2). In the perturbative treatment of; the singly-excited state, the doubly and triply excited configurations; are accounted for as in the case of CIS(D). In the language of; CIS(D), the former is regarded to introduce the orbital relaxation (OR); effect while the latter is argued to give rise to the differential; correlation (DC) correction to the excited state. In the PR-ADC(2); scheme, the DC term is corrected according to the ground state; PR-MP2 correlation, in which the correlation between the electron pairs; is accounted for in size-consistent and unitary-invariant fashion by; modulating the MP1 amplitude. By utilizing the PR scheme, substantial; resistance against quasi-degeneracy is readily granted as discussed; in Ref.

In these cases, you’ll want to add to the second test; suite that lives at psi4/tests/pytests. Presently, the “normal”; (everything in the tests/ directory that isn’t in tests/pytests/); are run through ctest, while the pytests are run through pytest. In; future, all will be run through Pytest, but the former will still be; run as PSIthon (psi4 input.dat) while the latter will still be; run as PsiAPI (import psi4). In other words, in designing a test,; choose its mode based on whether PSIthon or PsiAPI suits it better and; whether it’s a simple model for users (probably PSIthon) or for expert; users (probably PsiAPI). Both will continue to work in future.; In developing a Pytest test, you probably want to edit it in place,; rather than running make after each change. Easiest is from; <objdir>, run pytest ../tests/pytests. Add any filters (-k; test_name_fragment) or parallelism (-n <N> if pytest-xdist; installed) or print test names (-v) or print warnings (-rws). To; see stdout output from an otherwise passing test, easiest to add assert; 0 at its end to trigger failure. An important point is that because; they’re PsiAPI, import psi4 is happening, so the <objdir> PSI4; module must be in PYTHONPATH.

If there are no orbitals of a particular symmetry type a zero must be entered. For more information and an example see CFOUR_OCCUPATION . Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_ANH_ALGORITHM (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies which algorithm is used for CFOUR_ANHARMONIC =VIBROT, VPT2, and FULLQUARTIC calculations. If STANDARD (=0) is chosen, then simply invoking xcfour will cause a complete job to be run with all second-derivative calculations being done in series. If PARALLEL (=1), then the job stops after the second-derivative calculation at the reference geometry and generates out all input geometries for the remaining calculation.

Built-In Basis Sets; Specifying basis sets; Built-in basis sets by family; Built-in basis sets by element; User-Defined basis sets; Auxiliary bases for built-in orbital basis sets. Built-In Basis Sets¶; A wide range of orbital basis sets are built into PSI4. These are; summarized in Tables Pople,; Dunning,; Dunning (Douglas-Kroll),; Karlsruhe,; Jensen,; and Other in Appendix Basis Sets by Family.; These tables are arranged so that columns indicate degree of; augmentation by diffuse functions (generally necessary for anions, excited; states, and noncovalent interactions) and DTQ56 indicate the \(X\;=\zeta\) levels; available. Several intermediate levels of diffuse space between the customary; non-augmented and augmented versions have been supplied for each basis set,; including heavy-augmented and Truhlar’s [Papajak:2011:10] calendar; truncations described in Table Months Bases. Fitting bases; in Tables JKFIT,; RI, and DUAL; are available for methods incorporating density-fitting or dual-basis; approximations. JKFIT sets are appropriate for fitting \((oo|\)-type products,; such as encountered in SCF theory and the electrostatics/exchange terms of SAPT.; RI sets are appropriate for fitting \((ov|\)-type products, such as encountered in; MP2 and most SAPT terms.

Inputting effective core potentials (ECPs)¶; For ECP containing basis sets, all of the above mechanisms may still be used to; input the basis set; simply place the ECP definitions (in G94 format) in the; same file or input section as the orbital basis definition. Because the ECP; appears in the same section as the orbital basis, it will be parsed; automatically and the number of core electrons the ECP represents will be; detected, so no further input is required to use a core potential.

Copy the section into a PSI4 input file and surround it with the; command basis {...}, as shown below. Multiple basis sets can be; specified by adding additional sections within the surrounding brackets.; Use assign statements to actually request the basis set. This; basis {...} section replaces the usual set basis XXX line.; In a more complex input, if the user needs to call the user-defined; basis by name, this can be achieved using the syntax basis mybas {...},; and then the basis can be recalled later as set basis mybas.; To use a custom basis set as described in this section, it must be; defined prior to its use in a function that performs a computation.; basis {. # assign basset to all atoms and addl to hydrogens; assign basset; assign H addl. # basis set section like in snippet above goes here; [basset]; ... # additional basis set sections follow; [addl]; ...; }. The test case mints2 provides a complete example of; user-specified basis sets. Inputting effective core potentials (ECPs)¶; For ECP containing basis sets, all of the above mechanisms may still be used to; input the basis set; simply place the ECP definitions (in G94 format) in the; same file or input section as the orbital basis definition. Because the ECP; appears in the same section as the orbital basis, it will be parsed; automatically and the number of core electrons the ECP represents will be; detected, so no further input is required to use a core potential.

For; example,; set df_basis_mp2 cc-pvdz-ri. or. df_basis_mp2 {; assign cc-pVDZ-RI; }. are both equivalent ways to set the auxiliary basis set for density fitted MP2; computations. To assign the aug-cc-pVDZ-RI to carbon atoms, the following; command is used:; df_basis_mp2 {; assign C aug-cc-pVDZ-RI; }. Decontracted Basis Sets¶; Decontraction of the basis set can be useful in certain situations. In; order to decontract a given basis set, simply add “-decon” to the name; of the primary basis set (e.g. decontract).; set basis cc-pvdz-decon. Obviously this will add significantly to the computational cost of any given calculation, however it can; be useful when checking the basis set dependence of a particular calculated property or in certain situations; where a large basis set is critical. Currently it is recommended that a decontracted basis is always used when performing relativistic calculations using the X2C Hamiltonian. User-Defined Basis Sets¶. Note; No recompile of the PSI program is necessary for changes made to; files in $PSIDATADIR, including those described below. There are three routes by which a basis set in G94 format can be introduced to PSI4‘s notice.; (1) Install new basis set file into PSI4 basis library.; Copy the basis set definitions for all elements into a blank file.

Configure project and generate makefiles with CMake.; You will require Eigen (tested with version 3.1.2); and boost (tested with version 1.62). cmake .. Build the examples and samples. make. Test the installation by starting a small calculation.; Make sure to set the BRIANQC_INSTALL_PATH environment variable to <brianqc_install_path>!. export BRIANQC_INSTALL_PATH=<brianqc_install_path>; bin/sample_hf_and_dft --molecule ../share/qc_molecules/cis-decalin.raw --basis ../share/basis_sets/cc-pvdz. Building PSI4 with BrianQC¶; When CMake-ing PSI4, set the ENABLE_BrianQC CMake variable to 1; and set the BrianQC_DIR CMake variable to the path where BrianQC’s; components have been built (usually <brianqc_install_path>/build), then build PSI4 normally. Using BrianQC from PSI4¶; To use BrianQC, the BRIANQC_INSTALL_PATH environment variable; must be set to the full path of your BrianQC installation.; There are two ways to enable BrianQC for a specific calculation:. setting the BRIANQC_ENABLE input option to True;; setting the BRIANQC_ENABLE environment variable to 1.

Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.9. Build with full Python specification to root directory ${PFXC}. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=""${PFXC}/bin/python"" \; -DPython_LIBRARY=""${PFXC}/lib/libpython3.9.so"" \; -DPython_INCLUDE_DIR=""${PFXC}/include/python3.9"".

Usability,simpl,simple,"ecial options for lower method in a given stage. This is useful to calculate a direct stage in an otherwise density-fitted calculation, or similar.; `treatment`: treat extrapolation stage as `scf` or `corl`, by default only the first stage is `scf` and every later one is `corl`.; `stage`: tag for the stage used in tables. The next items in the `cbs_metadata` array extrapolate correlation. All of the above parameters are available, with only the `wfn` and `basis` keywords required. Other supported parameters are:. `wfn_lo`: the lower method from which the delta correction is to be calculated. By default, it is set to `wfn` from the previous field in the `cbs_metadata` array.; `basis_lo`: basis set to be used for the delta correction. By default, it is the same as the `basis` specified above. Others. Parameters; molecule (molecule) – h2o || etc.; The target molecule, if not the last molecule defined.

Basic Keywords¶; A complete list of keywords related to coupled-cluster computations is; provided in the appendices, with the majority of the relevant; keywords appearing in Appendix CCENERGY. For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantities with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., \(\langle ij | ab \rangle\) integrals) may be held in the cache. Type: integer; Default: 2.

For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantities with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., \(\langle ij | ab \rangle\) integrals) may be held in the cache. Type: integer; Default: 2. CACHETYPE¶. Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/cc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/cc.html

Here, the contents of the cfour {...} block are written directly to a; ZMAT file. This is joined by a default GENBAS file; (psi4/psi4/share/psi4/basis/GENBAS). To preferentially use your own GENBAS,; place it in PATH or PSIPATH. The line calling; energy() with argument 'cfour' invokes; xcfour.; After execution of the energy('cfour') line completes, Cfour results; are read back into PSI4 format and are thereafter accessible for; further processing in the input file.

Cube files store the value of a scalar; quantity on a regular Cartesian grid, and can be visualized with several; visualization programs, some of which are free, like VMD; (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).; An example utilization of the code is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set scf_type df; set freeze_core True; set cubeprop_tasks ['orbitals']; set cubeprop_orbitals [5,6,-5,-6]. E, wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True); cubeprop(wfn). In this example, the cubeprop(); call after the energy('scf') command; executes the cubeprop code. The array CUBEPROP_TASKS specifies which; tasks should be executed. In this case the task 'orbitals' generates cube; files for orbitals. The CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option specifies that cube files; should be generated only for alpha orbital",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/cubeprop.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/cubeprop.html

Orbital Visualization with VMD¶; Included in PSI4 is functionality to automatically render specified surfaces, including molecular orbitals,; densities, and basis functions, using VMD. The vmd_cube.py script takes the .cube files generated; in a calculation and generates images aligned with user-input specifications. The script is located; in psi4/psi4/share/psi4/scripts/vmd_cube.py. Script Prerequisites¶. VMD must be installed, and it can be downloaded for free at (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Additionally,; the script needs to know where to find the VMD executable, and this is defined as VMDPATH. VMDPATH must be defined as; an environment variable.; To generate images with multiple surfaces, ImageMagick must also be installed. ImageMagick is a free program which; can be installed using homebrew/pip or from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php .; With ImageMagick installed, an environment variable called MONTAGE needs to be created which points to the montage executable.; This executable can be found in the /bin/ sub-directory wherever ImageMagick was installed. VMDPATH¶; Filesystem path to the VMD executable. MONTAGE¶; Filesystem path to the Montage executable of ImageMagick. Running the Script¶. Run a PSI4 calculation, generating .cube files as detailed in the above documentation.; Add vmd_cube.py to your path. Call vmd_cube.py and pass the directory containing; the .cube files as an argument:; python vmd_cube.py /path/to/cube/files/. By default the script will search for cube files in the directory in which it is called.; In addition to individual image files for each orbital, vmd_cub",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/cubeprop.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/cubeprop.html

The first number (5) is the index of the; orbital while 1-B1 indicates that this is the first orbital that belongs to the B1 irrep.; The file Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube begins with two comment lines:; Psi4 Gaussian Cube File.; Property: Psi_a_5_1-B1. Isocontour range for 85% of the density: (0.0787495,-0.0787495). The second line reports the isocontour values that capture 85% of the probability density using; the least amount of grid points. This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option CUBEPROP_ISOCONTOUR_THRESHOLD. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals). DENSITYThis task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\r",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/cubeprop.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/cubeprop.html

BASIS_FUNCTIONSThis task is useful to produce cube files of the atomic orbital basis; functions \(\chi_\mu(\mathbf{r})\). ESPCalculates the total (nuclear + electronic) electrostatic potential; \(V(\mathbf{r})\). DUAL_DESCRIPTORCalculates the dual descriptor from frontier orbitals:; \(f^2(\mathbf{r})=\rho_{\mathrm{LUMO}}(\mathbf{r})-\rho_{\mathrm{HOMO}}(\mathbf{r})\).; The dual descriptor is a good measure of nucleophilicity and electrophilicity,; containing information essentially equivalent to both Fukui functions combined.; More details on the dual descriptor itself can be found in [Morell:2005:205],; while the current implementation is described in [Martinez-Araya:2015:451].; This feature is currently only supported for closed shell systems. Note; The ESP task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis; via the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword. Warning; It is important to specify the CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option when; dealing with large molecules to avoid running out of disk space.; For example, using the default grid spacing of; 0.2 Ångström, the size of a single cube file for a molecule like water; is of the order of 1.4 MB. For a molecule with 200 basis functions, the cube; files for all the orbitals occupy more than half a GB. Keywords¶. CUBEPROP_TASKS¶. Properties to compute.

One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\).; In order to obtain the DCT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:. The energy must be stationary with respect to a set of orbitals. This can be done by; diagonalizing the generalized Fock operator (as in the DC-06 and DC-12 methods, see below),; which introduces partial orbital relaxation, or by fully relaxing the orbitals and minimizing the entire energy expression; (as in the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods).; The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density; cumulant \(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\), constrained to N-representability conditions. Making the energy stationary requires solution of two sets of coupled; equations for orbitals and density cumulant, respectively (also known as; residual equations). At the present moment, three different algorithms for the; solution of the system of coupled equations are available (see; Iterative Algorithms for details).; Publications resulting from the use of the DCT code should cite contributions; listed here. Methods¶; Currently five DCT methods (functionals) are available: DC-06, DC-12, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13. The first four; methods use approximate N-representability conditions derived from; second-order perturbation theory and differ in the description of the; correlated (non-idempotent) part \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\) of the one-particle density; matrix and orbital optimization. While in the DC-06 and ODC-06 methods \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\) is derived from the density cumulant; in an approximate way (labelled by ‘06’), the DC-12 and ODC-12 methods derive this contribution exactly, and; take full advantage of the N-representability conditions (which is denoted by ‘12’).

DCT: Density Cumulant Theory¶; Code author: Alexander Yu. Sokolov, Andrew C. Simmonett, and Xiao Wang; Section author: Alexander Yu. Sokolov; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DCT. Theory¶; Density cumulant theory (DCT) is a density-based ab initio theory; that can compute electronic energies without the use of a wavefunction. The; theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and; two-particle density matrices (\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)):. \[E = h_p^q \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{2} g_{pq}^{rs} \gamma_{rs}^{pq}\]; Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices.; \(h_p^q\) and \(g_{pq}^{rs}\) are the standard one- and two-electron integrals, and; \(\gamma_p^q\) and \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) are the elements of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\),; respectively. Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements \(\gamma_p^q\) and; \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is separated i",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dct-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dct-1.html

For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are particularly inefficient for CISD and may result in the program; running out of memory and crashing for CISD except on very small molecules.; Instead, DETCI was designed to be efficient; in handling more highly correlated CI wavefunctions that can be helpful in more; challenging cases such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions. The CI; code is based on the fast, determinant-based string formalism; of Handy [Handy:1980]. It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI’s. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than \(n\) holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than \(m\) electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III).

Safety,avoid,avoided,"minants; selected for the CI computation. However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)), the program; will typically return singlets and not triplets. However, if enough roots are sought,; higher-multiplicities may enter in. This can be avoided by ensuring that all the guess; vectors have the correct spin multiplicity, by setting CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE).; It is also possible to ask DETCI to compute roots of higher multiplicities. The desired value of spin may be; provided by setting S = \(S\). Typically, it would be a good idea in this context to also set; CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE to ensure the guess roots have the right spin. However, be advised that; seeking these higher roots may cause convergence problems, because roundoff may allow the lower-lying; roots of lower multiplicities to re-enter the computation (reducing convergence criteria may help).; For open-shell systems, the MS0 keyword is typically not relevant, and there; is no control over spin multiplicities of higher roots unless|detci__calc_s_squared| is; used.

For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are particularly inefficient for CISD and may result in the program; running out of memory and crashing for CISD except on very small molecules.; Instead, DETCI was designed to be efficient; in handling more highly correlated CI wavefunctions that can be helpful in more; challenging cases such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions. The CI; code is based on the fast, determinant-based string formalism; of Handy [Handy:1980]. It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI’s. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than \(n\) holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than \(m\) electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/detci.html
Safety,avoid,avoided,"minants; selected for the CI computation. However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)), the program; will typically return singlets and not triplets. However, if enough roots are sought,; higher-multiplicities may enter in. This can be avoided by ensuring that all the guess; vectors have the correct spin multiplicity, by setting CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE).; It is also possible to ask DETCI to compute roots of higher multiplicities. The desired value of spin may be; provided by setting S = \(S\). Typically, it would be a good idea in this context to also set; CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE to ensure the guess roots have the right spin. However, be advised that; seeking these higher roots may cause convergence problems, because roundoff may allow the lower-lying; roots of lower multiplicities to re-enter the computation (reducing convergence criteria may help).; For open-shell systems, the MS0 keyword is typically not relevant, and there; is no control over spin multiplicities of higher roots unless|detci__calc_s_squared| is; used.

Testability,test,testing,"rsion of this feature is not yet released. However,; the current version of the code does include an interface to; Kallay’s MRCC code.; The DETCI module is also capable of computing arbitrary-order; coupled-cluster energies, using an approach similar to that of Hirata; and Bartlett [Hirata:2000:216], or of Olsen [Olsen:2000:7140].; Notably, the approach in DETCI also allows arbitrary-order; active space coupled-cluster procedures. The general algorithm; for doing this in DETCI is inefficient compared to optimized; lower-order coupled-cluster codes and should not be used for CCSD,; where the CCENERGY module is much more efficient. For higher-order; CC (like CCSDT and beyond), the code is also not as efficient as the; MRCC code by Kállay, to which PSI4 can interface (see Section; Interface to MRCC by M. Kállay); however, it may allow certain truncations of the model; space that might not be available presently in MRCC. For very small; systems, the code can be useful for testing of, for example, CCSDTQ or; its active-space CCSDtq analog [Piecuch:1999:6103].; To perform arbitrary-order coupled-cluster, set the DETCI; option CC to TRUE, and set; CC_EX_LEVEL (note: not EX_LEVEL); to the desired coupled-cluster excitation level, and invoke; energy('detci'). Various other DETCI options have a similar; option for coupled-cluster, usually named beginning with CC. The full; list of options is given in Appendix DETCI. table of contents.

Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DFMP2. Introduction¶; Second-order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor \({\cal O}(N^5)\) treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic \(ov\) products in the; bra- and ket- of the \((ov|ov)\)-type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference. An efficient,; threaded, disk-based DF-MP2 code is available in PSI4 for all single; reference types available in the SCF module.; MP2 defaults in PSI4 to the density-fitted code.

The; evaluation of these numerical integrals can be made to be linear scaling with a; reasonable amount of cleverness (mostly related to the fact that the basis; functions decay exponentially), meaning that the Coulomb and diagonalization; steps become rate limiting. This enormous potential speed gain over Hartree–Fock; with potentially exact treatment of electron correlation for “free” was one of; the primary motivations for KS-DFT’s adoption by chemists in the late 1980s and; early 1990s.; Unfortunately, local KS-DFT exhibits several spectacular failures, most of which; stem from the exponential decay of the local Kohn–Sham potential, which cannot; encapsulate long-range information in the exchange and correlation holes.

This guarantees the asymptotics of; the exchange potential,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{tuned-LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r} + I_{\mathrm{IP}} +; \epsilon_{\mathrm{HOMO}}\]; Note that LRC functionals with default \(\omega\) only capture the; \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r},\]; hybrid functionals only capture part of the \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Hybrid}} (r) = -; \frac{\alpha}{r}",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html

The residual kinetic energy term is usually quite; small, and is often ignored, hence \(E_{\mathrm{xc}}\) is often referred to; as simply the exchange-correlation functional (exchange and correlation, not; just exchange-type correlation).; In practice, the first few generations of KS-DFT functionals were chosen to be; local, meaning that the form of the exchange correlation energy is an integral; over all of space of a function depending only on local information in the; density, such as the density value or derivatives. The simplest variants are; Local Spin-Density Approximations (LSDA), which depend only on the spin density; \(\rho_\alpha\) or \(\rho_\beta\),. \[\rho_\sigma (\vec r_1) = D_{\mu\nu}^{\sigma} \phi_{\mu} (\vec r_1); \phi_\nu (\vec r_1)\]; The most popular variants are Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA); functionals which use the norm of the density gradient; \(\gamma_{\alpha\alpha}\), \(\gamma_{\alpha\beta}\) or; \(\gamma_{\beta\beta}\) to build an inhomogeneity; parameter. \[\gamma_{\alpha\alpha} (\vec r_1) = \nabla \rho_{\alpha} (\vec r_1) \cdot \nabla; \rho_{\alpha} (\vec r_1)\]",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/dft.html

CMake Variables. ENABLE_dkh — CMake variable toggling whether Psi4 builds with dkh; CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For dkh, set to an installation directory containing include/DKH/DKH_MANGLE.h; dkh_DIR — CMake variable to specify where pre-built dkh can be found. Set to installation directory containing share/cmake/dkh/dkhConfig.cmake; CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_dkh — CMake variable to force internal build of dkh instead of detecting pre-built; CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_dkh — CMake variable to force detecting pre-built dkh and not falling back on internal build.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external-1.html

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/external.html

Installation¶; Binary. gau2grid is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).; If using the PSI4 binary, gau2grid has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; gau2grid can be obtained through conda install gau2grid -c psi4.; Then, hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect gau2grid and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove gau2grid. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want gau2grid built from; from source also, let the build system fetch and build it and activate; dependent code. How to configure gau2gridfor building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, gau2grid is a library that provides essential; grid operations for DFT.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) gau2grid; Upstream Dependencies — gau2grid \(\Leftarrow\) None. CMake Variables. CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For gau2grid, set to an installation directory containing include/gau2grid/gau2grid.h; gau2grid_DIR — CMake variable to specify where pre-built gau2grid can be found. Set to installation directory containing share/cmake/gau2grid/gau2gridConfig.cmake; CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_gau2grid — CMake variable to force internal build of gau2grid instead of detecting pre-built; CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_gau2grid — ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/gau2grid.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/gau2grid.html

Simply place the data file in the directory PSI4; is called from, and provide the file name as the datafile argument to the; gdma() routine. For example, if GDMA data file is called; control.dma, the GDMA code is called as follows:; grad, wfn = gradient('mp2', return_wfn=True); gdma(wfn, datafile='control.dma'). An FCHK file will be generated for the GDMA code to read; this file will have; the prefix given by WRITER_FILE_LABEL (if set), or else by the name; of the output file plus the name of the current molecule, and the suffix will; be ‘.fchk’. This FCHK file name should be passed to the ‘File’ keyword in the; DGMA data file, to ensure that the GDMA code reads the correct wavefunction; information.; After running, two matrices of results can be accessed:; dma_results = get_array_variable('DMA DISTRIBUTED MULTIPOLES'); tot_results = get_array_variable('DMA TOTAL MULTIPOLES'). The first contains distributed multipoles, in units given by; GDMA_MULTIPOLE_UNITS, with the row index corresponding to the site and; the column index referencing the multipole component. Both indices are zero; based, and the \(Q^l_m\) components of the multipoles are ordered as; \(Q^0_0, Q^1_0, Q^1_{1c}, Q^1_{1s}, Q^2_0, Q^2_{1c}, Q^2_{1s}, Q^2_{2c},; Q^2_{2s}, \ldots\) The second matrix returned has a single row, whose columns; are the total multipoles, translated to GDMA_ORIGIN, and summed. psi4.gdma(wfn)[source]; Function to use wavefunction information in wfn and, if specified,; additional commands in filename to run GDMA analysis.

Usability,simpl,simply,"¶; Binary. GDMA is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).; If using the PSI4 binary, gdma has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; gdma can be obtained through conda install gdma -c psi4.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_gdma,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect gdma and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove gdma. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want gdma built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_gdma,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code. Input¶; The distributed multipole analysis (DMA) technique, developed by Anthony J.; Stone and implemented by him into the GDMA package, is available in PSI4.; The current implementation simply embeds Stone’s GDMA code into the main; executable, and generates the appropriate input files automatically. The; program takes as input a data file, and a Gaussian formatted checkpoint (see; Section FCHK) file. The simplest usage of the GDMA code is; demonstrated below, along with a listing of the options supported; these; options correspond to the options described in the; GDMA manual.; If more advanced usage is desired, which is not is permitted by the options; listed below, the user may provide their own data file containing keywords to; control the GDMA code.

Overview¶; PSI4 provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods using; state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms. Several parts of; the code feature shared-memory parallelization to run efficiently on; multi-core machines (see Sec. Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; PSI4 is, in many ways, a whole new package compared to Psi3.; While some libraries and modules remain the same, the majority of the code has; been rewritten from scratch based on a powerful set of new libraries written; in C++. A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec. Tutorial provides a brief tutorial to help new users; get started. Section Psithon offers further details into the; structure of PSI4 input files and how Python can be mixed with",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/introduction-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/introduction-1.html
