Caution; As of 1.0, the below, while essentially still correct, is so aged; as to be difficult to follow. Since quantum chemical methods in PSI4 are accessed through Python functions, and; most important quantities are available as PSI variables, it is straightforward; to create aliases to commonly run calculations or to define hybrid methods. The; psi4/psi4/driver/aliases.py file is intended for editing by the user for; this purpose.; As an example, the MP2.5 method; (which admittedly is already built in to PSI4); is the average of MP2 and MP3. The latter is; available through the arbitrary order MPn code and returns all lower energies; along with it in PSI variables. The following is basic code that will compute; and return the MP2.5 energy.; def run_mp2_5(name, **kwargs):. energy('mp3', **kwargs); e_scf = psi4.get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY'); ce_mp2 = psi4.get_variable('MP2 CORRELATION ENERGY'); ce_mp3 = psi4.get_variable('MP3 CORRELATION ENERGY'). ce_mp25 = 0.5 * (ce_mp2 + ce_mp3); e_mp25 = e_scf + ce_mp25. print """""" MP2.5 total energy: %16.8f\n"""""" % (e_mp25); print """""" MP2.5 correlation energy: %16.8f\n"""""" % (ce_mp25). return e_mp25.

In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. \[H=F_A+W_A+F_B+W_B+V\]; Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, \(F\), the fluctuation potential of each monomer, \(W\), and the; interaction potential, \(V\).

The factorization of the SAPT energy; expressions, as implemented in PSI4, assumes the use of density-fitted; two-electron integrals, therefore, the closed-shell SAPT module cannot be run with; exact integrals. In practice, we have found that the density-fitting; approximation introduces negligible errors into the SAPT energy; (often less than 0.01 kcal/mol for small dimers) and greatly; improves efficiency.; The latest addition to the SAPT code is the SAPT0 method for open-shell; monomers [Gonthier:2016:134106]. This code is available for both exact and density fitted integrals,; except for the dispersion terms which implementation relies on a density fitting; factorization. Both UHF and ROHF REFERENCE can be used, but coupled; induction computations are currently not supported with ROHF.

The factorization of the SAPT energy; expressions, as implemented in PSI4, assumes the use of density-fitted; two-electron integrals, therefore, the closed-shell SAPT module cannot be run with; exact integrals. In practice, we have found that the density-fitting; approximation introduces negligible errors into the SAPT energy; (often less than 0.01 kcal/mol for small dimers) and greatly; improves efficiency.; The latest addition to the SAPT code is the SAPT0 method for open-shell; monomers [Gonthier:2016:134106].

To compensate for these deviations, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommended to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; and recommended using the ratio with exponent \(\alpha = 1\). To obtain SAPT energies with this scaling,; simply set the keyword exch_scale_alpha true. Alternatively, another value for \(\alpha\); can be specified by setting EXCH_SCALE_ALPHA to a value. For example,; set exch_scale_alpha 1.0. will set \(\alpha = 1.0\) and scale exchange energies with \(p_{EX}(1.0)\).; However, as pointed out by Schaffer and Jansen [Schaffer:2013:2570]; in the context of DFT-based SAPT, the ratios \(E_{exch}^{(1)}(S^{2})/E_{exch}^{(1)}\),; \(E_{\rm exch-ind}^{(2)}(S^2)/E_{\rm exch-ind}^{(2)}\), and; \(E_{\rm exch-disp}^{(2)}(S^2)/E_{\rm exch-disp}^{(2)}\) are not very similar to; each o",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/sapt.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/sapt.html

Hence, in 2016 universal scaling of all \(S^{2}\) approximated terms; was turned off by default.; Finally, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106] empirically discovered that; SAPT0 energies for van der Waals dimers with close contacts benefit from a slightly modified; recipe that involves an empirically adjusted exponent \(\alpha = 3.0\).; To distinguish it from its unscaled counterpart, this energy is denoted sSAPT0 (see [Parker:2014:094106]). (9)¶\[E_{sSAPT0} = E_{elst}^{(10)} + E_{exch}^{(10)} + E_{ind,resp}^{(20)} +; p_{EX}(3.0) E_{exch-ind,resp}^{(20)} + E_{disp}^{(20)} + p_{EX}(3.0) E_{exch-disp}^{(20)}; + \delta_{HF}^{(2)}\]; where \(\delta_{HF}^{(2)}\) is computed without any scaling. Please note that; sSAPT0 is thus not the same as requesting exch_scale_alpha 3.0, and that the; scaling is automatically performed by requesting energy('ssapt0').

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions.

Interior option to clean up printing. Type: boolean; Default: false. Higher-Order SAPT¶; For smaller systems (up to the size of a nucleic acid base pair), more; accurate interaction energies can be obtained through higher-order SAPT; computations. The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies for closed-shell systems; only. Publications resulting from the use of the higher-order SAPT code; should cite the following:; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].; For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106], whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors. Thanks to; natural orbital methods [Parrish:2013:174102], the SAPT code; is able to include CCD dispersion with only a modest additional cost.; Computations employing CCD dispersion should cite [Parrish:2013:174102].; To request CCD dispersion treatment in a SAPT computation, simply append; (ccd) to the name of the method, as in the following examples; energy('sapt2+(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)'). The \(\delta_{MP2}\) corrections can also be computed automatically; by appending dmp2 to the name of the method, with or without CCD dispersion; energy('sapt2+dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)dmp2').

The charge-transfer energy; can be computed with the SAPT module as described by Stone; and Misquitta [Misquitta:2009:201].; Charge-transfer energies can be obtained from the following calls to the; energy function.; energy('sapt0-ct'); energy('sapt2-ct'); energy('sapt2+-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3-ct'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)-ct'). For now, charge transfer computations are not available with open-shell SAPT0.; A SAPT charge-transfer analysis will perform 5 HF computations: the dimer; in the dimer basis, monomer A in the dimer basis, monomer B in the dimer; basis, monomer A in the monomer A basis, and monomer B in the monomer B; basis. Next, it performs two SAPT computations, one in the dimer basis and; one in the monomer basis.

It is also possible to run a closed-shell SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set. Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example; molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation. Note that an error will be thrown if each atom in the; third monomer is not a ghost to prevent confusion with three-body SAPT which is; not currently supported by Psi4. Interpreting SAPT Results¶; We will examine the results of a SAPT2+3/aug-cc-pVDZ computation on the; water dimer.

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions. Publications resulting from the use of the SAPT0 code; should cite the following publications: [Hohenstein:2010:184111] and; [Hohenstein:2011:174107]. If the open-shell SAPT0 code is used,; [Gonthier:2016:134106] should be additionally cited. Basic SAPT0 Keywords¶. SAPT_LEVEL¶. The level of theory for SAPT.

The factorization of the SAPT energy; expressions, as implemented in PSI4, assumes the use of density-fitted; two-electron integrals, therefore, the closed-shell SAPT module cannot be run with; exact integrals. In practice, we have found that the density-fitting; approximation introduces negligible errors into the SAPT energy; (often less than 0.01 kcal/mol for small dimers) and greatly; improves efficiency.; The latest addition to the SAPT code is the SAPT0 method for open-shell; monomers [Gonthier:2016:134106]. This code is available for both exact and density fitted integrals,; except for the dispersion terms which implementation relies on a density fitting; factorization. Both UHF and ROHF REFERENCE can be used, but coupled; induction computations are currently not supported with ROHF. This means that orbital; relaxation is not included for ROHF and the uncoupled induction term is computed instead.; If both monomers are open-shell, their coupling is assumed to be high spin, i.e.; two doublets would interact to form a triplet. The S2 approximation and scaling¶; All exchange terms in SAPT arise from the antisymmetrization; of the wavefunctions of monomers A and B. Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the \(S^{2}\); approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron; pair between monomers.; The \(S^{2}\) approximation is usually pretty good, but may; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate for these deviations, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommended to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; and recommended using the ratio with exponent \(\alpha = 1\).

SAPT(DFT)¶; In general, SAPT(DFT) should provide more accurate interaction energy; components, and overall interaction energies, than SAPT0.

Like higher-order SAPT, SAPT(DFT) requires; sufficient memory to hold \(2ovN_aux\) doubles.; SAPT(DFT) requires a few special treatments to obtain accurate; result. The DFT functionals used in SAPT(DFT) need to be asymptotically; corrected with Gradient Regulated Asymptotic Correction scheme (GRAC),; in order to recover the correct long-range asymptotic behavior; (approaching \(-1/r\) as \(r\) approaches infinity). The program; requires manual input of GRAC shift parameter for each monomer through; keywords SAPT_DFT_GRAC_SHIFT_A and SAPT_DFT_GRAC_SHIFT_B,; which should be equal to the difference of the actual ionization; potential and the corresponding Kohn-Sham HOMO energy.

Higher-Order SAPT¶; For smaller systems (up to the size of a nucleic acid base pair), more; accurate interaction energies can be obtained through higher-order SAPT; computations. The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies for closed-shell systems; only. Publications resulting from the use of the higher-order SAPT code; should cite the following:; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].; For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106], whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors.

Warning; In rare cases with systems having a high degree of symmetry,; PSI4 gives (very obviously) wrong answers for SAPT computations; when the specification is in Z-matrix format.

Caution; January 28th 2016, the default for all NAT_ORBS options; was changed to true.

The dispersion; term needs to be computed with orbital response for good accuracy,; and it is recommended to enable SAPT_DFT_DO_HYBRID (set to; True by default).

The total component energies (i.e.,; electrostatics, exchange, induction, and dispersion) represent what we; regard as the best estimate available at a given level of SAPT computed; from a subset of the terms of that grouping. The groupings shown above are; not unique and are certainly not rigorously defined. We regard the groupings; used in PSI4 as a “chemist’s grouping” as opposed to a more; mathematically based grouping, which would group all exchange terms; (i.e. \(E_{exch-ind,resp}^{(20)}\), \(E_{exch-disp}^{(20)}\), etc.) in; the exchange component. A final note is that both Disp22(T); and Est.Disp22(T) results appear if MP2 natural orbitals are; used to evaluate the triples correction to dispersion. The Disp22(T); result is the triples correction as computed in the truncated NO basis;; Est.Disp22(T) is a scaled result that attempts to recover; the effect of the truncated virtual space and is our best estimate. The Est.Disp22(T); value is used in the SAPT energy and dispersion component (see [Hohenstein:2010:104107]; for details).

In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. \[H=F_A+W_A+F_B+W_B+V\]; Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, \(F\), the fluctuation potential of each monomer, \(W\), and the; interaction potential, \(V\). The monomer Fock operators, \(F_A+F_B\), are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of \(V\), \(W_A\), and \(W_B\).; Through first-order in \(V\), electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in \(V\). For; a complete description of SAPT, the reader is referred to the excellent; review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz [Jeziorski:1994:1887].; Several truncations of the closed-shell SAPT expansion are available in the SAPT; module of PSI4. The simplest truncation of SAPT is denoted SAPT0; and defined in Eq. (1).

The S2 approximation and scaling¶; All exchange terms in SAPT arise from the antisymmetrization; of the wavefunctions of monomers A and B. Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the \(S^{2}\); approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron; pair between monomers.; The \(S^{2}\) approximation is usually pretty good, but may; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate for these deviations, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommended to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; and recommended using the ratio with exponent \(\alpha = 1\). To obtain SAPT energies with this scaling,; simply set the keyword exch_scale_alpha true. Alternatively, another value for \(\alpha\); can be specified by setting EXCH_SCALE_ALPHA to a value. For example,; set exch_scale_alpha 1.0. will set \(\alpha = 1.0\) and scale exchange energies with \(p_{EX}(1.0)\).; However, as pointed out by Schaffer and Jansen [Schaffer:2013:2570]; in the context of DFT-based SAPT, the ratios \(E_{exch}^{(1)}(S^{2})/E_{exch}^{(1)}\),; \(E_{\rm exch-ind}^{(2)}(S^2)/E_{\rm exch-ind}^{(2)}\), and; \(E_{\rm exch-disp}^{(2)}(S^2)/E_{\rm exch-disp}^{(2)}\) are not very similar to; each other. Hence, in 2016 universal scaling of all \(S^{2}\) approximated terms; was turned off by default.; Finally, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106] empirically discovered that; SAPT0 energies for van der Waals dimers with close contacts benefit from a slightly modified; recipe that involves an empirically adjusted exponent \(\alpha = 3.0\).; To distinguish it from its unscaled counterpart, this energy is denoted sSAPT",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/sapt.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/sapt.html

Hence, in 2016 universal scaling of all \(S^{2}\) approximated terms; was turned off by default.; Finally, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106] empirically discovered that; SAPT0 energies for van der Waals dimers with close contacts benefit from a slightly modified; recipe that involves an empirically adjusted exponent \(\alpha = 3.0\).; To distinguish it from its unscaled counterpart, this energy is denoted sSAPT0 (see [Parker:2014:094106]). (9)¶\[E_{sSAPT0} = E_{elst}^{(10)} + E_{exch}^{(10)} + E_{ind,resp}^{(20)} +; p_{EX}(3.0) E_{exch-ind,resp}^{(20)} + E_{disp}^{(20)} + p_{EX}(3.0) E_{exch-disp}^{(20)}; + \delta_{HF}^{(2)}\]; where \(\delta_{HF}^{(2)}\) is computed without any scaling. Please note that; sSAPT0 is thus not the same as requesting exch_scale_alpha 3.0, and that the; scaling is automatically performed by requesting energy('ssapt0'). A First Example¶; The following is the simplest possible input that will perform all; available SAPT computations (normally, you would pick one of these methods,; not all of them).; molecule water_dimer {; 0 1; O -1.551007 -0.114520 0.000000; H -1.934259 0.762503 0.000000; H -0.599677 0.040712 0.000000; --; 0 1; O 1.350625 0.111469 0.000000; H 1.680398 -0.373741 -0.758561; H 1.680398 -0.373741 0.758561. units angstrom; no_reorient; symmetry c1; }. set basis aug-cc-pvdz. energy('sapt0'); energy('sapt2'); energy('sapt2+'); energy('sapt2+(3)'); energy('sapt2+3'). The SAPT module uses the standard PSI4 partitioning of the dimer; into monomers. SAPT does not use spatial symmetry and needs the geometry; of the system to remain fixed throughout monomer and dimer calculations.; These requirements are imposed whenever a SAPT calculation is requested; but can also be set explicitly with the no_reorient and symmetry; c1 molecule keywords, as in the example above. As a reminder, only; SAPT0 can handle the interaction of both closed- and open-shell monomers.; Higher-order SAPT and SAPT(",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/sapt.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/sapt.html

Publications resulting from the use of the higher-order SAPT code; should cite the following:; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].; For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106], whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors. Thanks to; natural orbital methods [Parrish:2013:174102], the SAPT code; is able to include CCD dispersion with only a modest additional cost.; Computations employing CCD dispersion should cite [Parrish:2013:174102].; To request CCD dispersion treatment in a SAPT computation, simply append; (ccd) to the name of the method, as in the following examples; energy('sapt2+(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)'). The \(\delta_{MP2}\) corrections can also be computed automatically; by appending dmp2 to the name of the method, with or without CCD dispersion; energy('sapt2+dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)dmp2'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)dmp2'). A brief note on memory usage: the higher-order SAPT code assumes that; certain quantities can be held in core. This code requires sufficient; memory to hold \(3o^2v^2+v^2N_{aux}\) arrays in core. With this; requirement computations on the adenine-thymine complex can be performed; with an aug-cc-pVTZ basis in less than 64GB of memory.; Higher-order SAPT is treated separately from the highly optimized SAPT0; code, therefore, higher-order SAPT uses a separate set of keywords.; The following keywords are relevant for higher-order SAPT.

These results are for the water dimer geometry shown above computed with; SAPT0/aug-cc-pVDZ. Monomer-Centered Basis Computations¶; The charge-transfer analysis above is carried out by taking the; difference between SAPT induction as calculated in the dimer-centered; basis (i.e., each monomer sees the basis functions on both monomers); vs. the monomer-centered basis (i.e., each monomer utilizes only its; own basis set). It is also possible to run a closed-shell SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set. Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example; molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation. Note that an error will be thrown if each atom in the; third monomer is not a ghost to prevent confusion with three-body SAPT which is; not currently supported by Psi4.

One can avoid this bottleneck by replacing these; dispersion terms with the empirical D3 corrections developed by Grimme.; Grimme’s dispersion corrections are discussed here.; The corresponding method, termed SAPT0-D, thus relies on empirically fit parameters; specific to SAPT0/jun-cc-pVDZ. While SAPT0-D can be used with any of the -D; variants using default parameters optimized for Hartee–Fock interaction energies,; we recommend using the refit parameters with Becke-Johnson damping, as described in; [Schriber:2021:234107].

Initial Guess¶; In each step of the SCF procedure, a new Fock or Kohn–Sham potential is built; according to the previous density, following which the potential is diagonalized; to produce new molecular orbitals, from which a new density is computed. This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. COREDiagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems. This is the default for single atoms. SAD [Default]Superposition of Atomic Densities. Builds the initial density as the; spin-averaged sum of atomic UHF computations in the current basis. If an; open-shell system, uniform scaling of the spin-averaged density matrices is; performed. If orbitals are needed (e.g., in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems. This is the default for; systems of more than one atom. SADNONatural orbitals from Superposition of Atomic Densities.

At present, casting from a different molecular point; group is not supported. This becomes the default for the second; and later iterations of geometry optimizations. SAPSuperposition of Atomic Potentials. This is essentially a; modification of the core Hamiltonian, which includes screening; effects by using a radially screened effective atomic charge. The; screening effects have been calculated at the complete basis set; limit with finite-element calculations, see [Lehtola:2019:25945]; and [Lehtola:2020:012516]. The guess and its implementation have; been described in [Lehtola:2019:1593]. The guess is evaluated on a; DFT quadrature grid, so the guess energy depends slightly on the; used DFT quadrature. The current implementation is based on; exchange-only local density calculations that are but nanohartree; away from the complete basis set limit [Lehtola:2020:012516]. SAPGAUSuperposition of Atomic Potentials, but using error function based; fits to the atomic radial potentials as discussed in; [Lehtola:2020:144105]. The main difference to the SAP guess; discussed above [Lehtola:2019:25945] is that the SAPGAU scheme is; analytic, and can be efficiently formed in terms of three-center; two-electron integrals [Lehtola:2020:144105]. The potential in; the SAPGAU scheme is passed with the SAPGAU_BASIS; keyword. The default potential is given by the large fit to the; HelFEM potential, sap_helfem_large, described in; [Lehtola:2020:144105]. Note that this guess is known in the DIRAC; program as .SCRPOT and in the ERKALE program as SAPFIT. These are all set by the GUESS keyword. Also, an automatic Python; procedure has been developed for converging the SCF in a small basis, and then; casting up to the true basis.

Integral-Direct Density-Fitted Coulomb Construction¶; The Resolution of the Identity (RI) can be used to decompose the normally 4-center ERI tensor into a combination of 3-center and 2-center components.; By reducing the dimensionality of the ERI tensor, application of the RI (often referred to as density-fitting, or DF) can be used to greatly speed up; SCF calculations. The reduction in ERI tensor rank also makes DF an appealing option for conventional SCF calculations, where the ERIs are stored; in core or on disk. However, even when using DF, I/O becomes a significant bottleneck for systems of a sufficient size when performing conventional SCF; calculations. In principle, though, DF approaches can be utilized in an integral-direct context, gaining the benefits of DF methods without suffering the; I/O bottlenecks that conventional DF methods will eventually run into. One such approach, outlined by Weigend in [Weigend:2002:4285],; is available for use in Psi4 for the separate construction of the Coulomb contribution to the Fock matrix. This implementation can be used alongside; Psi4’s separate Exchange construction algorithms for composite Fock matrix construction by using the keyword DFDIRJ as the Coulomb construction; algorithm when specifying SCF_TYPE to use a composite algorithm combination (DFDIRJ+K_alg in general,; or DFDIRJ for DFT with non-hybrid functionals).; DFDIRJ supports multiple capabilities to improve performance. Specifically, DFDIRJ allows for a combination of density-matrix based ERI; screening (set SCREENING to DENSITY) and incremental Fock matrix construction (set INCFOCK to TRUE). These two, when combined,; enable more aggressive screening of ERI contributions to the Coulomb matrix and thus greatly improve performance.

COSX Exchange¶; The semi-numerical COSX algorithm described in [Neese:2009:98] evaluates; two-electron ERIs analytically over one electron coordinate and numerically; over the other electron coordinate, and belongs to the family of pseudospectral; methods originally suggested by Friesner. In COSX, numerical integration is performed on standard; DFT quadrature grids, which are described in DFT: Density Functional Theory.; Both the accuracy of the COSX algorithm and also the computational; cost are directly determined by the size of the integration grid, so selection; of the grid is important. This COSX implementation uses two separate grids.; By default, the SCF algorithm is first converged on a smaller grid, followed by a; number of SCF iterations up to a maximum value (controlled by the COSX_MAXITER_FINAL keyword); on a larger grid. By default, COSX_MAXITER_FINAL is set to 1, a single; SCF iteration, which results in numerical errors comparable to; performing the entire SCF on the expensive larger grid at a computational cost; much closer to the smaller grid. Setting COSX_MAXITER_FINAL to 0 disables the; larger grid entirely. Setting COSX_MAXITER_FINAL to -1 allows; for the SCF to fully converge on the larger grid, useful for the study of wavefunction; properties such as gradients. The size of the initial grid is controlled by the keywords; COSX_RADIAL_POINTS_INITIAL and COSX_SPHERICAL_POINTS_INITIAL.; The final grid is controlled by COSX_RADIAL_POINTS_FINAL and; COSX_SPHERICAL_POINTS_FINAL.

The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations \(N,N+2,\ldots\), invoking; MOM_START N can often rescue the convergence of the SCF. MOM can; be used in concert with DIIS, though care should be taken to not turn MOM on; until the oscillatory behavior begins. Damping [Off by Default]In some cases, a static mixing of Fock Matrices from adjacent; iterations can quench oscillations. This mixing, known as; “damping” can be activated by setting the; DAMPING_PERCENTAGE keyword to a nonzero percent. Damping is; turned off when the DIIS error is smaller than; DAMPING_CONVERGENCE. Level shifting [Off by default]A commonly used alternative to damping is to use level shifting,; which decreases the mixing of occupied and unoccupied orbitals in; the SCF update by moving the unoccupied orbitals up in energy. It; can be shown that the SCF procedure always converges with a; suitably large level shift; however, the larger the shift is, the; slower the convergence becomes, and the calculation may end up; converging onto a higher lying SCF solution. Because of this, in; practice level shifting is most useful in the initial phase of the; calculation to reduce the orbital error enough for DIIS to work; well. The level shift is controlled by the parameter; LEVEL_SHIFT, and it is turned off when the DIIS error is; smaller than LEVEL_SHIFT_CUTOFF. Reasonable values for; the shift and convergence threshold are 5.0 and 1e-2,; respectively. SOSCF [Off by Default]See Second-order Convergence.

In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword “DF”; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; PSI4‘s internal routines.

Specifically, LinK exploits the fact that the Exchange term; requires only a linear-scaling number of significant elements through reformulating the; shell quartet screening process to scale linearly with system size.; LinK is most competitive when used with non-diffuse orbital basis sets, since orbital and density overlaps decay slower with diffuse functions.; LinK is especially powerful when combined with density-matrix based ERI ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/scf.html

As a “semi-numerical” Exchange construction method,; sn-LinK is also comparable to the pseudospectral method of Friesner.; sn-LinK and COSX have a number of significant differences in implementation details in PSI4, however.; First and foremost, the COSX implementation is contained within PSI4 itself, and is thus always available; for execution. On the other hand, the sn-LinK implementation in PSI4 is tied to the GauXC standalone; library discussed in [Williams-Young:2023:234104]; thus, the PSI4-GauXC interface must be built; for sn-LinK to be used. Second, the GauXC sn-LinK interface is more; efficient than the PSI4 COSX code on multiple levels. For CPU execution, GauXC’s sn-LinK uses highly-optimized; kernels for the contraction of the analytic integrals, whereas PSI4’s COSX uses a less-optimized, more; general contraction kernel. Additionally, GauXC’s sn-LinK code supports execution on GPUs, allowing for; GPU-enabled construction of the Exchange matrix, while PSI4’s COSX does not. In general,; sn-LinK will provide better runtime performance for hitting a desired accuracy; threshold compared to PSI4’s COSX. Third, some low-level implementation details differ between the two.; For example, PSI4’s COSX uses a dual-grid scheme similar to that originally proposed by Neese,; converging the SCF on a small grid, then running a number of SCF iterations,; equal to the value set by the COSX_MAXITER_FINAL, on a larger grid.; In contrast, sn-LinK only uses a single-grid scheme, simply converging the SCF on one grid.; As another example, while the COSX grid defaults are selected to emphasi",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/scf.html

Setting this option to true will fail unless the Psi4-GauXC interface is compiled with GPU support. Second-order Convergence¶; Second-order convergence takes into account both the gradient and Hessian to; take a full Newton step with respect to the orbital parameters. This results in; quadratic convergence with respect to density for SCF methods. For cases where; normal acceleration methods either fail or take many iterations to converge,; second-order can reduce the total time to solution.; Solving second-order (SO) methods exactly would require an inversion of the; orbital Hessian (an expensive \(\mathbb{N}^6\) operation); however, these; equations are normally solved iteratively where each iteration costs the same; as a normal Fock build (\(\mathbb{N}^4\)). The overall SOSCF operation is; thus broken down into micro- and macroiterations where the microiterations; refer to solving the SOSCF equations and macroiterations are the construction; of a new Fock matrix based on the orbitals from a SOSCF step.; SOSCF requires that all elements of the gradient to be less than one before the; method is valid. To this end, pre-SOSCF SCF iterations use normal; gradient-based extrapolation procedures (e.g., DIIS) until the gradient; conditions are met.

Value CHECK only computes the electronic; Hessian eigenvalue and checks if an actual SCF minimum has been found, while value FOLLOW; rotates the converged orbitals along the lowest eigenvector, then invokes the SCF; procedure again to lower the energy. In case the minimization does not succeed; or ends up on the same unstable solution, you can tune the scale factor for the orbital; rotation through the keyword FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE.; The rotation angle is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\mbox{ } \cdot\) (FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE). The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess, and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS;; the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS. Note; Setting the option STABILITY_ANALYSIS to FOLLOW is only avalible for UHF. When using; RHF and ROHF instabilities can be checked, but not followed.

At; this point, the code switches on the requested Direct integrals technology, which; requires only four full iterations to reach convergence, starting from the DF; guess. This hybrid DF/Direct procedure can significantly accelerate SCF; computations requiring exact integrals.; After the iterations are completed, a number of one-electron properties are; printed, and some bookkeeping is performed to set up possible correlated; computations. Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; PRINT option. Also printed are the occupied and virtual orbital energies,; which are useful in elucidating the stability and reactivity of the system. Theory¶; The objective of Hartree–Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) \(\{\psi_i\}\),. \[\psi_i(\vec x_1) = C_{\mu i} \phi_{\mu} (\vec x_1).\]; Here, \(\{\phi_{\mu}\}\) are the basis functions, which, in PSI4 are; contracted Cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs). The matrix \(C_{\mu i}\) contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree–Fock. The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. \[\begin{split}| \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |\end{split}\]; This form for the Hartree–Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; \(\mathbb{R}^6\) instead of a more complicated effect in; \(\mathbb{R}^N\).; Considering the electronic Hamiltonian,. \[\hat H = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/scf.html

Because of this, SCF is a nonlinear procedure, which; terminates when the generating orbitals are self-consistent with the Fock matrix; they generate.; The formation of the Coulomb matrix \(J\) and the exchange matrix; \(K^{\alpha}\) dominate the computational effort of the SCF procedure. For; very large systems, diagonalization of the Fock matrix can also present a; significant hurdle.

As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:134108].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; option S_TOLERANCE, which defaults to 1E-7.

Second-order Convergence¶; Second-order convergence takes into account both the gradient and Hessian to; take a full Newton step with respect to the orbital parameters.

For cases where; normal acceleration methods either fail or take many iterations to converge,; second-order can reduce the total time to solution.; Solving second-order (SO) methods exactly would require an inversion of the; orbital Hessian (an expensive \(\mathbb{N}^6\) operation); however, these; equations are normally solved iteratively where each iteration costs the same; as a normal Fock build (\(\mathbb{N}^4\)). The overall SOSCF operation is; thus broken down into micro- and macroiterations where the microiterations; refer to solving the SOSCF equations and macroiterations are the construction; of a new Fock matrix based on the orbitals from a SOSCF step.; SOSCF requires that all elem",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/scf.html

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used.; This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:134108].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; optio",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/scf.html

[5]; The E_CONVERGENCE keyword is implemented for most post-SCF modules.; See a list beginning at E_CONVERGENCE.

Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your orbital basis/atom type.

Within the DF portion; of the computation, the zeroth-iteration uses a non-idempotent density matrix; obtained from the SAD guess, so the energy is unphysically low. However, the; first true iteration is quite close to the final DF energy, highlighting the; efficiency of the SAD guess. Pulay’s DIIS procedure is then used to accelerate; SCF convergence, with the DF phase reaching convergence in eight true; iterations. When used together, SAD and DIIS are usually sufficient to converge; the SCF for all but the most difficult systems. Additional convergence; techniques are available for more difficult cases, and are detailed below.

In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix.

This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. COREDiagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems.

Also, an automatic Python; procedure has been developed for converging the SCF in a small basis, and then; casting up to the true basis. This can be done by adding; BASIS_GUESS = SMALL_BASIS to the options list. We recommend the; 3-21G or pcseg-0 basis for the small basis due to its efficient mix of flexibility and; compactness.

Convergence Stabilization¶; A summary of Psi’s supported convergence stabilization techniques is presented below:. DIIS [On by Default]DIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock matrix together; with an error criterion based on the orbital gradient to produce an informed; estimate of the next Fock Matrix. DIIS is almost always necessary to converge; the SCF procedure and is therefore turned on by default. In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via options. ADIIS [On by Default]ADIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock and density matrices to produce an; informed estimate of the next Fock matrix. ADIIS estimates are based on minimizing; an energy estimate rather than zeroing the residual, so this performs best in the early; iterations. By default, Psi will start using ADIIS before blending the ADIIS step with; the DIIS step, eventually using the pure DIIS step. The closely-related EDIIS procedure; may be used instead by setting SCF_INITIAL_ACCELERATOR. This is formally identical; to ADIIS for HF, but the methods will differ for more general DFT. MOM [Off by Default]MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital.

Linear Exchange¶; Large SCF calculations can benefit from specialized screening procedures that further reduce the scaling of the ERI contribution to the Fock matrix.; LinK, the linear-scaling exchange method described in [Ochsenfeld:1998:1663], is available in Psi4 in conjunction with composite algorithms that build J (SCF_TYPE set to J_alg+LINK).; LinK achieves linear-scaling by exploiting shell pair sparsity in the density matrix and overlap sparsity between shell pairs.

If one or more constraints have to be relaxed to reach; a lower-energy solution, there is an external instability. In PSI4, the only external instability; that can be checked at present is the RHF \(\rightarrow\) UHF one.; Currently, two algorithms exist in PSI4 for stability analysis: the original; Direct Inversion and the newly implemented Davidson algorithms. We will first describe; options common to both algorithms. To request a stability analysis at the end of the SCF,; set the keyword STABILITY_ANALYSIS. Value CHECK only computes the electronic; Hessian eigenvalue and checks if an actual SCF minimum has been found, while value FOLLOW; rotates the converged orbitals along the lowest eigenvector, then invokes the SCF; procedure again to lower the energy. In case the minimization does not succeed; or ends up on the same unstable solution, you can tune the scale factor for the orbital; rotation through the keyword FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE.; The rotation angle is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\mbox{ } \cdot\) (FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE). The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess, and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS;; the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS. Note; Setting the option STABILITY_ANALYSIS to FOLLOW is only avalible for UHF. When using; RHF and ROHF instabilities can be checked, but not followed.

For post-SCF methods, the entire gradient computation needed to be run as finite difference of energies. Warning; As of May 2022, v1.6, Psi4 uses the LibECPInt library, and analytic derivatives and Hessians of ECPs are available. Analytic derivatives of molecular systems including ECPs should be available whenever the method has analytic derivatives, but these have so far only been verified for HF and DFT.

For more; information on any of these options, see the relevant section below. Spin/Symmetry Treatment¶; PSI4 implements the most popular spin specializations of Hartree–Fock; theory, including:. Restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) [Default]Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical. Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF)Appropriate for most open-shell systems and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the \(\hat S^2\) operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to a; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem. Restricted Open-Shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF)Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical). Constrained Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (CUHF)A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used.; This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:134108].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; optio",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/scf.html

SNLINKAn algorithm based on the “seminumerical Linear Exchange” (sn-LinK); approach described in [Laqua:2020:1456], SNLINK is only available if PSI4; is compiled with the GauXC library, described in [Williams-Young:2023:234104].; Algorithmically, SNLINK is very similar to COSX, differing primarily in screening of; the analytic 3-center integrals.

To turn on this option, set INCFOCK to true.; We have added the automatic capability to use the extremely fast DF; code for intermediate convergence of the orbitals, for SCF_TYPE; DIRECT.

Integral-Direct Density-Fitted Coulomb Construction¶; The Resolution of the Identity (RI) can be used to decompose the normally 4-center ERI tensor into a combination of 3-center and 2-center components.; By reducing the dimensionality of the ERI tensor, application of the RI (often referred to as density-fitting, or DF) can be used to greatly speed up; SCF calculations. The reduction in ERI tensor rank also makes DF an appealing option for conventional SCF calculations, where the ERIs are stored; in core or on disk. However, even when using DF, I/O becomes a significant bottleneck for systems of a sufficient size when performing conventional SCF; calculations. In principle, though, DF approaches can be utilized in an integral-direct context, gaining the benefits of DF methods without suffering the; I/O bottlenecks that conventional DF methods will eventually run into.

For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS;; the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS.

The solvers can be used to extract the first few roots of interest for the full; time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) equations, also known as the random-phase; approximation (RPA), or its Tamm–Dancoff approximation.; The former is a generalized eigenvalue problem and our solver leverages; the Hamiltonian structure of the equations to ensure robust convergence [stratmann:1998].; The latter is a Hermitian eigenvalue problem and we employ a Davidson solver. Known limitations¶. Warning; The implementation cannot currently handle the following cases:; - Functionals with meta or VV10 components. Warning; The length-gauge rotatory strengths PSI4 computes are; currently not gauge-origin invariant. Theory¶; The excitation energies and corresponding states are obtained from the following generalized; eigenvalue problem, also known as the response eigenvalue problem:. \[\begin{split}\begin{pmatrix}; \mathbf{A} & \mathbf{B} \\; \mathbf{B}^{*} & \mathbf{A}^{*}; \end{pmatrix}; \begin{pmatrix}; \mathbf{X}_{n} \\; \mathbf{Y}_{n}; \end{pmatrix}; =; \omega_{n}; \begin{pmatrix}; \mathbf{1} & \mathbf{0} \\; \mathbf{0} & -\mathbf{1}; \end{pmatrix}; \begin{pmatrix}; \mathbf{X}_{n} \\; \mathbf{Y}_{n}; \end{pmatrix}.\end{split}\]; This approach has the advantage that there is no need to explicitly pa",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/tdscf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/tdscf.html
https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/tdscf.html:5464,Availability,down,down,5464,"lit}\]; This approach has the advantage that there is no need to explicitly parametrize; the wavefunctions of the molecular excited states.

The solvers can be used to extract the first few roots of interest for the full; time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) equations, also known as the random-phase; approximation (RPA), or its Tamm–Dancoff approximation.; The former is a generalized eigenvalue problem and our solver leverages; the Hamiltonian structure of the equations to ensure robust convergence [stratmann:1998].; The latter is a Hermitian eigenvalue problem and we employ a Davidson solver. Known limitations¶. Warning; The implementation cannot currently handle the following cases:; - Functionals with meta or VV10 components. Warning; The length-gauge rotatory strengths PSI4 computes are; currently not gauge-origin invariant.

If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True, dertype=1). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements.

Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances.

Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”.

A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want.

Note; Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with PSI4. In; Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language; (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then; submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into; pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure; Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind; the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name.

This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together.

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics; analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation.; You can see this in the next section of the output file. The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified.

In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases.

Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse \(d\) functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10]. So,; we’ll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to; use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors; while providing much faster computations [Hohenstein:2010:184111]; [Hohenstein:2010:014101]. Since we’re using density fitting for the SAPT,; we might as well also use it for the Hartree–Fock computations that are; performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that with; scf_type DF.; Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that; pair with the primary basis set.

In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set; (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set); that PSI4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT; auxiliary basis for the Hartree–Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set; for the SAPT procedure.; To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to; freeze the core electrons with freeze_core True.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it’s important to keep in mind that; the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular; geometry. Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies; at the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We could set up a second input file to perform; the vibrational frequency analysis, being very careful to copy over the; optimized geometry from the bottom of the output file for the geometry; optimization. This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True, dertype=1). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements.

Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values.

This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any “.in” or “.dat” extension by “.out”). Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples. A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory.

If everything goes well, the computation should complete and should report; a final restricted Hartree–Fock energy in a section like this:; Energy converged. @RHF Final Energy: -76.02663273410671. By default, the energy should be converged to about \(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\), so agreement; is only expected for about the first 6 digits after the decimal. If the; computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the; compilation or installation of the program (see the installation; instructions in Sec. Compiling and Installing from Source).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3).

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

PSI4; provides several built-in physical constants and conversion factors, as; described in section Physical Constants.; Notice the loop over \(R\) to create; the table looks just like the loop over R to run the different; computations, and the CP-corrected energies ecp[R] are accessed the same; way they were stored. The print line at the end just specifies some; formatting for the printed table (first element is a floating point number 3; spaces wide with one digit after the decimal, and the second element is a; floating point number 10 spaces wide with 6 digits after the decimal); the; format strings are the same as in the C programming language. For tables more; complicated than the simple one used here, Psithon has built-in support for; tables (see the next section).; Our table is printed at the very end of the output file, and looks like; this; CP-corrected CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ interaction energies.
