Content: @husamia Unfortunately usually is not a reliable description that can be applied to Docker, as it performs many layers of abstraction that can cause a spike when you are not even aware of it. 80% is definitely not enough, especially with the layers of abstractions that DeepVariant also adds.

# Content to Analyze
""directories in the tree flowing naturally from it. A minimal number of obvious scripts (with associated documentation) should naturally transition them from source code, through the build phase, and as quickly to the analysis process. Basically less is more, and you do not want to add more to the main directory as you begin to approach version 1.0. So ideally what would be nice is to have one build script - let's call it `build` - that reads a `config/build` directory - and does the following:. 1. Analyzes hidden build-generated files under `.build/...`, and detects if the `prereq` and `build-and-test` phases have been successfully processed. Otherwise, it would report back to the user the build status, and query the user with a recommendation on the next required step to run. For example:. ```; $ build status. Checking DeepVariant build prerequisites... OK; Checking DeepVariant test environment compatibility [GPU]... OK; Checking DeepVariant build binaries... MISSING. Proceed with building binaries [Y/n]?. ```. 2. Once the builds have been successfully completed, then it would tell the user the available options to run (i.e. `make_examples`, `call_variants`, `postprocess_variants`, `pkrusche/hap.py`, etc.) as well as any analysis that has been completed if a `results` or `analysis-results` folder is present. 3. For Cloud Build, that would also be part of the `build` script, when they provide the `help` argument:. ```; $ ./build help; ...; cloudbuild Builds Docker images of DeepVariant, and ; pushes them on the Google Container Registry (gcr.io) ; ... $ ./build cloudbuild help; CPU Builds a DeepVariant Docker image for CPU usage.; GPU Builds a DeepVariant Docker image for GPU usage.; Runner Builds a DeepVariant Docker image for large-scale analysis run; using the Genomics Pipelines API. $; ```. Even `Runner` is a bit too general, so maybe calling it `LargeScaleAnalysis`, or something which should be instantly recognizable as to its intended use. Hope it helps,; Paul""

Content: @A-Tsai So now you're getting into determining your lineage graph of computations, which requires a lot of thought on how you set up your data and computational steps. Wide dependencies (multiple child partitions from the parent RDD) should be kept on the same node, while narrow dependencies (one child partition per parent RDD) can go over the network. Spark does hash partitioning to shuffle, and tries by the modulo of the number of partitions that it is somewhat uniformly distributed. Basically you should model your computation tree in order to best organize the data for good distribution and maximal local computation, otherwise you flood you network which slows down your completion-time. If you have 8 compute node with 4 cores each, then the node number will not change. The key to think about is the cores, but you have to determine to resource-allocate properly. The following can be helpful:. http://site.clairvoyantsoft.com/understanding-resource-allocation-configurations-spark-application/. Regarding task information, you get the duration here:. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskInfo@finishTime:Long. You can control the policy with the application as noted here:. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/job-scheduling.html#scheduling-within-an-application. You can control the assignment by creating pools with a `minShare` of cpu cores guaranteed for that pool. If you have one pool, then that can control it all - especially in FIFO mode - but that would not be efficient use of a Spark cluster. Spark has many moving parts, including how you structure your data and how to chose to process it (batch vs. stream). To properly perform this you have to analyze carefully the design of your computational DAG, and how your work should be processed given the resources. To me 200 partitions does not quite feel right, but if you think that is optimal for your design that's fine. Hope it helps,; ~p

",True,"The content discusses several software architecture concepts:  

* **Modularity and Flexibility:** The author emphasizes the need for a modular codebase (`refactoring the codebase will allow for more fluid hierarchical analysis`) to enable adding new pipelines and analyses easily. This speaks to architectural principles of decomposing systems into reusable components.
* **Pipeline-Based Architecture:** The concept of multiple pipelines (`multiple pipelines that are auto-triggered to run accordingly`) suggests an architecture where data flows through a series of transformations, reminiscent of pipeline processing patterns often seen in data-intensive applications.
* **Data Flow and Transformation:**  The description of  `transforming datasets`, `streamlined as protobuf messages`, and the use of a DSL (`intermediate analysis language`) points towards a focus on data flow and transformation within the architecture. 
* **Integration and Centralization:** The author envisions a system where different datasets are integrated and compared, suggesting an architectural concern for data interoperability and centralized analysis capabilities.

""e more of an ensemble model approach in the future, where you you want to push your data through multiple pipelines for comparison. At that point you're not even writing code anymore, but rather directing transformation among (ephemeral) datasets through an intermediate analysis language ([DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) to try out different ideas upon a collection of data -- where some might contain/become golden standards. For example, now you have collections of transformed datasets streamlined as protobuf message, which can be filter-inspected as JSON as necessary for validation purposes, which you can do now such as for `CallVariantsOutput` among others:. ```; variant {; reference_bases: ""A""; alternate_bases: ""C""; calls {; info {; key: ""AD""; ...; call_set_name: ""Sample_Diag-excap51-HG002-EEogPU""; }; end: 1115835; reference_name: ""1""; start: 1115834; ...; ```. So what I'm humbly proposing is something more subtle and flexible. Imagine you open a genome browser, and search for a specific disease. It then can have you drill down to the available samples or the variation graph. For the variation graph it will allow you to see a model of transitions among samples relating the temporal behavior of subtypes of cancer. All these steps are multiple pipelines that are auto-triggered to run accordingly, or would be pre-cached results. As new samples come in, it improves the disease models, or other functional analysis. This opens doors to Personlized Medicine -- clinicians, research, or patients -- enabling integrated analysis that is centralized for different types of datasets. You already have the protobuf data-structures for initiating that, thus allowing your stored collection of pipelines to drive that integration and comparison to take place, of which DeepVariant would be one of many. Thus flexibility in the form of modularity when refactoring the codebase will allow for more fluid hierarchical analysis to take place down the line. Paul""

104,Energy Efficiency,"@A-Tsai So now you're getting into determining your lineage graph of computations, which requires a lot of thought on how you set up your data and computational steps. Wide dependencies (multiple child partitions from the parent RDD) should be kept on the same node, while narrow dependencies (one child partition per parent RDD) can go over the network. Spark does hash partitioning to shuffle, and tries by the modulo of the number of partitions that it is somewhat uniformly distributed. Basically you should model your computation tree in order to best organize the data for good distribution and maximal local computation, otherwise you flood you network which slows down your completion-time. If you have 8 compute node with 4 cores each, then the node number will not change. The key to think about is the cores, but you have to determine to resource-allocate properly.

""@pgrosu Thank you for the prompt response. Correct me if I'm wrong. ; taskset need to specify the specific cpu cores the process wants to occupy. Since my Spark cluster is multi-tenant, some processes may be running in the cluster and occupy some CPU cores. In addition, the dynamic resource allocation is enabled in my Spark cluster, so I can't assume all of my tasks can be equally assigned to each computing node. If my data are stored in 200 partitions, it mean that my program will launch 200 tasks by using pipe() to call taskset. I can't make sure which partition will be assigned to which computing node. Round-Robin assignment is a way, but it's violated the policy of the resource management (like Spark standalone or YARN). For example, I have 8 computing node with 4 cores per each. My Spark process might allocate 24 cores. It might be 8 computing nodes with 3 cores per each or 6 computing nodes with 4 cores per each. Furthermore, there is no information to let me know which task is done or which cpu core is available in my Spark program. the resource allocation might be unbalance and performance might be impacted severely, especially when several iterations of task assignment.""

370,Integrability,"Hi Pichuan,. It's a team effort :) Time is on our side as it's still sub-1.0. I think you can make it much easier and fun for yourself, as there another level to NGS analysis that can be tapped here. Currently the code sort of a wrapper to TensorFlow, and much of the definition of the input feature-set changed to the [0,254]-ranged 7 `ImageRow` channels -- `[base, base_quality, ..., matches_ref, op_len]` -- which is not really a RGB image anymore, and then run through the model to emit the three classes of predicted GT probabilities (homozygous reference, heterozygous and homozygous alternative):. ```; genotype_probabilities: 0.9999428988; genotype_probabilities: 1.8287e-05; genotype_probabilities: 3.88142e-05; ```. The VCF saving is helpful, but the interesting part is abstracting out the data and functionals (i.e. models), to enable a larger analysis platform, rather than still be file-focused which (dynamic) datasets would allow. Maybe tomorrow you want to try [Inception-v4](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/inception_v4.py) or some other more expressive network topology, which might require changes to your input tensor. I suspect things will become more of an ensemble model approach in the future, where you you want to push your data through multiple pipelines for comparison. At that point you're not even writing code anymore, but rather directing transformation among (ephemeral) datasets through an intermediate analysis language ([DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) to try out different ideas upon a collection of data -- where some might contain/become golden standards. For example, now you have collections of transformed datasets streamlined as protobuf message, which can be filter-inspected as JSON as necessary for validation purposes, which you can do now such as for `CallVariantsOutput` among others:. ```; variant {; reference_bases: ""A""; alternate_bases: ""C""; calls {; info {; key: ""AD""; ...; call_s",wrap,ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/21#issuecomment-353849339:229,wrapper,229,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/21#issuecomment-353849339,1,['wrap'],['wrapper'],"The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks.

If you have 8 compute node with 4 cores each, then the node number will not change. The key to think about is the cores, but you have to determine to resource-allocate properly. The following can be helpful:. http://site.clairvoyantsoft.com/understanding-resource-allocation-configurations-spark-application/. Regarding task information, you get the duration here:. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskInfo@finishTime:Long. You can control the policy with the application as noted here:. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/job-scheduling.html#scheduling-within-an-application. You can control the assignment by creating pools with a `minShare` of cpu cores guaranteed for that pool. If you have one pool, then that can control it all - especially in FIFO mode - but that would not be efficient use of a Spark cluster. Spark has many moving parts, including how you structure your data and how to chose to process it (batch vs. stream). To properly perform this you have to analyze carefully the design of your computational DAG, and how your work should be processed given the resources. To me 200 partitions does not quite feel right, but if you think that is optimal for your design that's fine. Hope it helps,; ~p""

725,Modifiability,"d, and has a very practical use-case for many users that would like to automate their analysis. I'm sort of hinting at something else. So just imagine you are pitching this to some Bioinformatician that has been doing their analysis on an internal cluster for years. S/he has heard from others of the benefits of DeepVariant through Google Cloud resources, and now has a little bit of free time to try it out to convince their boss to use it. The idea is that the root directory should be as simple as possible, so users don't get overwhelmed or confused - with all the other directories in the tree flowing naturally from it. A minimal number of obvious scripts (with associated documentation) should naturally transition them from source code, through the build phase, and as quickly to the analysis process. Basically less is more, and you do not want to add more to the main directory as you begin to approach version 1.0. So ideally what would be nice is to have one build script - let's call it `build` - that reads a `config/build` directory - and does the following:. 1. Analyzes hidden build-generated files under `.build/...`, and detects if the `prereq` and `build-and-test` phases have been successfully processed. Otherwise, it would report back to the user the build status, and query the user with a recommendation on the next required step to run. For example:. ```; $ build status. Checking DeepVariant build prerequisites... OK; Checking DeepVariant test environment compatibility [GPU]... OK; Checking DeepVariant build binaries... MISSING.

For example, the design team might want flexibility in playing around with different transformations of read signals and parameter search spaces - which might change over time or with different data sets - without worrying that the parameter list might require updating. Let's take the following simplified model optimization:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/f7c33960-59fc-45c9-9cdd-0f015ebd1aae). The team would let this model optimize itself to determine the parameter set under which it performs ideally. Then metadata about the training would be saved along with the optimized model. Then users can query the model's metadata via some program, which would provide information about the training data and parameters limits for different model types. Such metadata would be automatically populated through the model training step (where I'm including the validation and tuning steps). Based on that, a default set of parameters can be auto-generated for general users, and advanced users can then map their custom parameters however they want. It basically makes the training turn-key and usage automatic. Such training could even be remotely initiated through a browser, and different users can make some of their models available to others if they want, thus helping out the community and growing it at the same time. This would also make adapting new models much faster, including where a large set of specialized ensemble models might be required to check against. Best regards,; Paul""

Since my Spark cluster is multi-tenant, some processes may be running in the cluster and occupy some CPU cores. In addition, the dynamic resource allocation is enabled in my Spark cluster, so I can't assume all of my tasks can be equally assigned to each computing node. If my data are stored in 200 partitions, it mean that my program will launch 200 tasks by using pipe() to call taskset. I can't make sure which partition will be assigned to which computing node.

412,Safety," Bioinformatician that has been doing their analysis on an internal cluster for years. S/he has heard from others of the benefits of DeepVariant through Google Cloud resources, and now has a little bit of free time to try it out to convince their boss to use it. The idea is that the root directory should be as simple as possible, so users don't get overwhelmed or confused - with all the other directories in the tree flowing naturally from it. A minimal number of obvious scripts (with associated documentation) should naturally transition them from source code, through the build phase, and as quickly to the analysis process. Basically less is more, and you do not want to add more to the main directory as you begin to approach version 1.0. So ideally what would be nice is to have one build script - let's call it `build` - that reads a `config/build` directory - and does the following:. 1. Analyzes hidden build-generated files under `.build/...`, and detects if the `prereq` and `build-and-test` phases have been successfully processed. Otherwise, it would report back to the user the build status, and query the user with a recommendation on the next required step to run. For example:. ```; $ build status. Checking DeepVariant build prerequisites... OK; Checking DeepVariant test environment compatibility [GPU]... OK; Checking DeepVariant build binaries... MISSING. Proceed with building binaries [Y/n]?. ```. 2.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: ctory should be as simple as possible, so users don't get overwhelmed or confused - with all the other directories in the tree flowing naturally from it. A minimal number of obvious scripts (with associated documentation) should naturally transition them from source code, through the build phase, and as quickly to the analysis process. Basically less is more, and you do not want to add more to the main directory as you begin to approach version 1.0. So ideally what would be nice is to have one build script - let's call it `build` - that reads a `config/build` directory - and does the following:. 1. Analyzes hidden build-generated files under `.build/...`, and detects if the `prereq` and `build-and-test` phases have been successfully processed. Otherwise, it would report back to the user the build status, and query the user with a recommendation on the next required step to run. For example:. ```; $ build status. Checking DeepVariant build prerequisites... OK; Checking DeepVariant test environment compatibility [GPU]... OK; Checking DeepVariant build binaries... MISSING. Proceed with building binaries [Y/n]?. ```. 2. Once the builds have been successfully completed, then it would tell the user the available options to run (i.e. `make_examples`, `call_variants`, `postprocess_variants`, `pkrusche/hap.py`, etc.) as well as any analysis that has been completed if a `results` or `analysis-results` folder is present. 3.

",True,"The content discusses a high-level system design for DeepVariant, focusing on flexibility and adaptability. It mentions architectural elements like: 

* **Parameter Processor:** A component that maps between different parameter sets, enabling flexibility in model training and usage.
* **Model Training Process:**  Describes a turn-key training process with metadata capture, allowing users to query information about trained models and their parameters.
* **Community Engagement:** Encourages model sharing and collaboration within the community.

""Hi Andrew,. I think we are in perfect agreement. Supporting what the community wants is my preferred approach as well. I was only suggesting it after having performed a reduction upon the functional set of DeepVariant's design. Just in case the community requires more variety of labeled inputs, having a parameter processor might help in mapping between DeepVariant's core operation and different parameter sets. This would create flexibility for both the goals of the design team and community. For example, the design team might want flexibility in playing around with different transformations of read signals and parameter search spaces - which might change over time or with different data sets - without worrying that the parameter list might require updating. Let's take the following simplified model optimization:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/f7c33960-59fc-45c9-9cdd-0f015ebd1aae). The team would let this model optimize itself to determine the parameter set under which it performs ideally. Then metadata about the training would be saved along with the optimized model. Then users can query the model's metadata via some program, which would provide information about the training data and parameters limits for different model types. Such metadata would be automatically populated through the model training step (where I'm including the validation and tuning steps). Based on that, a default set of parameters can be auto-generated for general users, and advanced users can then map their custom parameters however they want. It basically makes the training turn-key and usage automatic. Such training could even be remotely initiated through a browser, and different users can make some of their models available to others if they want, thus helping out the community and growing it at the same time. This would also make adapting new models much faster, including where a large set of specialized ensemble models might be required to check against. Be""

The proposed solution of injecting state using `RStatus` objects suggests an attempt to address this concern by introducing a more structured approach to state propagation. \n* **Code organization and dependencies:** The example call stack illustrates how different functions and modules interact, hinting at the overall system structure. The analysis of which function might be responsible for handling errors (`ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()`, `ROOT::RNetFile::Read()`, etc.) reveals insights into the intended design and dependencies between these components.  \n\nWhile the content focuses on a specific code example, the underlying discussion revolves around architectural choices and their impact on system behavior and maintainability.",root-project/root/v6-32-06,"

",True,"The content discusses the evolution of RooFit from an application to a library and the implications for its behavior.  This touches upon architectural concerns: 

* **Architectural Style:** The shift from an application to a library represents a change in architectural style.
* **Dependencies:** The mention of 'other libraries or applications are built upon' highlights dependency relationships, a core architectural concern.
* **Quality Attributes:** The author emphasizes the library's 'success' being measured by its unobtrusive integration into other systems. This speaks to maintainability and potentially scalability as quality attributes.

# Content to Analyze
""I generally expect libraries to be silent and applications to write log files. If an application uses a dozen libraries, users don't want to see a dozen banners scroll past their terminal whenever they run it. A mark of a library's success is when it gets into the infrastructure in ways that downstream users might not even know about. If that's the goal here—for RooFit to be a library that other libraries or applications are built upon—then it shouldn't print its banner on startup. Although RooFit's API was designed with data analysts in mind (i.e. as an application), in recent years it has de-facto become a library with the likes of HistFactory, Combine, and lots of mini-frameworks built on top of it. If it were me, I would take that as a good sign and embrace it by becoming more library-like. (I have the same opinion of FastJet's banner, but that's another story.)""

",True,"This content discusses architectural concerns related to thread safety and potential deadlocks in a software system. 

Here's why:

* **Deadlock Analysis:** The author is explicitly analyzing the possibility of deadlocks arising from shared library loading within their system.
* **Locking Mechanisms:**  The discussion revolves around different locking strategies (e.g., wrapping `dlopen`, acquiring locks around specific code paths) to prevent deadlocks, highlighting architectural choices related to concurrency control.
* **System-Level Impact:** The author considers the broader impact of these decisions on the system's stability and maintainability, referencing the difficulty in tracking down a previous bug due to opaque interactions between shared libraries and core components. This points to an awareness of architectural implications.
* **Architectural Trade-offs:**  The author acknowledges trade-offs involved in potential solutions (e.g., adding locking within `TClassTable` might unintentionally interfere with other protected resources). This demonstrates a consideration of architectural design decisions and their consequences.",root-project/root/v6-32-06,"

For each library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so"" provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""... ; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1. The lookup for ""f"" finds and runs the materializer for ""f"".; 2.2.2. The materializer for ""f"" reaches JITLink, which tries to resolve symbol ""x"". There is no work to trigger (we started materializing it already in (2.1)), so the link is suspended pending resolution of ""x"". Critically, the dlopen cannot complete u""
