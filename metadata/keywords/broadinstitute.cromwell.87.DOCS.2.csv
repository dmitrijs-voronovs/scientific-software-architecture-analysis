https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md:55,Availability,avail,available,55,"In order to run a workflow, Cromwell uses the backends available to it to create jobs and monitor them until they are complete. When no new jobs can start and all jobs have finished (Success, Failure, Aborted), the workflow terminates. In an ideal situation, all jobs succeed and the workflow succeeds.; Unfortunately things don't always go as planned. Here is what to expect from Cromwell when things go off the rails. ## Failure Modes. Cromwell supports two failure modes, which specify how Cromwell behaves when a job fails during the execution of a workflow. * `NoNewCalls` **(default)** ; 	* Cromwell does not start any new call as soon as a job fails. Cromwell will still monitor the rest of the jobs until they complete (successfully or not). ; * `ContinueWhilePossible` ; 	* Cromwell attempts to run as many jobs as possible until no more can be started. When all running jobs are complete, the workflow fails. The failure mode can be set in the [Configuration](../Configuring/) or [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview#workflow-failure). _For example:_. ![](ABdependency.png).

Cromwell can only ask a backend to abort a job and wait for the backend to notify it when it is aborted. . For example, if you are running Cromwell on the Google backend and abort a job, Google will send an abort request to the Google Pipelines API. When Pipelines API indicates that the status of the job is aborted, Cromwell will mark it as such.; Remember that abort action is entirely dependent on the backend. In this particular case, Pipelines API does not guarantee the success of an abort request (see [Pipelines API documentation on abort](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/reference/rest/v1alpha2/operations/cancel)). You'll also notice that the workflow is finalized even though being aborted.; Finalization is the last step in the execution of a workflow and a chance for each backend to do some work before the workflow is terminated.; Backends won't be denied the chance to finalize the workflow even if it's being aborted. _Note that by the time the backend is asked to abort a job, the job may have succeeded or failed already.

This logic is implemented using [Akka Coordinated Shutdown Extension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown). Currently Cromwell is running [version 2.5.4](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.4/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown).; It comes with a set of pre-defined phases, that can be added on and modified. Those phases can be linked together to form a Graph. Cromwell shutdown graphs looks as such:. ![Scaladoc](CromwellShutdownProcess.png). Pre-defined but unused phases have been omitted (cluster related phases for example that are irrelevant in Cromwell). You'll notice the presence of a `PhaseAbortAllWorkflows` phase. This phase is at the same level as the `PhaseServiceRequestsDone` phase which corresponds to our step #3 above.; The reason for a specific abort phase is so that its timeout can be configured differently than the normal shutdown phase. Indeed, stopping all workflows and aborting them is very similar from an outside perspective. We send a message (resp. ""Stop"" and ""Abort"") and wait for a response.

This section explains what that entails. When aborting a workflow, either through the `/abort` endpoint or by terminating the [Cromwell run process](../Modes) (if [configured](../Configuring#abort) to do so), Cromwell does the following:. 1. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborting`,; 2. Does not start any new jobs,; 3. Asks every running job to abort,; 4. Waits for all running jobs to complete,; 5. Finalizes the workflow,; 6. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborted`. The action of aborting a job is backend specific. Cromwell can only ask a backend to abort a job and wait for the backend to notify it when it is aborted. . For example, if you are running Cromwell on the Google backend and abort a job, Google will send an abort request to the Google Pipelines API. When Pipelines API indicates that the status of the job is aborted, Cromwell will mark it as such.; Remember that abort action is entirely dependent on the backend. In this particular case, Pipelines API does not guarantee the success of an abort request (see [Pipelines API documentation on abort](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/reference/rest/v1alpha2/operations/cancel)).",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md

If the workflow was in state `Aborting`, Cromwell will ask all running jobs to abort again. No new jobs will be started. Once all jobs have been reconnected to, the workflow will keep running normally. During the reconnection process Cromwell might ask backends to reconnect to jobs that were never started before the restart. In that case, the job will be mark as failed with an explanation message. This failure is benign and only an artifact of the fact that Cromwell was restarted. ; If the backend does not support reconnection to an existing job, jobs will be marked as failed with an explanation message as well. The backend status of the jobs will be ""Unknown"". ## Graceful Shutdown. When Cromwell is run as a server, it will by default attempt to gracefully shutdown, stopping its different services in a specific order to avoid losing critical data.; This behavior, documented below, can be turned off in the configuration via `system.graceful-server-shutdown = false`. Upon receiving a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` signal, the JVM will initiate its shutdown process. Prior to this Cromwell will attempt to shutdown its own services in the following way:. 1. Workflows in `Submitted` state are no longer started; 2. Cromwell unbinds from the address/port it was listening on. From this point the Cromwell server is unreachable via the endpoints.; 3. All actors generating data that needs to be persisted receive a message asking them to gracefully stop.; This means that they are given some time (see below for how much and how to change it) to return to a known ""consistent"" state.; For example, an actor waiting for a response from the database before sending information to the metadata will wait for that response before shutting itself down.; 4.

Upon receiving a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` signal, the JVM will initiate its shutdown process. Prior to this Cromwell will attempt to shutdown its own services in the following way:. 1. Workflows in `Submitted` state are no longer started; 2. Cromwell unbinds from the address/port it was listening on. From this point the Cromwell server is unreachable via the endpoints.; 3. All actors generating data that needs to be persisted receive a message asking them to gracefully stop.; This means that they are given some time (see below for how much and how to change it) to return to a known ""consistent"" state.; For example, an actor waiting for a response from the database before sending information to the metadata will wait for that response before shutting itself down.; 4.

All actors responsible for data persistence are in turn being asked to gracefully shutdown. ; For example, all queued up metadata writes are executed.; 6. Database connection pools are shutdown.; 7. Actor system shuts down.; 8. JVM exits.; ; This multi-stage process is designed to minimize the risk of data loss during shutdown. However in order to prevent this process from lasting forever, each stage (called phase) has its own timeout.; If the phase does not complete within the given timeout, actors will be forcefully stopped and the next phase will start. This logic is implemented using [Akka Coordinated Shutdown Extension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown). Currently Cromwell is running [version 2.5.4](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.4/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown).; It comes with a set of pre-defined phases, that can be added on and modified. Those phases can be linked together to form a Graph. Cromwell shutdown graphs looks as such:. ![Scaladoc](CromwellShutdownProcess.png). Pre-defined but unused phases have been omitted (cluster related phases for example that are irrelevant in Cromwell). You'll notice the presence of a `PhaseAbortAllWorkflows` phase. This phase is at the same level as the `PhaseServiceRequestsDone` phase which corresponds to our step #3 above.; The reason for a specific abort phase is so that its timeout can be configured differently than the normal shutdown phase. Indeed, stopping all workflows and aborting them is very similar from an outside perspective. We send a message (resp. ""Stop"" and ""Abort",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md

When no new jobs can start and all jobs have finished (Success, Failure, Aborted), the workflow terminates. In an ideal situation, all jobs succeed and the workflow succeeds.; Unfortunately things don't always go as planned. Here is what to expect from Cromwell when things go off the rails. ## Failure Modes. Cromwell supports two failure modes, which specify how Cromwell behaves when a job fails during the execution of a workflow. * `NoNewCalls` **(default)** ; 	* Cromwell does not start any new call as soon as a job fails. Cromwell will still monitor the rest of the jobs until they complete (successfully or not). ; * `ContinueWhilePossible` ; 	* Cromwell attempts to run as many jobs as possible until no more can be started. When all running jobs are complete, the workflow fails. The failure mode can be set in the [Configuration](../Configuring/) or [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview#workflow-failure). _For example:_. ![](ABdependency.png). This simple diagram represents 4 jobs:. * Job A and Job B are independent; ; * Job A1 depends on A; ; * Job B1 depends on B. Let's look at the case where A and B are both running, and for some reason B fails (shaded red). **`NoNewCalls`** ; If the failure mode is `NoNewCalls` Cromwell waits for A to complete (shaded green). Regardless of whether A is successful or not, Cromwell then fails the workflow, without starting A1 or B1 (shaded grey). ![](NNC_B_fail.png). **`ContinueWhilePossible`** ; If the failure mode is `ContinueWhilePossible` and A succeeds (green), then Cromwell starts A1 (green) and waits for it to complete. At this point all jobs that can run have completed. B1 (grey) cannot run since B failed (red), therefore Cromwell fails the workflow without starting B1. ![](CWP_B_fail.png). ### Retryable failures. Retryable failures are **not** failures that can trigger a workflow failure. An example of a retryable failure is when a [preemptible VM](../RuntimeAttributes/#preemptible) is preempted. .

It is **not** sufficient to simply omit a filesystem from your stanza. . For example: adding this to your configuration file will remove the `http` filesystem and leave `local` for use in the ; engine:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; http {; enabled: false; }; }; }; ```. Whereas this example will leave `http` unchanged and merely re-assert the default enabling of `local`. In other; words, **this will do nothing**:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; local {; enabled: true; }; }; }; ```. ### Backend Filesystems. Similarly to the engine, you can also configure backend filesystems individually. Some backends might require the use of a specific filesystem.; For example, the [Pipelines API](../tutorials/PipelinesApi101.md) backend requires Google Cloud Storage.; Let's take another example:. ```wdl; version 1.0. task my_pipelines_task {; input {; File input_file; }; String content = read_string(input_file); ; command {; echo ~{content}; }; ; runtime {; docker: ""ubuntu""; }; }; workflow my_workflow {; call my_pipelines_task { input: input_file = ""gs://mybucket/my_file.txt"" }; }; ```. Suppose this workflow is submitted to a Cromwell running a Pipelines API backend. This time the `read_string` function is in the context of a task run by the backend.; The filesystem configuration used will be the one in the `config` section of the Pipelines API backend. ### Supported Filesystems. - Shared File System (SFS). - Google Cloud Storage (GCS) - [Cromwell Doc](GoogleCloudStorage.md) / [Google Doc](https://cloud.google.com/storage/). - Simple Storage Service (S3) - [Amazon Doc](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/). - HTTP - support for `http` or `https` URLs for [workflow inputs only](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/filesystems/HTTP). - File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - [Cromwell Doc](FileTransferProtocol.md); ",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/filesystems/Filesystems.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/Filesystems.md

Also, currently it works only with [GCS filesystem](../GoogleCloudStorage) in [PapiV2 backend](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/backends/Google).**. Also note that the local filesystem (the one on which Cromwell runs on) is implicitly accessible but can be disabled. ; To do so, add the following to any `filesystems` stanza in which the local filesystem should be disabled: `local.enabled: false`. ### Engine Filesystems. Cromwell is conceptually divided in an engine part and a backend part. One Cromwell instance corresponds to an ""engine"" but can have multiple backends configured.; The `engine.filesystems` section configures filesystems that Cromwell can use when it needs to interact with files outside of the context of a backend.

Some backends might require the use of a specific filesystem.; For example, the [Pipelines API](../tutorials/PipelinesApi101.md) backend requires Google Cloud Storage.; Let's take another example:. ```wdl; version 1.0. task my_pipelines_task {; input {; File input_file; }; String content = read_string(input_file); ; command {; echo ~{content}; }; ; runtime {; docker: ""ubuntu""; }; }; workflow my_workflow {; call my_pipelines_task { input: input_file = ""gs://mybucket/my_file.txt"" }; }; ```. Suppose this workflow is submitted to a Cromwell running a Pipelines API backend. This time the `read_string` function is in the context of a task run by the backend.; The filesystem configuration used will be the one in the `config` section of the Pipelines API backend. ### Supported Filesystems. - Shared File System (SFS). - Google Cloud Storage (GCS) - [Cromwell Doc](GoogleCloudStorage.md) / [Google Doc](https://cloud.google.com/storage/). - Simple Storage ",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/filesystems/Filesystems.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/Filesystems.md

Cromwell supports communication with basic FTP servers (not FTPS, and not SFTP either).; Please read the [#Filesystems](Filesystems.md) section before to get an explanation of how filesystems can be configured in general.; For a full example of FTP configuration see [here](#Example). **Note**: Be aware that FTP is in many cases very inefficient, not secure and generally doesn't scale well. If possible, consider using an alternate file system. ## Overview. Cromwell handles FTP connections as follows:. - Cromwell maintains one FTP FileSystem per FTP server per user; - An FTP FileSystem maintains a pool of connections with a fixed size (see `max-connection-per-server-per-user` configuration below) to that server, for that user; - When an FTP FileSystem hasn't been used in a certain amount of time (see `cache-ttl` configuration below), the associated connections are closed and it is destroyed; - In a given pool, when a connection has been idle for a certain amount of time (see `idle-connection-timeout` configuration below), it is closed. ```; Cromwell; +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+; | |; | FileSystem 1 FileSystem 2 FileSystem 3 |; | +-----------------------------+ +-----------------------------+ +-----------------------------+ |; | | | | | | | |; | | ftp://user1@server1.com | | ftp://user2@server1.com | | ftp://user1@server2.com | |; | | | | | | | |; | | Connection Pool | | Connection Pool | | Connection Pool | |; | | +-------------------------+ | | +-------------------------+ | | +-------------------------+ | |; | | | | | | | | | | | | | |; | | | - Connection 1 | | | | - Connection 1 | | | | - Connection 1 | | |; | | | | | | | | | | | | | |; | | | - Connection 2 | | | | - Connection 2 | | | | - Connection 2 | | |; | | | | | | | | | | | | | |; | | | - Connection 3 | | | | - Connection 3 | | | | - Connection 3 | | |; | | | | | | | | | | | | | |; | | +-------------------",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/filesystems/FileTransferProtocol.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/FileTransferProtocol.md

It allows the user to save intermediates of a task at regularly scheduled checkpoints.

Specifying a `checkpointFile` value in a task's `runtime` section designates a checkpoint file which will periodically be; copied to cloud storage every 10 minutes. This checkpoint file will then be restored automatically on subsequent attempts if the job is interrupted. Once the final output has been successfully generated, the checkpoint file will be deleted.

These costs should be minor, especially balanced against the performance and cost benefits of being able to restore from the checkpoint when a worker VM gets preempted. Since the checkpoint file is deleted after successful completion of the task, no further charges will accrue after completion. However, if the task is aborted or otherwise stopped externally, ie through interruption of Cromwell's operation, the checkpoint file will NOT be deleted and storage charges will continue to accrue indefinitely, or until the file is deleted manually. . ### Effect on Call Caching.

Specifying a `checkpointFile` value in a task's `runtime` section designates a checkpoint file which will periodically be; copied to cloud storage every 10 minutes.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/optimizations/FileLocalization.md:1993,Performance,optimiz,optimization,1993,"r. ## Scope. The 'localization_optional' optimization can be applied to a task's individual input declarations containing files, specifically `File` and `File?` values and any complex types containing them. ; It allows you to save time and money by identifying files which do not need to be localized for the task to succeed. ## Condition. The optimization signals to Cromwell that a task has been written in such a way that:; ; * The task **will work** if Cromwell does localize the specified file inputs; * For example if a file is localized for a local dockerized execution environment. **And**:. * The task will **also** work if Cromwell **does not** localize the same file input; * For example the file remains in a cloud object store and the command is constructed using its URL rather than a local path. ## Effect on File Localization. If the [backend](#backend-support) has been set up to respect `localization_optional`, Cromwell will ; choose not to localize the appropriate file input. ### Effect on Call Caching:. None! . Files marked for optional localization are still treated in exactly the same way as other `File` inputs for call caching. ## Language Support. ### WDL 1.0 (or later). In a WDL 1.0 `task`, this optimization is specified by adding a `localization_optional` field to ; an input's entry in the task's `parameter_meta` section. Here's an example:. ```wdl; task nio_task {; input {; File foo_file; File bar_file; }; ; parameter_meta {; foo_file: {; description: ""a foo file"",; localization_optional: true; }; bar_file: {; description: ""a bar file""; }; }; ; command <<<; # This tool must work for **BOTH** local file paths **AND** object store URL values:; java -jar my_tool_1.jar ~{foo_file}; ; # Because the optimization is not applied to 'bar_file' in parameter_meta, this file **WILL** be localized:; java -jar my_tool_2.jar ~{bar_file}; >>>; }; ```. ## Backend Support.

To create all the resources for running a Cromwell server on AWS using CloudFormation, launch the [Cromwell Full Stack Deployment](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/orchestration/cromwell/cromwell-overview/). Alternatively, this page will walk through the specific steps to configure and run a local Cromwell server using AWS Batch. 1.

[Outputs](#outputs). #### Authenticating a local Cromwell server with AWS. The easiest way to allow a local Cromwell server to talk to AWS is to:. 1. Install the AWS CLI through Amazon's [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).; 2. [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) by calling `aws configure` (provide your `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key` when prompted). Cromwell can access these credentials through the default authentication provider. For more options, see the [Configuring authentication of Cromwell with AWS](/backends/AWSBatch#configuring-authentication) section below. #### Configuring the AWS environment. Next you'll need the following setup in your AWS account:; - The core set of resources (S3 Bucket, IAM Roles, AWS Batch); - Custom Compute Resource (Launch Template or AMI) with Cromwell Additions. Information and instructions to setup an AWS environment to work properly with Cromwell can be found on [AWS for Genomics Workflow](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/core-env/introduction/).

Install the AWS CLI through Amazon's [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).; 2. [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) by calling `aws configure` (provide your `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key` when prompted). Cromwell can access these credentials through the default authentication provider. For more options, see the [Configuring authentication of Cromwell with AWS](/backends/AWSBatch#configuring-authentication) section below. #### Configuring the AWS environment. Next you'll need the following setup in your AWS account:; - The core set of resources (S3 Bucket, IAM Roles, AWS Batch); - Custom Compute Resource (Launch Template or AMI) with Cromwell Additions. Information and instructions to setup an AWS environment to work properly with Cromwell can be found on [AWS for Genomics Workflow](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/core-env/introduction/). By deploying the CloudFormation templates provided by AWS, the stack will output the S3 bucket name and two AWS Batch queue ARNs (default and high-priority) used in the Cromwell configuration. #### Configuring Cromwell. Now we're going to configure Cromwell to use the AWS resources we just created by updating a `*.conf` file to use the `AWSBackend` at runtime. This requires three pieces of information:. - The [AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) where yo",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/AwsBatch101.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/AwsBatch101.md

For more information about this configuration or how to change the behaviour of AWS Batch, visit the [AWS Backend](/backends/AWSBatch) page. #### Workflow Source Files . Lastly, create an example workflow to run. We're going to define a simple workflow that will `echo` a string to the console and return the result to Cromwell. Within AWS Batch (like other cloud providers), we're required to specify a Docker container for every task. ##### `hello.wdl`. ```wdl; task hello {; String addressee = ""Cromwell""; command {; echo ""Hello ${addressee}! Welcome to Cromwell . . . on AWS!""; }; output {; String message = read_string(stdout()); }; runtime {; docker: ""ubuntu:latest""; }; }. workflow wf_hello {; call hello; output { hello.message }; }; ```. #### Running Cromwell and AWS . Provided all of the files are within the same directory, we can run our workflow with the following command:. > **Note**: You might have a different Cromwell version number here. ```bash; java -Dconfig.file=aws.conf -jar cromwell-36.jar run hello.wdl; ```. This will:; 1. Start Cromwell in `run` mode,; 2. Prepare `hello.wdl` as a job and submit this to your AWS Batch queue. You can monitor the job within your [AWS Batch dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/batch/home).; 3. Run the job, write execution files back to S3, and report progress back to Cromwell. #### Outputs. The end of your workflow logs should report the workflow outputs. ```; [info] SingleWorkflowRunnerActor workflow finished with status 'Succeeded'.; {; ""outputs"": {; ""wf_hello.hello.message"": ""Hello World!

This tutorial page relies on completing the previous tutorials:. * [Five Minute Introduction](FiveMinuteIntro.md). ### Goals. At the end of this tutorial you'll have set up a configuration file for Cromwell and used it to modify Cromwell's behavior. ### Let's get started. #### Customizing Cromwell with Configuration Files. When Cromwell runs, it contains a large number of default options useful for getting started. For example, by default Cromwell doesn't require an external database while running all workflow jobs on your local machine. Soon you may want to start storing the results of your Cromwell runs in an external MySQL database. Or, you may want to run jobs on your organizations compute farm, or even run jobs in the cloud via the Pipelines API. All of these changes to the defaults will be done by setting configuration values. When you have many configuration settings you would like to set, you specify them in a custom configuration file. See the [configuration](../Configuring) page for more specific information on the configuration file, and for links to the example configuration file. #### Configuration file syntax. Cromwell configuration files are written in a syntax called HOCON.

Once you have created a new configuration file, you can pass the path to Cromwell by setting the system property `config.file`:. ```bash; java -Dconfig.file=/path/to/your.conf -jar cromwell-[VERSION].jar server; ```. Cromwell should start up as normal. As you haven't actually overridden any values yet, Cromwell should be running with the same settings. #### Setting a configuration value. To override a configuration value, you can specify new values in your configuration file. For example, say you want to change the default port that cromwell listens from `8000` to `8080`. In your config file you can set:. ```hocon; # below the include line from before; webservice {; port = 8080; }; ```. When you then run Cromwell updated config file, cromwell will now be listening on 8080 or 8000. #### Finding more configuration properties. In addition to the common configuration properties listed on the [configuration](../Configuring) page, there are also a large number of example configuration stanzas commented in [cromwell.examples.conf][cromwell-examples-conf], and; backend provider examples in [cromwell.example.backends][cromwell-examples-folder].

When Cromwell runs, it contains a large number of default options useful for getting started. For example, by default Cromwell doesn't require an external database while running all workflow jobs on your local machine.

See the [configuration](../Configuring) page for more specific information on the configuration file, and for links to the example configuration file. #### Configuration file syntax.

For example, by default Cromwell doesn't require an external database while running all workflow jobs on your local machine. Soon you may want to start storing the results of your Cromwell runs in an external MySQL database. Or, you may want to run jobs on your organizations compute farm, or even run jobs in the cloud via the Pipelines API. All of these changes to the defaults will be done by setting configuration values. When you have many configuration settings you would like to set, you specify them in a custom configuration file. See the [configuration](../Configuring) page for more specific information on the configuration file, and for links to the example configuration file. #### Configuration file syntax. Cromwell configuration files are written in a syntax called HOCON. See the [HOCON documentation](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation) for more information on all the ways one can create a valid configuration file. #### Creating your first configuration file.

At the end of this tutorial, you'll become familiar with container technologies and how to configure Cromwell to use these independently, or with job schedulers. ### Specifying Containers in your Workflow. Containers are specified on a per-task level, this can be achieved in WDL by specifying a [`docker`](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/master/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#docker) tag in the `runtime` section. For example, the following script should run in the `ubuntu:latest` container:. ```wdl; task hello_world {; String name = ""World""; command {; echo 'Hello, ${name}'; }; output {; File out = stdout(); }; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu:latest'; }; }. workflow hello {; call hello_world; }; ```. ### Docker. [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a popular container technology that is natively supported by Cromwell and WDL. #### Docker on a Local Backend. On a single machine (laptop or server), no extra configuration is needed to allow docker to run, provided Docker is installed. You can install Docker for Linux, Mac or Windows from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community). #### Docker on Cloud. It is strongly advised that you provide a Docker image to tasks that will run on Cloud backends, and in fact most Cloud providers require it. It might be possible to use an alternative container engine, but this is not recommended if Docker is supported. #### Docker on HPC. Docker can allow running users to gain superuser privileges, called the [Docker daemon attack surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docke",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md

To run Singularity on a job scheduler, the singularity command needs to be passed to the scheduler as a wrapped command. For example, in SLURM, we can use the normal SLURM configuration as explained in the [SLURM documentation](../backends/SLURM), however we'll add a `submit-docker` block to execute when a task is tagged with a docker container. . When constructing this block, there are a few things to keep in mind:; - Make sure Singularity is loaded (and in PATH). If `module` is installed for ; example you can call `module load Singularity`. If the cluster admin has made; a Singularity module available. Alternatively you can alter the `PATH` ; variable directly or simply use `/path/to/singularity` ; directly in the config.; - We should treat worker nodes as if they do not have stable access to the ; internet or build access, so we will pull the container before the task is ; submit to the cluster.; - It's a good idea to use a Singularity cache so that same images should only; have to be pulled once. Make sure you set the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` ; environment variable to a location on the filesystem that is reachable by the; worker nodes!; - If we are using a cache we need to ensure that submit processes started by; Cromwell do not pull to the same cache at the same time. This may corrupt the; cache. We can prevent this by implementing a filelock with `flock` and ; pulling the image before the job is submitted.

Nb: By disabling hash-lookup, call caching will not work for any container using a floating tag. #### Docker Root; If you want to change the root directory inside your containers, where the task places input and output files, you can edit the following option:. ```; backend {; providers {; LocalExample {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; ; # Root directory where Cromwell writes job results in the container.

When choosing the image version for your pipeline stages, it is highly recommended that you use a hash rather than a tag, for the sake of reproducibility; For example, in WDL, you could do this:; ```wdl; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu:latest'; }; ```.

This `rc` file is generated as part of the `script` within the execution directory, where the script is assembled at runtime. This is important as if the script executes successfully but the container doesn't terminate, Cromwell will continue the execution of the workflow and the container will persist hogging system resources. Within the configurations above:; - `singularity`: The exec mode does not run a container on the background. #### Cromwell: Run-in-background. By enabling Cromwell's run-in-background mode, you remove the necessity for the `kill`, `check-alive` and `job-id-regex` blocks, which disables some safety checks when running workflows:. - If there is an error starting the container or executing the script, Cromwell may not recognise this error and hang. For example, this may occur if the container attempts to exceed its allocated resources (runs out of memory); the container daemon may terminate the container without completing the script.; - If you abort the workflow (by attempting to close Cromwell or issuing an abort command), Cromwell does not have a reference to the container execution and will not be able to terminate the container. This is only necessary in local environments where there is no job manager to control this, however if your container technology can emit an identifier to stdout, then you are able to remove the run-in-background flag. . ### Next Steps.

Containers are specified on a per-task level, this can be achieved in WDL by specifying a [`docker`](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/master/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#docker) tag in the `runtime` section. For example, the following script should run in the `ubuntu:latest` container:. ```wdl; task hello_world {; String name = ""World""; command {; echo 'Hello, ${name}'; }; output {; File out = stdout(); }; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu:latest'; }; }. workflow hello {; call hello_world; }; ```. ### Docker. [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a popular container technology that is natively supported by Cromwell and WDL. #### Docker on a Local Backend. On a single machine (laptop or server), no extra configuration is needed to allow docker to run, provided Docker is installed. You can install Docker for Linux, Mac or Windows from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community). #### Docker on Cloud. It is strongly advised that you provide a Docker image to tasks that will run on Cloud backends, and in fact most Cloud providers require it. It might be possible to use an alternative container engine, but this is not recommended if Docker is supported. #### Docker on HPC. Docker can allow running users to gain superuser privileges, called the [Docker daemon attack surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface).

For example, this may occur if the container attempts to exceed its allocated resources (runs out of memory); the container daemon may terminate the container without completing the script.; - If you abort the workflow (by attempting to close Cromwell or issuing an abort command), Cromwell does not have a reference to the container execution and will not be able to terminate the container.

At the end of this tutorial, you'll become familiar with container technologies and how to configure Cromwell to use these independently, or with job schedulers. ### Specifying Containers in your Workflow. Containers are specified on a per-task level, this can be achieved in WDL by specifying a [`docker`](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/master/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#docker) tag in the `runtime` section. For example, the following script should run in the `ubuntu:latest` container:. ```wdl; task hello_world {; String name = ""World""; command {; echo 'Hello, ${name}'; }; output {; File out = stdout(); }; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu:latest'; }; }. workflow hello {; call hello_world; }; ```. ### Docker. [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a popular container technology that is natively supported by Cromwell and WDL. #### Docker on a Local Backend. On a single machine (laptop or server), no extra configuration is needed to allow docker to run, provided Docker is installed. You can install Docker for Linux, Mac or Windows from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search/",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md

If you are not able to get Singularity installed with these privileges, you can attempt a user install.; If this is the case, you will have to alter your Cromwell configuration to work in ""sandbox"" mode, which is explained in [this part](#without-setuid) of the documentation. . #### Configuring Cromwell for Singularity. Once Singularity is installed, you'll need to modify the `config` block inside `backend.providers` in your Cromwell configuration. In particular, this block contains a key called `submit-docker`, which will contain a script that is run whenever a job needs to run that uses a Docker image. If the job does not specify a Docker image, the regular `submit` block will be used. As the configuration will require more knowledge about your execution environment, see the local and job scheduler sections below for example configurations. ##### Local environments. On local backends, you have to configure Cromwell to use a different ; `submit-docker` script that would start Singularity instead of docker. ; Singularity requires docker images to be prefixed with the prefix `docker://`. Using containers isolates the filesystem that the script is allowed to interact with, for that reason we'll bind in the current working directory as `${docker_cwd}`, and we'll use the container-specific script path `${docker_script}`. . An example submit script for Singularity is:; ```bash; singularity exec --containall --bind ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} docker://${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}; ```. As the `Singularity exec` command does not emit a job-id, we must include the `run-in-background` tag within the the provider section in addition to the docker-submit script. As Cromwell watches for the existence of the `rc` file, the `run-in-background` option has ",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md

This `rc` file is generated as part of the `script` within the execution directory, where the script is assembled at runtime. This is important as if the script executes successfully but the container doesn't terminate, Cromwell will continue the execution of the workflow and the container will persist hogging system resources. Within the configurations above:; - `singularity`: The exec mode does not run a container on the background. #### Cromwell: Run-in-background. By enabling Cromwell's run-in-background mode, you remove the necessity for the `kill`, `check-alive` and `job-id-regex` blocks, which disables some safety checks when running workflows:. - If there is an error starting the container or executing the script, Cromwell may not recognise this error and hang. For example, this may occur if the container attempts to exceed its allocated resources (runs out of memory); the container daemon may terminate the container without completing the script.; - If you abort the workflow (by attempting to close Cromwell or issuing an abort command), Cromwell does not have a reference to the container execution and will not be able to terminate the container. This is only necessary in local environments where there is no job manager to control this, however if your container technology can emit an identifier to stdout, then you are able to remove the run-in-background flag. . ### Next Steps.

However, if you are sharing your Docker images with other users or have limited space in your user directory, you can redirect this caching location by exporting the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` variable in your `.bashrc` or at the start of the `submit-docker` block.; ```; export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/path/to/shared/cache; ```. For further information on the Singularity Cache, refer to the [Singularity 2 caching documentation](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/build_environment.html#cache-folders) (this hasn't yet been updated for Singularity 3). ___. ### udocker. [udocker](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker) is a tool designed to ""execute simple docker containers in user space without requiring root privileges"". In essence, udocker provides a command line interface that mimics `docker`, and implements the commands using one of four different container backends:. * PRoot; * Fakechroot; * runC; * Singularity. #### Installation; udocker can be installed without any kind of root permissions. Refer to udocker's installation documentation [here](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/doc/installation_manual.md) for more information. #### Configuration. (As of [2019-02-18](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/issues/112)) udocker does not support looking up docker container by digests, hence you'll have to make ensure `hash-lookup` is disabled. Refer to [this section](#docker-digests) for more detail. To configure `udocker` to work in a local environment, you must tag the provider's configuration to `run-in-background` and update the `submit-docker` to use udocker:; ```; run-in-background = true; submit-docker = """"""; udocker run -v ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} ${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}; """"""; ```.

Containers are specified on a per-task level, this can be achieved in WDL by specifying a [`docker`](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/master/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#docker) tag in the `runtime` section. For example, the following script should run in the `ubuntu:latest` container:. ```wdl; task hello_world {; String name = ""World""; command {; echo 'Hello, ${name}'; }; output {; File out = stdout(); }; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu:latest'; }; }. workflow hello {; call hello_world; }; ```. ### Docker.

Once Singularity is installed, you'll need to modify the `config` block inside `backend.providers` in your Cromwell configuration. In particular, this block contains a key called `submit-docker`, which will contain a script that is run whenever a job needs to run that uses a Docker image. If the job does not specify a Docker image, the regular `submit` block will be used. As the configuration will require more knowledge about your execution environment, see the local and job scheduler sections below for example configurations. ##### Local environments.

You can find the `sha256` of an image using `docker images --digests`; ; ; ### Notes. #### How does Cromwell know when a job or container has completed?; Cromwell uses the presence of the `rc` (returncode) file to determine whether a task has succeeded or failed. This `rc` file is generated as part of the `script` within the execution directory, where the script is assembled at runtime. This is important as if the script executes successfully but the container doesn't terminate, Cromwell will continue the execution of the workflow and the container will persist hogging system resources. Within the configurations above:; - `singularity`: The exec mode does not run a container on the background. #### Cromwell: Run-in-background. By enabling Cromwell's run-in-background mode, you remove the necessity for the `kill`, `check-alive` and `job-id-regex` blocks, which disables some safety checks when running workflows:. - If there is an error starting the container or executing the script, Cromwell may not recognise this error and hang. For example, this may occur if the container attempts to exceed its allocated resources (runs out of memory); the container daemon may terminate the container without completing the script.; - If you abort the workflow (by attempting to close Cromwell or issuing an abort command), Cromwell does not have a reference to the container execution and will not be able to terminate the container. This is only necessary in local environments where there is no job manager to control this, however if your container technology can emit an identifier to stdout, then you are able to remove the run-in-backgroun",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md

To run Singularity on a job scheduler, the singularity command needs to be passed to the scheduler as a wrapped command. For example, in SLURM, we can use the normal SLURM configuration as explained in the [SLURM documentation](../backends/SLURM), however we'll add a `submit-docker` block to execute when a task is tagged with a docker container. . When constructing this block, there are a few things to keep in mind:; - Make sure Singularity is loaded (and in PATH). If `module` is installed for ; example you can call `module load Singularity`. If the cluster admin has made; a Singularity module available. Alternatively you can alter the `PATH` ; variable directly or simply use `/path/to/singularity` ; directly in the config.; - We should treat worker nodes as if they do not have stable access to the ; internet or build access, so we will pull the container before the task is ; submit to the cluster.; - It's a good idea to use a Singularity cache so that same images should only; have to be pulled once. Make sure you set the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` ; environment variable to a location on the filesystem that is reachable by the; worker nodes!; - If we are using a cache we need to ensure that submit processes started by; Cromwell do not pull to the same cache at the same time.

This `rc` file is generated as part of the `script` within the execution directory, where the script is assembled at runtime. This is important as if the script executes successfully but the container doesn't terminate, Cromwell will continue the execution of the workflow and the container will persist hogging system resources. Within the configurations above:; - `singularity`: The exec mode does not run a container on the background. #### Cromwell: Run-in-background.

[udocker](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker) is a tool designed to ""execute simple docker containers in user space without requiring root privileges"". In essence, udocker provides a command line interface that mimics `docker`, and implements the commands using one of four different container backends:. * PRoot; * Fakechroot; * runC; * Singularity. #### Installation; udocker can be installed without any kind of root permissions. Refer to udocker's installation documentation [here](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/doc/installation_manual.md) for more information. #### Configuration. (As of [2019-02-18](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/issues/112)) udocker does not support looking up docker container by digests, hence you'll have to make ensure `hash-lookup` is disabled. Refer to [this section](#docker-digests) for more detail. To configure `udocker` to work in a local environment, you must tag the provider's configuration to `run-in-background` and update the `submit-docker` to use udocker:; ```; run-in-background = true; submit-docker = """"""; udocker run -v ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} ${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}; """"""; ```. With a job queue like SLURM, you just need to wrap this script in an `sbatch` submission like we did with Singularity:. ```; submit-docker = """"""; # Pull the image using the head node, in case our workers don't have network access; udocker pull ${docker}; ; sbatch \; -J ${job_name} \; -D ${cwd} \; -o ${cwd}/execution/stdout \; -e ${cwd}/execution/stderr \; -t ${runtime_minutes} \; ${""-c "" + cpus} \; --mem-per-cpu=${requested_memory_mb_per_core} \; --wrap ""udocker run -v ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} ${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}""; """"""; ```. #### Cac",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md

If you are not able to get Singularity installed with these privileges, you can attempt a user install.; If this is the case, you will have to alter your Cromwell configuration to work in ""sandbox"" mode, which is explained in [this part](#without-setuid) of the documentation. . #### Configuring Cromwell for Singularity. Once Singularity is installed, you'll need to modify the `config` block inside `backend.providers` in your Cromwell configuration. In particular, this block contains a key called `submit-docker`, which will contain a script that is run whenever a job needs to run that uses a Docker image. If the job does not specify a Docker image, the regular `submit` block will be used. As the configuration will require more knowledge about your execution environment, see the local and job scheduler sections below for example configurations. ##### Local environments. On local backends, you have to configure Cromwell to use a different ; `submit-docker` script that would start Singularity instead of docker. ; Singularity requires docker images to be prefixed with the prefix `docker://`.

This is important as if the script executes successfully but the container doesn't terminate, Cromwell will continue the execution of the workflow and the container will persist hogging system resources. Within the configurations above:; - `singularity`: The exec mode does not run a container on the background. #### Cromwell: Run-in-background. By enabling Cromwell's run-in-background mode, you remove the necessity for the `kill`, `check-alive` and `job-id-regex` blocks, which disables some safety checks when running workflows:. - If there is an error starting the container or executing the script, Cromwell may not recognise this error and hang. For example, this may occur if the container attempts to exceed its allocated resources (runs out of memory); the container daemon may terminate the container without completing the script.; - If you abort the workflow (by attempting to close Cromwell or issuing an abort command), Cromwell does not have a reference to the container execution and will not be able to terminate the container. This is only necessary in local environments where there is no job manager to control this, however if your container technology can emit an identifier to stdout, then you are able to remove the run-in-background flag. . ### Next Steps.

To run Singularity on a job scheduler, the singularity command needs to be passed to the scheduler as a wrapped command. For example, in SLURM, we can use the normal SLURM configuration as explained in the [SLURM documentation](../backends/SLURM), however we'll add a `submit-docker` block to execute when a task is tagged with a docker container. . When constructing this block, there are a few things to keep in mind:; - Make sure Singularity is loaded (and in PATH). If `module` is installed for ; example you can call `module load Singularity`. If the cluster admin has made; a Singularity module available. Alternatively you can alter the `PATH` ; variable directly or simply use `/path/to/singularity` ; directly in the config.; - We should treat worker nodes as if they do not have stable access to the ; internet or build access, so we will pull the container before the task is ; submit to the cluster.; - It's a good idea to use a Singularity cache so that same images should only; have to be pulled once. Make sure you set the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` ; environment variable to a location on the filesystem that is reachable by the; worker nodes!; - If we are using a cache we need to ensure that submit processes started by; Cromwell do not pull to the same cache at the same time. This may corrupt the; cache. We can prevent this by implementing a filelock with `flock` and ; pulling the image before the job is submitted. The flock and pull command ; needs to be placed *before* the submit command so all pull commands are ; executed on the same node. This is necessary for the filelock to work.; - As mentioned above the `--containall` flag is **important** f",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md

The syntax of this block is the same as defining the inputs for a WDL task. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; }; ```. In the example above, we have defined four different WDL variables defined, `cpu`, `memory_gb`, `sge_queue`, and `sge_project`. Below you will find more information on `cpu` and `memory`, and the ability to add custom runtime attributes like the `sge_queue` and `sge_project`. **cpu**. When you declare a runtime attribute with the name `cpu`, it must be an `Int`. This integer will validated to always be `>= 1`. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; # ...; """"""; }; ```. **memory**. When running a workflow, the memory runtime attribute in the task will specify the units of memory. For example, this jobs specifies that it only needs 512 megabytes of memory when running. ```wdl; task hello {; command { echo hello }; runtime { memory: ""512 MB"" }; }; ```. However, it's possible that when submitting jobs to your HPC cluster you want to specify the units in gigabytes. To specify the memory units that the submit command should use, append the units to the memory runtime attribute. For example:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Float? memory_gb; # ...; """"""; }; ```. Now, no matter what unit of memory is used within the task, the value will be converted into gigabytes before it is passed to your submit command. **custom attributes**. You can also declare other runtime attributes that a WDL task may use. For example, suppose you would like to allow the WDL to specify an sge queue in a task, like:. ```wdl; task hello {; command { echo hello }; runtime { sqe_queue: ""short"" }; }; ```. You declare your runtime attribute in your config by adding any other custom value to the `runtime-attributes` section:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """""";",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md

For example, this jobs specifies that it only needs 512 megabytes of memory when running. ```wdl; task hello {; command { echo hello }; runtime { memory: ""512 MB"" }; }; ```. However, it's possible that when submitting jobs to your HPC cluster you want to specify the units in gigabytes.

You declare your runtime attribute in your config by adding any other custom value to the `runtime-attributes` section:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String? sge_queue; # ...; """"""; }; ```. In this case, we've stated that the `sge_queue` is optional. This allows us to reuse WDLs from other pipeline authors who may not have set an `sge_queue`. Alternatively, you can also set a default for the declared runtime attributes. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String sge_queue = ""short""; # ...; """"""; }; ```. ##### Call Caching based on runtime attributes. The rules for call caching in HPC backends are:; * `docker`: Will be considered when call caching.; * Memory options: Will *not* be considered when call caching.; * CPU options: Will *not* be considered when call caching.; * Custom Attributes: Will *not* be considered when call caching (by default).; ; Although custom attributes",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md

When the job finishes submitting, Cromwell will need to retrieve the job id, so that it can abort the job if necessary. This job should be written to the stdout after submission, where Cromwell will then read the job id. Because the job id may be surrounded by other text, a custom regular expression should capture the actual job id. Because the submit above uses `-terse`, the job id will be the entire contents of the stdout, but should be all digits:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell should abort an HPC job. When aborting an HPC job, Cromwell will run a command confifured under the key `kill`, passing in the WDL variable `job_id`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell checks if an HPC job is alive. Whenever Cromwell restarts it checks to see if a job has completed by searching for return code in a file called `rc`. If this file isn't available, in this case Cromwell runs an extra check to make sure the job is still alive. You can configure the command used for this check via:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### Other backend settings. On some systems, the administrators may limit the number of HPC jobs a user may run at a time. To configure this limit, you can use the value `concurrent-job-limit` to limit the number of jobs. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; concurrent-job-limit = 100; }; ```. #### Putting the config section all together. With the above sections, we can combine them all together to create a completly working HPC backend. ```hocon; backend {; default = SGE; ; providers {; SGE {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; co",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md

With the above sections, we can combine them all together to create a completly working HPC backend. ```hocon; backend {; default = SGE; ; providers {; SGE {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; concurrent-job-limit = 100; ; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; ; submit = """"""; qsub \; -terse \; -V \; -b y \; -N ${job_name} \; -w",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md

Because the job id may be surrounded by other text, a custom regular expression should capture the actual job id. Because the submit above uses `-terse`, the job id will be the entire contents of the stdout, but should be all digits:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell should abort an HPC job. When aborting an HPC job, Cromwell will run a command confifured under the key `kill`, passing in the WDL variable `job_id`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell checks if an HPC job is alive. Whenever Cromwell restarts it checks to see if a job has completed by searching for return code in a file called `rc`. If this file isn't available, in this case Cromwell runs an extra check to make sure the job is still alive. You can configure the command used for this check via:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### Other backend settings. On some systems, the administrators may limit the number of HPC jobs a user may run at a time.

In the config section for your backend, you can define the different [runtime attributes](../RuntimeAttributes) that your HPC tasks will support. Any runtime attribute configured here will be read from the WDL tasks, and then passed into the command line used to submit jobs to the HPC cluster.

In the example above, we have defined four different WDL variables defined, `cpu`, `memory_gb`, `sge_queue`, and `sge_project`.

To specify the memory units that the submit command should use, append the units to the memory runtime attribute. For example:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Float? memory_gb; # ...; """"""; }; ```. Now, no matter what unit of memory is used within the task, the value will be converted into gigabytes before it is passed to your submit command. **custom attributes**. You can also declare other runtime attributes that a WDL task may use. For example, suppose you would like to allow the WDL to specify an sge queue in a task, like:. ```wdl; task hello {; command { echo hello }; runtime { sqe_queue: ""short"" }; }; ```. You declare your runtime attribute in your config by adding any other custom value to the `runtime-attributes` section:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String? sge_queue; # ...; """"""; }; ```. In this case, we've stated that the `sge_queue` is optional. This allows us to reuse WDLs from other pipeline authors who may not have set an `sge_queue`. Alternatively, you can also set a default for the declared runtime attributes. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String sge_queue = ""short""; # ...; """"""; }; ```. ##### Call Caching based on runtime attributes. The rules for call caching in HPC backends are:; * `docker`: Will be considered when call caching.; * Memory options: Will *not* be considered when call caching.; * CPU options: Will *not* be considered when call caching.; * Custom Attributes: Will *not* be considered when call caching (by default).; ; Although custom attributes will not be considered when call caching by default, you can override this in a `runtime-attributes-for-caching` section.

When Cromwell runs a task, it will fill in a template for the job using the declared runtime attributes. This specific template will vary depending on the requirements of your HPC cluster. For example, say you normally submit jobs to SGE using:. ```bash; qsub -terse -V -b y -N my_job_name \; -wd /path/to/working_directory \; -o /path/to/stdout.qsub \; -e /path/to/stderr.qsub \; -pe smp 1 -l mem_free=0.5g -q short \; /usr/bin/env bash myScript.bash; ```. For this particular SGE cluster, the above sets the working directory, stdout and stderr paths, the number of cpus to 1, the memory to half a gigabyte, and runs on the short queue. Converting this into a template using our runtime attributes requires defining `submit` as one would a WDL task `command`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; submit = """"""; qsub \; -terse \; -V \; -b y \; -N ${job_name} \; -wd ${cwd} \; -o ${out}.qsub \; -e ${err}.qsub \; -pe smp ${cpu} \; ${""-l mem_free="" + memory_gb + ""g""} \; ${""-q "" + sge_queue} \; ${""-P "" + sge_project} \; /usr/bin/env bash ${script}; """"""; }; ```.

For now, we'll give your backend the name `SGE`, but you can use any name you would like. ```hocon; backend {; providers {; SGE {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; # to be filled in; }; }; }; }; ```. The `actor-factory` above tells cromwell that you will be using the `config` section to tell cromwell how to submit jobs, abort jobs, etc. You'll likely also want to change the default backend to your new backend, by setting this configuration value:. ```hocon; backend.default = SGE; ```. #### Specifying the runtime attributes for your HPC tasks. In the config section for your backend, you can define the different [runtime attributes](../RuntimeAttributes) that your HPC tasks will support. Any runtime attribute configured here will be read from the WDL tasks, and then passed into the command line used to submit jobs to the HPC cluster. All runtime attributes must be defined in a single multi-line block. The syntax of this block is the same as defining the inputs for a WDL task. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; }; ```. In the example above, we have defined four different WDL variables defined, `cpu`, `memory_gb`, `sge_queue`, and `sge_project`. Below you will find more information on `cpu` and `memory`, and the ability to add custom runtime attributes like the `sge_queue` and `sge_project`. **cpu**.

For this particular SGE cluster, the above sets the working directory, stdout and stderr paths, the number of cpus to 1, the memory to half a gigabyte, and runs on the short queue.

When the job finishes submitting, Cromwell will need to retrieve the job id, so that it can abort the job if necessary. This job should be written to the stdout after submission, where Cromwell will then read the job id. Because the job id may be surrounded by other text, a custom regular expression should capture the actual job id.

Whenever Cromwell restarts it checks to see if a job has completed by searching for return code in a file called `rc`. If this file isn't available, in this case Cromwell runs an extra check to make sure the job is still alive.

When running a workflow, the memory runtime attribute in the task will specify the units of memory. For example, this jobs specifies that it only needs 512 megabytes of memory when running. ```wdl; task hello {; command { echo hello }; runtime { memory: ""512 MB"" }; }; ```. However, it's possible that when submitting jobs to your HPC cluster you want to specify the units in gigabytes. To specify the memory units that the submit command should use, append the units to the memory runtime attribute. For example:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Float? memory_gb; # ...; """"""; }; ```. Now, no matter what unit of memory is used within the task, the value will be converted into gigabytes before it is passed to your submit command. **custom attributes**. You can also declare other runtime attributes that a WDL task may use. For example, suppose you would like to allow the WDL to specify an sge queue in a task, like:. ```wdl; task hello {; command { echo hello }; runtime { sqe_queue: ""short"" }; }; ```. You declare your runtime attribute in your config by adding any other custom value to the `runtime-attributes` section:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String? sge_queue; # ...; """"""; }; ```. In this case, we've stated that the `sge_queue` is optional. This allows us to reuse WDLs from other pipeline authors who may not have set an `sge_queue`. Alternatively, you can also set a default for the declared runtime attributes. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String sge_queue = ""short""; # ...; """"""; }; ```. ##### Call Caching based on runtime attributes.

This tutorial page relies on completing the previous tutorials:. * [Configuration Files](ConfigurationFiles.md). ### Goals. At the end of this tutorial you'll have set up Cromwell to run against your HPC cluster. We'll use SGE as an example but this applies equally to LSF and others. ### Let's get started!. ####. #### Telling Cromwell the type of backend. Start by defining your new backend configuration under the section `backend`. For now, we'll give your backend the name `SGE`, but you can use any name you would like. ```hocon; backend {; providers {; SGE {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; # to be filled in; }; }; }; }; ```. The `actor-factory` above tells cromwell that you will be using the `config` section to tell cromwell how to submit jobs, abort jobs, etc. You'll likely also want to change the default backend to your new backend, by setting this configuration value:. ```hocon; backend.default = SGE; ```. #### Specifying the runtime attributes for your HPC tasks. In the config section for your backend, you can define the different [runtime attributes](../RuntimeAttributes) that your HPC tasks will support. Any runtime attribute configured here will be read from the WDL tasks, and then passed into the command line used to submit jobs to the HPC cluster. All runtime attributes must be defined in a single multi-line block. The syntax of this block is the same as defining the inputs for a WDL task. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; }; ```. In the example above, we have defined four different WDL variables defined, `cpu`, `memory_gb`, `sge_queue`, and `sge_project`. Below you will find more information on `cpu` and `memory`, and the ability to add custom runtime attributes like the `sge_queue` and `sge_project`. **cpu**.

In this section we will install the Cromwell Workflow Management system and configure it, so it can use the local scratch device on the compute nodes.; (these installations are done in a ```centos 8``` enviornment). ### 1. In order to install Cromwell, the `sbt` build tool is required, so we will install this now. ##### a. Add the sbt online repository. ```hocon; dnf config-manager --add-repo https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-rpm.repo; ```. ##### b. Install SBT build tool. ```hocon; dnf -y install sbt; ```. ### 2. Now we can download Cromwell from git repository. ##### a. Create a directory into which we will install Cromwell. ```hocon; mkdir cromwell; ```. ##### b. Now, we set the owner of that directory to the cromwell user and group and change the permissions in order to allow access to all users. ```hocon; chmod 775 -R cromwell; chown -R cromwell:cromwell cromwell; ```. ##### c. Login to the cromwell user account. ```hocon; su - cromwell; ```. ##### d. We will now use git to clone the Cromwell git repository. ```hocon; cd cromwell; git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell.git; ```. ##### e. This guide was tested and validated with `version 52` of cromwell, so we will checkout that version. ```hocon; cd cromwell; git checkout 52; ```. ### 3. We will now configure Cromwell to use the local NVMe disk as scratch space. ##### a. Open the `backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/RuntimeEnvironment.scala` file for editing. ##### b. Comment out line 3, so it reads:. ```hocon; //import java.util.UUID; ```. ##### c. Remove lines 23 through 27, i.e. the following lines:. ```hocon; val tempPath: String = {; val uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString; val hash = uuid.substring(0, uuid.indexOf('-')); callRoot.resolve(s""tmp.$hash"").pathAsString; }; ```. ##### d.

Now we can build the patched Cromwell. ```hocon; sbt clean; sbt assembly; ```. ### 5. When the build was successful, we can move the new jar file into the cromwell directory. ```hocon; cp server/target/scala-2.13/cromwell-52-*-SNAP.jar \; cromwell/cromwell-52-fix.jar; ```. ## Configure the Execution Environment for Cromwell. In this section we will configure the Cromwell execution environment.We will use the default configuration file as a starting point and change it to reflect our needs.; *• Configure MariaDB as the database Cromwell should use; *• Add the `SLURM backends`, so Cromwell can schedule job using `SLURM`. ### 1. First, we download the default Cromwell `reference.conf` configuration file. ```hocon; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/52_hotfix/core/\; src/main/resources/reference.conf cromwell/; ```. ### 2. We will now add `SLURM` as the backend Cromwell should use. ##### a. Open the `cromwell/reference.conf` file for editing. ##### b. Goto line 479 which should read:. ```hocon; default = ""Local""; ```. ##### c. Change the `""Local""` in that line to `""SLURM""`. ##### d.

In this section we will install the Cromwell Workflow Management system and configure it, so it can use the local scratch device on the compute nodes.; (these installations are done in a ```centos 8``` enviornment). ### 1. In order to install Cromwell, the `sbt` build tool is required, so we will install this now. ##### a. Add the sbt online repository. ```hocon; dnf config-manager --add-repo https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-rpm.repo; ```. ##### b. Install SBT build tool. ```hocon; dnf -y install sbt; ```. ### 2. Now we can download Cromwell from git repository. ##### a. Create a directory into which we will install Cromwell. ```hocon; mkdir cromwell; ```. ##### b.

This tutorial page relies on completing the previous tutorials:. * [Server Mode](ServerMode). ### Goals. At the end of this tutorial you'll have seen how to view timing diagram for a workflow as it's running, and interpreting the information on the timing diagram for a completed workflow. ### Let's get started. Want to see the tasks that ran in your workflow laid out in a handy timing diagram? Good news! That's exactly what's about to happen to you!. #### Preparing files. To get a good example of these timing diagrams, we're going to make a workflow that scatters a task across a few indices, and see how that gets represented. Open your favorite text editor, copy the following text in and save it in your cromwell directory as `timingWorkflow.wdl`:; ```wdl; workflow timingWorkflow {; 	scatter(i in range(15)) {; 		call sleep { input: sleep_time = i }; 	}; }. task sleep {; 	Int sleep_time; 	command {; 		echo ""I slept for ${sleep_time}""; 		sleep ${sleep_time}; 	}; 	output {; 		String out = read_string(stdout()); 	}; }; ```. In brief, this workflow will scatter 15 tasks, each one will sleep for a time proportional to their scatter index. Is that hard to imagine? Never mind, we'll see it in diagramatic form soon!. #### Submit to cromwell:. If it's not running already, start the cromwell server:; ```sh; java -jar cromwell-29.jar server; ```. Submit the workflow:; ```sh; curl -X POST --header ""Accept: application/json""\; 	-v ""localhost:8000/api/workflows/v1"" \; 	-F workflowSource=@timingWorkflow.wdl; ```. Amongst the curl output you should see the workflow ID come back, eg:; ```; [...] Workflow 8d18b845-7143-4f35-9543-1977383b7d2f submitted.; ```. I can now enter the following address into my web browser (i.e. Chrome) and see the timing diagram for the workflow. You'll need to swap out my workflow ID for the one that you received (they're all randomly generated) ; ```; http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/v1/8d18b845-7143-4f35-9543-197738",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/TimingDiagrams.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/TimingDiagrams.md

It has a single task call whose; result is exposed as an output String:. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow single_task_workflow {; call single_task; ; output {; String string_out = single_task.string_out; }; }. task single_task {; command {; echo hello; }; output {; String string_out = ""hello""; }; }; ```. The **Execution Store** will keep track of statuses as the workflow runs:. | | `single_task` | `string_out` |; |---|---|---|; |1|`NotStarted`|`NotStarted`|; |2|`QueuedInCromwell`|`NotStarted`|; |3|`Starting`|`NotStarted`|; |4|`Running`|`NotStarted`|; |5|`Done`|`NotStarted`|; |6|`Done`|`Running`|; |7|`Done`|`Done`|. In step 1, the workflow has just started and the ExecutionStore is created in its initial; state. The Value Store doesn't track statuses and so begins empty: `{ }`. In steps 2-4, the Execution Store tracks the `single_task` job as the engine is executing it. As the Execution Store is updated to indicate task completion is step 5, the Value Store is also updated to; include the output value of the task:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello""; }; ```. By step 6, Cromwell can use the fact that the task is complete to decide that the output node is ready to be; evaluated. And the input to the output expression is available for lookup in the Value Store. In step 7, all workflow nodes have run and the workflow is complete. The Value Store is updated once again to; additionally contain the output node value:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello"",; ""string_out"": ""hello""; }; ``` . Cromwell can use this information to trigger the ""workflow complete"" logic. ## Handling scatters.

Cromwell can use this information to trigger the ""workflow complete"" logic. ## Handling scatters. When Cromwell runs scattered tasks, the Execution Store cannot tell ahead of time how many; `JobKey`s it will need to represent all of the shards in the scatter. It can get around; this problem by putting a placeholder `JobKey` for the scatter node in the Execution Store. When; the scatter key is evaluated, it expands the Execution Store to include new `JobKey`s representing; every shard in the scatter. As with the single task example, the Value Store starts empty, and is updated with the results of each; shard only as and when they are generated.

This page provides run-throughs to give insight into how the; [Execution Store](executionStore.md) and [Value Store](valueStore.md) work in; practice in some example situations. . ## Handling a single task call. To begin, consider this simple workflow. It has a single task call whose; result is exposed as an output String:. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow single_task_workflow {; call single_task; ; output {; String string_out = single_task.string_out; }; }. task single_task {; command {; echo hello; }; output {; String string_out = ""hello""; }; }; ```.

By step 6, Cromwell can use the fact that the task is complete to decide that the output node is ready to be; evaluated. And the input to the output expression is available for lookup in the Value Store. In step 7, all workflow nodes have run and the workflow is complete. The Value Store is updated once again to; additionally contain the output node value:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello"",; ""string_out"": ""hello""; }; ``` .

When Cromwell runs scattered tasks, the Execution Store cannot tell ahead of time how many; `JobKey`s it will need to represent all of the shards in the scatter. It can get around; this problem by putting a placeholder `JobKey` for the scatter node in the Execution Store. When; the scatter key is evaluated, it expands the Execution Store to include new `JobKey`s representing; every shard in the scatter. As with the single task example, the Value Store starts empty, and is updated with the results of each; shard only as and when they are generated.

The Execution Store is a data structure owned and maintained inside each ; `WorkflowExecutionActor` (see [Major Actors](majorActors.md)).

The Value Store is a data structure owned and maintained inside each ; `WorkflowExecutionActor` (see [Major Actors](majorActors.md)). Its purpose is to hold the set of _values_ produced by the workflow so far.

Nor does it determine when downstream nodes are ready; to run. That is the domain of the [Execution Store](executionStore.md). . ## Data Structure. The Value Store data structure is a mapping from output ports on WOM `GraphNode`s ; (and shard index if necessary) to the appropriate `WomValue`. . ## Examples.

For the various versions of WDL supported in Cromwell, the conversion to WOM follows; these paths: . ![Parsing Flowchart](wdlmap.svg). #### Process Description. You can think of WDL parsing in Cromwell in terms of the following major steps:. 1. Lexing: Converting the raw WDL string into a one dimensional stream of ""tokens"".; 2. Parsing: Converting the stream of tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST).; 3. Transliteration: Transforming the language-specific AST into a standard set of Scala objects; 4. Import Resolution: Recursively processing any import statements into WOM bundles.; 5. Linking: Discovering, resolving and recording all references within the AST and imports.; 6. WOM Building: Creating a set of WOM objects; 7. Input Validation: Link any provided inputs to inputs on the WOM objects. #### Intermediate Data Formats. * **WDL Object Model (WDLOM)**:; * A Scala case class representation of WDL grammar ASTs.; * **Linked inputs**:; * The original WDL source's WDLOM representation; * And WOM bundles imported; * Links from any references to their definitions; * Including custom type references, variable references, task calls, subworkflow calls ; * **WOM Bundle**:; * A set of tasks, workflows and custom types, and the fully qualified names by which they can be referenced.; * In Cromwell's WOM format (the WOM format is the ultimate destination for _all_ languages, including WDL); * **Validated WOM Namespace**:; * The conjunction of a WOM bundle with an input set.; * The entry point workflow is known.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/developers/bitesize/workflowParsing/wdlParsingOverview.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/bitesize/workflowParsing/wdlParsingOverview.md
https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/bitesize/workflowParsing/wdlToWdlom.md:3724,Availability,avail,available,3724,"ment.scala):. * The conversion from AST to WDLOM relies on two other conversions, `astNodeToTypeElement` and `astNodeToExpressionElement`, ; to validate the attributes on the AST it is given, and construct WDLOM from Hermes ASTs.; * The resulting function can itself be used as a building block to construct higher-level WDLOM types. . #### How AST-to-WDLOM building blocks are chained together. To see how these building blocks are pieced together we can look at WDL 1.0's [`ast2wdlom`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/master/wdl/transforms/draft3/src/main/scala/wdl/draft3/transforms/ast2wdlom/ast2wdlom.scala) package object. Notice how - and where - the `astToInputDeclarationElement` value is declared:. * It follows the `implicit val`s `astNodeToTypeElement` and `astNodeToExpressionElement` and so can use those in its processing.; * It is, as an `implicit val`, used later on by `astNodeToInputsSectionElement`, which is then used by `astNodeToWorkflowBodyElement` and `astNodeToTaskSectionElement`, and so on. . #### How different WDL versions convert to WDLOM differently. These package objects ultimately control how different WDL versions are parsed differently. These differences can be seen most easily by comparing package objects for different WDL versions:. ```bash; diff \; wdl/transforms/draft3/src/main/scala/wdl/draft3/transforms/ast2wdlom/ast2wdlom.scala \; wdl/transforms/biscayne/src/main/scala/wdl/transforms/biscayne/ast2wdlom/ast2wdlom.scala ; ``` . In an extreme case, these could contain fundamentally different conversion logic from AST to WDLOM for different WDL versions. Luckily, between; WDL 1.0 and the WDL `development` version, there are only a few minor changes, amongst which are:. * Importing a new Hermes parser.; * Specifying that additional functions are available when constructing the `astNodeToExpressionElement` conversion.; * Specifying that a new `Directory` type is available when constructing the `astNodeToTypeElement` conversion.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/developers/bitesize/workflowParsing/wdlToWdlom.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/bitesize/workflowParsing/wdlToWdlom.md

Hermes can be asked to show its parse tree for a valid WDL file by running:. ```bash; $ hermes analyze grammar.hgr <WDL FILE>; ```.

This allows call caching to happen if you need to restart for any reason.; See instructions for using a Dockerized MySQL server and CI config [here](#cromwell-setup-for-publishing). Note that the publish workflow is quite resource intensive; it's a good idea to shut down other resource intensive apps before launching it to avoid painfully slow or failed executions. Make sure to plug in your laptop. Using the Swagger API at `http://localhost:8000`, submit the workflow to Cromwell along with the inputs file.

An implementation that uses Fargate might be an ; alternative that is closer or an implementation that uses Step Functions although; that would be a separate backend. From a Cromwell perspective, this means that unlike Pipelines, where; infrastructure details are defined in the configuration or the WDL, in AWS; Batch, these configuration details are handled outside. All the AWS Batch; backend needs to know is ""what is the ARN for the job Queue""?. A good example of the difference can be seen in the 'disks' configuration. In; Pipelines, you need to specify the type of disk and size. In AWS, this will; be defined instead when you setup your environment (more on that later), so; all the AWS backend really needs to know is what mount points you need; defined.

While there is; documentation regarding roles related to ECS services, these are; irrelevant to the Cromwell use case.; 2. Other than access to the main Cromwell bucket, the task container itself ; does not need additional permissions unless; the task in the WDL has been defined with a command that interfaces; with AWS directly. This may include access to additional s3 buckets containing; things like reference genome files. Task container permissions are currently supported through ECS and AWS; Batch, but there is no configuration currently wired for the Cromwell; AWS Backend to pass these settings to AWS. As such, the task container; permissions must be managed by attaching a role to the EC2 Instance; with permissions necessary for both the ECS Agent and the task container. NOTE: ECS Agent permissions currently must use the permissions as outlined; in the AmazonEC2ContainerServiceForEC2Role managed policy. Future considerations; ---------------------.

In AWS, this will; be defined instead when you setup your environment (more on that later), so; all the AWS backend really needs to know is what mount points you need; defined. This infrastructure and all the associated configuration still exists; however,; it is moved out of the Cromwell configuration. AWS Batch; ---------. Because AWS Batch is so different from PAPI, those familiar only with PAPI; would be best off with an overview of AWS Batch. If you are familiar with; the workings of Batch, feel free to skip this section, and move on. [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) fundamentally is a service to allow batch jobs to run easily and; efficiently. To use it effectively, however, you need to understand its own; technical stack. To create a job, you need a ""Job Queue"". That job queue allows; jobs to be scheduled onto one or more ""Compute Environments"". This can; be managed through AWS Batch, but when AWS Batch sets up a compute environment,; it's simply setting up an Elastic Container Service (ECS) Cluster. The ECS; cluster, in turn is just a few managed CloudFormation templates, that is; controlling an AutoScaling group of EC2 instances. What really makes an ECS instance an ECS instance is the presence of a configured; [Amazon ECS agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent). This agent polls; the ECS service to determine if there are any tasks to run. An AWS Batch Job; will be turned into an ECS task. From there, the agent will pick it up and; manage it, sending updates back to ECS (and from there AWS Batch) on a regular; basis. There are some limits that will impact the design of the AWS Batch backend, and; will be discussed later. These are:. * [AWS Batch Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_limits.html); * [8k container overrides limit.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/run-task.html).
