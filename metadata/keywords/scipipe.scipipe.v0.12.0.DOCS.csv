Performance,concurren,concurrent,"tions. - There are still a number of missing good-to-have features for workflow; design. See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/issues); for details.; - There is not (yet) support for the [Common Workflow Language](http://common-workflow-language.github.io). ## Installing. For full installation instructions, see the [intallation page](/install).; For quick getting started steps, you can do:. 1. [Download](https://golang.org/dl/) and [install](https://golang.org/doc/install) Go; 2. Run the following command, to install the scipipe Go library (don't miss the; trailing dots!), and create a Go module for your script:. ```bash; go install github.com/scipipe/scipipe/...@latest; go mod init myfirstworkflow-module; ```. ## Hello World example. Let's look at an example workflow to get a feel for what writing workflows in; SciPipe looks like:. ```go; package main. import (; // Import SciPipe, aliased to sp; sp ""github.com/scipipe/scipipe""; ). func main() {; // Init workflow and max concurrent tasks; wf := sp.NewWorkflow(""hello_world"", 4). // Initialize processes, and file extensions; hello := wf.NewProc(""hello"", ""echo 'Hello ' > {o:out|.txt}""); world := wf.NewProc(""world"", ""echo $(cat {i:in}) World > {o:out|.txt}""). // Define data flow; world.In(""in"").From(hello.Out(""out"")). // Run workflow; wf.Run(); }; ```. To create a file with a similar simple example, you can run:. ```; scipipe new hello_world.go; ```. ## Running the example. Let's put the code in a file named `hello_world.go` and run it. First you need to make sure that the dependencies (SciPipe in this case) is; installed in your local Go module. This you can do with:. ```bash; go mod tidy; ```. Then you can go ahead and run the workflow:. ```bash; $ go run hello_world.go; AUDIT 2018/07/17 21:42:26 | workflow:hello_world | Starting workflow (Writing log to log/scipipe-20180717-214226-hello_world.log); AUDIT 2018/07/17 21:42:26 | hello | Executing: echo 'Hello ' > hello.out.txt; AUDIT 2018/07/17 21:4",MatchSource.DOCS,README.md,scipipe,scipipe,v0.12.0,https://scipipe.org,https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/tree/v0.12.0/README.md

Note: A the time of this writing, v0.9.10 is the latest published version, this; will change over time and you need to adapt. Next, replace any reference to the previous URL with reference to the; `<cloned-scipipe-dir>` location:. ```; go mod edit -replace=github.com/scipipe/scipipe@v0.9.10=<cloned-scipipe-dir>; ```. Now when you do:. ```; go run main.go; ```. ... it will not be pulling the code from GitHub but references the code you; have cloned locally.

SciPipe is a library for writing [Scientific Workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_workflow_system),; sometimes also called ""pipelines"", in the [Go programming language](http://golang.org).

Performance,concurren,concurrent,"tions. - There are still a number of missing good-to-have features for workflow; design. See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/issues); for details.; - There is not (yet) support for the [Common Workflow Language](http://common-workflow-language.github.io). ## Installing. For full installation instructions, see the [intallation page](/install).; For quick getting started steps, you can do:. 1. [Download](https://golang.org/dl/) and [install](https://golang.org/doc/install) Go; 2. Run the following command, to install the scipipe Go library (don't miss the; trailing dots!), and create a Go module for your script:. ```bash; go install github.com/scipipe/scipipe/...@latest; go mod init myfirstworkflow-module; ```. ## Hello World example. Let's look at an example workflow to get a feel for what writing workflows in; SciPipe looks like:. ```go; package main. import (; // Import SciPipe, aliased to sp; sp ""github.com/scipipe/scipipe""; ). func main() {; // Init workflow and max concurrent tasks; wf := sp.NewWorkflow(""hello_world"", 4). // Initialize processes, and file extensions; hello := wf.NewProc(""hello"", ""echo 'Hello ' > {o:out|.txt}""); world := wf.NewProc(""world"", ""echo $(cat {i:in}) World > {o:out|.txt}""). // Define data flow; world.In(""in"").From(hello.Out(""out"")). // Run workflow; wf.Run(); }; ```. To create a file with a similar simple example, you can run:. ```; scipipe new hello_world.go; ```. ## Running the example. Let's put the code in a file named `hello_world.go` and run it. First you need to make sure that the dependencies (SciPipe in this case) is; installed in your local Go module. This you can do with:. ```bash; go mod tidy; ```. Then you can go ahead and run the workflow:. ```bash; $ go run hello_world.go; AUDIT 2018/07/17 21:42:26 | workflow:hello_world | Starting workflow (Writing log to log/scipipe-20180717-214226-hello_world.log); AUDIT 2018/07/17 21:42:26 | hello | Executing: echo 'Hello ' > hello.out.txt; AUDIT 2018/07/17 21:4",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/index.md,scipipe,scipipe,v0.12.0,https://scipipe.org,https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/tree/v0.12.0/docs/index.md

After this, you will; be able to use Go's `go run` command to run SciPipe workflows. ## Install Go. Install Go by following the instructions [on this page](https://golang.org/doc/install#install), for your operating system. To make sure that everything is installed, run the `go` command in your; terminal, and make sure that it outputs something. To be specific, you can try exetuging `go version`, which sould output something; like the below:. ```bash; $ go version; go version go1.17 linux/amd64; ```; ; ## Install SciPipe. There are two main ways of installing SciPipe, one which is super-easy, and one; which is recommended if you want to make sure that your workflow will never; break because of API changes in SciPipe, and that you always have a copy of the; SciPipe source code available. ### Easy: Using go install. The easiest way to intsall SciPipe is by using the `go install` tool in the Go; tool chain. To install scipipe with `go install`, run the following command in; your terminal:. ```bash; go install github.com/scipipe/scipipe/...@latest; ```. **N.B:** Don't miss the `...`, as otherwise the `scipipe` helper tool will not be installed. ## Initialize a new workflow file. Now, you should be able to write code like in the example below, in files; ending with `.go`. The easiest way to get started is to let the scipipe tool generate a starting point for you:. ```bash; scipipe new myfirstworkflow.go; ```. ... which you can then edit to your liking. ## Create a Go module. Before you can run the workflow, you need to also create a [go module](https://golang.org/ref/mod#introduction). To do this, you can run the following command, in the directory where you; created your first workflow:. ```bash; go mod init <package-name>; ```.

To install scipipe with `go install`, run the following command in; your terminal:. ```bash; go install github.com/scipipe/scipipe/...@latest; ```. **N.B:** Don't miss the `...`, as otherwise the `scipipe` helper tool will not be installed. ## Initialize a new workflow file. Now, you should be able to write code like in the example below, in files; ending with `.go`. The easiest way to get started is to let the scipipe tool generate a starting point for you:. ```bash; scipipe new myfirstworkflow.go; ```. ... which you can then edit to your liking. ## Create a Go module. Before you can run the workflow, you need to also create a [go module](https://golang.org/ref/mod#introduction). To do this, you can run the following command, in the directory where you; created your first workflow:. ```bash; go mod init <package-name>; ```. For `<module-name>`, you have to replace it with a name of the package.; For a ",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/install.md,scipipe,scipipe,v0.12.0,https://scipipe.org,https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/tree/v0.12.0/docs/install.md
Energy Efficiency,power,powerful,"you always have a copy of the SciPipe source; code available, we recommend to always include a copy of the SciPipe source; code in your workflow's source code repository. The SciPipe source code is; only around 1500 lines of code, with no external dependencies except Go and; Bash, so this should not increase the size of your repository too much. A simple way to do this, is to use Go's `vendor` tool, which stores a local; copy of the source code of packages used, inside the local directory, in; a sub-directory called ""vendor"". To do this, execute the following command:. ```; go mod vendor; ```. Then, to make sure the code is included in your git history, make sure to add it; to git:. ```bash; git add vendor; git commit -m ""Add vendored version of SciPipe""; ```. ## Run your workflow. Now youa re ready to run the workflow. To run a `.go` file, just use `go run <script-file>`, e.g:; ; ```bash; go run myfirstworkflow.go; ```. ## Some tips about editors. In order to be productive with SciPipe, you will also need a Go editor or IDE; with support for auto-completion, sometimes also called ""intellisense"". We can warmly recommend to use one of these editors, sorted by level of endorsement:. 1.

Availability,echo,echo,"# Writing Workflows - An Overview. In order to give an overview of how to write workflows in SciPipe, let's look; at the example workflow used on the front page again:. ```go; package main. import (; // Import SciPipe; ""github.com/scipipe/scipipe""; ). func main() {; // Init workflow with a name, and a number for max concurrent tasks, so we; // don't overbook our CPU (it is recommended to set it to the number of CPU; // cores of your computer); wf := scipipe.NewWorkflow(""hello_world"", 4). // Initialize processes and set output file paths; hello := wf.NewProc(""hello"", ""echo 'Hello ' > {o:out}""); hello.SetOut(""out"", ""hello.txt""). world := wf.NewProc(""world"", ""echo $(cat {i:in}) World >> {o:out}""); world.SetOut(""out"", ""{i:in|%.txt}_world.txt""). // Connect network; world.In(""in"").From(hello.Out(""out"")). // Run workflow; wf.Run(); }; ```. Now let's go through the code example in some detail, to see what we are; actually doing. ## Initializing processes. ```go; // Initialize processes from shell command patterns; hello := wf.NewProc(""hello"", ""echo 'Hello ' > {o:out}""); world := wf.NewProc(""world"", ""echo $(cat {i:in}) World >> {o:out}""); ```. Here we are initializing two new processes, both of them based on a shell; command, using the `wf.NewProc()` function, which takes a processname, and; a shell command pattern as input. ### The shell command pattern. The shell command patterns, in this case `echo 'Hello ' > {o:out}` and; `echo $(cat {i:in}) World >> {o:out}`, are basically normal bash; shell commands, with the addition of ""placeholders"" for input and output; filenames. Input filename placeholders are on the form `{i:INPORT-NAME}` and the output; filename placeholders are similarly of the form `{o:OUTPORT-NAME}`. These; placeholders will be replaced with actual filenames when the command is; executed later. The reason that it a port-name is used to name them, is that; files will be queued on the channel connecting to the port, and for each set of; files on in-ports, a com",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/writing_workflows.md,scipipe,scipipe,v0.12.0,https://scipipe.org,https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/tree/v0.12.0/docs/writing_workflows.md

Finally we need to define the data dependencies between our processes. We do; this by connecting the outports of one process to the inport of another; process, using the `From` method available on each in-port object (Or the; `To` method on out-ports). We also need to connect the final out-port of the; pipeline to the workflow, so that the workflow can pull on this port; (technically pulling on a Go channel), in order to drive the workflow. ```go; // Connect network; world.In(""in"").From(helloWriter.Out(""out"")); ```. ## Running the pipeline. So, the final part probably explains itself, but the workflow component is a; relatively simple one that will start each component in a separate go-routine. For technical reasons, one final process has to be run in the main go-routine; (that where the program's `main()` function runs), but generally you don't; need to think about this, as the workflow will then use an in-built; [sink](https://godoc.org/github.com/scipipe/scipipe#Sink) process for this; purpose. If you for any reason need to customize which process to use as the; ""driver"" process, instead of the in-built sink. see the [`SetDriver` section](https://godoc.org/github.com/scipipe/scipipe#Workflow.SetDriver); in the docs. ```go; wf.Run(); ```. ## Summary.

To avoid this situation, you can do one of two things, of which the latter is; generally recommended:. **1.** Create a new copy of the variable, inside the anonymous function:. ```go; for _, val := range []string{""foo"", ""bar""} {; proc := scipipe.NewProc(val + ""_proc"", ""cat {p:val} > {o:out}""); val := val // <- Here we create a new copy of the variable; proc.SetOutFunc(""out"", func(t *scipipe.Task) string {; return val + "".txt""; }); }; ```. **2.** ... or, better, access the parameter value via the task which the path function receives:. ```go; for _, val := range []string{""foo"", ""bar""} {; proc := scipipe.NewProc(val + ""_proc"", ""cat {p:val} > {o:out}""); proc.SetOutFunc(""out"", func(t *scipipe.Task) string {; return t.Param(""val"") + "".txt"" // Access param via the task (`t`); }); }; ```. ## Connecting processes into a network.

Modifiability,variab,variables,"`.; - Example: `{i:infile|s/file/my_file/}`, if `infile` has the path `file.txt`, will convert it to `my_file.txt`. ## Even more control over file formatting. We can actually get even more control over how file names are produced than; this, by manually supplying each process with an anonymous function that; returns file paths given a `scipipe.Task` object, which will be produced for; each command execution. In order to implement the same path patterns as above, using this method, we; would write like this:. ```go; // Configure output file path formatters for the processes created above; hello.SetOutFunc(""out"", func(t *scipipe.Task) string {; return ""hello.txt""; }); world.SetOutFunc(""out"", func(t *scipipe.Task) string {; return strings.Replace(t.InPath(""in""), "".txt"", ""_world.txt"", -1); }); ```. As you can see, this is a much more complicated way to format paths, but it can; be useful for example when needing to incorporate parameter values into file; names. ### A caveat about using variables in anonymous functions. Note that when using anonymous functions, you have to be careful to not re-use; the same variable (even with different values) in multiple functions, due to; the [subtle ways in which closures work in Go](https://golang.org/doc/faq#closures_and_goroutines). For example, if you create multiple new processes with separate formatting; functions in a loop, that uses a shared variable, like this:. ```go; for _, val := range []string{""foo"", ""bar""} {; proc := scipipe.NewProc(val + ""_proc"", ""cat {p:val} > {o:out}""); proc.SetOutFunc(""out"", func(t *scipipe.Task) string {; return val + "".txt""; }); }; ```. ... then, both functions will return ""bar.txt"", since both funcs were pointing to; the same variable (""var""), which had the value ""bar"" at the end of the loop.

Safety,avoid,avoid,"ial convenience methods on the processes, starting with; `SetOut...`. There are a few variants, of which two of them are shown here. ```go; // Configure output file path formatters for the processes created above; hello.SetOut(""out"", ""hello.txt""); world.SetOut(""out"", ""{i:in|%.txt}_world.txt""); ```. `SetOut` takes a pattern similar to the shell command pattern, with; placeholders, used to define new (shell-based) processes. The available; placeholders that can be used are: `{i:INPORTNAME}`, `{p:PARAMNAME}` and; `{t:TAGNAME}`. An example of a full pattern might be:; `{i:foo}.replace_with_{p:replacement}.txt`, but can also be used for; simple, static paths, like in the example above. The placeholders can also take certain extra ""modifiers"", separated from the; placeholder name by pipe characters, and of which the one used above is; probably the most important one: `%STRING`. It will remove the specified; string from the _end_ of the path. This is useful when we want to avoid; getting too long paths when re-using previous processes' paths. With the; example above, our input file named `hello.txt` will be converted into; `hello_world.txt` by this path pattern. ### Available path modifiers. The currently available path modifiers are:. - `basename` - Removes all folders from the path, leaving only the filename.; - Example: `{i:infile|basename}`, if `infile` has the path `data/file.txt`, will convert it to just `file.txt`.; - `dirname` - Removes the ending file name part from the path, leaving only the folder path.; - Example: `{i:infile|dirname}/newfile.txt`, if `infile` has the path `data/file.txt`, will convert it to `data/newfile.txt`.; - `%.<extension>` - Removes the file extension `<extension>`.; - Example: `{i:infile|%.txt}`, if `infile` has the path `file.txt`, will convert it to just `file`.; - `s/<search>/<replacement>/` - Will do a simple search and replace, from `<search>` to `<replacement>`.; - Example: `{i:infile|s/file/my_file/}`, if `infile` has the path `fi",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/writing_workflows.md,scipipe,scipipe,v0.12.0,https://scipipe.org,https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/tree/v0.12.0/docs/writing_workflows.md

We also need to connect the final out-port of the; pipeline to the workflow, so that the workflow can pull on this port; (technically pulling on a Go channel), in order to drive the workflow. ```go; // Connect network; world.In(""in"").From(helloWriter.Out(""out"")); ```. ## Running the pipeline. So, the final part probably explains itself, but the workflow component is a; relatively simple one that will start e",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/writing_workflows.md,scipipe,scipipe,v0.12.0,https://scipipe.org,https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/tree/v0.12.0/docs/writing_workflows.md
Usability,simpl,simple,"each set of; files on in-ports, a command will be created and executed whereafter new files; will be pulled in on the out-ports, and so on. ## Formatting output file paths. Now we need to provide some way for scipipe to figure out a suitable file name; for each of the files propagating through the ""network"" of processes. This can; be done using special convenience methods on the processes, starting with; `SetOut...`. There are a few variants, of which two of them are shown here. ```go; // Configure output file path formatters for the processes created above; hello.SetOut(""out"", ""hello.txt""); world.SetOut(""out"", ""{i:in|%.txt}_world.txt""); ```. `SetOut` takes a pattern similar to the shell command pattern, with; placeholders, used to define new (shell-based) processes. The available; placeholders that can be used are: `{i:INPORTNAME}`, `{p:PARAMNAME}` and; `{t:TAGNAME}`. An example of a full pattern might be:; `{i:foo}.replace_with_{p:replacement}.txt`, but can also be used for; simple, static paths, like in the example above. The placeholders can also take certain extra ""modifiers"", separated from the; placeholder name by pipe characters, and of which the one used above is; probably the most important one: `%STRING`. It will remove the specified; string from the _end_ of the path. This is useful when we want to avoid; getting too long paths when re-using previous processes' paths. With the; example above, our input file named `hello.txt` will be converted into; `hello_world.txt` by this path pattern. ### Available path modifiers. The currently available path modifiers are:. - `basename` - Removes all folders from the path, leaving only the filename.; - Example: `{i:infile|basename}`, if `infile` has the path `data/file.txt`, will convert it to just `file.txt`.; - `dirname` - Removes the ending file name part from the path, leaving only the folder path.; - Example: `{i:infile|dirname}/newfile.txt`, if `infile` has the path `data/file.txt`, will convert it to `data/new",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/writing_workflows.md,scipipe,scipipe,v0.12.0,https://scipipe.org,https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/tree/v0.12.0/docs/writing_workflows.md

Modifiability,flexible,flexible,"Parameters are arguments sent to commands as flags, or unnamed values, or; sometimes just the occurance of flags. SciPipe does not provide one unified way to handle parameters, but instead; suggest a few different strategies, dependent on the usage pattern. This is; because it turns out that there is a very large variety in how parameters can; be used with shell commands. To keep SciPipe a small and flexible tool, we instead mostly leave the choice; up to the workflow author to create a solution for each case, using a few helper; tools provided with SciPipe, but also all the programming facilities built in to; the Go programming language. Below we will discuss how to handle the most common uses for for parameters in; SciPipe. For any more complicated use cases not covered here, please refer to; the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scipipe) or the; [chat](https://gitter.im/scipipe/scipipe), to ask your question. ## Static parameters. If parameters in your shell command is always, the same, you can just add them; ""manually"" to the shell command pattern used to create your process. For example, if you always want to write the string ""hello"" to output files,; you could create your processes with this string added manually:. ```go; helloWriter := scipipe.NewProc(""helloWriter"", ""echo hello > {o:outfile}""); ```. ### See also. - [Static parameters example](https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/blob/master/examples/static_params/staticparams.go). ## Receive parameters dynamically.
