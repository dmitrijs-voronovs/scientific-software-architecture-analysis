A geometry iterator that sequentially follows all nodes of the geometrical; hierarchy of a volume. The iterator has to be initiated with a top volume; pointer:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TGeoIterator next(myVolume);; ~~~. One can use the iterator as any other in ROOT:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TGeoNode *node;; while ((node=next())) {; ...; }; ~~~. The iterator can perform 2 types of iterations that can be selected via:. ~~~ {.cpp}; next.SetType(Int_t type);; ~~~. Here TYPE can be:; - 0 (default) - 'first daughter next' behavior; - 1 - iteration at the current level only. Supposing the tree structure looks like:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TOP ___ A_1 ___ A1_1 ___ A11_1; | | |___ A12_1; | |_____A2_1 ___ A21_1; | |___ A21_2; |___ B_1 ...; ~~~. The order of iteration for TYPE=0 is: A_1, A1_1, A11_1, A12_1, A2_1, A21_1,; A21_2, B_1, ... The order of iteration for TYPE=1 is: A_1, B_1, ...; At any moment during iteration, TYPE can be changed. If the last iterated node; is for instance A1_1 and the iteration type was 0, one can do:. ~~~ {.cpp}; next.SetType(1);; ~~~. The next iterated nodes will be the rest of A daughters: A2,A3,... The iterator; will return 0 after finishing all daughters of A. During iteration, the following can be retrieved:; - Top volume where iteration started: TGeoIterator::GetTopVolume(); - Node at level I in the current branch: TGeoIterator::GetNode(Int_t i); - Iteration type: TGeoIterator::GetType(); - Global matrix of the current node with respect to the top volume:; TGeoIterator::GetCurrentMatrix(). The iterator can be reset by changing (or not) the top volume:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TGeoIterator::Reset(TGeoVolume *top);; ~~~. ### Example:. We want to find out a volume named ""MyVol"" in the hierarchy of TOP volume. ~~~ {.cpp}; TIter next(TOP);; TGeoNode *node;; TString name(""MyVol"");; while ((node=next())); if (name == node->GetVolume()->GetName()) return node->GetVolume();; ~~~; */; /** \class TGeoIteratorPlugin; \ingroup Geo",MatchSource.CODE_COMMENT,geom/geom/src/TGeoNode.cxx,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/geom/geom/src/TGeoNode.cxx

It is the user's task to provide different names; for different volume families in order to avoid ambiguities at tracking time.; A generic family rather than a single volume is created only in two cases :; when a generic shape is provided to the volume constructor or when a division; operation is applied. Each volume in the geometry stores an unique; ID corresponding to its family. In order to ease-up their creation, the manager; class is providing an API that allows making a shape and a volume in a single step. Volumes are objects that can be visualized, therefore having visibility,; colour, line and fill attributes that can be defined or modified any time after; the volume creation. It is advisable however to define these properties just; after the first creation of a volume namespace, since in case of volume families; any new member created by the modeler inherits these properties. In order to provide navigation features, volumes have to be able to find; the proper container of any point defined in the local reference frame. This; can be the volume itself, one of its positioned daughter volumes or none if; the point is actually outside. On the other hand, volumes have to provide also; other navigation methods such as finding the distances to its shape boundaries; or which daughter will be crossed first. The implementation of these features; is done at shape level, but the local mother-daughters management is handled; by volumes that builds additional optimisation structures upon geometry closure.; In order to have navigation features properly working one has to follow the; general rules for building a valid geometry (see TGeoManager class).

This; can be the volume itself, one of its positioned daughter volumes or none if; the point is actually outside.

The implementation of these features; is done at shape level, but the local mother-daughters management is handled; by volumes that builds additional optimisation structures upon geometry closure.; In order to have navigation features properly working one has to follow the; general rules for building a valid geometry (see TGeoManager class).

Since we did not supplied the third argument, the wire will be positioned with; an identity transformation inside the chamber. One will notice that the inner; radii of the wire and chamber are both zero - therefore, aren't the two volumes; overlapping ? The answer is no, the modeler is even relaying on the fact that; any daughter is fully contained by its mother. On the other hand, neither of; the nodes positioned inside a volume should overlap with each other. We will; see that there are allowed some exceptions to those rules. ### Overlapping volumes.

Suppose we want to position the same box inside 2 different volumes; and we want the Z size to match the one of each container:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TGeoVolume *container1 = gGeoManager->MakeBox(""C1"", imed, 10,10,30);; TGeoVolume *container2 = gGeoManager->MakeBox(""C2"", imed, 10,10,20);; TGeoVolume *pvol = gGeoManager->MakeBox(""PVOL"", jmed, 3,3,-1);; container1->AddNode(pvol, 1);; container2->AddNode(pvol, 1);; ~~~. Note that the third parameter of PVOL is negative, which does not make sense; as half-length on Z. This is interpreted as: when positioned, create a box; replacing all invalid parameters with the corresponding dimensions of the; container. This is also internally handled by the TGeoVolumeMulti class, which; does not need to be instantiated by users. ### Dividing volumes. Volumes can be divided according a pattern. The most simple division can; be done along one axis, that can be: X, Y, Z, Phi, Rxy or Rxyz. Let's take; the most simple case: we would like to divide a box in N equal slices along X; coordinate, representing a new volume family.

First one, and most important is that X Window System; * completely lacks any tools for image manipulation, except for very; * rudimentary operations. With Introduction of Render extentions in; * XFree86 4.0 that situation is changing, but still is far from; * perfect. There need is therefore to implement client side image; * manipulation. That inturn creates a problem of image data transfer; * between Server and client.; *; * To avoid that full-time image storage on the client side is needed.; * Which is memory extensive. So there appears to be a need for some; * in-memory compression.; *; * On the other side there is an image quality issue. Its easy to write; * a scaling function by simply dropping out or duplicating pixels,; * but quality is awfull. What is needed is very fast; * averaging/interpolation code. That brings us to the issue of 8 bits; * per channel. Add two pixels together and you get overflow. So all the; * math has to be performed in different colorspace and then converted; * back. On the other side, such a conversion may discard valuable bits,; * so some compensation method has to be implemented.; *; * On the text drawing side of things, there are numerous problems just; * as well. Native X fonts look ugly as soon as you try to show any; * decently sized text. That is supposed to be solved with said Render; * extensions to XFree86, but as experiense has shown, things aren't as; * easy as it looks, besides one wants one's app to run well under any X; * Server.

If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it; must be called again after making room in the output buffer because there; might be more output pending. The flush parameter of inflate() can be Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH,; Z_FINISH, or Z_BLOCK. Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much; output as possible to the output buffer. Z_BLOCK requests that inflate() stop; if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary. When decoding the; zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately after; the header and before the first block.

The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.; Also to assist in this, on return inflate() will set strm->data_type to the; number of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm->next_in, plus 64; if inflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream,; plus 128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block; code or decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the; deflate stream. The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the; uncompressed data from that block has been written to strm->next_out. The; number of unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when; bit 7 of data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be; less than eight. inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an; error.

A TButton has a name and an associated action.; When the button is clicked with the left mouse button, the corresponding; action is executed. A TButton can be created by direct invocation of the constructors; or via the graphics editor. The action can be set via TButton::SetMethod.; The action can be any command. Examples of actions:; - ""34+78"" When the button is clicked, the result of addition is printed.; - "".x macro.C"" . Clicking the button executes the macro macro.C; The action can be modified at any time via TButton::SetMethod. To modify the layout/size/contents of one or several buttons; in a canvas, you must set the canvas editable via TCanvas::SetEditable.; By default a TCanvas is editable.; By default a TDialogCanvas is not editable.; TButtons are in general placed in a TDialogCanvas.

A class to define a conversion from pixel values to pixel color. A Palette is defined by some anchor points. Each anchor point has; a value between 0 and 1 and a color. An image has to be normalized; and the values between the anchor points are interpolated.; All member variables are public and can be directly manipulated.; In most cases the default operator will be used to create a; TImagePalette. In this case the member arrays have to be allocated; by an application and will be deleted in the destructor of this; class. We provide few predefined palettes:. - gHistImagePalette - palette used in TH2::Draw(""col""); - gWebImagePalette; The web palette is a set of 216 colors that will not dither or; shift on PCs or Macs. Browsers use this built-in palette when; they need to render colors on monitors with only 256 colors; (also called 8-bit color monitors).; The 6x6x6 web palette provides very quick color index lookup; and can be used for good quality conversion of images into; 2-D histograms.; - TImagePalette(Int_t ncolors, Int_t *colors); if ncolors <= 0 a default palette (see below) of 50 colors; is defined. if ncolors == 1 && colors == 0, then a Rainbow Palette is created. if ncolors > 50 and colors=0, the DeepSea palette is used.; (see TStyle::CreateGradientColorTable for",MatchSource.CODE_COMMENT,graf2d/graf/src/TAttImage.cxx,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/graf2d/graf/src/TAttImage.cxx

The histogram limits times in seconds. If `wmin` and `wmax` are the histogram; limits, the time axis will spread around the time offset value from `TimeOffset+wmin`; to `TimeOffset+wmax`.

Actually it will go from; `TimeOffset+wmin` to `TimeOffset+wmax` where `wmin` and `wmax` are the minimum; and maximum values (in seconds) of the axis. Let's take again an example.

TLatex's purpose is to write mathematical equations. The syntax is very similar; to the Latex's one. It provides several functionalities:. - [Subscripts and Superscripts](\ref L1); - [Fractions](\ref L2); - [Splitting Lines](\ref L3); - [Roots](\ref L4); - [Mathematical Symbols](\ref L5); - [Delimiters](\ref L6); - [Greek Letters](\ref L7); - [Accents](\ref L8); - [Changing Style](\ref L9); - [Alignment Rules](\ref L10); - [Character Adjustment](\ref L11); - [Italic and Boldface](\ref L12); - [Examples](\ref L13); - [Interface to TMathText](\ref L14). When the font precision (see `TAttText`) is low (0 or 1), TLatex is; painted as a normal TText, the control characters are not interpreted. \anchor L1; ## Subscripts and Superscripts; Subscripts and superscripts are made with the `_` and `^`; commands. These commands can be combined to make complicated subscript and; superscript expressions. You may adjust the display of subscripts and; superscripts by using the two functions `SetIndiceSize(Double_t)`,; which set relative size of subscripts and superscripts, and; `SetLimitIndiceSize(Int_t)`, which set limits for text resizing of; subscripts and superscripts. Examples:. Begin_Macro; {; TCanvas *cl = new TCanvas(""cl"",""cl"",10,10,700,500);; TLatex Tl; Tl.SetTextFont(43); Tl.SetTextSize(20);; Double_t dy = 1./7.;; Tl.DrawText(.1, dy, ""x^{2y} :""); Tl.DrawLatex(.5, dy, ""x^{2y}"");; Tl.DrawText(.1, 2*dy, ""x_{2y} :""); Tl.DrawLatex(.5, 2*dy, ""x_{2y}"");; Tl.DrawText(.1, 3*dy, ""x^{y^{2}} :""); Tl.DrawLatex(.5, 3*dy, ""x^{y^{2}}"");; Tl.DrawText(.1, 4*dy, ""x^{y_{1}} :""); Tl.DrawLatex(.5, 4*dy, ""x^{y_{1}}"");; Tl.DrawText(.1, 5*dy, ""x^{y}_{1} :""); Tl.DrawLatex(.5, 5*dy, ""x^{y}_{1}"");; Tl.DrawText(.1, 6*dy, ""x_{1}^{y} :""); Tl.DrawLatex(.5, 6*dy, ""x_{1}^{y}"");; }; End_Macro.

The histogram is put in the legend; using its reference pointer whereas the graph and the function are added; using their names.

TPostScript support two color model RGB and CMYK. CMY and CMYK models are; subtractive color models unlike RGB which is an additive. They are mainly; used for printing purposes. CMY means Cyan Magenta Yellow to convert RGB; to CMY it is enough to do: C=1-R, M=1-G and Y=1-B. CMYK has one more; component K (black).

To zoom using the Adobe SVG Viewer, position the mouse over; the area you want to zoom and click the right button. To define the zoom area,; use Control+drag to mark the boundaries of the zoom area. To pan, use Alt+drag.; By clicking with the right mouse button on the SVG graphics you will get; a pop-up menu giving other ways to interact with the image. SVG files can be used directly in compressed mode to minimize the time; transfer over the network. Compressed SVG files should be created using; `gzip` on a normal ASCII SVG file and should then be renamed; using the file extension `.svgz`.; */; ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////; /// Default SVG constructor",MatchSource.CODE_COMMENT,graf2d/postscript/src/TSVG.cxx,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/graf2d/postscript/src/TSVG.cxx
