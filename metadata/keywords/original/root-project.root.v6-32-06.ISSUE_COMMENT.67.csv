It also made be realize that it might not be a unique case. Previously the user was explicitly/positively listing the libraries to be considered for autoloading (by creating a rootmap file and/or having it listed in one). If I understand correctly this patch now consider all libraries that are on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The fact that some libraries should not be autoloaded (like libNew) means that we probably need to add a 'new feature' to allow the user to remove some libraries from considerations.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4717#issuecomment-571660851

It also made be realize that it might not be a unique case. Previously the user was explicitly/positively listing the libraries to be considered for autoloading (by creating a rootmap file and/or having it listed in one). If I understand correctly this patch now consider all libraries that are on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The fact that some libraries should not be autoloaded (like libNew) means that we probably need to add a 'new feature' to allow the user to remove some libraries from considerations. We can only resolve symbols from libraries which we have a module for. This would bring exactly the same feature for ROOTSYS/lib, however, we will still need some facility for ignoring some system libraries.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4717#issuecomment-571702155

I clearly see your point and I got to admit I was not thinking much about compatibility when I wrote this feature although this is a crucial point for a toolkit like ROOT. About the default value for the constructor everything is totally fine.; About the redefined virtual functions, I am not 100% sure what is the best way to resolve the problem. Probably providing a default value for the new parameter like I did for TAttMarker::SaveMarkerAttributes will not be enough.; I was asking myself whether it is better to overload the virtual function with the additional parameter or to define a complete new function with a different name. Maybe you can give me an advice on how to resolve this problem since am not fully familiar with the concept of virtual functions and the consequences of a particular implementation. All the best,; Simon Spies",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4721#issuecomment-571182962
