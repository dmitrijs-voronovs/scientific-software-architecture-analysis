https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1511:645,Deployability,update,updated,645,"A minor DCT bug that is on my to-fix list when I move the control logic to Python:; The code often prints energies to the output file that were created using outdated intermediates, so they aren't the energy you would actually get using the current cumulant and orbital parameters. This means that even for variational parameters, lowering the residual produces a higher (reported) energy. The two offenders I've noticed are not updating the tau intermediate after a cumulant update and not re-computing the 1RDM and separable contributions to the energy after updating tau. In `dcft_oo_UHF.cc:run_simult_dcft_oo`, for instance, the cumulant is updated on [this line](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/src/psi4/dcft/dcft_oo_UHF.cc#L133), but tau never gets recomputed (`build_tau` and `refine_tau`) until the next iteration of the loop, by which point the energy has already been printed. You can see both problems in the twostep algorithm. Even if it was recomputed, `dcft_compute_uhf:compute_energy_UHF` is never called until the next iteration of the loop either. That function is responsible for re-computing the tau-dependent terms, so the tau-energy contribution would still be one iteration behind. The control logic will need to be re-organized.",MatchSource.ISSUE,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1511

I tested for correctness not only by comparison to basis sets that are on EMSL, but also by reproducing the G2 energy of SO2 reported by Brown and Barber (DOI: 10.1021/j100020a034) within 2E-5 hartrees. The G2 method requires this basis set. I get the same error margin when I try to reproduce their CO2 energies, so I attribute this to them not having converged their geometry tightly.

If what you really want is for the psi4 to work and the libint upgrade was a mistake, downgrade the libint: `conda install libint=1.2.1=h87b9b30_4 -c psi4`. ### what can go wrong with locally-built psi4?. * A major use of the `libint` conda package is to be a detectable pre-built dependency for a from-source psi4 compilation. If the `$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libint.so` to which a psi4 `core.so` is linked suddenly changes identity, psi4 will be deranged.; * To fix this, `cmake` needs to detect the new libint headers and a half-dozen psi4 files need to rebuild.; ```; > cd <objdir>; > rm -rf external/upstream/libint/; > make; # cmake says: -- Found Libint 8: /home/psilocaluser/toolchainconda/envs/p4dev37/lib/libint.so (found version 1.2.1); ```; * If you need to avoid recompiling and instead revert your environment back to the AM6 libint, use the command in the last bullet of the previous section. ### Notes; * Only Linux affected. It took a week to build AM6 on the mac mini, so AM8 is not within reach. Thus, it's possible for the same job to run fine on linux binary but throw an angular momentum error on mac binary.; * `simint` max is AM7 both past and near future. Only `libint` is changing.; * Between higher AM and optimizing for multiple architectures, the new libint pkg is _heavy_, >120mb zipped. For psi4 CI, I'm planning to pull the old AM6 to lessen the strain on Travis. This won't help downstream projects that summon a built psi4 to test their addon.; * I haven't posted the AM8 package yet, as I want the stack to finish building, and I wanted to give you all a heads-up. I'll post to this issue when the package goes up. Will only be in `-c psi4/label/dev` for now, not `-c psi4`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1533

https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1574:131,Availability,error,errors,131,"I have been modifying my gdma code so that it can handle h functions. It's a fairly straightforward change, but I found that I got errors in the multipoles when there were h functions in the basis. In particular, the total charge was always nonzero. Repeated checks found no errors in the gdma code. Finally I found that there is a bug in the treatment of h functions in Psi4, or at least an inconsistency with d, f and g. If the normalization factor for z^2 exp(-zeta r^2) is N, then the factor for xy exp(-zeta r^2) is \sqrt(3)N -- it needs the extra sqrt(3). Similarly z^5, xz^4, x^2z^3, xyz^3 and x^2y^2z cartesian h functions all need different normalization factors. If the gdma code takes account of these as it does for d, f and g, I get the errors. If however I treat them all as having the same normalization factor as z^5, I get sensible results -- total charges are now zero.

Better for weak interactions, but no time savings/no screening); - [x] extends `DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME` keyword with:; - [x] Treutler grid pruning ``TREUTLER``; - [x] a more robust grid pruning variant of it ``ROBUST``; - [x] new variables: ``XC GRID TOTAL POINTS``, ``XC GRID SPHERICAL POINTS``, ``XC GRID RADIAL POINTS``; - [x] `print > 2` adds (existing but unused) debug grid print out; - [x] tight DFT tests are updated with new values due to the new Bragg-Slater radii used; - [x] testing and error overview; - [x] option to properly disable all pruning (currently only indirect way); - [x] tests below indicate a reduction of the grid size by 30 and 45% using `ROBUST` and `TREUTLER` pruning, respectively. This leads to a 15-20% speed up for small molecules.; - [x] the following tests have been updated because of the new BS radii: `dft-b3lyp`; `dft-custom-mgga`, `dft-grad-lr1`, `dft-grad-lr3`, `dft-grad-meta`, `dft-grad1`, `dft-grad2`, `dft-omega`, `dft-psivar`, `dft-vv10`, `dft1`, `dftd3-grad`, `dftd3-version`, `frac-traverse`, `opt13`, `pcmsolver-dft`, `pcmsolver-dipole`; - [x] new test: `dft-pruning`. ## Questions; - Pruning enabled by default? -> not this PR, but after further testing yes. ## Checklist; - [x] Documentation; - [x] Pruning Tests added; - [x] All relevant `ctests` pass; (http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_plannin",MatchSource.ISSUE,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1591

I believe, that the problem occurs in the line `138` of `diatomic.py`, i.e. on the line; ```; we = 5.3088375e-11 * np.sqrt(d2/mu); ```. where, as we can see, is `d2/mu`, which is considered a `nan` by `numpy.sqrt()` function. I've tried it separately from Psi4 and its exhibiting the same behavior. . ```; >>> numpy.sqrt(-0.02414940264774275 / 1.1626325532182573e-26); __main__:1: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in sqrt; nan; ```. Is there anything, that can be done to prevent this problem?. ---. ### My software versions:. * Ubuntu 18.10; * Psi4 1.3; * Python 3.7.3; * Numpy 1.16.2. ---. ### Full output file. ```. -----------------------------------------------------------------------; Psi4: An Open-Source Ab Initio Electronic Structure Package; Psi4 1.3 release.

I find that there already exists an option for allowing fractional occupation number (FON) to accelerate SCF, so it should be handy to extend it to finite temperature DFT by allowing FON for the converged wavefunction. Specifically, the FONs with Fermi-Dirac distribution smearing Gaussian smearing are most commonly used. Reference: Springborg, Michael, R. C.

The E(30)ind correction is given by Eq. (72) of JCP 125, 154107 (2006), which stems from evaluating the matrix elements in Eq. (75) using the second-order induction amplitudes in Eq. (79). Psi4 proceeds slightly differently, by actually evaluating the induction amplitudes from Eq. (79) (as far as I can see, the code in psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libsapt_solver/amplitudes.cc matches Eq. (79) exactly) and contracting them with the \omega electrostatic potential matrix elements in psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libsapt_solver/ind30.cc in SAPT2p3::ind30(). The problem is that this algorithm accounts for the first 2 matrix elements in Eq. (75) but not for the last one, <VS_AS_B>. Unless I understand something incorrectly, the Psi4 code is missing the <VS_AS_B> contribution in E(30)ind. Going now back to Eq. (72), it is easy to prove that <VS_AS_B>=4s^r_a v^{ab}_{rs} s^s_b, that is, it contributes a quarter of the last term in Eq. (72). Our working hypothesis was that, because of the omission of this term, E(30)ind programmed in Psi4 has the last term in Eq. (72) multiplied by 12 instead of 16. Therefore, Jonathan modified his Psi4NumPy E(30)ind code to include this last term with the incorrect factor of 12, and now his values are matching Psi4 perfectly! In other words, we are quite certain that the Psi4 implementation includes the last term in Eq. (72) with an erroneous factor of 12 instead of 16. Fortunately, this doesn’t affect the SAPT2+(3) or SAPT2+3 results that also include delta HF, but it will (slightly) affect the third-order SAPT results computed without delta HF. I think the E(30)ind,resp code is fine but the wrong E(30)ind will slightly affect the scaled approximated value of E(30)exch-ind,resp.

https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1677:6,Testability,test,testing,6,"While testing out some enhancements to third-order SAPT, Jonathan Waldrop and I seem to have found a bug in the E(30)ind implementation in psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libsapt_solver/ind30.cc. The E(30)ind correction is given by Eq. (72) of JCP 125, 154107 (2006), which stems from evaluating the matrix elements in Eq. (75) using the second-order induction amplitudes in Eq. (79). Psi4 proceeds slightly differently, by actually evaluating the induction amplitudes from Eq. (79) (as far as I can see, the code in psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libsapt_solver/amplitudes.cc matches Eq. (79) exactly) and contracting them with the \omega electrostatic potential matrix elements in psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libsapt_solver/ind30.cc in SAPT2p3::ind30(). The problem is that this algorithm accounts for the first 2 matrix elements in Eq. (75) but not for the last one, <VS_AS_B>. Unless I understand something incorrectly, the Psi4 code is missing the <VS_AS_B> contribution in E(30)ind. Going now back to Eq. (72), it is easy to prove that <VS_AS_B>=4s^r_a v^{ab}_{rs} s^s_b, that is, it contributes a quarter of the last term in Eq. (72). Our working hypothesis was that, because of the omission of this term, E(30)ind programmed in Psi4 has the last term in Eq. (72) multiplied by 12 instead of 16.

Noticeably, pulling an electron from the homo-3 and homo-4 require some crafty work, but **I have managed to converge this calculations with several basis sets and in DFT, too, using damping and other tricks, all in PSI4 1.1. Energies are qualitatively the same alway**s. All the output files are attached, in psython mode (I could not make MOM to work from python). Now then, I wanted to check some things, so I printed the density matrices from .fchk files and plugged them to PySCF, projecting them properly and so on, just to evaluate the energy with UHF on top of those density matrices. I get the same energies for the neutral molecule and the homo, homo-1 and homo-2 cations. I get VERY different energies from the homo-3 and homo-4 states. Now thats weird, because the energies above make sense. So I assumed, okay, maybe there's something odd with the .fchk writer module. I've seen its been updated, so lets try a newer version of PSI4. So I got the 1.4a2.dev78 and tried to run my calculations using the newest available dev release, from scratch. I get exactly the same energies, except for the homo-4 state, for which I get some very funky results:. [psi4_14.tar.gz](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/files/3469641/psi4_14.tar.gz).

And that's the story! I would try to read the .fchk files and see if I can evaluate the UHF energy on top of them with Psi4 intead of PySCF next, but this thing appeared and I guess some checks are due to know what is going on.

Do i need to install psi4 with `conda`, or can i keep my current installation as it is? I'd rather not install psi4 using `conda-forge` as it is really slow, while the PPA is pretty fast.

https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1717:861,Availability,error,error,861,"## Description; While working on a _different_ PR for the dcft code, I stumbled across a bug that I had accidentally introduced in #1310. DCFT previously allowed you to use the amplitudes from a previous computation as your guess for the next one by setting `dcft_guess dcft`. Key to this mechanism was the fact that the LibDPD files persisted after the computation... which is precisely what I changed in #1310 to fix #1309, where intermediate files would interfere with the amplitude guess. The primary purpose of this PR is to both keep the guess feature working and keep issue #1309 fixed. This is accomplished by checking if `dcft_guess` is `dcft` at the time of `compute_energy` and choosing whether or not to nuke previous files. So past intermediate files will interfere only when you want them to. There are also some related changes: adding a helpful error message to replace the PSIO error that appears when the past files don't exist, adding a test case to prevent a repeat of this little mess, removing some dead code, and per discussions with @jturney, moving some tensors from the libtrans libdpd to the dcft libdpd if they were more than integrals. The other `dcft` PR will be coming as soon as this one is merged in: another bugfix, and (finally!) the transition from `dcft` to `dct`. Obligatory @ssh2 notification. ## Todos; Notable points (developer or user-interest) that this PR has or will accomplish.; - [x] Restore `dcft_guess dcft` functionality; - [x] Move tensors (DCT's amplitudes and ""generalized"" Fock matrix) from the `libtrans` dpd buffer to the `dcft` buffer; - [x] Add a test for `dcft_guess`; - [x] Eliminate one obnoxious PSIO_ERROR. ## Checklist; - [x] Tests added for any newly working features; - [x] All 14 `dcft` tests pass. ## Status; - [x] Ready for review; - [x] Ready for merge",MatchSource.ISSUE,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1717

The opposite direction (i.e. using Psi4 SCF results in adcc) is already implemented and working, see the [adcc manual](https://adc-connect.org/calculations.html#general-adc-n-calculations), so this should mainly be an effort of connecting the strings together on the Psi4 side. Currently I am still very much in the planning phase of this PR, thankful for any early pointers or feedback to get me moving in a sensible direction.

This was previously done by `integraltransform_oei.cc:trans_one`. As this function has other responsibilities, `trans_one` is preserved. Compared to the previous interface, there are three key changes.; 1. Callers can pass in blocks of the OPDM/Lagrangian. This gives callers flexibility to pass in `oo` and `vv` and `ov` and `vo` blocks separately if available, and to not pass in a block that is conjugate to another block already passed in. This is frequently the case.; 2. Callers pass in these blocks as a map from orbital space labels to a SharedMatrix containing the relevant block and are responsible for attaching this to the wavefunction object via the `Da`, `Db`, and `X` member variables. This is the most important point for this section! All codes except `cc` already store the OPDM/Lagrangian as `SharedMatrix` objects, so this is the path of least resistance. The one holdout predates `libmints` and instead uses a `libmints` `Matrix`-like structure. (See discussion in Step Four.) Existing code had to perform many an astounding number of type conversions to ultimately convert back to the type we had originally. `dct`, for instance, went `SharedMatrix` -> `file2` -> QTOrdered Block Matrix -> PSIO Entry -> Lower Triangle -> Block Matrix -> Lower Triangle -> PSIO Entry -> `SharedMatrix`.

When you use a `Matrix`, the transformation reduces to a `linalg::triplet` call.; 3. Lastly, prefactors. Because it's ambiguous what you call the Lagrangian, I'm going to use as a point of reference ""the thing you contract against the overlap derivatives"", because that is pefectly unambiguous. In the old code, you'd send -2 times that thing. Now, you send -1 times that thing. This is necessary for consistency with how the SCF code determines the value of the Lagrangian on a wavefunction object. If you want an example for how this works, see the newly added code in `dct_gradient_UHF.cc:compute_ewdm_odc`. With these changes, 30 lines of code replaces about 230.

This was previously done by `integraltransform_oei.cc:trans_one`. As this function has other responsibilities, `trans_one` is preserved. Compared to the previous interface, there are three key changes.; 1. Callers can pass in blocks of the OPDM/Lagrangian. This gives callers flexibility to pass in `oo` and `vv` and `ov` and `vo` blocks separately if available, and to not pass in a block that is conjugate to another block already passed in. This is frequently the case.; 2. Callers pass in these blocks as a map from orbital space labels to a SharedMatrix containing the relevant block and are responsible for attaching this to the wavefunction object via the `Da`, `Db`, and `X` member variables. This is the most important point for this section! All codes except `cc` already store the OPDM/Lagrangian as `SharedMatrix` objects, so this is the path of least resistance. The one holdout predates `libmints` and instead uses a `libmints` `Matrix`-like structure. (See discussion in Step Four.) Existing code had to perform many an astounding number of type conversions to ultimately convert back to the type we had originally. `dct`, for instance, went `SharedMatrix` -> `file2` -> QTOrdered Block Matrix -> PSIO Entry -> Lower Triangle -> Block Matrix -> Lower Triangle -> PSIO Entry -> `SharedMatrix`. We now stay in a `SharedMatrix` the entire time. This type change is why `integraltransform_oei.cc:trans_one` is not used in th",MatchSource.ISSUE,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1745

When you use a `Matrix`, the transformation reduces to a `linalg::triplet` call.; 3. Lastly, prefactors. Because it's ambiguous what you call the Lagrangian, I'm going to use as a point of reference ""the thing you contract against the overlap derivatives"", because that is pefectly unambiguous. In the old code, you'd send -2 times that thing. Now, you send -1 times that thing. This is necessary for consistency with how the SCF code determines the value of the Lagrangian on a wavefunction object. If you want an example for how this works, see the newly added code in `dct_gradient_UHF.cc:compute_ewdm_odc`.

The next question is what we do about this. I see two solutions:; 1. Put a flag in sotoao that throws if `include_pure_transform_` is true. I've run this change through full tests and didn't get any errors. However, somebody can assume `sotoao()` is the transpose of `aotoso()` and get rubbish.; 2.

I determined by comparison to my own Psi4Numpy implementation of DF-OMP2 that this was an error in the `dfocc` module and eventually tracked it down to `dfocc` sending the wrong orbitals to `OEProp`. The primary purpose of this PR was to fix that and get density-fitted orbital optimized properties hooked up to the driver. ...Unfortunately, adding a test that the remaining dipoles are correct required me to fix some other standing `dfocc` issues that prevent users from setting tight convergence (#1143). That in turn required quite a few test changes. While working through that, I also solved #1509. The 0.7 mHartree difference I was seeing was due to another bug in `dfocc`.

The problem is that I started to renormalize the overlap matrix before doing the eigendecomposition. However, it turns out that there's no (simple?) way to renormalize **and** still have a symmetric orthogonalizing matrix **X**. . Namely, the natural way to get the right normalization out is that you. 1. normalize `S`: `Snorm = diag(1.0/sqrt(S)) * S * diag(1.0/sqrt(S))`; 2. form `Xnorm` for `Snorm`; 3. form `X = diag(1.0/sqrt(S)) * Xnorm`. Trying to do step 3 in a way that maintains symmetricity of `X` would require much deeper linear algebra, as you need to know how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors change when you balance S to have a unit diagonal. (It may be that some old linear algebra textbooks show how this is done.). Anyway, IMHO there's nothing wrong with having an asymmetric `X`: if you have a linearly dependent basis, this is bound to happen, and so there's no reason to assume `X` is symmetric. All that matters in the end is the number of molecular orbitals you get from `X`, since the SCF (or even the core Hamiltonian) will give you a basis that is different from `X`. The asymmetric `X` revealed a problem in the initialization of the ROHF code, which is now fixed. ROHF should now also work for the case of canonical orthogonalization, I'm not sure why there ever was a stopping clause. A problem was also found in CUHF, which wasn't tested before.

Trying to do step 3 in a way that maintains symmetricity of `X` would require much deeper linear algebra, as you need to know how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors change when you balance S to have a unit diagonal. (It may be that some old linear algebra textbooks show how this is done.). Anyway, IMHO there's nothing wrong with having an asymmetric `X`: if you have a linearly dependent basis, this is bound to happen, and so there's no reason to assume `X` is symmetric. All that matters in the end is the number of molecular orbitals you get from `X`, since the SCF (or even the core Hamiltonian) will give you a basis that is different from `X`. The asymmetric `X` revealed a problem in the initialization of the ROHF code, which is now fixed. ROHF should now also work for the case of canonical orthogonalization, I'm not sure why there ever was a stopping clause. A problem was also found in CUHF, which wasn't tested before.

Unsurprisingly, the nuclear repulsion energies disagree between the two, and Psi reports a [validation error](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/driver/qcdb/cfour.py#L597).",MatchSource.ISSUE,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1784

This PR fixes #1808 and condenses some of the relevant code. The bug is discussed in detail at https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1808. Briefly, OMP2.5 theory has two sets of amplitudes, T2(1) and T2(2). Compared to the very similar OMP3 theory, it halves certain terms. OCC implemented this by halving the T2(2) amplitudes instead of halving intermediates that use them. While the intermediates will be correct, this has the side-effect of changing the T2(2) amplitudes from their current values, so they do not converge. This PR changes the implementation so the necessary terms are halved, but not the T2(2) amplitudes. Now they converge properly and agree better with my Psi4Numpy implementation of OMP2.5.

However, although I can find the integrals in `libmints`, I'm unable to see where the code is called. I was thinking that if one-electron integrals are now faster (related to PCM?), implementing a seminumerical exchange algorithm should be relatively straightforward. It might be really beneficial in Psi4 since although RI is really fast, exact integrals are quite slow at present, which is a problem for e.g. benchmark calculations that would be feasible with a seminumerical approach.",MatchSource.ISSUE,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1818

https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1829:380,Availability,failure,failure,380,"## Description; Think of the default orbital optimization algorithm in OCC with the following pseudocode:; ```; orbital_gradient = compute_orbital_gradient(); try:; orbital_step = compute_NR_step_via_PCG_with_HF_MO_hessian(orbital_gradient); except ConvergenceError:; orbital_step = compute_step_with_crude_diagonal_MO_hessian(orbital_gradient); diis_step(); ```. I traced a test failure in an upcoming PR (ocepa-grad2) to a failure in the approximate NR step. Five failures, in fact.; 1. The HF MO Hessian couples alpha and beta IDPs. You need a single alpha, not a different alpha for each spin.; 2. For the same reason, you need a single beta.; 3. The Fock term assumed semicanonical orbitals. OCC does not use semicanonical orbitals.; 4. The Fock matrix was acting on the wrong vector.; 5. One of the tensor contractions involving TEI was incorrect. After fixing those five bugs, I observed three things:; 1. After accounting for whether you index by (v,o) or (o, v), the matrix-vector products of the new occ implementation match those of the SOUHF P4N tutorials,; 2. The X (kappa) converged to does satisfy Ax=b; 3. The orbital equations refuse to converge. My conclusion is that the implementation of the algorithm is now correct, but it's not a good way to generate orbital steps. The off-diagonal terms can end up being significant for the open-shell systems that would lead you to use an orbital-optimized method. This didn't cause obvious problems before because the previous errors rendered the PCG procedure non-convergent, so you would always fall back to the crude diagonal step _unless_ your orbital gradient was so low that you didn't need to iterate at all. So what we expect to see from this bug is difficulties converging occ tightly, which has been my experience. To remedy the situation, the default orbital step is now the crude semicanonical step.

This didn't cause obvious problems before because the previous errors rendered the PCG procedure non-convergent, so you would always fall back to the crude diagonal step _unless_ your orbital gradient was so low that you didn't need to iterate at all. So what we expect to see from this bug is difficulties converging occ tightly, which has been my experience. To remedy the situation, the default orbital step is now the crude semicanonical step. The next PR should be the final one in the series. I'll just need to rebase it onto this one, repair the two tests I mentioned on broken tests, and confirm the test suite is clean.
