Because Pythia8 is; also written in C++, its functions/classes can be called directly from a; compiled C++ script.; To call Pythia functions not available in this interface a dictionary must; be generated.; see $ROOTSYS/tutorials/pythia/pythia8.C for an example of use from CINT. | |; | *------------------------------------------------------------------------------* |; | | | |; | | | |; | | PPP Y Y TTTTT H H III A Welcome to the Lund Monte Carlo! | |; | | P P Y Y T H H I A A This is PYTHIA version 8.100 | |; | | PPP Y T HHHHH I AAAAA Last date of change: 20 Oct 2007 | |; | | P Y T H H I A A | |; | | P Y T H H III A A Now is 27 Oct 2007 at 18:26:53 | |; | | | |; | | Main author: Torbjorn Sjostrand; CERN/PH, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland, | |; | | and Department of Theoretical Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; | |; | | phone: + 41 - 22 - 767 82 27; e-mail: torbjorn@thep.lu.se | |; | | Author: Stephen Mrenna; Computing Division, Simulations Group, | |; | | Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, MS 234, Batavia, IL 60510, USA; | |; | | phone: + 1 - 630 - 840 - 2556; e-mail: mrenna@fnal.gov | |; | | Author: Peter Skands; CERN/PH, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland, | |; | | and Theoretical Physics Department, | |; | | Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, MS 106, Batavia, IL 60510, USA; | |; | | phone: + 41 - 22 - 767 24 59; e-mail: skands@fnal.gov | |; | | | |; | | The main program reference is the 'Brief Introduction to PYTHIA 8.1', | |; | | T.

ROOT; » CORE; » BASE; » TQCommand. class TQCommand: public TList, public TQObject. The Command design pattern is based on the idea, that all editing; in an application is done by creating instances of command objects.; Command objects apply changes to the edited object and then are; stored on a command stack. Furthermore, each command knows how to; undo its changes to bring the edited object back to its previous; state. As long as the application only uses command objects to; change the state of the edited object, it is possible to undo; a sequence of commands by traversing the command stack downwards and; calling the ""undo"" method of each command in turn. It is also; possible to redo a sequence of commands by traversing the command; stack upwards and calling the ""redo"" method of each command. Examples:. 1. Create a new command. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)""; ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 1st parameter - the name of class; 2nd parameter - object; 3rd parameter - the name of do/redo method; 4th parameter - the name of undo method. Since redo,undo methods are the same, undo name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. For objects derived from TObject class name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 2. Setting undo, redo parameters. Color_t old_color = hpx->GetFillColor();; Color_t new_color = 4; // blue color. com->SetRedoArgs(1, new_color);; com->SetUndoArgs(1, old_color);. 1st argument - the number of undo, redo parameters; the other arguments - undo, redo values.

This is the ROOT implementation of the Qt object communication; mechanism (see also http://www.troll.no/qt/metaobjects.html). Signals and slots are used for communication between objects.; When an object has changed in some way that might be interesting; for the outside world, it emits a signal to tell whoever is; listening. All slots that are connected to this signal will be; activated (called). It is even possible to connect a signal; directly to another signal (this will emit the second signal; immediately whenever the first is emitted.) There is no limitation; on the number of slots that can be connected to a signal.; The slots will be activated in the order they were connected; to the signal.

This widget can be used as a Qt ""custom widget""; to build a custom GUI interfaces with Qt Designer. The class emits the Qt signals and has Qt public slots. Public slots: (Qt). virtual void cd(); // make the associated TCanvas the current one (shortcut to TCanvas::cd()); virtual void cd(int subpadnumber); // as above - shortcut to Canvas::cd(int subpadnumber); void Disconnect(); // disconnect the QWidget from the ROOT TCanvas (used in the class dtor); void Refresh(); // force the associated TCanvas::Update to be called; virtual bool Save(const QString &fileName) const; // Save the widget image with some ppixmap file; virtual bool Save(const char *fileName) const;; virtual bool Save(const QString &fileName,const char *format,int quality=60) const;; virtual bool Save(const char *fileName,const char *format,int quality=60) const;. signals (Qt). CanvasPainted(); // Signal the TCanvas has been painted onto the screen; Saved(bool ok); // Signal the TCanvas has been saved into the file; RootEventProcessed(TObject *selected, unsigned int event, TCanvas *c);; // Signal the Qt mouse/keyboard event has been process by ROOT; // This ""signal"" is emitted by the enabled mouse events only.; // See: EnableSignalEvents; // --- DisableSignalEvents. public methods:; The methods below define whether the TQtWidget object emits ""RootEventProcessed"" Qt signals; (By default no RootEventProcessed Qt signal is emitted ); void EnableSignalEvents (UInt_t f); void DisableSignalEve",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html602/TQtWidget.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html602/TQtWidget.html

ROOT; » MATH; » PHYSICS; » TQuaternion. class TQuaternion: public TObject. A Quaternion Class. Quaternion is a 4-component mathematic object quite convenient when dealing with; space rotation (or reference frame transformation). . In short, think of quaternion Q as a 3-vector augmented by a real number. Q = Q|r + Q|V; Quaternion multiplication :. Quaternion multiplication is given by :; Q.Q' = (Q|r + Q|V )*( Q'|r + Q'|V); = [ Q|r*Q'|r - Q|V*Q'|V ] + [ Q|r*Q'|V + Q'|r*Q|V + Q|V X Q'|V ]; ; where :; Q|r*Q'|r is a real number product of real numbers; Q|V*Q'|V is a real number, scalar product of two 3-vectors; Q|r*Q'|V is a 3-vector, scaling of a 3-vector by a real number; Q|VXQ'|V is a 3-vector, cross product of two 3-vectors; ; Thus, quaternion product is a generalization of real number product and product of a vector by a real number. Product of two pure vectors gives a quaternion whose real part is the opposite of scalar product and the vector part the cross product.; ; The conjugate of a quaternion Q = Q|r + Q|V is Q_bar = Q|r - Q|V. The magnitude of a quaternion Q is given by |Q|� = Q.Q_bar = Q_bar.Q = Q�|r + |Q|V|�; ; Therefore, the inverse of a quaternion is Q-1 = Q_bar /|Q|�; ; ""unit"" quaternion is a quaternion of magnitude 1 : |Q|� = 1.; Unit quaternions are a subset of the quaternions set.; ; Quaternion and rotations :. A rotation of angle f around a given axis, is represented by a unit quaternion Q :; - The axis of the rotation is given by the vector part of Q.; - The ratio between the magnitude of the vector part and the real part of Q equals tan(f/2).; ; In other words : Q = Q|r + Q|V = cos(f/2) + sin(f/2).; (where u is a unit vector // to the rotation axis,; cos(f/2) is the real part, sin(f/2).u is the vector part)",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html602/TQuaternion.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html602/TQuaternion.html
https://root.cern/root/html602/TQuaternion.html:3780,Performance,optimiz,optimized,3780," -Q|V is its inverse quaternion.; ; One verifies that :; Q.Q-1 = Q-1.Q = Q|r*Q|r + Q|V*Q|V + Q|r*Q|V -Q|r*Q|V + Q|VXQ|V; = Q�|r + Q�|V = 1; . The rotation of a vector V by the rotation described by a unit quaternion Q is obtained by the following operation : V' = Q*V*Q-1, considering V as a quaternion whose real part is null.; ; Numeric computation considerations :. Numerically, the quaternion multiplication involves 12 additions and 16 multiplications.; It is therefore faster than 3x3 matrixes multiplication involving 18 additions and 27 multiplications.; ; On the contrary, rotation of a vector by the above formula ( Q*V*Q-1 ) involves 18 additions and 24 multiplications, whereas multiplication of a 3-vector by a 3x3 matrix involves only 6 additions and 9 multiplications.; ; When dealing with numerous composition of space rotation, it is therefore faster to use quaternion product. On the other hand if a huge set of vectors must be rotated by a given quaternion, it is more optimized to convert the quaternion into a rotation matrix once, and then use that later to rotate the set of vectors.; ; More information :. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation .; . en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion .; ; _______________________________________________; ; This Class represents all quaternions (unit or non-unit); It possesses a Normalize() method to make a given quaternion unit; The Rotate(TVector3&) and Rotation(TVector3&) methods can be used even for a non-unit quaternion, in that case, the proper normalization is applied to perform the rotation.; ; A TRotation constructor exists than takes a quaternion for parameter (even non-unit), in that cas the proper normalisation is applied.; .

The Command design pattern is based on the idea, that all editing; in an application is done by creating instances of command objects.; Command objects apply changes to the edited object and then are; stored on a command stack.

TH1::FillRandom(TH1 *) or TH1::FillRandom(const char *tf1name). can be used to fill an histogram (1-d, 2-d, 3-d from an existing histogram; or from an existing function. Note this interesting feature when working with objects. You can use several TRandom objects, each with their ""independent""; random sequence. For example, one can imagine; TRandom *eventGenerator = new TRandom();; TRandom *tracking = new TRandom();; eventGenerator can be used to generate the event kinematics.; tracking can be used to track the generated particles with random numbers; independent from eventGenerator.; This very interesting feature gives the possibility to work with simple; and very fast random number generators without worrying about; random number periodicity as it was the case with Fortran.; One can use TRandom::SetSeed to modify the seed of one generator. a TRandom object may be written to a Root file. -as part of another object; -or with its own key (example gRandom->Write(""Random"");.
