But as we have a bunch of working 2D airfoils in regression already I recon that adding a clear explanation and warning to the cfg as suggested by Pedro is fine.

If high turbulence kinetic energy(TKE) and Mach number condition, the boundary condition cannot be maintained the imposed value. (I think there seems to be a bug in the temperature calculation using total energy when including the TKE). The introduction of C1 was intended to provide a 'temporary' solution at the level of first aid (simply commenting out conditional statements in code).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1851#issuecomment-1521383702

I think I figured it out and it‚Äôs a weird one‚Ä¶ In short: it was the thermal conductivities, but not for the reason we think. They are divided by a denom term that depends on a value a that indeed goes to nan if any free-stream concentrations are zero. However, the reason it doesn‚Äôt diverge immediately is if that denom term is less than eps, the thermal conductivity is set to zero, so thermal conductivity was always zero which is why it blew up after a few iters rather than the first one.; Fix: FS concentrations > 0, but also have to remove the if-statement that sets k_tr to zero. The denom term is order 1E-21 and always less than eps, so with that in the code it is always 0.

With [minimal.cpp.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/10459977/minimal.cpp.txt) (remove the .txt), OpenMPI gives the following results:; ```bash; $ mpic++ minimal.cpp -o minimal ; $ mpirun -np 1 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = -42 100 ; $ mpirun -np 2 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; Rank 1 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; ```; This is in line with the expected behaviour of `MPI_Allgatherv` described above. For MPICH however, I get:; ```bash; $ mpicxx.mpich minimal.cpp -o minimal; $ mpirun.mpich -np 1 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = 100 0 ; $ mpirun.mpich -np 2 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; Rank 1 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; ```; as if `displs` were ignored for `-np 1`. @pcarruscag Can you confirm this observation? Do you think that my understanding of the expected behaviour of `MPI_Allgatherv` is correct?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1893#issuecomment-1397436501

Would that be a nice addition?; 3. I couldn't find any python wrapper tests among the parallel AD and hybrid AD tests.

No need to create dummy points for periodic BC is really an ingenious design and when I run RANS/URANS cases, I get good results.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2075#issuecomment-1627815111:1150,Modifiability,portab,portable,1150,"I think the way the prefix is set up is fine. My suggestion is more about where things go under $prefix. For python scripts meant to be used as executables... I'd put these directly under `$prefix/bin`, e.g. on my system, `/usr/bin/foo.py` and be sure that foo.py has execute permission. Python modules meant to be imported ... I'd put these in <somewhere>/python3.x/site-packages or let pip decide where to put them. So `foo.py` could end up in two different places, I guess. Concrete example: I just installed and ended up with:; ```; /usr/bin/SU2_Nastran/; /usr/bin/SU2_Nastran/pysu2_nastran.py; /usr/bin/SU2_Nastran/__init__.py; ```; Instead, a better setup might be:. `/usr/bin/pysu2_nastran.py` (with mode 755). and. ```; /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/SU2_Nastran/; /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/SU2_Nastran/pysu2_nastran.py; /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/SU2_Nastran/__init__.py; ```. Whereby /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages is right for my system, but other systems will have their own place to install modules. That's where I suspect pip might be helpful.

Please let me know if not however - I am not familiar with the specifics of multigrid and its implementation. Note that the commits above presume that values specified in `CustomBoundaryTemperature` and `CustomBoundaryHeatFlux` in `CGeometry` are dimensional, regardless if SU2 is in nondimensional mode. It might make more sense to have these be nondimensional and just ensure that incoming default values from a `MARKER_ISOTHERMAL` and `MARKER_HEATFLUX` are nondimensionalized appropriately, but in my opinion it is more straightforward to have users set dimensional temperatures and heat fluxes. However, then it would also make sense to return dimensional heat fluxes and temperatures as well for Python custom walls which I am not sure is currently how it is done. Apologies for the long explanation, but curious to hear your input on this.

Something like `--medi=/path/to/installed/medi` and such ? pkgconfig or other auto-detection mechanisms usually work, but sometimes it doesn't, and explicit workarounds sometimes help. . I also don't see other packages that end up in externals, such as `metis`, `parmetis`, `autotools`, `catch2`. I am not sure how those are used (or if they are used), but I noticed folders for them in the `externals` folder.

Would be very interesting to add this to develop, looking forward to using it actually.; > ; > Hi @bigfooted, unfortunately I do not have enough time/computational power to perform a proper validation. I only tried something with a NACA0021 at 17 deg and 60 deg and they were promising, at least for the DDES implementation. The SAS ones are not that good. I'll upload some post-processing as soon as I have the time to do so. Hi @rois1995, I believe there is an error or a typo in the Babu's paper in the Q_SAS source term and in turn in your implementation, which may be the reason for the poor performance in SAS results. . ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5791d344-967a-4cc5-b512-457b7fe61435).

I have also experienced an issue where the NSpan is calculated is much larger (maybe max value of unisgned short I'm not sure). @LorenzoFabris if you notice this issue with any meshes try regenerating but keep the original and we can try and determine the difference between the two?

In my experience MUSCL reconstruction at boundaries in SU2 is ""incorrect"" as it doesn't take into account the boundary condition applied and just assumed ```v_i = v_j```, as far as I have understood from scouring the code. This usually is a small first order approximation locally, but with complex EoS or unlucky combinations of BCs and numerical settings it can cause unphysical solutions and crashes. In a project of mine I have had some success by either disabling MUSCL outright at boundaries (very conservative and brutal solution), or disable it only at specific kinds of corners, which requires more memory unfortunately as one needs to somehow save if the node is a corner, etc. The ""real solution"" would be to either save the boundary solution in ghost nodes and use it for the gradient computation, or fix gradients in post-process with a small performance penalty.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2266#issuecomment-2107217617

When a corner is shared between an inlet and a wall, the inlet has to take into account that the node is shared by a wall (it has to know about no-slip for instance).; But it is good to know that MUSCL has issues at boundaries as well, this should definitely be fixed. If you can spare a couple of minutes, can you create an Issue here on github for MUSCL not being high order/robust on boundaries and share your experience?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2266#issuecomment-2108623088

I have already created a fork of the master branch. Do i just make pull request to submit my changes or is there something else I should do?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2274#issuecomment-2102637760

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2276#issuecomment-2100775569:187,Testability,test,testcase,187,"As mentioned previously I would be surprised if the fix implemented in c97610b is the source of the issue as I would expect the other turbomachinery cases to fail as well. Looking at the testcase there would be two things I would try. 1. Converge the solution very tightly, however I expect that this may be difficult, save the converged solution. Restart the solver and run for 1 iteration and compare the results of the two. Inspect the solution and see if there is anything obvious, this may give a hint as to where the problem lay. Maybe also include linear solver information in the output to see if the desired convergence is being achieved in the initial iterations. 2. Furthermore inspect the residuals of the initial converged solution as it approaches the restart point, a jump in residuals could indicate that the solver is not converging smoothly before the termination of the initial solution. I suggest maybe increasing the value of ENTROPY_FIX_COEFF, say 0.1 and see what happens. If you can't converge the solution tightly in point 1, apply the increased entropy fix in point 2 and retry. If you would like @alecappiello once you have tried this we can organise a call to discuss early next week.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2276#issuecomment-2100775569

I checked this for the serial test cases in the test file's ""turbomachinery"" section. - `aachen_turbine_restart`: iterations both with `jSpan == 0` and `jSpan == nSpanDonor - 1` have an effect, the latter trigger the memory access violations; - `jones_turbocharger_restart`: some iterations with `jSpan == 0` have an effect, but iterations for larger `jSpan` usually overwrite the results; also, the case `jSpan == 0` does not trigger the memory access violation; - `axial_stage2D`: the problematic code is not executed by this test case; - `transonic_stator_restart`: the problematic code is not executed by this test case.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2285#issuecomment-2124781449:1693,Usability,simpl,simply,1693," the solution at the inlet corner is completely wrong, while the outlet is ok most likely because characteristics are outgoing as it is supersonic. The artifacts disappear if we disable MUSCL everywhere (1st order solution) or disable it only on boundaries (not ideal solution, but disabling only on corners would still be good enough for now I believe).

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2329#issuecomment-2252659742:938,Modifiability,layers,layers,938,"Hi,. The use of an Omega production limiter (about the cross-diffusion term) is correct for low-Reynolds-number (LRN) models (the approach described by Peng et al. is very naive; there are other more rigorous treatments). For high-Reynolds-number (HRN) models, the clipping should be zero, keeping the cross-diffusion term positive; thus, the current implementation is correct. Indeed, it is not exactly as it appears in Menter's original publication. The factor (1-F1) aimed to promise that the cross-diffusion term will be activated only outside the boundary layer, where it is positive (the cross-diffusion term switches its sign deep inside the boundary layer). This was also recognized by Peng et al. (first paragraph above Eq. 17). However, it may happen that the factor (1-F1)=1 where the cross-diffusion term is negative. Usually, it may happen at the wake, very near the airfoil trailing edge, where the upper and lower boundary layers merge. It is due to the imperfection of the F1 function. To summarize, the current implementation is correct, and it is perfect for HRN models.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2329#issuecomment-2252659742

He agreed that the factor (1-F1) should activate the CD term only at the ""k-epsilon"" branch, where the CD term is already positive.; Therefore, clipping with zero is in terms of the model and is not incorrect. Me: A simple boundary layer simulation will reveal that the CD term switch sign is inside the boundary layer and that the F1 function switches from 1 to zero outside the boundary layer. Namely, the CD term should be positive. Florian is unaware of the occasions when it may be negative (even though the model was designed so that this term will be activated when it is positive). .

The standard version of SU2 used the value of CDkw as value of the cross-diffusion term in the residual computations. Thus, I think I should revert to that formulation.

Five different meshes have been considered. ![ComparisonNewBCsResiduals](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d84d7a23-e173-449a-9968-8d8d49b6000f). ![ComparisonNewBCsSFC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/243c55c6-e9c7-4335-b889-67244fa81e6b). The solutions are pretty much identical for the same mesh level, but the cases with the config 3 achieved convergence across all of the meshes. It is interesting how, on finer meshes, the use of dimensionless limits (config 1) actually had worst convergence than the one with std limits (config 2) (up until the finest mesh, where config 2 diverges). I am going to try to perform the simulations also with the non m variants of the SST model and the full production term. It may require some work since all of the occurrences of the ""ComputeStressTensor"" have to be changed. Ideally I think that it should be computed only once and then used that value for all of the other instances.
