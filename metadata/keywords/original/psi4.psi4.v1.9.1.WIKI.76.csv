A reaction is a combination of one or more; reagent energies whose value you are interested in and a reference value; for which you may or may not be in possession of. A few examples follow.; In a database of interaction energies, the reagents are dimers and their; component monomers (usually derived from the dimer geometry), and the; reactions are the dimer less monomers energies. In a database of barrier; heights, the reagents are reactants, products, and transition-state; structures, and the reactions are the transition-states less; minimum-energy structures. Possibly you may have a collection of; structures to simply be acted upon in parallel, in which case the; structures are both the reagents and the reactions. The role of the; database.py file is to collect arrays and dictionaries that define the; geometries of reagents (GEOS), their combination into reactions (RXNM &; ACTV), available reference values for reactions (BIND), and brief comments; for reagents and reactions (TAGL). The journey from reagent geometries to; functional database.py file is largely automated, in a process described; below. Prepare geometry files; Assemble xyz files for all intended reagent systems in a directory.; Follow the rules below for best results. The filename for each xyz; file should be the name of the system. lowercase or MixedCase is; preferable (according to Sherrill lab convention). Avoid dashes and; dots in the name as python won’t allow them. If you’re determined to; have dashes and dots, they must be replaced by other characters in the; process_input line, then translated back in the GEOS section; see; NBC10.py for an example.

The atom lines should not contain any dummy atoms (what’s the use in cartesian form). For dimer systems, an algorithm is used to apportion the atoms into two fragments; thus the atoms need not be arranged with all fragmentA atoms before all fragmentB atoms. The algorithm will fail for very closely arranged fragments. For dimers, any charge and multiplicity from the second line will be applied to fragmentA (python); charge and multiplicity may need to be redistributed later in the editing step. Run script psi4/lib/scripts/ixyz2database.py. Move into the directory where all your xyz files are located. Run the; script, probably as $PSIDATADIR/scripts/ixyz2database.py. (If you; run it in place, there won’t be any path problems. It will ask a number of; questions about your intended database and generate a python file; named for your database. Uppercase is preferable for database names; (according to Sherrill lab convention). Note your choice for the route; variable for the next step. Edit file database.py.

Creating a Database¶; A necessary consideration in constructing a database is the distinction; between reagents and reactions. A reagent is a single molecular system; (may be a dimer) whose geometry you are possession of and whose electronic; energy may be of interest. A reaction is a combination of one or more; reagent energies whose value you are interested in and a reference value; for which you may or may not be in possession of. A few examples follow.; In a database of interaction energies, the reagents are dimers and their; component monomers (usually derived from the dimer geometry), and the; reactions are the dimer less monomers energies. In a database of barrier; heights, the reagents are reactants, products, and transition-state; structures, and the reactions are the transition-states less; minimum-energy structures. Possibly you may have a collection of; structures to simply be acted upon in parallel, in which case the; structures are both the reagents and the reactions. The role of the; database.py file is to collect arrays and dictionaries that define the; geometries of reagents (GEOS), their combination into reactions (RXNM &; ACTV), available reference values for reactions (BIND), and brief comments; for reagents and reactions (TAGL). The journey from reagent geometries to; functional database.py file is largely automated, in a process described; below. Prepare geometry files; Assemble xyz files for all intended reagent systems in a directory.; Follow the rules below for best results. The filename for each xyz; file should be the name of the system. lowercase or MixedCase is; preferable (according to Sherrill lab convention). Avoid dashes and; dots in the name as python won’t allow them. If you’re determined to; have dashes and dots, they must be replaced by other characters in the; process_input line, then translated back in the GEOS section; see; NBC10.py for an examp",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/quickadddatabase.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/quickadddatabase.html

The Est.Disp22(T); value used in the SAPT energy and dispersion component (see [Hohenstein:2010:104107]; for details). Table Of Contents.

In practice, we have found that the density-fitting; approximation introduces negligable errors into the SAPT energy and greatly; improves efficiency. A First Example¶; The following is the simplest possible input that will perform all; available SAPT computations (normally, you would pick one of these methods).; molecule water_dimer {; 0 1; O -1.551007 -0.114520 0.000000; H -1.934259 0.762503 0.000000; H -0.599677 0.040712 0.000000; --; 0 1; O 1.350625 0.111469 0.000000; H 1.680398 -0.373741 -0.758561; H 1.680398 -0.373741 0.758561. units angstrom; no_reorient; symmetry c1; }. set globals {; basis aug-cc-pvdz; }. energy('sapt0'); energy('sapt2'); energy('sapt2+'); energy('sapt2+(3)'); energy('sapt2+3'). The SAPT module uses the standard PSI4 partitioning of the dimer; into monomers. SAPT does not use spatial symmetry and needs the geometry; of the system to remain fixed throughout monomer and dimer calculations.; These requirements are imposed whenever a SAPT calculation is requested; but can also be set explicitly with the no_reorient and symmetry; c1 molecule keywords, as in the example above. A final note is that the; SAPT module is only capable of performing SAPT computations for; interactions between closed-shell singlets.; The example input shown above would not be used in practice.; To exploit the efficiency of the density-fitted SAPT implementation in; PSI4, the SCF computations should also be performed with density-fitted; (DF) integrals.; set globals {; basis aug-cc-pvdz; df_basis_scf aug-cc-pvdz-jkfit; df_basis_sapt aug-cc-pvdz-ri; guess sad; scf_type df; }. set sapt {; print 1; }.

Hohenstein; Section author: Edward G. Hohenstein; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, LIBSAPT_SOLVER; Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly; computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the; interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the; monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the; interaction energy into physically meaningful components: i.e.,; electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, , the fluctuation potential of each monomer, , and the; interaction potential, . The monomer Fock operators, , are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of , , and .; Through first-order in , electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in . For; a complete description of SAPT, the reader is referred to the excellent; review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz [Jeziorski:1994:1887].; Several truncations of the SAPT expansion are available in the SAPT; module of PSI4. The simplest truncation of SAPT is denoted SAPT0; and defined in Eq. (1).

During the SCF procedure, the occupation of orbitals is typically determined by; the Aufbau principal across all spatial symmetries. This may result in the; occupation shifting between iterations.

Broken Symmetry¶; For certain problems, such diradicals, allowing the spin-up and spin-down orbitals to differ in closed-shell computations can be advantageous; this is known as symmetry breaking. The resulting wavefunction will often provide superior energetics, due to the increased flexibility, but will suffer non-physicical spin contamination from higher multiplicity states. PSI4 can compute a high-spin triplet wavefunction and then use this as a guess for the broken-symmetry low spin state.

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis.

If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs per irrep may be slightly smaller than the number of USOs per irrep.; A contrived example demonstrating OSOs/MOs vs. AOs with symmetry is shown; below:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c2 # Two irreps is easier to comprehend; }. set {; s_tolerance 0.0001 # Set an unreasonably tight; # tolerance to force canonical; basis aug-cc-pv5z # This diffuse basis will have; # small-ish eigenvalues for even H2O; }. energy('scf').

This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available.

Also, the SAD; UHF guess is very slow in large basis sets, so you may want to cast up for; >TZ.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your primary basis/atom type.

This will run a Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) on neutral singlet Helium in; spatial symmetry with a minimal STO-3G basis, 1.0E-6; energy and 1.0E-5 density convergence criteria (since single-point, see; SCF Convergence & Algorithm), a DF ERI algorithm, symmetric; orthogonalization, DIIS, and a core Hamiltonian guess. For more; information on any of these options, see the relevant section below. Spin/Symmetry Treatment¶; PSI4 implements the most popular spin specializations of Hartree-Fock; theory, including:. Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) [Default]; Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical.; Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF); Appropriate for most open-shell systems, and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file.

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL.

Initial Guess/Convergence Stabilization¶; In each step of the SCF procedure, a new Fock or Kohn–Sham potential is built; according to the previous density, following which the potential is diagonalized; to produce new molecular orbitals, from which a new density is computed. This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded.

[5]The E_CONVERGENCE keyword is implemented for most post-SCF modules.; See a list beginning at E_CONVERGENCE. [6]The R_CONVERGENCE keyword places a convergence check on an internal; residual error measure and is implemented for several post-SCF; modules (see list beginning at R_CONVERGENCE).

Recommendations¶; The SCF code is already quite flexible and powerful, with new features being; added weekly. We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum, and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment. Also, the SAD; UHF guess is very slow in large basis sets, so you may want to cast up for; >TZ.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxilia",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/scf-1.html

However, the; first true iteration is quite close to the final DF energy, highlighting the; efficiency of the SAD guess. Pulay’s DIIS procedure is then used to accelerate; SCF convergence, with the DF phase reaching convergence in eight true; iterations. When used together, SAD and DIIS are usually sufficient to converge; the SCF for all but the most difficult systems.

For more; information on any of these options, see the relevant section below. Spin/Symmetry Treatment¶; PSI4 implements the most popular spin specializations of Hartree-Fock; theory, including:. Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) [Default]; Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical.; Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF); Appropriate for most open-shell systems, and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to an; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem.; Restricted Open-Shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF); Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical).; Constrained Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (CUHF); A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz, and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/scf-1.html

For some of these algorithms, Schwarz and/or density sieving can be used to; identify negligible integral contributions in extended systems. To activate; sieving, set the INTS_TOLERANCE keyword to your desired cutoff; (1.0E-12 is recommended for most applications).; Recently, we have added the automatic capability to use the extremely fast DF; code for intermediate convergence of the orbitals, for SCF_TYPE other; than DF.

This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available.

READ becomes the default for the second and later iterations; of geometry optimizations.; SAD; Superposition of Atomic Densities. Builds the initial density as the; spin-averaged sum of atomic UHF computations in the current basis. If an; open-shell system, uniform scaling of the spin-averaged density matrices is; performed. If orbitals are needed (e.g., in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems.; GWH; Generalized Wolfsberg-Helmholtz, a simple Huckel-Theory-like method based on; the overlap and core Hamiltonian matrices. May be useful in open-shell systems.; READ; Read the previous orbitals from a checkpoint file, casting from one basis to; another if needed. Useful for starting anion computations from neutral; orbitals, or after small geometry changes. At present, casting from a; different molecular point group is not supported. This becomes the; default for the second and later iterations of geometry optimizations. These are all set by the GUESS keyword. Also, an automatic Python; procedure has been developed for converging the SCF in a small basis, and then; casting up to the true basis. This can be done by adding; BASIS_GUESS = SMALL_BASIS to the options list. We recommend the; 3-21G basis for the small basis due to its efficient mix of flexibility and; compactness.

Broken Symmetry¶; For certain problems, such diradicals, allowing the spin-up and spin-down orbitals to differ in closed-shell computations can be advantageous; this is known as symmetry breaking. The resulting wavefunction will often provide superior energetics, due to the increased flexibility, but will suffer non-physicical spin contamination from higher multiplicity states. PSI4 can compute a high-spin triplet wavefunction and then use this as a guess for the broken-symmetry low spin state.

The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis.

If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs per irrep may be slightly smaller than the number of USOs per irrep.; A contrived example demonstrating OSOs/MOs vs. AOs with symmetry is shown; below:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c2 # Two irreps is easier to comprehend; }. set {; s_tolerance 0.0001 # Set an unreasonably tight; # tolerance to force canonical; basis aug-cc-pv5z # This diffuse basis will have; # small-ish eigenvalues for even H2O; }. energy('scf').

This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. CORE [Default]; Diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems.

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs).

[4]Note that this table applies to the final convergence criteria for; all the post-SCF modules that define a E_CONVERGENCE keyword. [5]The E_CONVERGENCE keyword is implemented for most post-SCF modules.; See a list beginning at E_CONVERGENCE. [6]The R_CONVERGENCE keyword places a convergence check on an internal; residual error measure and is implemented for several post-SCF; modules (see list beginning at R_CONVERGENCE). It is defined; according to the quantum chemical method and so its default value is set; by each module individually.

Recommendations¶; The SCF code is already quite flexible and powerful, with new features being; added weekly. We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum, and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment. Also, the SAD; UHF guess is very slow in large basis sets, so you may want to cast up for; >TZ.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxilia",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/scf.html

However, the; first true iteration is quite close to the final DF energy, highlighting the; efficiency of the SAD guess. Pulay’s DIIS procedure is then used to accelerate; SCF convergence, with the DF phase reaching convergence in eight true; iterations. When used together, SAD and DIIS are usually sufficient to converge; the SCF for all but the most difficult systems. Additional convergence; techniques are available for more difficult cases, and are detailed below. At; this point, the code switches on the requested PK integrals technology, which; requires only four full iterations to reach convergence, starting from the DF; guess.

For more; information on any of these options, see the relevant section below. Spin/Symmetry Treatment¶; PSI4 implements the most popular spin specializations of Hartree-Fock; theory, including:. Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) [Default]; Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical.; Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF); Appropriate for most open-shell systems, and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to an; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem.; Restricted Open-Shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF); Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical).; Constrained Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (CUHF); A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz, and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2). Abelian spatial symmetry is fully supported in PSI4, and can be used to; obtain physical interpretation of the molecular orbitals, to assist in difficult; convergence cases, and, in some methods, ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/scf.html

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/scf.html

For some of these algorithms, Schwarz and/or density sieving can be used to; identify negligible integral contributions in extended systems. To activate; sieving, set the INTS_TOLERANCE keyword to your desired cutoff; (1.0E-12 is recommended for most applications).; Recently, we have added the automatic capability to use the extremely fast DF; code for intermediate convergence of the orbitals, for SCF_TYPE other; than DF. At the moment, the code defaults to cc-pVDZ-JKFIT as the; auxiliary basis, unless the user specifies DF_BASIS_SCF manually. For; some atoms, cc-pVDZ-JKFIT is not defined, so this procedure will fail. In these; cases, you will see an error message of the form:; RuntimeError: sanity check failed! Gaussian94BasisSetParser::parser:; Unable to find the basis set for HE.

This hybrid DF/conventional procedure can significantly accelerate SCF; computations requiring exact integrals, especially when used in concert with the; integral-direct conventional algorithm.; After the iterations are completed, a number of one-electron properties are; printed, and some bookkeeping is performed to set up possible correlated; computations. Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; PRINT option. Also printed are the occupied and virtual orbital energies,; which are useful in elucidating the stability and reactivity of the system. Theory¶; The objective of Hartree-Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) ,. Here, are the basis functions, which, in PSI4 are; contracted cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs). The matrix contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree-Fock. The molecular orbitals, are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,.

Here the tensor is an AO Electron-Repulsion; Integral (ERI) in chemists’ notation,. The MO coefficients are found as the generalized eigenvectors of the Fock Matrix,. The eigenvalues are the orbital energies, and the metric matrix; is the AO-basis overlap matrix.

This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. CORE [Default]; Diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems. READ becomes the default for the second and later iterations; of geometry optimizations.; SAD; Superposition of Atomic Densities. Builds the initial density as the; spin-averaged sum of atomic UHF computations in the current basis. If an; open-shell system, uniform scaling of the spin-averaged density matrices is; performed. If orbitals are needed (e.g., in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems.; GWH; Generalized Wolfsberg-Helmholtz, a simple Huckel-Theory-like method based on; the overlap and core Hamiltonian matrices. May be useful in open-shell systems.; READ; Read the previous orbitals from a checkpoint file, casting from one basis to; another if needed. Useful for starting anion computations from neutral; orbitals, or after small geometry changes. At present, casting from a; different molecular point group is not supported. This becomes the; default for the second and later iterations of geometry optimizations. These are all set by the GUESS keyword. Also, an automatic Python; procedure has been developed for converging the SCF in a small basis, and then; casting up to the true basis. This can be done by adding; BASIS_GUESS = SMALL_BASIS to the options list. We recommend the; 3-21G basis for the small basis due to its efficient mix of flexibility and; compactness.

Phys. Chem. XXX This uses a “primary” virtual space 3s3p (RAS 2), a “secondary” virtual space 3d4s4p4d4f (RAS 3), and a “tertiary” virtual space consisting of the remaining virtuals. First, an initial CISD computation is run to get the natural orbitals; this allows a meaningful partitioning of the virtual orbitals into groups of different importance. Next, the RASCI is run. The split-virtual CISD[TQ] takes all singles and doubles, and all triples and quadruples with no more than 2 electrons in the secondary virtual subspace (RAS 3). If any electrons are present in the tertiary virtual subspace (RAS 4), then that excitation is only allowed if it is a single or double. cc5a; RHF CCSD(T) STO-3G frozen-core energy of C4NH4 Anion. ocepa2; OCEPA cc-pVDZ energy with B3LYP initial guess for the NO radical. mcscf3; RHF 6-31G** energy of water, using the MCSCF module and Z-matrix input. frac; Carbon/UHF Fractionally-Occupied SCF Test Case. pywrap-basis; SAPT calculation on bimolecular complex where monomers are unspecified so driver auto-fragments it.

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, first we must set up an input; using the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We can easily get the optimized geometry; from the previous computation.

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index.

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.24; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z mass; O 0.000 0.000 -0.270 15.994915; H 0.000 0.418 0.538 1.007825; H 0.000 -0.418 0.538 1.007825. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate. (This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

Notice we have a couple of new keywords in the molecule specification.; no_reorient tells the program not to reorient the molecule; to a different coordinate system (this is important for SAPT to make; sure the same coordinate frame is used for the computations of the two; monomers and for the dimer). The next keyword symmetry c1 tells PSI4 to run; in C1 point-group symmetry (i.e., without using symmetry), even if a; higher symmetry is detected. SAPT computations know to turn off; symmetry and fix orientation even without the user specifying these; molecule keywords.; Here’s the second half of the input:; set {; basis jun-cc-pVDZ; scf_type DF; freeze_core True; }. energy('sapt0').

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. But most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances.

The built-in; Psithon function cp() does it all for us, automatically.; And that’s it! The only remaining part of the example input is a little table; of the different R values and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) energies, converted from; atomic units (hartree) to kcal mol-1 by multiplying by the; automatically-defined conversion factor psi_hartree2kcalmol, which is; defined in Sec.

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, first we must set up an input; using the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We can easily get the optimized geometry; from the previous computation. Looking at the output from running the; previous example, we see that the OH bond length is about 0.9463 Ångstroms,; and the bond angle is about 104.575 degrees. It’s good to give this many; digits (or more) to make sure there’s not significant roundoff error in the; geometry when running a frequency computation. So, our frequency; computation input (which can be found as test case; tu4-h2o-freq) is:; #!

Alternatively, it’s also possible for PSI4 to use Cartesian coordinate; input. Here, the Cartesian coordinates of the optimized geometry can be; extracted from the bottom of the optimization output.

PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want.

In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set; (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set); that PSI4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT; auxiliary basis for the Hartree–Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set; for the SAPT procedure.; To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to; freeze the core electrons with freeze_core True. The SAPT; procedure is invoked with the simple call, energy('sapt0'). This; call knows to automatically run two monomer computations and a dimer; computation and then use these results to perform the SAPT analysis. The; various energy components are printed at the end of the output, in addition; to the total SAPT0 interaction energy. An explanation of the various; energy components can be found in the review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and; Szalewicz [Jeziorski:1994:1887], and this is discussed in more detail; in the SAPT section later in this manual. For now, we’ll note that most of; the SAPT energy components are negative; this means those are attractive; contributions (the zero of energy in a SAPT computation is defined as; non-interacting monomers). The exchange contributions are positive; (repulsive). In this example, the most attractive contribution between; ethylene and acetylene is an electrostatic term of -2.12 kcal mol-1; (Elst10,r where the 1 indicates the first-order; perturbation theory result with respect to",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/tutorial-1.html

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge. At; the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the; perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.; Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical; understanding about the interaction between the two monomers.

Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation and grep-able with ~), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; Step Total Energy Delta E MAX Force RMS Force MAX Disp RMS Disp ~; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; 1 -76.026632734857 -76.026632734857 0.01523505 0.01245744 0.02742199 0.02277500 ~; 2 -76.027022668419 -0.000389933562 0.00178749 0.00142923 0.01007985 0.00594840 ~; 3 -76.027032729361 -0.000010060942 0.00014016 0.00008485 0.00077279 0",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/tutorial.html

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, first we must set up an input; using the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We can easily get the optimized geometry; from the previous computation. Looking at the output from running the; previous example, we see that the OH bond length is about 0.9463 Ångstroms,; and the bond angle is about 104.575 degrees. It’s good to give this many; digits (or more) to make sure there’s not significant roundoff error in the; geometry when running a frequency computation.

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.24; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z mass; O 0.000 0.000 -0.270 15.994915; H 0.000 0.418 0.538 1.007825; H 0.000 -0.418 0.538 1.007825. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate. (This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

Notice we have a couple of new keywords in the molecule specification.; no_reorient tells the program not to reorient the molecule; to a different coordinate system (this is important for SAPT to make; sure the same coordinate frame is used for the computations of the two; monomers and for the dimer). The next keyword symmetry c1 tells PSI4 to run; in C1 point-group symmetry (i.e., without using symmetry), even if a; higher symmetry is detected. SAPT computations know to turn off; symmetry and fix orientation even without the user specifying these; molecule keywords.; Here’s the second half of the input:; set {; basis jun-cc-pVDZ; scf_type DF; freeze_core True; }. energy('sapt0').

This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse functions ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/tutorial.html

For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity ).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables ( and ), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

If it works, it should print; the final energy as; @UHF Final Energy: -38.92533462456894. Notice we added a new keyword, set reference uhf, to the input. For; open-shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree–Fock, or UHF), or restricted orbitals (restricted; open-shell Hartree–Fock, or ROHF).

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.24; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z mass; O 0.000 0.000 -0.270 15.994915; H 0.000 0.418 0.538 1.007825; H 0.000 -0.418 0.538 1.007825. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate. (This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0]. set basis aug-cc-pVDZ; set freeze_core True. # Initialize a blank dictionary of counterpoise corrected energies; # (Need this for the syntax below to work); ecp = {}. for R in Rvals:; dimer.R = R; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)').

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available.

This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index. Note we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. The built-in; Psithon function cp() does it all for us, automatically.; And that’s it! The only remaining part of the example input is a little table; of the different R values and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) energies, converted from; atomic units (hartree) to kcal mol-1 by multiplying by the; automatically-defined conversion factor psi_hartree2kcalmol, which is; defined in Sec.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. But most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

The built-in; Psithon function cp() does it all for us, automatically.; And that’s it! The only remaining part of the example input is a little table; of the different R values and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) energies, converted from; atomic units (hartree) to kcal mol-1 by multiplying by the; automatically-defined conversion factor psi_hartree2kcalmol, which is; defined in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File.

Notice we have a couple of new keywords in the molecule specification.; no_reorient tells the program not to reorient the molecule; to a different coordinate system (this is important for SAPT to make; sure the same coordinate frame is used for the computations of the two; monomers and for the dimer). The next keyword symmetry c1 tells PSI4 to run; in C1 point-group symmetry (i.e., without using symmetry), even if a; higher symmetry is detected. SAPT computations know to turn off; symmetry and fix orientation even without the user specifying these; molecule keywords.; Here’s",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/tutorial.html

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

ADC: Ab Initio Polarization Propagator¶; Code author: Masaaki Saitow; Section author: Masaaki Saitow; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, ADC; The ADC code seeks the pole structure of the polarization; propagator, which is equivalent to the correlated excitation energy,; in terms of the second order algebraic-diagrammatic construction; (ADC(2)) scheme. Originally, the ADC scheme was derived in purely; the diagrammatic language by Schirmer [Schirmer:1982] and later,; a sophisticated algebraic scheme was developed [Trofimov:2006]; by Trofimov et al. In general by n-th order ADC theory, the; excited state is treated at completely equivalent level to the; Møller–Plesset perturbation expansion of the same order.; Hence the ADC(2); can be described as MP2 theory for the excited state and the relation; to such other response theories as CC2-LR, CIS(D) and CIS(D:math:_n) has; been addressed [Haettig:2002] by Hattig et al. In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as . In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation. As a consequence,; the pre-factor in the polynomial scaling becomes far larger than that; of the CIS(D) even though the quasi-degeneracy of the excited state is; properly accounted for in the ADC(2) model.; In PSI4 the quite efficient and flexible integral-transformation; library named libtrans is newly equipped and utilized in the; producti",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b5/adc-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b5/adc-1.html

Originally, the ADC scheme was derived in purely; the diagrammatic language by Schirmer [Schirmer:1982] and later,; a sophisticated algebraic scheme was developed [Trofimov:2006]; by Trofimov et al. In general by n-th order ADC theory, the; excited state is treated at completely equivalent level to the; Møller–Plesset perturbation expansion of the same order.; Hence the ADC(2); can be described as MP2 theory for the excited state and the relation; to such other response theories as CC2-LR, CIS(D) and CIS(D:math:_n) has; been addressed [Haettig:2002] by Hattig et al. In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as . In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation.

The most; important keyword is ROOTS_PER_IRREP, which is an array; giving the number of excited states desired for each irreducible; representation. Implementation¶; Some very essential points are emphasized for understanding of the; nature and the limitations of the theory. The ADC(2) response matrix,; denoted as , is expanded in the single (S) and double (D); excitation manifolds as. where the superscript on each matrix block indicates the order of; the fluctuation. Instead of solving the above equation explicitly,; the large D manifold is treated effectively as. This form of the ADC(2) equation requires 7 – 10 iterations for; convergence on only one root. But thanks to Newton-Raphson; acceleration,. the computational time reduces to shorter than half of the simple iterative; procedure. Construction of the denominator of the second term in the above; equation is less computationally expensive than contruction of one $sigma$-vector with respect to the effective response matrix. The non-iterative excitation energy stated above is calculated as a diagonal element of the Davidson mini-Hamiltonian matrix in the SEM as,. where and denote the CIS; excitation energy and wave function, respectively. The explicit form of the; σ-vector is provided in a note accompanying the source code,; in the file psi4/src/bin/adc/sigma.pdf. Table Of Contents.
