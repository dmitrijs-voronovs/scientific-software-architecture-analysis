This doesn't force any particular choice... along it at least raises the issue. ### What *should* QuPath do?; This remains an open question - with feedback and ideas welcome. My current suspicion is that QuPath *should* enforce the use of one Locale consistently throughout the application. If so, this would likely have to be ```Locale.US``` - because this is [guaranteed to exist](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html#getAvailableLocales()). This will enforce an internal consistency, which is less likely to be troubled by whether or not the programmer of some component or extension parses their numbers in a different way. It *may* still be helpful to optionally export data for a specific Locale - but this would need to be explicitly selected (every time?), for ease of importing results into other software. However, providing this option would require some more thought and planning for at least two reasons:. * Some exported data should also be reimported into QuPath, e.g. exported TMA data might be imported to use the *TMA data viewer* - in this case the correct Locale needs to be used for importing as well.; * There are different ways to export, both in terms of saving or copying values to the clipboard. Any 'smart' behavior in one place risks lulling a user into a false sense of security that the Locale they unthinkingly expect will always be used. In short, it's a thorny issue. For now, the best approach is to use a Locale that formats uses dots rather than commas as the decimal mark... and then pay close attention whenever the exported results are imported elsewhere. ### Immediate plans. I am considering making the first half the change suggested above in the next update, i.e. to force the use of the US Locale. There is too much that is unclear or untested whenever different Locales may be used.

Finally, it's important to consider what happens *after* running QuPath's analysis. Commonly, it's necessary to put the results into another application - such as an Excel Spreadsheet. Excel isn't immune from these issues, and will also parse numbers according to some system setting. **Therefore the spreadsheet application is not guaranteed to interpret the numbers written by QuPath in the way that is intended - it's absolutely essential to check.**. ## How does QuPath handle this?. ### What QuPath does now; QuPath gives some consideration to Locales in two ways, although neither is a complete solution. Firstly, the Locale information used when saving a ```.qpdata``` file is saved with the file. This way, it can be temporarily applied when reloading the file. This at least helps reduce the possibility that a later change in Locale means that a previously-written data file cannot be read again - or is read wrongly. Secondly, QuPath gives the user a choice of Locale on first startup (or under *Help &rarr; Show setup options* - along with a warning:; <img width=""608"" alt=""qupath_setup"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4690904/20858862/a6a5f5e4-b946-11e6-823c-82dccca3a0ba.png"">.

This is described in more detail in the [Decimal mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark) Wikipedia article. This scenario isn't great for software that is intended to be used worldwide for scientific applications, where the format in which numbers are entered and exported really matters. ### Locales & formatting numbers. The good news is that Java can support different [Locales](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/locale/index.html). This makes it possible to write code that takes the region into consideration. The very bad news is that handling this predictably is far from straightforward. This arises partly because there are many ways to format numbers within Java, some more convenient than others, and some more problematic than others. For example, considering the following Groovy script to test out different methods:. ```groovy; import java.text.*;. def count = 1;; def sb = new StringBuffer(""\n"");. def s = NumberFormat.getInstance().format(1.234); // Depends on default Locale; sb.append(count++).append("": "").append(s).append(""\n"");. s = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.GERMANY).format(1.234); // 1,234; sb.append(count++).append("": "").append(s).append(""\n"");. s = new DecimalFormat(""#.##"").format(1.234); // Depends on default Locale, 2 decimal places; sb.append(count++).append("": "").append(s).append(""\n"");. s = String.format(""My number is %.3f"", 1.234); // Depends on default Locale; sb.append(count++).append("": "").append(s).append(""\n"");. s = ""My number is "" + 1.234; // 1.234 - always uses the dot; sb.append(count++).append("": "").append(s).append(""\n"");; ```.

A derived class should be shown with a colon separator, e.g. ```Tumor: Positive``` and ```Tumor: Negative``` are both derived from a base classification of ```Tumor```. This appears to work fine, but if there are more than two 'levels' to the classification then only the final two are displayed through the user interface. Therefore while ```Tumor: E-cadherin: Positive``` can be represented in code, it would only be shown as ```E-cadherin: Positive``` on screen. The following script can be used to print out what all the levels of the classification are. ```groovy; // Get classification of selected object; def pathClass = getSelectedObject().getPathClass(); println(""Classification is "" + pathClass); if (pathClass == null) {; return; }. // Print the full classification; String fullName = pathClass.getName(); pathClass = pathClass.getParentClass(); while (pathClass != null) {; fullName = pathClass.getName() + "": "" + fullName; pathClass = pathClass.getParentClass(); }; println(""Full classification hierarchy is "" + fullName); ```.

https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/41:289,Safety,detect,detections,289,"Occasionally, QuPath hangs when selecting multiple objects when analyzing a large tissue image. The bug can be intermittent during 'normal use', but is reproducible with the following steps:. * Open a whole slide image; * Create a single, very large annotation; * Create a large number of detections within the annotation (at least tens/hundreds of thousands); this is easiest with the *Create tiles* command; * Draw several more smaller annotations within the large one; * In the *Annotation* tab, select multiple annotations; * Wait... then give up waiting and force-quit QuPath. The problem traces back to QuPath's attempt to synchronize the selected within QuPath’s object hierarchy with the objects shown in the JavaFX ```TreeView``` used in the *Hierarchy* tab.

Hello all, ; Sorry if my question is basic but I could'nt find an answer and am looking for your help.; So I have 500 Scans of renal biopsies which are stained for Macrophages (CD68). The question is how can I tile the already marked tissue Area through (Simple Tissue detection) into 3 regions of interest (Cortex, Medulla and extrarenal tissue)?. Does it work somehow to draw lines to seperate the areas?.; Next question is, can I get a table with the percentages of positive Area for each ROI in all 500 slides? .

One idea for the potential workflow is this:; * Open an image or project in QuPath; * Chop up either entire images or annotated regions into CellProfiler-friendly image tiles; * Launch CellProfiler analysis from a command line, passing a CP pipeline and the image tiles; * Bring the results back into QuPath for visualization (?). The first parts should be possible to handle on the QuPath side with the addition of a (relatively) straightforward Groovy script*. The last bit is trickier. I am not sure if it is needed in general or, if it is, what kind of data needs to be brought back... and how standardized would it be?. Ideas and comments would be welcome. _*- To begin with.

We plan to make a self containing package of the image material that students can download for self study. What we currently miss is an option to write longer descriptions to annotations and to the images. We were planning to make a separate project per exercise like ""Muscle"" where there would be sample images from different muscle types. When you choose from project-view an image and you go to image-tab, there would be a good place for ""Description"" - freetext field where longer description of the image could be written. When I open the ""Annotation""-tab and choose an annotation, under the current ""key-value"" box there could be again ""Description"" freetext field for longer text. This could be edited in annotation set view. . Would this kind of new additional text fields be doable? .

I would like to know if it is possible to detect not only the percentage of positive cells but also the area that they occupy. ; What I tried to do was: 1. Use positive cells selection. 2. Create a classifier to differentiate between tumour and stroma and 3. send detections to ImageJ (in an intend to merge all the detections into a ROI and calculate the area occupied by positive tumour cells). My problem is that when I send the region to ImageJ i get all (tumour and stroma) detections and I cannot differentiate them anymore (in ImageJ all objects are treated as the same overlay).; Is there any way in QuPath to calcuate the area that occupy all positive tumour cells? and if not, is it possible to send only the detection of tumour cells to ImageJ already as a single selection? (because if I have thousands of detections and I want to merge them as a single ROI it has an extremely high cost in terms of processing power for the computer).

I ask because when deploying my qupath coordinates to a server the server currently does not support hole generation. I also don't want to force a connection between the outer and inner polygons, leaving a line in between the two. So I was wondering if the ""horseshoe"" idea is possible...can we write code to break a small part of the inner and outer polygons and establish a connection between them, and do this across all inner polygons (if an outer polygon has multiple inner polygons?).",MatchSource.ISSUE,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/177

Similarly converting detections to points does not display points either. Interestingly the points will display when the image is is rotated to <90 degrees either way.

Afterwards open counter tool and begin marking infiltrates. However the counter will register a click but no corresponding point will not appear on the image. Similarly converting detections to points does not display points either. Interestingly the points will display when the image is is rotated to <90 degrees either way. Furthermore the points will scale down with as the image is rotated towards to the original orientation. This is best seen when the smallest point size is selected. Otherwise a great program and is proving immensely helpful. Many thanks.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/193

I'm trying to get my head around the functionalities of QuPath in terms of automatic object detection (or segmentation).

From the german wikipedia page, I understand that the Ki-67 marker can be used to mark dividing cells which would be mitosis detection as I see it.

https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/243:808,Performance,load,load,808,"The main propose of this issue is to report a problem that the classes of annotations in a open image do NOT appear in the classes list (that panel on the right of the annotations list panel, in Annotations tab). Q1. When I create a new project, the software seems to keep all classes I add in the previous project, while I want to use a new set of classes in a different task. Is this a designed behavior?; ---I try to do ""Reset all classes"", which make the classes list become the default one; then I delete all classes and added wanted classes. Q2. Then I work with this new classes list, make some annotations in an image, and save them in a .qpdata file (use Ctrl+S). Some time after that, my computer crashed (unlikely caused by QuPath) and restarted. I open the new project again, finding that QuPath load the classes list of my PREVIOUS project (which I don't want, as I mentioned in Q1), and lost all the classes I create in the new project. Meanwhile, the annotations in the image are with correct classes (those I add in the new project). Now, the classes of annotations in the image is inconsistent with project‘s classes list, as is shown in the screenshot below. Now I can neither create annotations with classes I added before (which are lost), nor get back my new classes list or manage them (like changing the color of the annotations). What should I do? ; ---I'm not sure what will happen if I do [reset, delete, add classes] again will help. I think even I add classes with the same name, it is another classes (which is not the same of those existed in the qpdata file).

https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/250:1351,Safety,avoid,avoid,1351,"Dear @petebankhead . Hope this finds you well. I am back again for your input on an issue. First, let me tell briefly about **my task with the QuPath**. I stained slides of different mouse tissues. The main stain was X-gal stain (blue) to satin positive/expressed cells, and I co-stained the same section with Neutral red (red) to stain nuclei. Therefore, I have only two colours to play with. Overall, in a particular region (or, annotation) in those sections, I need to figure out what is the percentage of the blue signals wrt red signals. **Currently,** after annotating a region, I am mentioning QuPath to fetch me the two different signals based on the threshold chosen. Higher threshold values (say, 0.40) helped me to select blue signals, and low threshold (0.08) helped me to select both red and blue to denote the overall number of cells in that region (with all the other default settings as fixed). Till now everything was fine. **Problem is that** some nuclei are stained too dark, and they also show up in high threshold values along with blue signals, accounting for a high, unreal figure for positive signals. I assume the darker red nuclei have an overlapped intensities to the blue signals. **My question** to you: Is there any way to discriminate these cells based on the pixel colour, NOT the intensity of the colour so that I can avoid the artefacts? . Please let me know if you need any further clarification. . Many thanks in advance for your suggestion. Sincerely,; Partha. **Here is the dropbox link to my image file:**; https://www.dropbox.com/s/vz8e0jssrr7ur2w/Image%20file.qpdata?dl=0. **And, I show my procedure pictorially here:**; [procedure.pdf](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/files/2678866/procedure.pdf)",MatchSource.ISSUE,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/250

If the image was originally openable( and only Bioformats can handle it because without this extension then QuPath cannot open it) in QuPath using BioFormats Extension, such as .vsi/.scn format, then the command raise error:. However, the image Leica-Fluorescence-1.scn could be hand-opened in QuPath, and after openning, I can run the same script by clicking inside QuPath without problem.

I used ""Tiles and superpixels"", classified the pictures in stroma and tumor and used ""Tile classifications to annotations"" to get the measurements of the classified area. But I also should get the number of cells of every classified area/annotation.; So I was wondering, is there a possibility to change the superpixels (already classified and in annotations) in cells by a script?; I know that I can select every annotation individually and use cell detection. But where can I figure out the number of cells in the selected annotation without a new classifier?; And is there a script wich I could use for an automatically cell detection in every picture of a project?.

But I also should get the number of cells of every classified area/annotation.; So I was wondering, is there a possibility to change the superpixels (already classified and in annotations) in cells by a script?; I know that I can select every annotation individually and use cell detection. But where can I figure out the number of cells in the selected annotation without a new classifier?; And is there a script wich I could use for an automatically cell detection in every picture of a project?. Thanks for your help, hope you have an idea :); Simone",MatchSource.ISSUE,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/261

I am a fairly new Qupath user and I would like to calculate the proportion of stroma/epithelium in a given area of annotated tissue (prostate biopsy in particular) and also identify immune cells (lymphocytes) and express them as a density (cells/mm2) in stromal and epithelial areas. I am beginning with benign tissue but would like to move on to tumour-containing tissues as well down the line. I am also looking for an effective way to extract that data for multiple images (>500) into an Excel spreadsheet. Unfortunately I cannot find any resources online for this. The Qupath classifier identifies individual cells and most responses are on IHC, whereas my images are H&E. Could anyone please help?. Thank you,.

However, A and B overlap in the middle by about 146 pixels. I noticed that B was also about 10 pixels higher than A, this indicate that the two images are not perfectly on the same y level. This offset on Y was noticed when I open image either on QuPath or on CaseViewer, they both shows exactly 10 pixels of Y offset on B. To further prove that A and B has Y offset, from the extracted small 302px x 252 px tiles I pick up two tiles that just located on both side of boundary between A and B.

Thus further subdividing the tumor center in 500 µm bands, and assess the numer of positive and negative cells in eacht band.

They opened fine and it appeared that I could save the files when I was using the new version with qpdata files made with the old one. However, although it seemed to save, the original qpdata file is deleted or renamed/moved in such a way that I cannot find it anymore. It is not in the trash, and there is not a new/alternate file name generated in the same folder the original file was in. I know that in the window that appears when you open the new version that it says opening old files can make them incompatible, but I wasn't expecting to have no record of the file anymore. I have some alterations I made that would be great to recover, but otherwise, this is more reporting for a general notice.

When opening them in QuPath, the first thing I usually do is to run a script to set the min and max display:; ```; // Get access to the display info for each channel; def viewer = getCurrentViewer(); def channels = viewer.getImageDisplay().availableChannels(). // Set the range for the 4 channels; channels[0].setMinDisplay(500); channels[0].setMaxDisplay(30000); channels[1].setMinDisplay(500); channels[1].setMaxDisplay(30000); channels[2].setMinDisplay(500); channels[2].setMaxDisplay(30000); channels[3].setMinDisplay(500); channels[3].setMaxDisplay(20000); ```. In theory it should be possible to use a maximum value of 65,536 if I am not mistaken, for 16 bit images. However, if I want to fine tune this setting and open the ""Brightness & Contrast"" tool, I am not able to go to the maximum theoritical value. ; If I start playing with the ""Max display"" side of the bar, it automatically ""clips"" the range to a certain value usually relatively low, making the signal way too strong in most cases (not sure how that value is calculated?), and there is no going back using this ""Brightness & Contrast"" tool. ; The only way of adjusting this value is to re-use the script. It is fine and can be done, but I was wondering if it would be possible to modify QuPath to prevent the software from this behaviour? I don't remember having such problem when using 8-bit Versa images, but I think I had the same issue using 32-bit vectra images. **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: Windows, macOS; - QuPath Version 0.2.0m3 (and before too)",MatchSource.ISSUE,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/352

See attached image: ; ![VSI_m2_vs_m4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55238250/64780209-0fca3e80-d560-11e9-817d-c90eeee4865c.PNG). Left hand side is the 0.2.0-m2, right hand side is 0.2.0-m4.; m4 only opens the label and the Image list is lost. Hope this will be fixed soon :). Another two issues: . - The 0.2... version in general; it doesn't any longer recognize the image type when opening VSI-files. This worked fine in 0.1...versions with the Bio-Format extension. . - In all versions (0.1... included) the color of the different fluorescent channels are mixed up, for example the FITC channel is displayed in red and TRITC channel in green . This must be manually corrected under brightness and contrast, and it would of course be convenient if it was recognized automatically.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/361

https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/383:945,Performance,load,loaded,945,"## Bug report. **Describe the bug**; This is kind of minor, but I noticed that opening the `Leica-1.ome.tiff` example OME-TIFF provided on [this page](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/6.0.0/ome-tiff/data.html) using File -> Open opens the ""macro"" slide image instead of the full-resolution scan. . **To Reproduce**; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. File -> Open (Ctrl+O), choose `Leica-1.ome.tiff`. **Expected behavior**; I'm assuming this is happening because the example file defines the first image as the macro image, or because the first IFD in the TIFF is the macro image. . I realized that you can view the full-resolution scan by creating a new project and importing the ome.tiff through ""Add Images"", which adds both images into the project, but I often use File -> Open for quickly viewing things and found this behaviour to be unexpected. I think it would be great if you added the option to select which image should be loaded when opening an OME-TIFF with multiple images in it. **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: Windows; - QuPath Version: 0.2.0-m7",MatchSource.ISSUE,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/383

When I open the images in other image processing programs like gimp the images do not appear distorted. It looks like the distortion that is taking place is that part of the image is being copied and translated into a different part of the image. . **To Reproduce**; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1. Go to QuPath 0.1.2; 2. Click on File -> Open Image; 3. Select specific image; 4. See error. **Expected behavior**; The image should not be cut into pieces and distorted. . **Screenshots**; Here is what the image should look like:( Here I opened the .tif image in gimp). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10617598/70916106-1f3aa700-1fe9-11ea-91d2-72f5340bdcb4.png).

The script isn't super clean (sorry if I butchered John's code, I'm very new to groovy) but works for us (Hamamatsu NanoZoomer NDPI files / NDPA generated with NDP.view 2.6.8). Once launched, it will look for an NDPA file which has the same name as the NDPI file selected in QuPath and load all the annotations. Then for each annotation:; * *The title* becomes the QuPath annotation's class; * *The details* are transferred to the QuPath annotation's description. Cheers,; Egor. **Attached:** [NDPA.zip](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/files/4165181/NDPA.zip)",MatchSource.ISSUE,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/398

However, when you calculate detection centroid distances on objects with multiple classifications, the results are difficult to interpret. It gives a separate measurement for the distance to the nearest cell of each permutation of classes individually. So, it gives the shortest distance to a cell of classA: classB, then separately to classA: classC, etc. But often what I want to know is the distance from a cell to another of classA of any subtype. Can you add a summary measurement for the shortest distance to any cell of classA, maybe like a classA*?",MatchSource.ISSUE,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/405

If not, please do these things first. Otherwise, please fill in the template below with as much information as possible to help us reproduce the bug & fix it. ## Bug report. **Describe the bug**. There seem to be ghost co-ordinates that are only visible when zooming in and alter the annotations. The zoom level therefore determines the shape of the annotation. In a similar way editing an annotation is causing the co-ordinates to move. We have exported the annotations and jsons and reimported them and there was a bug in our own code that created these lines across the annotations. . We are wondering whether, the co-ordinates of an original annotation are stored in some way even after editing, rather than being deleted. For example, if a circle was drawn and then a chunk removed from the edge - would the original circumference details still be retained. **To Reproduce**. See examples here:. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQmyZTKsUTU - milestone 9. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i0mODbj7Zc - on milestone 7; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQONdCIs4Os - on milestone 7. **Expected behavior**; There would be one set of co-ordinates visible all the time. **Screenshots**; If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: [e.g. Windows, macOS, Ubuntu...].

Sometimes when running cell detection (`qupath.imagej.detect.cells.WatershedCellDetection`) in the parallel tiled mode it will fail saying `ERROR: Exception during post-processing`.

https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/494:416,Energy Efficiency,monitor,monitor,416,"## Bug report. **Describe the bug**; Currently (at least on Windows) the script editor window is quasi-modal which means it does not show up as a separate window in the task bar and minimizing the window is not possible. It's either opened and on top of the main window or completely closed. I think this is a bit of a workflow hindrance. Personally, I can work around by moving the script editor window to a second monitor but let's assume, someone is working on a script using only one screen and wants to add an annotation to the current image manually: They would have to either close the script editor completely or grab the window and move it out of the way. However, I think the more common UI workflow would be either quickly minimizing the script editor or ALT-TAB-ing between the windows. . **Expected behavior**; Minimizable and non-modal script editor window. **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: Windows 10 64bit; - QuPath Version 0.2.0-m12",MatchSource.ISSUE,qupath,qupath,v0.5.1,https://qupath.github.io,https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/494

I've recently installed the most recent version of QuPath (0.2.0-m12) and am getting an error message saying ""Failed to launch JVM"" when I try to launch the software. I am opening the software by double clicking on the actual QuPath application, not through opening a .svs file or any other image file. I had a similar issue when I installed a new-at-the-time vesion of QuPath (0.2.0-m8) but was eventually able to run it through means that I do not recall. Can anyone please help me out with what could be going wrong? I've attached a log from the debug version when I try to open it.
