Test Suite¶; A test suite plays a vital role in open-source software use and development. For a PSI4 user, tests provide models of inputs that should work; “as-is” and a searchable collection of syntax and capabilities.; The test suite also allows high-quality development snapshots of the; codebase to be built automatically for users.; For a user who has PSI4 as part of a complex computational molecular software environment, a test suite alongside installed PSI4 can be used to show that the PSI4 piece is working.; For a feature developer, adding tests provides confidence that you; can leave your code untouched and still advertise that the feature works; years later. With tests, proposed changes to PSI4 that break your; code fall upon the change proposer to fix, rather than being merged; silently and lying in wait for a concientious user to detect and report; and then likely falling upon you to fix.; For a general developer, the test suite allows confidence in refactoring, switching out underlying libraries, maintenance, and upgrading.

Test Suite¶; A test suite plays a vital role in open-source software use and development. For a PSI4 user, tests provide models of inputs that should work; “as-is” and a searchable collection of syntax and capabilities.; The test suite also allows high-quality development snapshots of the; codebase to be built automatically for users.; For a user who has PSI4 as part of a complex computational molecular software environment, a test suite alongside installed PSI4 can be used to show that the PSI4 piece is working.; For a feature developer, adding tests provides confidence that you; can leave your code untouched and still advertise that the feature works; years later. With tests, proposed changes to PSI4 that break your; code fall upon the change proposer to fix, rather than being merged; silently and lying in wait for a concientious user to detect and report; and then likely falling upon you to fix.; For a general developer, the test suite allows confidence in refactoring, switching out underlying libraries, maintenance, and upgrading. CTest and pytest, PSIthon and PsiAPI¶; In designing a test, sometimes you want it to be a model input for the user in a single file or you don’t want a lot of psi4. or Python syntax cluttering the input.; In this case, follow Adding PSIthon Test Cases to prepare as PSIthon (psi4 input.dat) for, roughly speaking, running through ctest.; The PSIthon/CTest test suite occupies the whole of psi4/tests except psi4/tests/pytests.; At other times you want the test to check several variations of a template job or you want to test error handling or you want to focus on PsiAPI rather than PSIthon or you want to control the compute conditions with environment variables.; In this case, follow Adding PsiAPI Test Cases to prepare as PsiAPI (import psi4) for, roughly speaking, running through pytest.; The PsiAPI/pytest test suite occupies psi4/tests/pytests.;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html

Far more complicated logic is allowed than for; CTest: pytest -m ""dftd3 and not api and not long"".; The most important marks are “quick” and “long” that opt tests into the quick CI suite or out of; the normal full suite.

Use “quick” freely for tests that cover functionality and; are under 15s. Use “long” sparingly to winnow out the longest examples,; particularly those over a minute. Running for Debugging¶; There are many ways to run pytest, How to test a Psi4 installation, and three different copies of the test file; (i.e., psi4/tests/pytests/test_mp2.py, <objdir>/stage/lib/PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR/psi4/tests/test_mp2.py,; CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR/psi4/tests/test_mp2.py).; But for developing a pytest test, you probably want to use the first so you can edit it in place rather than running cmake --build after each change. Easiest is from <objdir>, run pytest ../tests. Add any filters (-k; test_name_fragment) or parallelism (-n <N> or -n auto if pytest-xdist; installed) or print test names (-v) or print warnings (-rws).; An important point is that because they’re PsiAPI, import psi4 is happening,; so the <objdir> PSI4 module must be in PYTHONPATH.

Use “quick” freely for tests that cover functionality and; are under 15s. Use “long” sparingly to winnow out the longest examples,; particularly those over a minute. Running for Debugging¶; There are many ways to run pytest, How to test a Psi4 installation, and three different copies of the test file; (i.e., psi4/tests/pytests/test_mp2.py, <objdir>/stage/lib/PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR/psi4/tests/test_mp2.py,; CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR/psi4/tests/test_mp2.py).; But for developing a pytest test, you probably want to use the first so you can edit it in place rather than running cmake --build after each change. Easiest is from <objdir>, run pytest ../tests. Add any filters (-k; test_name_fragment) or parallelism (-n <N> or -n auto if pytest-xdist; installed) or print test names (-v) or print warnings (-rws).; An important point is that because they’re PsiAPI, import psi4 is happening,; so the <objdir> PSI4 module must be in PYTHONPATH. Also, any call; to QCEngine is using which psi4, so the <objdir> PSI4 executable must be in; PATH. The easiest way to prepare your local environment is to; execute the printout of <objdir>/stage/bin/psi4 --psiapi.; To see stdout output from an otherwise passing test, easiest to add assert 0; at its end to trigger failure.; If stdout printing is insufficient, and you really need to see output.dat or other files,; comment out their deletion in psi4/tests/pytests/conftest.py and run the single test, deleting; the file each time (since it appends).

Test Contents¶. Most PSI4 tests will be integration tests focusing on non-regression of user input to answers, and we insist on having these.; But if you find unit tests helpful, by all means add them to the test suite.; Most tests should store reference results (from literature or another implementation or a carefully run PSI4 calculation),; run quantum chemistry, then apply one or more of the Comparison Functions so that the test will fail if the answer is unexpected.; The functions are the same in CTest and pytest, but in the former they are, for example, compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...) while in the latter it’s asserted, like assert compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...).; The main advantage of the testing functions is that they provide helpful error printing upon failure. Deep down, they’re NumPy functions.; In preparing the test case reference values, aim for the converged value rather than many digits from your computer under default convergence conditions.; This will make the test more robust for different OS, different BLAS libraries, and variations in SC",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html

Of those small modifications, first, note the special comment at the top (starting with the #! comment marker). This should be descriptive since it is inlined into the manual (unless !nosample in the comment) as a sample input.; Reference values are often assigned to variables for later use.; The compare_values function (along with several relatives in psi4/psi4/driver/p4util/testing.py for comparing strings, matrices, etc.) checks that the computed values match these reference values to suitable precision. This function prints an error message and signals that the test failed to the make system, if the values don’t match. Any lines of the input associated with the validation process should be flagged with #TEST at the end of each line, so that they can be removed when copying from the tests to the samples directory. output.ref¶; When your test case is in final form, run it locally, rename the output to output.ref, and check it into the repository alongside input.dat.; While this isn’t used for any testing machinery (except for the nearly decommissioned psi4/tests/psitest.pl for CC tests; full decommission expected by v1.6), it can be handy for users or developers to consult. test_input.py¶; Starting March 2022, one can also run tests designed as above for CTest through pytest.; To bring the test to pytest’s notice, add a file to the directory named test_input.py.; Below is an example for the psi4/tests/ci-property/test_input.py; from addons import *. @ctest_labeler(""quick;ci;cas;properties;cart;noc1""); def test_ci_property():; ctest_runner(__fi",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html

Test Suite¶; A test suite plays a vital role in open-source software use and development. For a PSI4 user, tests provide models of inputs that should work; “as-is” and a searchable collection of syntax and capabilities.; The test suite also allows high-quality development snapshots of the; codebase to be built automatically for users.; For a user who has PSI4 as part of a complex computational molecular software environment, a test suite alongside installed PSI4 can be used to show that the PSI4 piece is working.; For a feature developer, adding tests provides confidence that you; can leave your code untouched and still advertise that the feature works; years later. With tests, proposed changes to PSI4 that break your; code fall upon the change proposer to fix, rather than being merged; silently and lying in wait for a concientious user to detect and report; and then likely falling upon you to fix.; For a general developer, the test suite allows confidence in refactoring, switching out underlying libraries, maintenance, and upgrading. CTest and pytest, PSIthon and PsiAPI¶; In designing a test, sometimes you want it to be a model input for the user in a single file or you don’t want a lot of psi4. or Python syntax cluttering the input.; In this case, follow Adding PSIthon Test Cases to prepare as PSIthon (psi4 input.dat) for, roughly speaking, running through ctest.; The PSIthon/CTest test suite occupies the whole of psi4/tests except psi4/tests/pytests.; At other times you want the test to check several variations of a template job or you want to test error handling or you want to focus on PsiAPI rather than PSIthon or you want to control the compute conditions with environment variables.; In this case, follow Adding PsiAPI Test Cases to prepare as PsiAPI (import psi4) for, roughly speaking, running through pytest.; The PsiAPI/pytest test suite occupies psi4/tests/pytests.; The above description sounds as if there are two disjoint test suites, and",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/add_tests.html

A function in psi4/tests/pytests/conftest.py does this automatically between every test.; Especially if using data or functions from outside a test, run a variety of tests at different pytest -n <N> levels to mix up test ordering.

For every new test file, add pytestmark = [pytest.mark.psi, pytest.mark.api] at the top.; This ensures that every test has the psi mark and every PsiAPI test has the api mark to contrast with PSIthon tests with cli mark.; There are individual “marks” that can be added to whole tests or parts; of parameterized tests so that they can be run by category (pytest -m <mark>; vs. ctest -L <mark>) rather than just by name (pytest -k <name_fragment>; vs. ctest -R <name_fragment>).

If adding a test for an already existing module, the labels for other tests of the module will suggest other labels to add.; Labels have been added as developers needed, so they are not systematic or thorough.

A test that confirms PSI4 is operational should be labeled smoketests.; If a test needs extra input files like grid.dat or extra reference files for checking against, like fchk, specify these in the CMakeLists.txt as shown above.

Test Contents¶. Most PSI4 tests will be integration tests focusing on non-regression of user input to answers, and we insist on having these.; But if you find unit tests helpful, by all means add them to the test suite.; Most tests should store reference results (from literature or another implementation or a carefully run PSI4 calculation),; run quantum chemistry, then apply one or more of the Comparison Functions so that the test will fail if the answer is unexpected.; The functions are the same in CTest and pytest, but in the former they are, for example, compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...) while in the latter it’s asserted, like assert compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...).; The main advantage of the testing functions is that they provide helpful error printing upon failure.

If you see labels to add or rename, please do.; A test requiring over 15 minutes should be labeled longtests. A short test under 30 seconds used for general bug checking should be labeled quicktests. A test that confirms PSI4 is operational should be labeled smoketests.; If a test needs extra input files like grid.dat or extra reference files for checking against, like fchk, specify these in the CMakeLists.txt as shown above. Such tests must be run through ctest and don’t usually work when run “by hand” from the objdir via stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/directory_name/input.dat.; If a test is multiple minutes long, load-balancing a parallel CTest run requires the test to be started early.

This file contains much the same information as the CMakeLists.txt.; The def test_ci_property contains the name of the test, now with underscores rather than hyphens.; def test_ identifies it to pytest as a test.; That part of the function name and the name of the file, test_input.py are required, but no further registration with CMake is necessary.; Most tests need only the simple form of the runner line ctest_runner(__file__).; This uses QCEngine machinery to execute python psi4 input.dat.; If additional input files are needed from the test directory, their names can be added to the the second argument list as shown above.; Those additional input files do need to be registered in psi4/psi4/CMakeLists.txt.; Finally, the label string passed to CTest is here handed to pytest, with a few changes:. psi added automatically, so exclude it when copying from CTest CMakeLists.txt; cli added automatically to distinguish CTest origin from deliberate pytest origin, which have api added; smoke used instead of CTest smoketests; quick used instead of CTest quicktests; long used instead of CTest longtests; addon and <name-of-addon> added automatically when @uusing(""<name-of-addon>"") decorates the test or marks=using(""<name-of-addon>"") marks the test.

If STANDARD (=0) is chosen, then simply invoking xcfour will cause a complete job to be run with all second-derivative calculations being done in series. If PARALLEL (=1), then the job stops after the second-derivative calculation at the reference geometry and generates out all input geometries for the remaining calculation. These can be then processed in “parallel” (currently not recommended). Note that it is recommended to carry out all calculations with PARALLEL, even when the actual calculation is carried out in a sequential mode. Type: string; Possible Values: STANDARD, PARALLEL; Default: STANDARD. CFOUR_ANH_DERIVATIVES (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies whether the anharmonic force field is calculated using analytic gradients (=FIRST) or analytic Hessians (=SECOND). Type: string; Possible Values: FIRST, SECOND; Default: SECOND. CFOUR_ANH_STEPSIZE (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Controls the stepsize used in anharmonic force field calculations. The value is specified in reduced normal coordinates, which are dimensionless. The actual stepsize used in the calculation is \(\times 10^6\) the integer value specified.

If set to NONABELIAN (=0), maximum advantage will be taken of symmetry and the full set of cubic force constants will be generated from a skeleton set by application of the totally symmetric projection operator. If set to ABELIAN (=1), only the operations of the abelian subgroup will be exploited. Note: It is important to point out that the symmetrization currently works only for cubic constants. Therefore, if you require quartic force constants (for frequency calculations), you must use the ABELIAN option. Moreover, the latter work for only asymmetric tops and linear molecules.

CFOUR_ANHARMONIC (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies treatment of anharmonic effects by calculating cubic and/or quartic force fields. VIBROT (=3) requests calculation of only those cubic constants of the form \(\phi_{nij}\), where n is a totally symmetric coordinate. These are sufficient to determine the vibration-rotation interaction constants needed to calculate vibrational corrections to rotational constants, but are not sufficient to generate the corresponding cubic constants of isotopologs that have a lower point-group symmetry (i.e. HOD isotopolog of water). VPT2 (=1, note that the old value CUBIC can be still used and is equivalent to VPT2) generates all cubic constants and all quartic constants apart from those of the form \(\phi_{ijkl}\), which is enough for: 1) generation of cubic constants of isotopologs (see manual entries associated with anharmonic calculations for an example); 2) calculation of vibrational energy levels with VPT2. This keyword also directs the program to analyze resonances and calculate intensities of one- and two-quantum transitions. FULLQUARTIC (=2) (not part of the public release) is largely self-explanatory; it directs the program to calculate all quartic constants.

The orbitals are numbered in ascending order from the most stable (negative energy) to the most unstable (largest positive energy). Individual orbitals must be separated with a dash, while x>y means orbitals x through y inclusive. For example, the string 1>10-55-58>64, would result in orbitals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,55,58,59,60,61,62,63 and 64 being dropped. For UHF calculations, the appropriate orbitals are deleted for both spin cases. No dropped virtual MOs are currently allowed for gradient or property calculations. Psi4 Interface: The array above is specified in PSI as (white space tolerant) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,55,58,59,60,61,62,63,64]. Type: array; Default: No Default.

CFOUR_ESTATE_PROP (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — This keyword applies only to EOM-CC calculations and specifies whether any excited or ionized state one-electron properties are to be calculated. Proper use of this keyword requires a relatively advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry and the available options are discussed here. The options are: OFF (=0) [no properties or transition moments are calculated]; EXPECTATION (=1) [transition moments and dipole strengths are calculated along with selected one-electron properties which are evaluated as expectation values]; UNRELAXED (=2) [selected one-electron properties are calculated in an approximation that neglects relaxation of molecular orbitals]; RESPONSE (=3) [selected one-electron properties are calculated as analytic first derivatives of the energy]. Except for EOMCC calculations on two-electron systems (which are exact), properties obtained by the three approaches will not be equivalent. The default value for this keyword is slightly complicated. For TDA calculations, the default is EXPECTATION since the evaluation of transition moments involves only a negligible amount of additional computation relative to the evaluation of the excitation energies. For EOMCC, the default is OFF since evaluation of any transition moments or properties requires approximately twice the computational time. Transition moments and dipole strengths are evaluated by default for all values of ESTATE_PROP other than OFF.

An example of the use of the OCCUPATION keyword for the water molecule would be OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0. For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0. It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed.

SR-CC and PSA-CC are within the CCSD approximation restricted to excitations defined by the first-order interacting space arguments. With the keywords PSA-CC_FULL (=2) or SR-CC_FULL (=6) inclusion of the so called “pseudo-triples” beyond the first-order interacting space is also possible.

The use of semicanonical orbitals is, for example, required for ROHF-CCSD(T) calculations and for those calculations also automatically set. LOCAL requests a localization of the HF orbitals and this is currently done according to the Pipek-Mezey localization criterion.

CFOUR_PERT_ORB (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies the type of perturbed orbitals used in energy derivative calculations.

Examples given later in this manual further illustrate the QRHF input options and may help to clarify any confusion resulting from this documentation. (Default : 1). Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_QRHFGUES (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — If this keyword is set to ON (=1), then the QRHF orbitals specified by the CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL, CFOUR_QRHF_ORBITAL and CFOUR_QRHF_SPIN (nyi?) keywords are used as a starting guess for a restarted SCF procedure. This can be an extremely useful way to converge “difficult” SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry. Note that when this option is used, the calculation that is performed is not a QRHF-CC calculation; it is instead a UHF-based or ROHF-based calculation, depending on what type of reference is specified by the CFOUR_REFERENCE keyword. The QRHF aspect of the calculation is used simply as a device to converge the orbitals. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RAMAN_INT (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — ON (=1) requests a calculation of Raman intensities based on the geometrical derivatives of the static polarizability tensor, while DYN (=2) requests a calculation of Raman intensities based on the derivatives of the dynamical polarizability tensor.

CFOUR_RES_RAMAN (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — This option can be used to convert an analytically calculated gradient vector to a particular normal coordinate representation. A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations. No such transformation is performed if OFF (=0); while ON (=1) directs the program to evaluate the gradient and transform it to the chosen set of normal coordinates.

Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_QRHF_ORBITAL (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — By default, in QRHF calculations, electrons are removed from the highest occupied orbital in a symmetry block (symmetry block HOMO), while electrons are added to the lowest unoccupied orbital within a symmetry block (symmetry block LUMO). The purpose of the QRHF_ORBITAL keyword is to allow additional flexibility in choosing which orbitals will have their occupation numbers altered. The value of this keyword gives the offset with respect to the default orbital for the orbital which will be depopulated (or populated) in QRHF-CC calculations. For calculations involving more than one removal or addition of electrons, values are separated by commas and correspond to the CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL input on a one-to-one basis.

Examples given later in this manual further illustrate the QRHF input options and may help to clarify any confusion resulting from this documentation. (Default : 1). Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_QRHFGUES (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — If this keyword is set to ON (=1), then the QRHF orbitals specified by the CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL, CFOUR_QRHF_ORBITAL and CFOUR_QRHF_SPIN (nyi?) keywords are used as a starting guess for a restarted SCF procedure. This can be an extremely useful way to converge “difficult” SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry. Note that when this option is used, the calculation that is performed is not a QRHF-CC calculation; it is instead a UHF-based or ROHF-based calculation, depending on what type of reference is specified by the CFOUR_REFERENCE keyword. The QRHF aspect of the calculation is used simply as a device to converge the orbitals. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RAMAN_INT (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — ON (=1) requests a calculation of Raman intensities based on the geometrical derivatives of the static polarizability tensor, while DYN (=2) requests a calculation of Raman intensities based on the derivatives of the dynamical polarizability tensor.

CFOUR_RES_RAMAN (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — This option can be used to convert an analytically calculated gradient vector to a particular normal coordinate representation. A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix FCMFINAL, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations. No such transformation is performed if OFF (=0); while ON (=1) directs the program to evaluate the gradient and transform it to the chosen set of normal coordinates. A warning message is printed if the force constant matrix is unavailable. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RESTART_CC (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Offers the possibility to restart a CC calculation which stopped for various reasons, e.g. time limit, in the correlation part. However, note that a restart which is specified by ON (= 1) needs the following files of the previous unfinished calculation: JOBARC, JAINDX, MOINTS, and MOABCD. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_ROT_EVEC (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies which eigenvector of the orbital rotation Hessian is to be used to rotate the original SCF orbitals. By default, it will use that associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the totally symmetric part of the block-factored Hessian, as this choice often leads to the lowest energy SCF solution.

Moreover, POPLE has not been tested for some time and should definitely be checked! (Default : DIIS). Type: string; Possible Values: POPLE, DIIS; Default: DIIS. CFOUR_LOCK_ORBOCC (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — This keyword is used by the SCF program to determine if the orbital occupancy (by symmetry block) is allowed to change in the course of the calculation.

CFOUR_OCCUPATION (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies the orbital occupancy of the reference function in terms of the occupation numbers of the orbitals and their irreducible representations. The occupancy is specified by either NIRREP or 2*NIRREP integers specifying the number of occupied orbitals of each symmetry type, where NIRREP is the number of irreducible representations in the computational point group. If there are no orbitals of a particular symmetry type a zero must be entered. If the reference function is for an open-shell system, two strings of NIRREP occupation numbers separated by a slash are input for the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) sets of orbitals. An example of the use of the OCCUPATION keyword for the water molecule would be OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0. For the \(^2A_1\) water cation, an open-shell system, the keyword would be specified by OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/2-1-1-0. It should be noted that the xvmol integral program orders the irreducible representations in a strange way, which most users do not perceive to be a logical order. Hence, it is usually advisable initially to run just a single point integral and HF-SCF calculation in order to determine the number and ordering of the irreducible representations. The occupation keyword may be omitted, in which case an initial orbital occupancy is determined by diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian. In many cases, HF-SCF calculations run with the core Hamiltonian guess will usually converge to the lowest energy HF-SCF solution, but this should not be blindly assumed. (Default: The occupation is given by the core Hamiltonian initial guess). Psi4 Interface: The arrays above are specified in PSI as (white space tolerant) [3,1,1,0] and [[3,1,1,0],[3,0,1,0]].

CFOUR_PERT_ORB (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies the type of perturbed orbitals used in energy derivative calculations. STANDARD means that the gradient formulation assumes that the perturbed orbitals are not those in which the (perturbed) Fock matrix is diagonal. CANONICAL means that the perturbed orbitals are assumed to be canonical. This keyword is set automatically to CANONICAL in derivative calculations with methods which include triple excitations (MBPT[4]/MP4, CCSD+T[CCSD], CCSD[T], QCISD[T] and all iterative schemes like CCSDT-n and CC3) apart from CCSDT. IJ_CANONICAL requests a canonical perturbed-orbital treatment only for the occupied-occupied block of the unperturbed density matrix in analytic derivative calculations. For testing purposes, it is possible to force the use standard perturbed orbitals even in case of iterative triple excitations via the option FORCE_STANDA (dne?). Note also that in case of unrelaxed derivatives standard orbitals must be used.

Type: string; Possible Values: STANDARD, AOBASIS; Default: STANDARD. CFOUR_ACTIVE_ORBI (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies the active orbitals used in a TCSCF calculation and has to be used in combination with the keyword CFOUR_CORE_ORBITALS. The active orbitals are specified by either NIRREP or 2*NIRREP integers specifying the number of active orbitals of each symmetry type, where NIRREP is the number of irreducible representations in the computational point group. If there are no orbitals of a particular symmetry type a zero must be entered. For more information and an example see CFOUR_OCCUPATION . Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_ANH_ALGORITHM (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies which algorithm is used for CFOUR_ANHARMONIC =VIBROT, VPT2, and FULLQUARTIC calculations. If STANDARD (=0) is chosen, then simply invoking xcfour will cause a complete job to be run with all second-derivative calculations being done in series. If PARALLEL (=1), then the job stops after the second-derivative calculation at the reference geometry and generates out all input geometries for the remaining calculation. These can be then processed in “parallel” (currently not recommended). Note that it is recommended to carry out all calculations with PARALLEL, even when the actual calculation is carried out in a sequential mode. Type: string; Possible Values: STANDARD, PARALLEL; Default: STANDARD. CFOUR_ANH_DERIVATIVES (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies whether the anharmonic force field is calculated using analytic gradients (=FIRST) or analytic Hessians (=SECOND). Type: string; Possible Values: FIRST, SECOND; Default: SECOND. CFOUR_ANH_STEPSIZE (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Controls the stepsize used in anharmonic force field calculations. The value is specified in reduced normal coordinates, which are dimensionless. The actual stepsize used in the calculation is \(\times 10",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html
https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/autodoc_glossary_options_c.html:37422,Usability,clear,clearly,37422,"eyword is slightly complicated. For TDA calculations, the default is EXPECTATION since the evaluation of transition moments involves only a negligible amount of additional computation relative to the evaluation of the excitation energies. For EOMCC, the default is OFF since evaluation of any transition moments or properties requires approximately twice the computational time. Transition moments and dipole strengths are evaluated by default for all values of ESTATE_PROP other than OFF. Type: string; Possible Values: OFF, EXPECTATION, UNRELAXED, RESPONSE; Default: No Default. CFOUR_ESTATE_SYM (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies the number of excited states which are to be determined in each irreducible representation of the computational subgroup. The program attempts to find all of the lowest roots, but this is not guaranteed because the eigenvalue problem is not solved by direct matrix diagonalization, but rather by an iterative (modified Davidson) algorithm. For excited state gradient calculations, only one root (clearly) is used. In such a case, one and only one non-zero entry in the string can be used, and this value is usually set to one (i.e. 0/1/0/0). (However sometimes one wants to calculate the gradient for, say, the second root of a given symmetry, and in such a case, one could use 0/2/0/0. What happens is that both roots are calculated, but only the second one is used in the subsequent density matrix and gradient calculation.) The format used for this keyword is identical to that used in CFOUR_OCCUPATION. For example, for a computational subgroup having four symmetry species, the string 3/1/0/2 specifies that 6 total roots should be searched for, three in the first block, one in the second block, and two in the fourth block. It is also important to note that the %excite* input, if present, takes precedence over this keyword. Default: All zeros. Psi4 Interface: The array above is specified in PSI as (white space tolerant) [3,1,0,2]. Type: array; Default: No Default.

Examples given later in this manual further illustrate the QRHF input options and may help to clarify any confusion resulting from this documentation. (Default : 1). Type: array; Default: No Default. CFOUR_QRHFGUES (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — If this keyword is set to ON (=1), then the QRHF orbitals specified by the CFOUR_QRHF_GENERAL, CFOUR_QRHF_ORBITAL and CFOUR_QRHF_SPIN (nyi?) keywords are used as a starting guess for a restarted SCF procedure. This can be an extremely useful way to converge “difficult” SCF solutions, such as those that correspond to states that are not the lowest states of a given symmetry. Note that when this option is used, the calculation that is performed is not a QRHF-CC calculation; it is instead a UHF-based or ROHF-based calculation, depending on what type of reference is specified by the CFOUR_REFERENCE keyword. The QRHF aspect of the calculation is used simply as a device to converge the orbitals. Type: boolean; Default: false. CFOUR_RAMAN_INT (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — ON (=1) requests a calculation of Raman intensities based on the geometrical derivatives of the static polarizability tensor, while DYN (=2) requests a calculation of Raman intensities based on the derivatives of the dynamical polarizability tensor. Type: string; Possible Values: ON, DYN, OFF; Default: OFF. CFOUR_RAMAN_ORB (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies whether Raman intensities are calculated with orbital relaxation with respect to the electric field perturbation (RELAXED, = 1) or without orbital relaxation (UNRELAXED, = 0). Type: string; Possible Values: RELAXED, UNRELAXED; Default: UNRELAXED. CFOUR_RDO (CFOUR)¶CFOUR — Specifies whether or not relaxed density natural orbitals are to be computed. This option only has meaning for a correlated calculation. For =0, Do not compute. For =1, compute. Type: boolean; Default: true.

First, an initial CISD computation is run to get the natural orbitals; this allows a meaningful partitioning of the virtual orbitals into groups of different importance. Next, the RASCI is run. The split-virtual CISD[TQ] takes all singles and doubles, and all triples and quadruples with no more than 2 electrons in the secondary virtual subspace (RAS 3).

Mixing Basis Sets¶; While the above syntax will suffice for specifying basis sets in most cases,; the user may need to assign basis sets to specific atoms. To achieve this, a; basis “block” can be used. We use a snippet from the mints2 sample; input file, which performs a benzene SCF computation, to demonstrate this; feature.; basis {; assign DZ; assign C 3-21G; assign H1 sto-3g; assign C1 sto-3g; }.

Multiple basis sets can be; specified by adding additional sections within the surrounding brackets.; Use assign statements to actually request the basis set. This; basis {...} section replaces the usual set basis XXX line.; In a more complex input, if the user needs to call the user-defined; basis by name, this can be achieved using the syntax basis mybas {...},; and then the basis can be recalled later as set basis mybas.; To use a custom basis set as described in this section, it must be; defined prior to its use in a function that performs a computation.; basis {. # assign basset to all atoms and addl to hydrogens; assign basset; assign H addl. # basis set section like in snippet above goes here; [basset]; ... # additional basis set sections follow; [addl]; ...; }. The test case mints2 provides a complete example of; user-specified basis sets. Inputting effective core potentials (ECPs)¶; For ECP containing basis sets, all of the above mechanisms may still be used to; input the basis set; simply place the ECP definitions (in G94 format) in the; same file or input section as the orbital basis definition. Because the ECP; appears in the same section as the orbital basis, it will be parsed; automatically and the number of core electrons the ECP represents will be; detected, so no further input is required to use a core potential. See; Effective core potentials (ECPs) for more information about using ECPs and the; Def2-TZVP basis set definition; for an example of their input syntax. table of contents.
