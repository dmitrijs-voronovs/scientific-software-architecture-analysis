Source:; header file; source file; inheritance tree (.pdf) viewVC header viewVC source. Sections:; class description; function members; data members; class charts. ROOT; » CORE; » BASE; » TQCommand. class TQCommand: public TList, public TQObject. The Command design pattern is based on the idea, that all editing; in an application is done by creating instances of command objects.; Command objects apply changes to the edited object and then are; stored on a command stack. Furthermore, each command knows how to; undo its changes to bring the edited object back to its previous; state. As long as the application only uses command objects to; change the state of the edited object, it is possible to undo; a sequence of commands by traversing the command stack downwards and; calling the ""undo"" method of each command in turn. It is also; possible to redo a sequence of commands by traversing the command; stack upwards and calling the ""redo"" method of each command. Examples:. 1. Create a new command. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)""; ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 1st parameter - the name of class; 2nd parameter - object; 3rd parameter - the name of do/redo method; 4th parameter - the name of undo method. Since redo,undo methods are the same, undo name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. For objects derived from TObject class name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 2. Setting undo, redo parameters.

This is the ROOT implementation of the Qt object communication; mechanism (see also http://www.troll.no/qt/metaobjects.html). Signals and slots are used for communication between objects.; When an object has changed in some way that might be interesting; for the outside world, it emits a signal to tell whoever is; listening. All slots that are connected to this signal will be; activated (called). It is even possible to connect a signal; directly to another signal (this will emit the second signal; immediately whenever the first is emitted.) There is no limitation; on the number of slots that can be connected to a signal.; The slots will be activated in the order they were connected; to the signal.

This widget can be used as a Qt ""custom widget""; to build a custom GUI interfaces with Qt Designer. The class emits the Qt signals and has Qt public slots. Public slots: (Qt). virtual void cd(); // make the associated TCanvas the current one (shortcut to TCanvas::cd()); virtual void cd(int subpadnumber); // as above - shortcut to Canvas::cd(int subpadnumber); void Disconnect(); // disconnect the QWidget from the ROOT TCanvas (used in the class dtor); void Refresh(); // force the associated TCanvas::Update to be called; virtual bool Save(const QString &fileName) const; // Save the widget image with some ppixmap file; virtual bool Save(const char *fileName) const;; virtual bool Save(const QString &fileName,const char *format,int quality=60) const;; virtual bool Save(const char *fileName,const char *format,int quality=60) const;. signals (Qt). CanvasPainted(); // Signal the TCanvas has been painted onto the screen; Saved(bool ok); // Signal the TCanvas has been saved into the file; RootEventProcessed(TObject *selected, unsigned int event, TCanvas *c);; // Signal the Qt mouse/keyboard event has been process by ROOT; // This ""signal"" is emitted by the enabled mouse events only.; // See: EnableSignalEvents; // --- DisableSignalEvents. public methods:; The methods below define whether the TQtWidget object emits ""RootEventProcessed"" Qt signals; (By default no RootEventProcessed Qt signal is emitted ); void EnableSignalEvents (UInt_t f); void DisableSignalEve",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html604/TQtWidget.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html604/TQtWidget.html

ROOT; » MATH; » PHYSICS; » TQuaternion. class TQuaternion: public TObject. A Quaternion Class. Quaternion is a 4-component mathematic object quite convenient when dealing with; space rotation (or reference frame transformation). . In short, think of quaternion Q as a 3-vector augmented by a real number. Q = Q|r + Q|V; Quaternion multiplication :. Quaternion multiplication is given by :; Q.Q' = (Q|r + Q|V )*( Q'|r + Q'|V); = [ Q|r*Q'|r - Q|V*Q'|V ] + [ Q|r*Q'|V + Q'|r*Q|V + Q|V X Q'|V ]; ; where :; Q|r*Q'|r is a real number product of real numbers; Q|V*Q'|V is a real number, scalar product of two 3-vectors; Q|r*Q'|V is a 3-vector, scaling of a 3-vector by a real number; Q|VXQ'|V is a 3-vector, cross product of two 3-vectors; ; Thus, quaternion product is a generalization of real number product and product of a vector by a real number. Product of two pure vectors gives a quaternion whose real part is the opposite of scalar product and the vector part the cross product.; ; The conjugate of a quaternion Q = Q|r + Q|V is Q_bar = Q|r - Q|V. The magnitude of a quaternion Q is given by |Q|� = Q.Q_bar = Q_bar.Q = Q�|r + |Q|V|�; ; Therefore, the inverse of a quaternion is Q-1 = Q_bar /|Q|�; ; ""unit"" quaternion is a quaternion of magnitude 1 : |Q|� = 1.; Unit quaternions are a subset of the quaternions set.; ; Quaternion and rotations :. A rotation of angle f around a given axis, is represented by a unit quaternion Q :; - The axis of the rotation is given by the vector part of Q.; - The ratio between the magnitude of the vector part and the real part of Q equals tan(f/2).; ; In other words : Q = Q|r + Q|V = cos(f/2) + sin(f/2).; (where u is a unit vector // to the rotation axis,; cos(f/2) is the real part, sin(f/2).u is the vector part)",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html604/TQuaternion.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html604/TQuaternion.html
https://root.cern/root/html604/TQuaternion.html:3780,Performance,optimiz,optimized,3780," -Q|V is its inverse quaternion.; ; One verifies that :; Q.Q-1 = Q-1.Q = Q|r*Q|r + Q|V*Q|V + Q|r*Q|V -Q|r*Q|V + Q|VXQ|V; = Q�|r + Q�|V = 1; . The rotation of a vector V by the rotation described by a unit quaternion Q is obtained by the following operation : V' = Q*V*Q-1, considering V as a quaternion whose real part is null.; ; Numeric computation considerations :. Numerically, the quaternion multiplication involves 12 additions and 16 multiplications.; It is therefore faster than 3x3 matrixes multiplication involving 18 additions and 27 multiplications.; ; On the contrary, rotation of a vector by the above formula ( Q*V*Q-1 ) involves 18 additions and 24 multiplications, whereas multiplication of a 3-vector by a 3x3 matrix involves only 6 additions and 9 multiplications.; ; When dealing with numerous composition of space rotation, it is therefore faster to use quaternion product. On the other hand if a huge set of vectors must be rotated by a given quaternion, it is more optimized to convert the quaternion into a rotation matrix once, and then use that later to rotate the set of vectors.; ; More information :. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation .; . en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion .; ; _______________________________________________; ; This Class represents all quaternions (unit or non-unit); It possesses a Normalize() method to make a given quaternion unit; The Rotate(TVector3&) and Rotation(TVector3&) methods can be used even for a non-unit quaternion, in that case, the proper normalization is applied to perform the rotation.; ; A TRotation constructor exists than takes a quaternion for parameter (even non-unit), in that cas the proper normalisation is applied.; .

The Command design pattern is based on the idea, that all editing; in an application is done by creating instances of command objects.; Command objects apply changes to the edited object and then are; stored on a command stack.

TH1::FillRandom(TH1 *) or TH1::FillRandom(const char *tf1name). can be used to fill an histogram (1-d, 2-d, 3-d from an existing histogram; or from an existing function. Note this interesting feature when working with objects. You can use several TRandom objects, each with their ""independent""; random sequence. For example, one can imagine; TRandom *eventGenerator = new TRandom();; TRandom *tracking = new TRandom();; eventGenerator can be used to generate the event kinematics.; tracking can be used to track the generated particles with random numbers; independent from eventGenerator.; This very interesting feature gives the possibility to work with simple; and very fast random number generators without worrying about; random number periodicity as it was the case with Fortran.; One can use TRandom::SetSeed to modify the seed of one generator. a TRandom object may be written to a Root file. -as part of another object; -or with its own key (example gRandom->Write(""Random"");.

When an object is referenced (see TRef assignement operator or TRefArray::Add); a unique identifier is computed and stored in both the fUniqueID of the; referenced and referencing object. This uniqueID is computed by incrementing; by one the static global in TProcessID::fgNumber. fUniqueID is some sort of; serial object number in the current session. One can retrieve at any time; the current value of fgNumber by calling the static function TProcessID::GetObjectCount; or set this number via TProcessID::SetObjectCount.; To avoid a growing table of fObjects in TProcessID, in case, for example,; one processes many events in a loop, it might be necessary to reset the; ObjectNumber at the end of processing of one event. See an example; in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.cxx (look at function Build).; The value of ObjectNumber (say saveNumber=TProcessID::GetObjectCount()) may be; saved at the beginning of one event and reset to this original value; at the end of the event via TProcessID::SetObjectCount(saveNumber).

Special case of a TRef pointing to an object with a TUUID.

WARNING1: If MyClass is the class of the referenced object, The TObject; part of MyClass must be Streamed. One should not; call MyClass::Class()->IgnoreTObjectStreamer(). WARNING2: A TRef cannot point to another TRef. ObjectNumber. When an object is referenced (see TRef assignement operator or TRefArray::Add); a unique identifier is computed and stored in both the fUniqueID of the; referenced and referencing object. This uniqueID is computed by incrementing; by one the static global in TProcessID::fgNumber. fUniqueID is some sort of; serial object number in the current session. One can retrieve at any time; the current value of fgNumber by calling the static function TProcessID::GetObjectCount; or set this number via TProcessID::SetObjectCount.; To avoid a growing table of fObjects in TProcessID, in case, for example,; one processes many events in a loop, it might be necessary to reset the; ObjectNumber at the end of processing of one event. See an example; in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.cxx (look at function Build).; The value of ObjectNumber (say saveNumber=TProcessID::GetObjectCount()) may be; saved at the beginning of one event and reset to this original value; at the end of the event via TProcessID::SetObjectCount(saveNumber). These; actions may be stacked. Action on Demand. The normal behaviour of a TRef has been described above. In addition,; TRef supports also ""Actions on Demand"". It may happen that the object; referenced is not yet in memory, on a separate file or not yet computed.; In this case TRef is able to automatically execute an action:; - call to a compiled function (static function of member function); - call to an interpreted function; - execution of a CINT script. How to select this option?; In the definition of the TRef data member in the original class, do:; TRef fRef; //EXEC:execName. points to something; When the special keyword ""EXEC:"" is found in the comment field of the member,; the next string is assumed to be the name of",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html604/TRef.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html604/TRef.html

When a TRef is dereferenced via TRef::GetObject, its TExec will be; automatically executed. In the function/script being executed, one or more; of the following actions can be executed:; - load a file containing the referenced object. This function typically; looks in the file catalog (GRID).; - compute a pointer to the referenced object and communicate this pointer; back to the calling function TRef::GetObject via:; TRef::SetStaticObject(object).; When the TExec is called, it has access to the dereferencing TRef; by calling GetStaticObject() (TRef::GetObject() sets fgObject to ""this""; before the call to TExec). This can be useful for accessing the TRef's; fUniqueID.; As soon as an object is returned to GetObject, the fUniqueID of the TRef is set; to the fUniqueID of the referenced object. At the next call to GetObject,; the pointer stored in fPid:fObjects[fUniqueID] will be returned directly. An example of action on demand is shown in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.h with; the member:; TRef fWebHistogram; //EXEC:GetWebHistogram; When calling fWebHistogram.GetObject(), the function GetObject; will automatically invoke a script GetWebHistogram.C via the interpreter.; An example of a GetWebHistogram.C script is shown below; void GetWebHistogram() {; TFile *f= TFile::Open(""http://root.cern.ch/files/pippa.root"");; f->cd(""DM/CJ"");; TH1 *h6 = (TH1*)gDirectory->Get(""h6"");; h6->SetDirectory(0);; delete f;; TRef::SetStaticObject(h6);; }; In the above example, a call to fWebHistogram.GetObject() executes the; script with the function GetWebHistogram. This script connects a file; with histograms: pippa.root on the ROOT Web site and returns the object h6; to TRef::GetObject.; Note that if the definition of the TRef fWebHistogram had been:; TRef fWebHistogram; //EXEC:GetWebHistogram(); then, the compiled or interpreted function GetWebHistogram() would have; been called instead of the CINT script GetWebHistogram.C.

When a top level object (eg Event *event) is a tree/graph of many objects,; the normal ROOT Streaming mechanism ensures that only one copy of each object; in the tree/graph is written to the output buffer to avoid circular; dependencies.; However if the object event is split into several files or into several; branches of one or more Trees, normal C++ pointers cannot be used because; each I/O operation will write the referenced objects.; When a TRef is used to point to a TObject *robj, for example in a class with; TRef fRef;; one can do:; fRef = robj; //to set the pointer; This TRef and robj can be written with two different I/O calls; in the same or different files, in the same or different branches of a Tree. If the TRef is read and the referenced object has not yet been read,; the TRef will return a null pointer. As soon as the referenced object; will be read, the TRef will point to it. If the referenced object is; contained in a TTree it can be autoloaded using the TBranchRef mechanism,; which is set up by simply calling TTree::BranchRef(). TRef also supports the complex situation where a TFile is updated; multiple times on the same machine or a different machine. How does it work. A TRef is itself a TObject with an additional transient pointer fPID.; When the statement fRef = robj is executed, the following actions happen:; - The pointer fPID is set to the current TProcessID.; - The current ObjectNumber (see below) is incremented by one.; - robj::fUniqueID is set to ObjectNumber.; - In the fPID object, the element fObjects[ObjectNumber] is set to robj; - ref::fUniqueID is also set to ObjectNumber.; After having set fRef, one can immediatly return the value of robj; using fRef.GetObject(). This function returns directly fObjects[fUniqueID]; from the fPID object. When the TRef is written, the process id number pidf of fPID is written; in addition to the TObject part of TRef (fBits,fUniqueID).; When the TRef is read, its pointer fPID is set to t",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html604/TRef.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html604/TRef.html

What are robust estimators?; ""An important property of an estimator is its robustness. An estimator; is called robust if it is insensitive to measurements that deviate; from the expected behaviour.

What does this algorithm do?; It computes a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter.; Then, it takes those estimates to compute robust distances of all the; data vectors. Those with large robust distances are considered outliers.; Robust distances can then be plotted for better visualization of the data. How does this algorithm do it?; The MCD objective is to find h observations(out of n) whose classical; covariance matrix has the lowest determinant. The MCD estimator of location; is then the average of those h points and the MCD estimate of scatter; is their covariance matrix.

There are 2 ways to treat such deviating; measurements: one may either try to recongize them and then remove; them from the data sample; or one may leave them in the sample, taking; care that they do not influence the estimate unduly.

What does this algorithm do?; It computes a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter.; Then, it takes those estimates to compute robust distances of all the; data vectors. Those with large robust distances are considered outliers.; Robust distances can then be plotted for better visualization of the data.

What are robust estimators?; ""An important property of an estimator is its robustness. An estimator; is called robust if it is insensitive to measurements that deviate; from the expected behaviour. There are 2 ways to treat such deviating; measurements: one may either try to recongize them and then remove; them from the data sample; or one may leave them in the sample, taking; care that they do not influence the estimate unduly.

What does this algorithm do?; It computes a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter.; Then, it takes those estimates to compute robust distances of all the; data vectors. Those with large robust distances are considered outliers.; Robust distances can then be plotted for better visualization of the data. How does this algorithm do it?; The MCD objective is to find h observations(out of n) whose classical; covariance matrix has the lowest determinant.

The MCD estimator of location; is then the average of those h points and the MCD estimate of scatter; is their covariance matrix. The minimum(and default) h = (n+nvariables+1)/2; so the algorithm is effective when less than (n+nvar+1)/2 variables are outliers.; The algorithm also allows for exact fit situations - that is, when h or more; observations lie on a hyperplane. Then the algorithm still yields the MCD location T; and scatter matrix S, the latter being singular as it should be. From (T,S) the; program then computes the equation of the hyperplane. How can this algorithm be used?; In any case, when contamination of data is suspected, that might influence; the classical estimates.; Also, robust estimation of location and scatter is a tool to robustify; other multivariate techniques such as, for example, principal-component analysis; and discriminant analysis. Technical details of the algorithm:; 0.The default h = (n+nvariables+1)/2, but the user may choose any interger h with; (n+nvariables+1)/2<=h<=n.

Efficiency (e or em) is the detection probability for signal.; A low efficiency hence generally means weaker limits.; If the efficiency of an experiment (with analysis cuts) is; dealt with elsewhere, em or e can be set to one.

For Gaussian efficiency or background:. bm = estimate of the background; sdb = corresponding standard deviation. em = estimate of the efficiency; sde = corresponding standard deviation. If the efficiency scale of dealt with elsewhere,; set em to 1 and sde to the relative uncertainty.

The TROOT object is the entry point to the ROOT system.; The single instance of TROOT is accessible via the global gROOT.; Using the gROOT pointer one has access to basically every object; created in a ROOT based program. The TROOT object is essentially a; container of several lists pointing to the main ROOT objects. The following lists are accessible from gROOT object:; gROOT->GetListOfClasses; gROOT->GetListOfColors; gROOT->GetListOfTypes; gROOT->GetListOfGlobals; gROOT->GetListOfGlobalFunctions; gROOT->GetListOfFiles; gROOT->GetListOfMappedFiles; gROOT->GetListOfSockets; gROOT->GetListOfSecContexts; gROOT->GetListOfCanvases; gROOT->GetListOfStyles; gROOT->GetListOfFunctions; gROOT->GetListOfSpecials (for example graphical cuts); gROOT->GetListOfGeometries; gROOT->GetListOfBrowsers; gROOT->GetListOfCleanups; gROOT->GetListOfMessageHandlers. The TROOT class provides also many useful services:; - Get pointer to an object in any of the lists above; - Time utilities TROOT::Time. The ROOT object must be created as a static object. An example; of a main program creating an interactive version is shown below:.

Setting The Rotations; The member function SetToIdentity() will set the rotation object; to the identity (no rotation).; With a minor caveat, the Euler angles of the rotation may be set using; SetXEulerAngles() or individually set with SetXPhi(),; SetXTheta(), and SetXPsi(). These routines set the Euler; angles using the X-convention which is defined by a rotation about the Z-axis,; about the new X-axis, and about the new Z-axis. This is the convention used; in Landau and Lifshitz, Goldstein and other common physics texts. The; Y-convention euler angles can be set with SetYEulerAngles(),; SetYPhi(), SetYTheta(), and SetYPsi(). The caveat; is that Euler angles usually define the rotation of the new coordinate system; with respect to the original system, however, the TRotation class specifies; the rotation of the object in the original system (an active rotation). To; recover the usual Euler rotations (ie. rotate the system not the object), you; must take the inverse of the rotation.; The member functions SetXAxis(), SetYAxis(), and; SetZAxis() will create a rotation which rotates the requested axis; of the object to be parallel to a vector. If used with one argument, the; rotation about that axis is arbitrary. If used with two arguments, the; second variable defines the XY, YZ, or ZX; respectively. Inverse rotation;   TRotation a,b;;   ...;   b = a.Inverse();  // b is inverse of a, a is unchanged;   b = a.Invert();   // invert a and set b = a. Compound Rotations; The operator * has been implemented in a way that follows the; mathematical notation of a product of the two matrices which describe the; two consecutive rotations. Therefore the second rotation should be placed; first:;   r = r2 * r1;.

A TS3WebFile is a TWebFile which retrieves the file contents from a; web server implementing the REST API of the Amazon S3 protocol. This; class is meant to be as generic as possible to be used with files; hosted not only by Amazon S3 servers but also by other providers; implementing the core of the S3 protocol. The S3 protocol works on top of HTTPS (and HTTP) and imposes that; each HTTP request be signed using a specific convention: the request; must include an 'Authorization' header which contains the signature; of a concatenation of selected request fields. For signing the; request, an 'Access Key Id' and a 'Secret Access Key' need to be; known. These keys are used by the S3 servers to identify the client; and to authenticate the request as genuine. As an end user, you must know the Access Key and Secret Access Key; in order to access each S3 file. They are provided to you by your S3; service provider. Those two keys can be provided to ROOT when; initializing an object of this class by two means:; a) by using the environmental variables S3_ACCESS_KEY and; S3_SECRET_KEY, or; b) by specifying them when opening each file. The first method is convenient if all the S3 files you want to; access are hosted by a single provider. The second one is more; flexible as it allows you to specify which credentials to use; on a per-file basis. See the documentation of the constructor of; this class for details on the syntax.

Default options are taken from fgAcceptOpt and are initially; equivalent to kSrvNoAuth; they can be changed with the static; method TServerSocket::SetAcceptOptions(Opt).; The active defaults can be visualized using the static method; TServerSocket::ShowAcceptOptions(). TInetAddress GetLocalInetAddress(); Return internet address of host to which the server socket is bound,; i.e. the local host. In case of error TInetAddress::IsValid() returns; kFALSE. Int_t GetLocalPort(); Get port # to which server socket is bound. In case of error returns -1. UChar_t GetAcceptOptions(); Return default options for Accept. void SetAcceptOptions(UChar_t Opt); Set default options for Accept according to modifier 'mod'.; Use:; kSrvAuth require client authentication; kSrvNoAuth do not require client authentication. void ShowAcceptOptions(); Print default options for Accept. Bool_t Authenticate(TSocket* ); Check authentication request from the client on new; open connection. TServerSocket(); { }.
