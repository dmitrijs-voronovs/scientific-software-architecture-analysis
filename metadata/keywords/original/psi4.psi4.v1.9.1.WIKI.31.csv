PSI4. Installation and Runtime Configuration; Compiling and Installing from Source. Compiling and Installing from Source¶; This section fulfills the duty of every Linux project to have an INSTALL; file detailing how to build it from source. Few (mostly packagers and; sysadmins) are expected to read this file as it is a broad guide to the; many choices in building this project. For a specific, well-tested,; and performance-tuned build path, see psicode.org/installs/latest; (select “source”). For pre-built binaries again well-tested,; performance-tuned, and available for all common operating systems,; see psicode.org/installs/latest (select “conda”). Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ON",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/build_planning-1.html

It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers on Linux also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked.; Intel OneAPI Classic compilers work fine. OneAPI beta compilers build but have; been only minimally tested. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works. Use it at your own risk and after testing your; particular distribution, including tests run multithreaded,; if you intend to run PSI4 so. Use at least 0.2.15, and; pay attention to how it was compiled - unthreaded seems safe,; openmp-threaded is mostly safe, default pthreaded is not safe.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS.

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected.

Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance.

See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; >>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. If you have pytest installed, very similar coverage is obtained through:; >>> make pytest. How to run a subset of tests¶; CTest allows flexibly partitioned running of the test suite.

How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation).

Install. If tests pass, install the code.; >>> make install. 7. Configure Runtime. To run PSI4 after installation, you need to configure a few variables:. How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation; How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation. What are the tools and dependencies strictly required for building Psi4¶; The core PSI4 build requires the software below. Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it. C++ and C Compilers (C++14 compliant); Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard; Linux distribution); Python interpreter and headers (3.6+) https://www.python.org/; CMake (3.15+) https://cmake.org/download/; NumPy (needed at runtime and buildtime) https://numpy.org/; System utilities: GNU make and GNU install or Ninja, POSIX threads (Pthreads) library. The following are also required for PSI4, but if not detected, the; build system will automatically download and build. gau2grid — [what is gau2grid?] [gau2grid min version]; Libint — [what is Libint?] [Libint min version] (Libint2 as of Nov 2020; added by v1.4).

Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. How to configure code to use high angular momentum basis sets¶; The Libint integral code handles; arbitrary order angular momentum (AM), but compiling that is; prohibitive. The build process for Libint2 takes longer than; for Libint1, so it’s recommended to use the conda packages. The AM controlling keyword MAX_AM_ERI; has definition changed a little from Libint1. It is used to ensure; that conventional energies can use at least MAX_AM_ERI zeta. See; psi4//external/upstream/libint2/CMakeLists.txt for a fuller; discussion of AM capabilities. Unless BUILD_Libint2_GENERATOR; is set to ON, an internal build of Libint2 will download a; pregenerated tarball of at least MAX_AM_ERI AM. If you; want to build completely from generator source, turn on the keyword,; but parts can only run in serial and parts benefit from parallel, so; it’s not recommended. All the AM generation settings would need to be; edited in the above CMakeLists.txt rather than passing them into; the PSI4 build directly.

If earlier Libint was built; internally (as opposed to detecting an external installation),; remove stage/include/libint/, stage/share/cmake/Libint/,; stage/lib/libint2.so.2.

Reinvoke make and check the number; beside Found Libint in the CMake output.; Note that the same keyword MAX_AM_ERI controls Libint and simint. simint; can’t compile above AM7, so you’ll have to turn off simint to get an; internal compile of AM>=8 Libint. The keyword is only a lower bound for; detection, so you can set it at 7, have both Libint and simint enabled,; and point CMake toward a pre-built Libint AM8 just fine.

How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time.

Compiling and Installing from Source¶; This section fulfills the duty of every Linux project to have an INSTALL; file detailing how to build it from source. Few (mostly packagers and; sysadmins) are expected to read this file as it is a broad guide to the; many choices in building this project. For a specific, well-tested,; and performance-tuned build path, see psicode.org/installs/latest; (select “source”). For pre-built binaries again well-tested,; performance-tuned, and available for all common operating systems,; see psicode.org/installs/latest (select “conda”). Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4. More detail is given here.; >>> cd {top-level-psi4-dir}; >>> cmake -S. -Bobjdir [your configuration options]; >>> cd objdir; >>> make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; >>> make install.

Compiling and Installing from Source¶; This section fulfills the duty of every Linux project to have an INSTALL; file detailing how to build it from source. Few (mostly packagers and; sysadmins) are expected to read this file as it is a broad guide to the; many choices in building this project. For a specific, well-tested,; and performance-tuned build path, see psicode.org/installs/latest; (select “source”). For pre-built binaries again well-tested,; performance-tuned, and available for all common operating systems,; see psicode.org/installs/latest (select “conda”). Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4. More detail is given here.; >>> cd {top-level-psi4-dir}; >>> cmake -S. -Bobjdir [your configuration options]; >>> cd objdir; >>> make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; >>> make install.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; shebang line. To use a different Python with PSI4 in the long term,; edit the shebang line.; If you’re using PSI4 as a Python module, then PSI4 is running; the Python of which python. How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. >>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run.

How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt.

Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest.

For pre-built binaries again well-tested,; performance-tuned, and available for all common operating systems,; see psicode.org/installs/latest (select “conda”). Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4. More detail is given here.; >>> cd {top-level-psi4-dir}; >>> cmake -S. -Bobjdir [your configuration options]; >>> cd objdir; >>> make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; >>> make install. How to build, test, and install Psi4, in detail¶; 1. Plan Directories. Get ahold of the PSI4 codebase, and navigate to the top level source; directory, hereafter top-level-psi4-dir.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation; How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation. What are the tools and dependencies strictly required for building Psi4¶; The core PSI4 build requires the software below. Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code.

This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments).

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code.

This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to configure a Psi4 build on Cray¶; Cray systems strongly prefer to build static libraries, but PSI4; needs to be dynamic to function as a Python module. Courtesy of @misha; at the forum and various supercomputer guides, building PSI4 on; Cray requires setting environment variables before running cmake.; CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes cmake ... CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE¶; Set to allow PSI4 to build as shared library on Cray supercomputers. CRAY_ADD_RPATH¶; Set to true to allow PSI4 to build on Cray supercomputers. How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies. PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source.

The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.9.

PSI4. Installation and Runtime Configuration; Compiling and Installing from Source. Compiling and Installing from Source¶; This section fulfills the duty of every Linux project to have an INSTALL; file detailing how to build it from source. Few (mostly packagers and; sysadmins) are expected to read this file as it is a broad guide to the; many choices in building this project. For a specific, well-tested,; and performance-tuned build path, see psicode.org/installs/latest; (select “source”). For pre-built binaries again well-tested,; performance-tuned, and available for all common operating systems,; see psicode.org/installs/latest (select “conda”). Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

A way to get one is to download; the gfortran_osx-64 conda package. This provides; gfortran compilers for Mac. The version is 4.8.5, which is quite old,; but the Fortran compiler will work.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ON",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/build_planning.html

Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers on Linux also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked.; Intel OneAPI Classic compilers work fine. OneAPI beta compilers build but have; been only minimally tested. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_osx-64 clang_osx-64 llvm-openmp intel-openmp. # To Build, activate environment (prepends PATH and defines environment variables CLANG, CLANGXX, HOST, etc):; >>> conda activate clang401; >>> echo ${CLANGXX}; /path/to/miniconda/envs/clang401/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-clang++; >>> echo ${HOST}; x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0. # build with Clang; >>> cmake -S. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${CLANG} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CLANGXX} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-stdlib=libc++"" \; -DOp",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/build_planning.html

See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; >>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works. Use it at your own risk and after testing your; particular distribution, including tests run multithreaded,; if you intend to run PSI4 so. Use at least 0.2.15, and; pay attention to how it was compiled - unthreaded seems safe,; openmp-threaded is mostly safe, default pthreaded is not safe.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works.

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h.

See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; >>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. If you have pytest installed, very similar coverage is obtained through:; >>> make pytest. How to run a subset of tests¶; CTest allows flexibly partitioned running of the test suite.

Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it. C++ and C Compilers (C++14 compliant); Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard; Linux distribution); Python interpreter and headers (3.6+) https://www.python.org/; CMake (3.15+) https://cmake.org/download/; NumPy (needed at runtime and buildtime) https://numpy.org/; System utilities: GNU make and GNU install or Ninja, POSIX threads (Pthreads) library. The following are also required for PSI4, but if not detected, the; build system will automatically download and build. gau2grid — [what is gau2grid?] [gau2grid min version]; Libint — [what is Libint?] [Libint min version] (Libint2 as of Nov 2020; added by v1.4).

Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. How to configure code to use high angular momentum basis sets¶; The Libint integral code handles; arbitrary order angular momentum (AM), but compiling that is; prohibitive. The build process for Libint2 takes longer than; for Libint1, so it’s recommended to use the conda packages. The AM controlling keyword MAX_AM_ERI; has definition changed a little from Libint1. It is used to ensure; that conventional energies can use at least MAX_AM_ERI zeta. See; psi4//external/upstream/libint2/CMakeLists.txt for a fuller; discussion of AM capabilities. Unless BUILD_Libint2_GENERATOR; is set to ON, an internal build of Libint2 will download a; pregenerated tarball of at least MAX_AM_ERI AM. If you; want to build completely from generator source, turn on the keyword,; but parts can only run in serial and parts benefit from parallel, so; it’s not recommended. All the AM generation settings would need to be; edited in the above CMakeLists.txt rather than passing them into; the PSI4 build directly. Build with Higher Angular Momentum; >>> cmake -DMAX_AM_ERI=6.

If earlier Libint was built; internally (as opposed to detecting an external installation),; remove stage/include/libint/, stage/share/cmake/Libint/,; stage/lib/libint2.so.2. Edit MAX_AM_ERI; value in CMakeCache.txt. Reinvoke make and check the number; beside Found Libint in the CMake output.; Note that the same keyword MAX_AM_ERI controls Libint and simint. simint; can’t compile above AM7, so you’ll have to turn off simint to get an; internal compile of AM>=8 Libint. The keyword is only a lower bound for; detection, so you can set it at 7, have both Libint and simint enabled,; and point CMake toward a pre-built Libint AM8 just fine. How to configure Libint for building Psi4. How to get high angular momentum integrals from conda¶; Libint2 conda packages are available from conda for Linux, Mac, and Windows.; The Linux package has base MAX_AM_ERI=7 and can run 7z energies; and gradients conventional, 6z energies and gradients density-fitted,; and qz Hessians both conventional and density fitted.; The Mac and Windows packages have base MAX_AM_ERI=5 and can run; 5z energies, qz gradients, and tz Hessians, both conventional and; density-fitted.; Details about angular momentum settings are available here; https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/external/upstream/libint2/CMakeLists.txt; .

How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_osx-64 clang_osx-64 llvm-openmp intel-openmp. # To Build, activate environment (prepends PATH and defines environment variables CLANG, CLANGXX, HOST, etc):; >>> conda activate clang401; >>> echo ${CLANGXX}; /path/to/miniconda/envs/clang401/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-clang++; >>> echo ${HOST}; x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0. # build with Clang; >>> cmake -S. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${CLANG} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CLANGXX} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-stdlib=libc++"" \; -DOpenMP_CXX_FLAG=""-fopenmp=libiomp5"". # build with Intel; >>> cmake -S. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc \; -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-clang-name=${CLANG}"" \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-clang-name=${CLANG} -clangxx-name=${CLANGXX} -stdlib=libc++ -I${CONDA_PREFIX}/include/c++/v1"". # Configure and build.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; shebang line. To use a different Python with PSI4 in the long term,; edit the shebang line.; If you’re using PSI4 as a Python module, then PSI4 is running; the Python of which python. How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. >>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner. Issue make VERBOSE=1 to display the full; compilation commands and errors. How to highlight git merge conflicts in vi¶; Edit your ~/.vimrc file to include the lines below.

How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt.

Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation).

Few (mostly packagers and; sysadmins) are expected to read this file as it is a broad guide to the; many choices in building this project. For a specific, well-tested,; and performance-tuned build path, see psicode.org/installs/latest; (select “source”). For pre-built binaries again well-tested,; performance-tuned, and available for all common operating systems,; see psicode.org/installs/latest (select “conda”). Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4. More detail is given here.; >>> cd {top-level-psi4-dir}; >>> cmake -S. -Bobjdir [your configuration options]; >>> cd objdir; >>> make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; >>> make install. How to build, test, and install Psi4, in detail¶; 1. Plan Directories. Get ahold of the PSI4 codebase, and navigate to the top level source; directory, hereafter top-level-psi4-dir.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation; How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation. What are the tools and dependencies strictly required for building Psi4¶; The core PSI4 build requires the software below. Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it. C++ and C Compilers (C++14 compliant); Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard; Linux distribution); Python interpreter and headers (3.6+) https://www.python.org/; CMake (3.15+) https://cmake.org/download/; NumPy (needed at runtime and buildtime) https://numpy.org/; System utilities: GNU make and GNU install or Ninja, POSIX threads (Pthreads) library.

This is a full; installation.; /; bin/ (executables for psi4 + any external proj); bin/psi4 (psi4 executable, actually just a py script); include/ (installed headers for psi4 + any external proj); include/psi4/ (header files for #include-ing); include/psi4/psi4-dec.h (primary psi4 header); include/psi4/masses.h (a project-wide psi4 header); include/psi4/libmints/ (psi4 library headers); include/psi4/libfock/ (ditto); share/ (read-only arch-indep files for psi4 + any external proj); share/cmake/psi4/ (files for detecting installed targets); share/cmake/psi4/psi4Config.cmake (psi4 build/install info); share/cmake/psi4/psi4ConfigVersion.cmake (psi4 cmake version info); share/doc/psi4/html/ (sphinx html documentation); share/psi4/ (text files needed by psi4); share/psi4/basis (basis sets); share/psi4/plugins (plugin template files); share/psi4",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/build_planning.html

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always n",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/build_planning.html

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to configure a Psi4 build on Cray¶; Cray systems strongly prefer to build static libraries, but PSI4; needs to be dynamic to function as a Python module. Courtesy of @misha; at the forum and various supercomputer guides, building PSI4 on; Cray requires setting environment variables before running cmake.; CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes cmake ... CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE¶; Set to allow PSI4 to build as shared library on Cray supercomputers. CRAY_ADD_RPATH¶; Set to true to allow PSI4 to build on Cray supercomputers. How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies. PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source.

The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.9. Build with full Python specification to root directory ${PFXC}. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=""${PFXC}/bin/python"" \; -DPython_LIBRARY=""${PFXC}/lib/libpython3.9.so"" \; -DPython_INCLUDE_DIR=""${PFXC}/include/python3.9"". What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable.

If some options should be used for both parts of the stage, they should be entered in both `options` and `options_lo`. This is helpful for calculating all electron corrections in otherwise frozen core calculations, or relativistic (DKH) Hamiltionian corrections for otherwise nonrelativistic.; `options_lo`: special options for lower method in a given stage. This is useful to calculate a direct stage in an otherwise density-fitted calculation, or similar.; `treatment`: treat extrapolation stage as `scf` or `corl`, by default only the first stage is `scf` and every later one is `corl`.; `stage`: tag for the stage used in tables. The next items in the `cbs_metadata` array extrapolate correlation. All of the above parameters are available, with only the `wfn` and `basis` keywords required. Other supported parameters are:. `wfn_lo`: the lower method from which the delta correction is to be calculated. By default, it is set to `wfn` from the previous field in the `cbs_metadata` array.; `basis_lo`: basis set to be used for the delta correction.

Note; As of October 2018, only two explicit `deltaN_[wfn,basis,scheme]` sets of options are active; if more delta functions are required, use the `cbs_metadata` interface. Also, temporarily extrapolations are performed on differences of target and scf total energies, rather than on correlation energies directly. This doesn’t affect the extrapolated values of the particular formulas defined here (though it does affect the betas, which are commented out), but it is sloppy and temporary and could affect any user-defined corl extrapolations.

If some options should be used for both parts of the stage, they should be entered in both `options` and `options_lo`. This is helpful for calculating all electron corrections in otherwise frozen core calculations, or relativistic (DKH) Hamiltionian corrections for otherwise nonrelativistic.; `options_lo`: special options for lower method in a given stage. This is useful to calculate a direct stage in an otherwise density-fitted calculation, or similar.; `treatment`: treat extrapolation stage as `scf` or `corl`, by default only the first stage is `scf` and every later one is `corl`.; `stage`: tag for the stage used in tables. The next items in the `cbs_metadata` array extrapolate correlation. All of the above parameters are available, with only the `wfn` and `basis` keywords required. Other supported parameters are:. `wfn_lo`: the lower method from which the delta correction is to be calculated. By default, it is set to `wfn` from the previous field in the `cbs_metadata` array.; `basis_lo`: basis set to be used for the delta correction.

Basic Keywords¶; A complete list of keywords related to coupled-cluster computations is; provided in the appendices, with the majority of the relevant; keywords appearing in Appendix CCENERGY. For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems.

Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd codes. A value of LOW selects a “low priority” scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities. A value of LRU selects a “least recently used” scheme in which the oldest item in the cache will be the first one deleted. Type: string; Possible Values: LOW, LRU; Default: LOW. NUM_AMPS_PRINT¶. Number of important \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes to print. Type: integer; Default: 10. MP2_AMPS_PRINT¶. Do print the MP2 amplitudes which are the starting guesses for RHF and UHF reference functions?. Type: boolean; Default: false. Larger Calculations¶; Here are a few recommendations for carrying out large-basis-set coupled; cluster calculations with PSI4:. In most cases it is reasonable to set the memory keyword to 90% of; the available physical memory, at most. There is a small amount of overhead; associated with the; coupled cluster modules that is not accounted for by the internal CC memory; handling routines. Thus, the user should not specify the entire; physical memory of the system, or swapping is likely. However, for especially large; calculations, it is better to set the memory keyword to a value less than 16 GB.; Set the CACHELEVEL keyword to 0.; This will turn off cacheing, which, for very large calculations, can; lead to heap fragmentation and memory faults, even when sufficient; physical memory exists.; Set the PRINT keyword to 2. This; will help narrow where memory bottlenecks or other errors exist in the; event of a crash. Excited State Coupled Cluster Calculations¶; A complete list of keywords related to; coupled cluster linear response is provided in Appendix CCEOM.; The most important keywords associated with EOM-CC calculations are:. ROOTS_PER_IRREP¶. Number of excited states per irreducible representation for EOM-CC and CC-LR calculations.

Type: string; Possible Values: POLARIZABILITY, ROTATION, ROA, ROA_TENSOR, ALL; Default: POLARIZABILITY. OMEGA¶. Array that specifies the desired frequencies of the incident radiation field in CCLR calculations. If only one element is given, the units will be assumed to be atomic units. If more than one element is given, then the units must be specified as the final element of the array. Acceptable units are HZ, NM, EV, and AU. Type: array; Default: No Default. GAUGE¶. Specifies the choice of representation of the electric dipole operator. For polarizability, this keyword is ignored and LENGTH gauge is computed. For optical rotation and raman optical activity, this keyword is active, and acceptable values are LENGTH for the usual length-gauge representation, VELOCITY``(default) for the modified velocity-gauge representation in which the static-limit optical rotation tensor is subtracted from the frequency- dependent tensor, or ``BOTH. Note that, for optical rotation and raman optical activity calculations, only the choices of VELOCITY or BOTH will yield origin-independent results.

When; specified, the memory value is passed on to Cfour by setting keywords; CFOUR_MEMORY_SIZE and CFOUR_MEM_UNIT=MB.; PSI4 has an extensive basis set library in; Gaussian94 format. See Basis Sets for details. Contrasts to; Cfour basis handling include identifying basis sets by standard name; (aug-cc-pVDZ instead of AUG-PVDZ), direct handles for; diffuse-function-pruned sets (e.g., jun-cc-pVDZ), case insensitivity,; appropriate setting of spherical/Cartesian depending on basis set design,; and syntax to set different basis sets to different classes of atoms; without listing each atom. All of these features are available to Cfour by; using the BASIS keyword instead of CFOUR_BASIS; (accompanied, of course, by specifying the molecule PSI4-style).; Internally, PSI4 processes the basis set as usual, then translates; the basis set format and writes out a GENBAS file with an entry for; each atom. The P4C4 interface sets keyword CFOUR_BASIS=SPECIAL; and CFOUR_SPHERICAL as appropriate, then writes the basis section; necessary for SPECIAL below the *CFOUR(...) block.
