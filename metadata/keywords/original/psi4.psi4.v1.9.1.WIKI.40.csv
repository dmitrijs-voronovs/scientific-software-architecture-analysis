How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it.

Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

What C and C++ compilers and versions are approved¶; On Linux, the following work nicely. GNU: gcc, g++; Intel: icc, icpc; Clang: clang, clang++. On Mac, the following work nicely. Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers on Linux also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked.; Intel OneAPI Classic compilers work fine. OneAPI beta compilers build but have; been only minimally tested. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_osx-64 clang_osx-64 llvm-openmp intel-openmp. # To Build, activate environment (prepends PATH and defines environment variables CLANG, CLANGXX, HOST, etc):; >>> conda activate clang401; >>> echo ${CLANGXX}; /path/to/miniconda/envs/clang401/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-clang++; >>> echo ${HOST}; x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0. # build with Clang; >>> cmake -S. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${CLANG} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CLANGXX} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-stdlib=libc++"" \; -DOp",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning-1.html

Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies. PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source. Examples. Build with detected compiler from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific (Intel) compiler from PATH. >>> cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort. What Fortran compilers are approved¶; On Linux and Mac, the following work nicely. GNU: gfortran; Intel: ifort. Packages to install for specific OS or package managers:. Ubuntu gfortran; conda gfortran_linux-64 or gfortran_osx-64 to get gfortran. How to obtain a Fortran compiler for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; Xcode does not provide a Fortran compiler. A way to get one is to download; the gfortran_osx-64 conda package. This provides; gfortran compilers for Mac. The version is 4.8.5, which is quite old,; but the Fortran compiler will work.

How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. >>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works. Use it at your own risk and after testing your; particular distribution, including tests run multithreaded,; if you intend to run PSI4 so. Use at least 0.2.15, and; pay attention to how it was compiled - unthreaded seems safe,; openmp-threaded is mostly safe, default pthreaded is not safe.

Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works.

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h.

See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; >>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. If you have pytest installed, very similar coverage is obtained through:; >>> make pytest. How to run a subset of tests¶; CTest allows flexibly partitioned running of the test suite. In; the examples below, testname are regex of test names,; and testlabel are regex of labels (e.g., cc, mints,; libefp defined [here, for example]. Run tests in parallel with -j flag.

It may have a; .tmp extension, depending on whether the last test was interrupted and; a few other factors. Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation.

It; is recommended that the PSI4 build be initially configured with; -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON (easier to notice changes). And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn.

How to configure code to use high angular momentum basis sets¶; The Libint integral code handles; arbitrary order angular momentum (AM), but compiling that is; prohibitive. The build process for Libint2 takes longer than; for Libint1, so it’s recommended to use the conda packages. The AM controlling keyword MAX_AM_ERI; has definition changed a little from Libint1. It is used to ensure; that conventional energies can use at least MAX_AM_ERI zeta. See; psi4//external/upstream/libint2/CMakeLists.txt for a fuller; discussion of AM capabilities. Unless BUILD_Libint2_GENERATOR; is set to ON, an internal build of Libint2 will download a; pregenerated tarball of at least MAX_AM_ERI AM. If you; want to build completely from generator source, turn on the keyword,; but parts can only run in serial and parts benefit from parallel, so; it’s not recommended. All the AM generation settings would need to be; edited in the above CMakeLists.txt rather than passing them into; the PSI4 build directly.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

OneAPI beta compilers build but have; been only minimally tested. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; shebang line. To use a different Python with PSI4 in the long term,; edit the shebang line.; If you’re using PSI4 as a Python module, then PSI4 is running; the Python of which python. How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. >>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner. Issue make VERBOSE=1 to display the full; compilation commands and errors. How to highlight git merge conflicts in vi¶; Edit your ~/.vimrc file to include the lines below.

How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt.

Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest.

Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer.

How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation. From the executable; # smoke tests only in serial; psi4 --test; # smoke tests only in parallel; psi4 --test -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; # most tests; psi4 --test full. From the library (PSI4 must be detectable as a Python; module. See setup at How to configure paths for PsiAPI; if needed.); # smoke tests only; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test('smoke')""; # most tests; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test()"".

Output looks something like the below.

It; is recommended that the PSI4 build be initially configured with; -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON (easier to notice changes). And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn. This should; re-clone the Add-On, rebuild and install it, rebuild any parts of; PSI4 that interface to it, and relink the main core.so.; If you’re modifying the Add-On’s file or directory structure, be; smart and rm all traces of it within {objdir}/stage/,; especially any *.pyc files.; Alternatively and preferentially to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the PSI4 repository. This; is especially useful if you want to avoid full recompiles of the; Add-On at each change to the Add-On’s source. Build the Add-On; library dynamically (-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON) and mind any; “Psi4 wants” in the Add-On’s top-level CMakeLists.txt. Install the; Add-On and note the full path to AddOnConfig.cmake.

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected.

Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments).

Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to configure a Psi4 build on Cray¶; Cray systems strongly prefer to build static libraries, but PSI4; needs to be dynamic to function as a Python module. Courtesy of @misha; at the forum and various supercomputer guides, building PSI4 on; Cray requires setting environment variables before running cmake.; CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes cmake ... CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE¶; Set to allow PSI4 to build as shared library on Cray supercomputers. CRAY_ADD_RPATH¶; Set to true to allow PSI4 to build on Cray supercomputers.

PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables.

The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.9.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable.

PSI4. Installation and Runtime Configuration; Compiling and Installing from Source. Compiling and Installing from Source¶; This section fulfills the duty of every Linux project to have an INSTALL; file detailing how to build it from source. Few (mostly packagers and; sysadmins) are expected to read this file as it is a broad guide to the; many choices in building this project. For a specific, well-tested,; and performance-tuned build path, see psicode.org/installs/latest; (select “source”). For pre-built binaries again well-tested,; performance-tuned, and available for all common operating systems,; see psicode.org/installs/latest (select “conda”). Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ON",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning.html

Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4. Or in the shell; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSIDATADIR {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSIDATADIR={top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

What C and C++ compilers and versions are approved¶; On Linux, the following work nicely. GNU: gcc, g++; Intel: icc, icpc; Clang: clang, clang++. On Mac, the following work nicely. Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers on Linux also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked.; Intel OneAPI Classic compilers work fine. OneAPI beta compilers build but have; been only minimally tested. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_osx-64 clang_osx-64 llvm-openmp intel-openmp. # To Build, activate environment (prepends PATH and defines environment variables CLANG, CLANGXX, HOST, etc):; >>> conda activate clang401; >>> echo ${CLANGXX}; /path/to/miniconda/envs/clang401/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-clang++; >>> echo ${HOST}; x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0. # build with Clang; >>> cmake -S. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${CLANG} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CLANGXX} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-stdlib=libc++"" \; -DOp",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning.html

How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies. PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source. Examples. Build with detected compiler from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific (Intel) compiler from PATH. >>> cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort. What Fortran compilers are approved¶; On Linux and Mac, the following work nicely. GNU: gfortran; Intel: ifort. Packages to install for specific OS or package managers:. Ubuntu gfortran; conda gfortran_linux-64 or gfortran_osx-64 to get gfortran. How to obtain a Fortran compiler for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; Xcode does not provide a Fortran compiler. A way to get one is to download; the gfortran_osx-64 conda package. This provides; gfortran compilers for Mac. The version is 4.8.5, which is quite old,; but the Fortran compiler will work. How to configure BLAS/LAPACK for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies.

How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. >>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner.

Hitting the F7; key will toggle highlighting of git’s conflict markers.; >>> cat ~/.vimrc; set hlsearch; map <F7> :/\(<<<<<<<\\|=======\\|>>>>>>>\)<CR>.

How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler.

An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works. Use it at your own risk and after testing your; particular distribution, including tests run multithreaded,; if you intend to run PSI4 so. Use at least 0.2.15, and; pay attention to how it was compiled - unthreaded seems safe,; openmp-threaded is mostly safe, default pthreaded is not safe.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works.

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning.html:46593,Integrability,interface,interface,46593,"ussions.; Choose your NumPy and PSI4 compile conditions to use the same; BLAS distribution.; The BLAS/LAPACK detected for PSI4 are also linked into any; Add-Ons (e.g., libefp) that require them, rather than relying on; those packages’ native math detection.; The separation between BLAS and LAPACK seen in detection printing; and CMake variables is purely formal. In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake.

See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; >>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. If you have pytest installed, very similar coverage is obtained through:; >>> make pytest. How to run a subset of tests¶; CTest allows flexibly partitioned running of the test suite. In; the examples below, testname are regex of test names,; and testlabel are regex of labels (e.g., cc, mints,; libefp defined [here, for example]. Run tests in parallel with -j flag.

When ctest reports that some (or all) tests have failed, look in your; build directory for file; objdir/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log. It may have a; .tmp extension, depending on whether the last test was interrupted and; a few other factors. Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation. From the executable; # smoke tests only in serial; psi4 --test; # smoke tests only in parallel; psi4 --test -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; # most tests; psi4 --test full.

If you’re changing the PSI4 repo codebase between compiles, there’s; nothing more to do as CMake will handle the code rebuild deps for you.; If you’re changing the local Add-On repo codebase between compiles,; CMake does not know when libaddon.[a|so|dylib] needs rebuilding. It; is recommended that the PSI4 build be initially configured with; -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON (easier to notice changes). And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn. This should; re-clone the Add-On, rebuild and install it, rebuild any parts of; PSI4 that interface to it, and relink the main core.so.; If you’re modifying the Add-On’s file or directory structure, be; smart and rm all traces of it within {objdir}/stage/,; especially any *.pyc files.; Alternatively and preferentially to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the PSI4 repository.

How to configure code to use high angular momentum basis sets¶; The Libint integral code handles; arbitrary order angular momentum (AM), but compiling that is; prohibitive. The build process for Libint2 takes longer than; for Libint1, so it’s recommended to use the conda packages. The AM controlling keyword MAX_AM_ERI; has definition changed a little from Libint1. It is used to ensure; that conventional energies can use at least MAX_AM_ERI zeta. See; psi4//external/upstream/libint2/CMakeLists.txt for a fuller; discussion of AM capabilities. Unless BUILD_Libint2_GENERATOR; is set to ON, an internal build of Libint2 will download a; pregenerated tarball of at least MAX_AM_ERI AM. If you; want to build completely from generator source, turn on the keyword,; but parts can only run in serial and parts benefit from parallel, so; it’s not recommended. All the AM generation settings would need to be; edited in the above CMakeLists.txt rather than passing them into; the PSI4 build directly.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

OneAPI beta compilers build but have; been only minimally tested. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; shebang line. To use a different Python with PSI4 in the long term,; edit the shebang line.; If you’re using PSI4 as a Python module, then PSI4 is running; the Python of which python. How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. >>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner. Issue make VERBOSE=1 to display the full; compilation commands and errors. How to highlight git merge conflicts in vi¶; Edit your ~/.vimrc file to include the lines below.

How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt.

An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer.

When ctest reports that some (or all) tests have failed, look in your; build directory for file; objdir/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log. It may have a; .tmp extension, depending on whether the last test was interrupted and; a few other factors. Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation. From the executable; # smoke tests only in serial; psi4 --test; # smoke tests only in parallel; psi4 --test -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; # most tests; psi4 --test full. From the library (PSI4 must be detectable as a Python; module. See setup at How to configure paths for PsiAPI; if needed.); # smoke tests only; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test('smoke')""; # most tests; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test()"". From pytest directly. If package pytest-xdist is installed, can run in parallel.; # smoke tests only; pytest {prefix}/lib/{PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/psi4/tests/ -m smoke -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; # all tests; pytest {prefix}/lib/{PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/psi4/tests/ -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. Output looks something like the below. PASSED in green is good; (means test ran correctly); SKIPPED in yellow is good (means that; not all software required for test is available); XPASS or XFAIL; in yellow is fine (unexpected pass or expected fail happens when we; include tests that need particular conditions (e.g., multiple cores); to run correctly); FAILED in red is bad.; test_addons.py::test_gdma PASSED; test_addons.py::test_mrcc SKIPPED; test_addons.py::test_chemps2 PASSED; test_addon",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning.html

It; is recommended that the PSI4 build be initially configured with; -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON (easier to notice changes). And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn. This should; re-clone the Add-On, rebuild and install it, rebuild any parts of; PSI4 that interface to it, and relink the main core.so.; If you’re modifying the Add-On’s file or directory structure, be; smart and rm all traces of it within {objdir}/stage/,; especially any *.pyc files.; Alternatively and preferentially to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the PSI4 repository. This; is especially useful if you want to avoid full recompiles of the; Add-On at each change to the Add-On’s source. Build the Add-On; library dynamically (-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON) and mind any; “Psi4 wants” in the Add-On’s top-level CMakeLists.txt. Install the; Add-On and note the full path to AddOnConfig.cmake. Pass; the path containing that file to PSI4‘s CMake as; -DAddon_DIR=/path/to/config/usually/ending/in/share/cmake/AddON; and build PSI4. The main core.so should be dynamically linked; to your dev AddOn dynamic lib and update automatically when you rebuild; the AddOn lib. Naturally, you may need to delete core.so and remake; as needed. table of contents.

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code.

This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code.

This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

Courtesy of @misha; at the forum and various supercomputer guides, building PSI4 on; Cray requires setting environment variables before running cmake.; CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes cmake ... CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE¶; Set to allow PSI4 to build as shared library on Cray supercomputers. CRAY_ADD_RPATH¶; Set to true to allow PSI4 to build on Cray supercomputers. How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies. PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source. Examples. Build with detected compiler from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific (Intel) compiler from PATH. >>> cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort.

The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.9. Build with full Python specification to root directory ${PFXC}. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=""${PFXC}/bin/python"" \; -DPython_LIBRARY=""${PFXC}/lib/libpython3.9.so"" \; -DPython_INCLUDE_DIR=""${PFXC}/include/python3.9"". What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; she",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/build_planning.html

Basic Keywords¶; A complete list of keywords related to coupled-cluster computations is; provided in the appendices, with the majority of the relevant; keywords appearing in Appendix CCENERGY. For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems.

Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd codes. A value of LOW selects a “low priority” scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities. A value of LRU selects a “least recently used” scheme in which the oldest item in the cache will be the first one deleted. Type: string; Possible Values: LOW, LRU; Default: LOW. NUM_AMPS_PRINT¶. Number of important \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes to print. Type: integer; Default: 10. MP2_AMPS_PRINT¶. Do print the MP2 amplitudes which are the starting guesses for RHF and UHF reference functions?. Type: boolean; Default: false. Larger Calculations¶; Here are a few recommendations for carrying out large-basis-set coupled; cluster calculations with PSI4:. In most cases it is reasonable to set the memory keyword to 90% of; the available physical memory, at most. There is a small amount of overhead; associated with the; coupled cluster modules that is not accounted for by the internal CC memory; handling routines. Thus, the user should not specify the entire; physical memory of the system, or swapping is likely. However, for especially large; calculations, it is better to set the memory keyword to a value less than 16 GB.; Set the CACHELEVEL keyword to 0.; This will turn off cacheing, which, for very large calculations, can; lead to heap fragmentation and memory faults, even when sufficient; physical memory exists.; Set the PRINT keyword to 2. This; will help narrow where memory bottlenecks or other errors exist in the; event of a crash. Excited State Coupled Cluster Calculations¶; A complete list of keywords related to; coupled cluster linear response is provided in Appendix CCEOM.; The most important keywords associated with EOM-CC calculations are:. ROOTS_PER_IRREP¶. Number of excited states per irreducible representation for EOM-CC and CC-LR calculations.

Type: string; Possible Values: POLARIZABILITY, ROTATION, ROA, ROA_TENSOR, ALL; Default: POLARIZABILITY. OMEGA¶. Array that specifies the desired frequencies of the incident radiation field in CCLR calculations. If only one element is given, the units will be assumed to be atomic units. If more than one element is given, then the units must be specified as the final element of the array. Acceptable units are HZ, NM, EV, and AU. Type: array; Default: No Default. GAUGE¶. Specifies the choice of representation of the electric dipole operator. For polarizability, this keyword is ignored and LENGTH gauge is computed. For optical rotation and raman optical activity, this keyword is active, and acceptable values are LENGTH for the usual length-gauge representation, VELOCITY``(default) for the modified velocity-gauge representation in which the static-limit optical rotation tensor is subtracted from the frequency- dependent tensor, or ``BOTH. Note that, for optical rotation and raman optical activity calculations, only the choices of VELOCITY or BOTH will yield origin-independent results.

The above example also shows the total memory for the computation being; set in PSI4 format. See Memory Specification for details. When; specified, the memory value is passed on to Cfour by setting keywords; CFOUR_MEMORY_SIZE and CFOUR_MEM_UNIT=MB.; PSI4 has an extensive basis set library in; Gaussian94 format. See Basis Sets for details. Contrasts to; Cfour basis handling include identifying basis sets by standard name; (aug-cc-pVDZ instead of AUG-PVDZ), direct handles for; diffuse-function-pruned sets (e.g., jun-cc-pVDZ), case insensitivity,; appropriate setting of spherical/Cartesian depending on basis set design,; and syntax to set different basis sets to different classes of atoms; without listing each atom. All of these features are available to Cfour by; using the BASIS keyword instead of CFOUR_BASIS; (accompanied, of course, by specifying the molecule PSI4-style).; Internally, PSI4 processes the basis set as usual, then translates; the basis set format and writes out a GENBAS file with an entry for; each atom. The P4C4 interface sets keyword CFOUR_BASIS=SPECIAL; and CFOUR_SPHERICAL as appropriate, then writes the basis section; necessary for SPECIAL below the *CFOUR(...) block. (I’m sorry that the; name of the basis doesn’t appear in ZMAT, but the combination of the; ~14 character basis name limit and the absence of a comment line marker; rather precludes that helpful label.); The input below employs a PSI4 library basis set and also introduces; the final stage of conversion toward PSI4 format. Instead of the; generic 'cfour', the computational method is specified as the first; argument to the optimize() call.

Specification Details¶; The above narrative introduction to the P4C4 interface should be; sufficient to get started. Issues of competition between PSI4 and; Cfour specification format are generally resolved behind the scenes:; not according to a simple rule but according to sensible, sometimes; intricate, rules governed by user intent (and integration of Cfour to; behave like a PSI4 module). Much can be gleaned by just running; inputs and inspecting the ZMAT passed to Cfour, but when questions; arise, here are the specifics, the governing laws. Specifying a piece of input in PSI4 format is entering into; a contract that you mean it. In particular this applies to; molecule (including charge/multiplicity through molecule; optional_molecule_name {...}), memory (through memory; value unit), computational method (through .

Specifying anything in PSI4 format (molecule, basis, options,; method call) starts building a *CFOUR(...) directive for the; ZMAT file. Since the contents of the cfour {...} block are; blindly appended to any input interpreted from PSI4 format, mixing; of PSI4 and Cfour input formats likely will give rise to multiple; *CFOUR(...) directives in the prospective ZMAT, execution of; which will be trapped and halted. Proper uses for the cfour {...}; block are for the sandwich mode, where the entire ZMAT is enclosed,; or for extra directives like %excite*, which presently have no other; specification route.; Specifying the basis is perhaps the regulated piece of input. Since; basis set names differ between PSI4 and Cfour and it’s not; practical to compare exponent-to-exponent, any input file with both; BASIS and CFOUR_BASIS keywords present will halt. Once; a basis set has been requested through BASIS, overriding the; default spherical/Cartesian setting must be done through; PUREAM (as opposed to CFOUR_SPHERICAL).; Specifying keywords that control geometry optimization is; straightforward. Unless the optimization is invoked in sandwich mode,; all Cfour optimization keywords (e.g., CFOUR_GEO_MAXCYC) are; ineffective, as the Cfour optimizer is never invoked. PSI4; optimization keywords (e.g., GEOM_MAXITER) instead fill; these roles.; Specifying the computational method (through, for instance,; energy('c4-ccsd') instead of energy('cfour')) often; sets additional keywords consistent with best practices (e.g.,; C",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/cfour-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/cfour-1.html

Specifying certain keywords that are nominally applicable for pure-PSI4 modules directs them to fulfil analogous roles; in the Cfour program (e.g., MAXITER is used to set; CFOUR_SCF_MAXCYC). This keyword translation only takes place; if the keywords are explicitly set in the input file (part of that; contract that you mean it), meaning that PSI4‘s defaults don’t; get imposed on Cfour. Also, in the case where a translatable pure-PSI4 keyword and its translation Cfour keyword are both set,; the value attached to the latter is always used.

Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH.

Set memory as usual; Set molecule as usual; Set basis set as usual (Cfour only cares about orbital basis, no fitting; bases); Set the task as usual, indicating Cfour as the intended code by; prepending “c4-” to the method argument.

There are many; sample inputs in psi4/tests/cfour/ starting with sp- that take; examples from the Cfour manual and first run them in sandwich mode and; then run them as translated into PSI4 format. Note; PSI4 only recognizes keywords by their full name, so the common; Cfour keyword abbreviations CALC, REF, etc. must be replaced by their; proper names of CFOUR_CALC_LEVEL, CFOUR_REFERENCE, etc. Whenever the molecule is supplied in PSI4 format, it is possible to; perform geometry optimizations where Cfour supplies the gradient and the; PSI4 module optking drives the structural; changes. Because of the limitations on geometry specification for; optimizations in Cfour, optking-driven optimizations are the only; optimizations allowed in the P4C4 interface.

Warning; Because p4c4 does not inspect the contents of the cfour {...}; block, once the user specifies a PSI4-style molecule, the; interface cannot judge whether a sandwich mode (drop the PSI4 molecule; and use the cfour block as the entirety of the ZMAT) or a standard mode; (translate the PSI4 molecule and append additional input from the; cfour block) is intended. The latter is what actually occurs.

Therefore, if mixing sandwich and; standard or pure-PSI4 computations in an input file, place all; the sandwich jobs at the beginning before declaring PSI4; molecules. If necessary, clear the cfour block with cfour {} before; commencing standard P4C4 jobs.

See Molecule and Geometry Specification for details and; cfour/mints5 for examples. When a PSI4-style molecule is; supplied, its geometry is written to ZMAT in Cartesian form and the; CFOUR_COORDINATES=CARTESIAN, CFOUR_UNITS=ANGSTROM,; CFOUR_CHARGE, and CFOUR_MULTIPLICITY keywords are set; appropriately in the *CFOUR(...) directive. Warning; There exist molecules (e.g., allene) where the; inertial frame is not unique (planes along atoms or between; atoms). The orientation reconciling machinery currently does not; handle these cases and will fail with “Axis unreconcilable between; QC programs”. I will get to this soon. Whenever the molecule is supplied in PSI4 format, the job control; keywords must be too. All Cfour keywords are the usual; ones, prepended by cfour_ to avoid any possible name conflicts. As; detailed in Job Control Keywords, setting keywords is flexible in; format.

The above example also shows the total memory for the computation being; set in PSI4 format. See Memory Specification for details. When; specified, the memory value is passed on to Cfour by setting keywords; CFOUR_MEMORY_SIZE and CFOUR_MEM_UNIT=MB.; PSI4 has an extensive basis set library in; Gaussian94 format. See Basis Sets for details. Contrasts to; Cfour basis handling include identifying basis sets by standard name; (aug-cc-pVDZ instead of AUG-PVDZ), direct handles for; diffuse-function-pruned sets (e.g., jun-cc-pVDZ), case insensitivity,; appropriate setting of spherical/Cartesian depending on basis set design,; and syntax to set different basis sets to different classes of atoms; without listing each atom. All of these features are available to Cfour by; using the BASIS keyword instead of CFOUR_BASIS; (accompanied, of course, by specifying the molecule PSI4-style).; Internally, PSI4 processes the basis set as usual, then translates; the basis set format and writes out a GENBAS file with an entry for; each atom. The P4C4 interface sets keyword CFOUR_BASIS=SPECIAL; and CFOUR_SPHERICAL as appropriate, then writes the basis section; necessary for SPECIAL below the *CFOUR(...) block. (I’m sorry that the; name of the basis doesn’t appear in ZMAT, but the combination of the; ~14 character basis name limit and the absence of a comment line marker; rather precludes that helpful label.); The input below employs a PSI4 library basis set and also introduces; the final stage of conversion toward PSI4 format. Instead of the; generic 'cfour', the computational method is specified as the first; argument to the optimize() call. In the computational; command below, the string argument 'c4-ccsd(t)' directs that a CCSD(T); computation be run using Cfour (as opposed to 'ccsd(t)' which w",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/cfour.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/cfour.html
