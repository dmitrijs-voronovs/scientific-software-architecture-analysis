I tried a mix of gradle sub-project-ing and shading with John and they all didn't work out for various different reasons. Azure library was doing some weird classLoader stuff that didn't like being bulk-relocated, and force-upgrading jackson didn't work because pyspark bundles in the buggy version of jackson without shading it. We can try to work out the former but I decided to pause on that front and try instead to just not use the buggy Azure method from the compatible library version and hit the REST endpoint directly, which involves some XML parsing. Currently in the middle of that. Happy to discuss the various approaches at our 1:1 tomorrow or earlier. In terms of hail-side implementation, it's all here under the assumption that the underlying library doesn't cause classpath conflicts (which it currently does).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11617#issuecomment-1095033418

Going to want to find the max value in the column in bytes, figure out what scale we are at (bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, etc.) then set custom tick range and tickvals accordingly.

List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache).

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11996#issuecomment-1178118437:219,Deployability,update,update,219,"Just for reference, I had to make the following changes:; 1. There's a new table that tracks attempts that have been already aggregated. The reason I can't put this variable into the attempts table is due to a circular update that's not allowed.; 2. I added a dummy variable to the attempts table that is just a way to get the update trigger to run. We find all complete attempts from the batches state and update the dummy variable for the attempts table in chunks. Within the new trigger, if the attempt has not been aggregated yet, then we use `NEW.end - NEW.start` as the time to aggregate with. If the attempt has been aggregated, then we use the original way which is just to take the difference between New and Old. At the end, we find all attempts that have not been aggregated (not in the new table that keeps track of whether an attempt has been aggregated) and update the dummy variable to run the trigger.

Here's a diagram of the current and proposed scenarios that I hope helps:. ### Normal services (current `main`); 1. gateway receives a request destined for `batch.hail.is`; 2. gateway intends to forward this request to `batch.default:443`; 3. gateway makes a DNS request to resolve `batch.default`. gateway receives IP `A.A.A.A` which is the cluster IP of the batch Kubernetes Service; 4. gateway forwards the request to `A.A.A.A:443`; 5. The Kubernetes Service (really kube-proxy) receives the request, selects a pod with IP `X.X.X.X` and forwards the request to `X.X.X.X:5000`. ### Proposed headless service approach; 1. gateway receives a request destined for `batch.hail.is`; 2. gateway intends to forward this request to `batch.default:443`; 3. gateway makes a DNS request to resolve `batch.default`. gateway receives multiple DNS records back saying that `batch.default` corresponds to the IP addresses `X.X.X.X`, `Y.Y.Y.Y`, and `Z.Z.Z.Z` (assuming there are 3 pods in the deployment).; 4. gateway gets its pick out of the pods (this is really important and is why envoy needs all the IPs to properly load balance!) and decides to forward the request directly to pod `X.X.X.X:443`. So in the second scenario, it is necessary that the pod itself be listening on 443 because that is where gateway is going to send the request. It is not exactly a permissions issue, but upon writing this I am now realizing that by doing so we *require* that the service pods like `auth` and `batch` be running as root in order to bind on port 443. I think the port specified in the `Service` yaml is actually useless now. So two actionable options are:. 1. Remove the useless `port` field on the `Service` yaml for auth, batch, etc.; 2. Keep all of our services on unprivileged ports (5000) and have gateway forward traffic to `batch.default:5000` instead of `batch.default:443`.

It is not exactly a permissions issue, but upon writing this I am now realizing that by doing so we *require* that the service pods like `auth` and `batch` be running as root in order to bind on port 443. I think the port specified in the `Service` yaml is actually useless now. So two actionable options are:. 1. Remove the useless `port` field on the `Service` yaml for auth, batch, etc.; 2. Keep all of our services on unprivileged ports (5000) and have gateway forward traffic to `batch.default:5000` instead of `batch.default:443`. Keeping our services on port 5000 could allow us to run those services as non-root users. I guess k8s has them running as root by default…",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12094#issuecomment-1283052287
