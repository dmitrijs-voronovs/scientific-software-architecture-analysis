In GATK 4 we only emit calls that are within the unpadded read shards, which I believe do not extend past the input intervals. Thus, as long as `SplitIntervals` returns disjoint subintervals (which it does), different scatters of M2 should produce disjoint calls.

I'm sorry to hear that you had to put things on hold. A lot of the spark tools are not refined to the point they need to be for productive use. We hope to fix a lot of the spark issues towards the end of the summer or beginning of fall, so maybe we can revisit this then. . I'm curious what changes you ended up making to gatk. We've had to do quite a lot of work to get gcs NIO support working well so it's not surprising that there would be similar changes needed for s3. . We'd definitely be interested in hearing about your work on this though, maybe we could schedule a chat at some point once we're nearing the end of beta.

If the final solution is that this is not going to be maintained in GATK4, I would port this code to my own software if you give me the permission; but it is definitely something that the community is interested. For example, I'm working with Pool-Seq data with hundreds of individuals together, so `HaplotypeCaller` is not a possibility in our case. I'm actually evaluating other approaches for realignment, such as [ABRA](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu376) or [SRMA](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r99). I'm even thinking on implementing a new realigner based on the GATK's assembler engine and its PairHMM; but this requires more time for evaluation, and it will be nice to be able to compare with the current indel realignment pipeline.

That's the reason of making the port in split PRs. One option can be to have the PRs open, and reviewed independently without acceptance until every component is ready. Otherwise, I think that an experimental tag would be good until we find a good set of tests for edge cases. Does this approach make sense for you, @cmnbroad?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-366187605

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3112#issuecomment-371515115:2174,Usability,simpl,simple,2174,"ot sure if that was already covered. @sooheelee - this is going to be an exact port of the indel-realignment pipeline, as it is in the GATK3 code, so that means that I won't modify the interval list format or anything (although I will use the HTSJDK/Picard classes as used on GATK3). Because this will be an experimental/beta feature, I think that I can have a look to the new format after acceptance of the original port. @cmnbroad - I understand that a fully functional tool is a requirement for acceptance, but what I mean is that some specific features might require more work than others. I am only concerned about the `NWaySAMFileWriter`, which is just an specific way of output the data but does not add anything to the real realignment process (actually, I think that I've never heard about anyone around me using it). That is a nice feature, but I don't think that it is a high-priority - I care more about having the algorithm implemented to test if the actual processing of the data works, and add support for some way of output the data in a different PR. In addition, if the people still using indel-realignment does not require the n-way output, then it is pointless to spend time on it.

I have almost prepare a PR for the new port of `RealignerTargetCreator` that will have TODOs for the test data prepared by you, and with some tests using files already in the repository (for the target-creator, I guess that the validation for getting the regions to realign would be enough, because thanks to that tests I realized of a small bug due to not including all the loci in the `LocusWalker`). On the other hand, I will still fight for the `--nWayOut` not blocking the inclusion of `IndelRealigner` in the first place. My reasons are the following:; ; 1.

We are building a custom snapshot of `google-cloud-java` with `maxChannelReopens` hardcoded to the value we want, which should resolve https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2685 for now, but it would be great to have a permanent solution in master. Requiring GATK to construct Path objects a certain way and pass them down into libraries like htsjdk is just too brittle, as those libraries often need to create Path objects on-the-fly and we lose our settings.

If you don't do this, you will get truly horrific and cryptic messages when the native code crashes with out-of-memory. This is really something that needs to be documented prominently!.

Perhaps a good starting point is bringing back Valentin's GATKReadPair which was removed as a part of XHMM-related code cleanup. Eventually, it is also useful to have the option of collecting various summary statistics and empirical distribution for features such as insert length, mapping quality, the position with respect to bins. Other things to consider are summary of orphan reads, reads with mates on other contigs, and reads with multiple alternate alignments. This requires a bit of good software engineering but it's a necessary one-time investment. This is a relatively high-priority refactoring given the growing interest in running gCNV on large datasets (gnomAD, gen psy cohort, TCGA).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3153#issuecomment-310507118

I had some inkling that perhaps results may be different (see my question below) and I wanted to square off my matrix of results. So I ran this just now. That I created a PoN for the bad cohort first on Friday is solely due to it finishing its counting well before the bifem cohort. One question I had on Friday was how the zero counts were counted. If the various samples have zero counts for different targets, or per target only some samples had zero counts and samples varied for each target, then does the QC look across the 2-D array for zero count patterns or just per 1-D dataset?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3163#issuecomment-310877132

The basic idea of `getAdaptorBoundary` is to find the end of the insert, that is, where the original fragment ends and the adaptor begins.

Therefore, I set `-maxReadsPerAlignmentStart` to be equal and much lower than the default in both branches. I have tried a few values, but none lower than 10. I expect that using master downsampling to 3 reads per alignment start will handle most of the runtime issue at some small cost to sensitivity and precision, but let me run it and see what happens.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3238#issuecomment-341939411

This will help narrow down whether the problem lies in the asynchronous writer, the asynchronous NIO prefetcher, or the Intel deflater/inflater itself (or none of the above!)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3316#issuecomment-317032724

Be sure to take a look at the HDF5RandomizedSVDReadCountPanelOfNormals.IntervalHelper class in my sl_create_pon branch.

I wasn't thinking, we keep hitting this issue in different places and I was assuming you had seen it before. The issue is that there was no spec for contig names, and when they made hg38 they allowed contig names like `HLA:1-3:52-*:6+` which are terrible because they are ambiguous with the format for specifying intervals. Everyone in the world who wrote software that parses contig names and intervals was using the implicit assumption that `:` and `-` didn't appear in the contig names and write intervals as `contig:start-stop`. So we had to modify all the code that parses intervals to first try to understand it as a complete contig name and if that matches a contig in the sequence dictionary stop parsing it. .

TileDB manages arrays hierarchically. A workspace can contain arrays or groups of arrays. Groups can have different arrays with same name. When you read from an existing array or update it with a given workspace path, you need to figure out which array in the the group you are referring to, hence the full path. More information [here](http://istc-bigdata.org/tiledb/tutorials/index.html#workspaces_groups). The real issue here is to figure out a way to package TileDB arrays to ship it to some other location. The problem is the data and fragments inside the array directory is self-contained. If we replace the full path in the schema it will break other conventions for groups and workspaces.

How to convince people:; I agree. I think it is most effective to make people ""feel"" the difference, i.e. output like ""you have been waiting 1324s or 60% of additional processing time on this step due to compression"".; Or ""Processing still hasn't started due to compression/decompression."". GATK4, especially on Spark hides that pretty well.; For example, turning off Spark lz4 and relying on ZFS lz4 for the writing of temporary data was instructive about how much CPU was used for it (not that much). 2. Compression differences:; I might help to look at the used dictionary size for the differences and also the possible method of compression parallelization. Multi-core compression mostly cuts files into pieces and can greatly decrease compression if the data is highly repetitive. Because another core starts anew on data that the previous one might have reduced to almost nothing (zstd allows some sharing of the dictionary between cores, but most do not I think). Example about the dictionary difference: For long distance repetitive files, compression with; xz --lzma2=preset=1,dict=1500M can bringe a huge gain in compression, but still be much faster than level 9 (which has normally only a dictionary of 64MB). Compression levels are correlated with dict size for most compressors to ensure monotonically increasing memory usage, but that doesn't have to be so.; zstd, for example, allows many parameters to change this. Even more than xz. I suspect due to my experiments that quality values gain more from increased dictionary size, because they are more repetitive than the DNA data. And shorter BAMs would be different because they are less repetitive (usually less coverage), so their compression relies more on CPU-expensive crunching of the ""2bit nature"" of the DNA.; So they might logically suffer more from a lower compression level.; It might be instructive ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3413#issuecomment-360179673

Stating the obvious, level 1 compressed files are expected to be larger file than level 5 compressed files. However, GKL level 1 and 2 trade compression ratio for compression speed, so we ran some experiments on data from #4249 to investigate. The chart below shows compression speed vs. compression ratio for 11 files compressed using GKL (use-jdk-deflater = False) and JDK (use-jdk-deflater = True) for compression levels 1 through 9. The chart shows BAM files with binned quality scores can be compressed more given more CPU effort (i.e. higher compression level). The effect is the same for GKL compression and JDK compression, but the compression ratio difference is higher for GKL due to the ratio vs. speed trade off. ![compression study](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10476709/38428795-a5f11e4c-398a-11e8-8cfb-800b0423a95a.png).

For this solution, we do not need to add or remove any dependencies. The only change is to the `log4j.properties` file (which configures log4j 1.x) to match the config specified in `log4j2.xml` (which configures log4j2). Now, GKL will use log4j 1.x to log, but the format will match the rest of GATK, which uses log4j2.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3437#issuecomment-322485170:909,Energy Efficiency,reduce,reducers,909,"I can confirm this too. When I reverted https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/4c697e06ea33c9179840c81c843658442c82a951 the problem disappeared, so that seems to be the culprit. This is definitely a GCS issue, as I don't see the problem when running with HDFS inputs. More details: for ReadsPipelineSpark, the first job has the following stages when running OK:; * Stage ID 0, mapToPair at MarkDuplicatesSparkUtils.java:56, 147 partitions; * Stage ID 1, flatMapToPair at MarkDuplicatesSparkUtils.java:60, 1880 partitions. And the following when there's only a single partition:; * Stage ID 0, mapToPair at MarkDuplicatesSparkUtils.java:56, 294 partitions; * Stage ID 1, flatMapToPair at MarkDuplicatesSparkUtils.java:60, **_1 partition_**.

There are a few different parameters that can help you adjust the memory ratios.; A good tuning might be something like; ; ```; --num-executors 5 ; --executor-cores 8 ; --executor-memory 32g ; ```. if you're not running with gatk-launch you'll need to set; ```; --conf spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead=600; ```; Without setting a higher than default yarn memory overhead like this we see consistent crashes, it's included in the settings gatk-launch applies already. That should run 5 separate executors with 8 cores each and give each one 32g, so 4g / core. . If you're running in cluster mode you'll have to carve out some memory and cores for the driver. You can set the driver settings with ; ```; --driver-cores 2; --driver-memory 4g; ``` ; or something along those lines. The driver doesn't need much memory or computer for BQSR. In general we've had better luck using the entire cluster for one job and running jobs in sequence rather than trying to run two jobs simultaneously using a subset of the cluster.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3465#issuecomment-324064738

In that case disregard my previous advice. Running a single process spark isn't going to scale well to 40 cores whatever you do, you'd be better off installing spark locally on your machine and running it as a single node cluster than running in the local mode. . If you want to run with master local, the biggest thing is probably to set -Xmx high enough, I'd set it as all of your memory - some overhead for the OS.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3469#issuecomment-324204507:725,Availability,error,errors,725,"Re: strandedness, while it would be much easier not to have to track strand (and would probably save me from writing a lot of bugs), I think that we do need to do so if we ever want these data elements to be used for calling more complicated events like inversions or translocations. For example, for inversions we need to record whether we saw evidence linking +/+ strands or -/- strands, since the breakpoints might appear different at the two junctions due to insertions or deletions. For translocations, you definitely need to know which strands were involved so that you can extrapolate the rest of the event from the breakpoint. Agreed that it's a pain to keep track of it, though, and I find myself introducing strand errors all the time.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3469#issuecomment-324204507

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3487#issuecomment-324402304:593,Availability,avail,available,593,"@lbergelson I was just adding a third point to the list. I didn't realize these were different tools so thanks for the clarification. . I think since Picard LiftoverVcf doesn't leftalign/trim, and GATK4-Mutect2 requires exactly identical allele representations in the resource to use the allele frequency in its calculations, and we are trying to nudge people to switch to GRCh38 over b37, we should provide a means for folks to correctly format their REF/ALT alleles after liftover or after calling using a non-GATK caller (to enable using Mutect2). I just think this functionality should be available somewhere--either in Picard or GATK. Since GATK already has such a tool, my vote would be to port to GATK4.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3487#issuecomment-324402304

If we could only initialize GCS support when we are sure that we actually are accessing files from google that could be a useful, but it doesn't seem like there's any single point we can plug into to detect that, it would have to be spread over everything that uses paths.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-427432141

What I see there is that the code sets the default NIO option, and as part of this is creates a google cloud `StorageOptions` object. Sadly for us, when this object is created it determines which Google credentials to use, and if nothing was specified by the user it will send some network messages to try to figure out whether it's running on a Google Compute Engine machine. When we wrote the default-setting code we didn't realize that setting the number of retries was going to cause a network message to be sent, with the associated potential retries and delays. We can't change the way Google Compute Engine works, or how the Google authentication works either. Ideally we'd want some way to only search for credentials when we know NIO is going to be used. The point of these defaults is that they're used for anything that uses NIO, including third-party library code. We can't fully replicate this behavior in a different way from the outside. So I think the ""correct"" fix would be to go deep inside the Google NIO library and change it so that instead of providing a default configuration (that the user would have to put together, causing the problem you've seen), we can provide a *callback* that sets the configuration when the Google Cloud NIO provider is loaded. This is harder for future developers to wrap their heads around, but at least it would prevent this delay if NIO is not used. I'd like to think about this some more before doing something quite this drastic, though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504

When we wrote the default-setting code we didn't realize that setting the number of retries was going to cause a network message to be sent, with the associated potential retries and delays. We can't change the way Google Compute Engine works, or how the Google authentication works either. Ideally we'd want some way to only search for credentials when we know NIO is going to be used. The point of these defaults is that they're used for anything that uses NIO, including third-party library code. We can't fully replicate this behavior in a different way from the outside. So I think the ""correct"" fix would be to go deep inside the Google NIO library and change it so that instead of providing a default configuration (that the user would have to put together, causing the problem you've seen), we can provide a *callback* that sets the configuration when the Google Cloud NIO provider is loaded.

Depending on the algorithm it could be 10s or 100s of kb. I'm worried that that could create a too-large assembly. One possible solution is that we might want to only create evidence intervals around the proposed breakpoints of the interval, based on adding some amount of slop around each breakpoint (since these inputs are from read-depth based CNV callers that won't be able to identify the breakpoint with single-nucleotide precision). It might take some analysis of the input parameters to figure out the right parameters for this type of approach, which we could do in a subsequent task if you want.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3564#issuecomment-328853019:335,Availability,down,downstream,335,"Thanks much for the help with this. That's a good question as representing multiple low frequency somatic variants at the same position doesn't have a great fit with VCF. You're right, these are essentially a pool so could have an arbitrarily large number of calls, but reflecting that as ploidy ends up being a little problematic for downstream processing. If I got to pick, I'd suggest normalizing these so each variant has it's own line. This also has the advantage of applying filters to individual variants instead of needing to treat all possibilities together. Running `bcftools norm -m '-any` gets it almost right, except for retaining the triploid calls:; ```; #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT control_downsample tumor_downsample; 1 725556 .
