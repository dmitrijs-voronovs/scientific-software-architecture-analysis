One potential syntax for this suggested by @glwagner is passing a tuple to the model constructor: ; ```; forcing = (; u = (u_relaxation, u_sponge)),; ```. This seems like a straightforward syntax from a user perspective since it's similar to other model constructor syntax, e.g., specifying tracers. Since a `Relaxation` can be called from within a `Forcing` function, it might be easier to simple provide an example of that syntax to create a combined `Forcing`. The calling order of the forcings is explicit in that case since the user is writing the function and it doesn't require any additional development (well, other than an example).",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2136

One idea that came up is to combine `IsotropicDiffusivity` and `HorizontallyCurvilinearAnisotropicDiffusivity` into a single `ScalarDiffusivity` (where isotropy in various directions is _implied_). We'll also simplify the ""anisotropic"" diffusivity in this process.

The advantage is that we eliminate / share much more code. Arguably the API is a bit cleaner as well. (We can discuss aliases and defaults like `HorizontalScalarDiffusivity`, etc.). Under the hood we'll add the `Directionality` type to the type parameters of `ScalarDiffusivity`:. ```julia; struct ScalarDiffusivity{TimeDisc, Nu, Kappa, Directionality} <: AbstractScalarDiffusivity{TimeDisc, Dir}; ﾎｽ :: Nu; ﾎｺ :: Kappa. function IsotropicDiffusivity{TimeDisc}(dir::Dir, ﾎｽ::Nu, ﾎｺ::Ka) where {TimeDisc, Dir, Nu, Ka}; return new{TimeDisc, Nu, Ka, Dir}(ﾎｽ, ﾎｺ); end; end; ```.

I'm wondering if it makes more sense to calculate this inside `update_state!`. Our algorithm calculates `update_state!` at the _end_ of a time-step, which means that after calling `time_step!(model)` the model auxiliary and prognostic state are all concurrent, which is useful for output. cc @sandreza @simone-silvestri",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2244
https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2246:697,Energy Efficiency,reduce,reduced,697,"This PR adds a new property `indices` to `Field`. By default `indices = (:, :, :)`. Using `UnitRange` for a dimension's indices will ""window"" a field in that direction. This permits diagnostics to be ""windowed"" for selected indices; for example a surface field might be computed with `indices = (:, :, grid.Nz:grid.Nz)`. Another important feature is the extension of `FieldTimeSeries` to ""sliced"" fields. This means we can save just the surface velocity fields (rather than the 3D velocity fields), and in post-processing compute the surface vorticity. This PR is still very much WIP, but hopefully will be fully featured by the time it's merged, and we'll convert free surface displacements from reduced fields to windowed fields.

I think it's a great idea and I love how it simplifies things, but the use of the word ""isotropy"" kinda threw me off a bit. To me setting a scalar diffusivity as `ScalarDiffusivity(..., isotropy=Horizontal())`, implies that the diffusivity is the same in the horizontal directions, but that you can also set a different diffusivity in the vertical direction. Which you can't in this instance of the constructor; you have to create a new one. There's an extra issue I think if you set `ScalarDiffusivity(..., isotropy=Vertical())`. Since by definition isotropy is [uniformity in all orientations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy#:~:text=Isotropy%20is%20uniformity%20in%20all,the%20prefix%20an%2C%20hence%20anisotropy.), I don't think it's accurate to say something is isotropic over one single direction.

In my view it would make more sense to use `xor` there instead of `or`.

Instead of defining structs specifically to symbolize directions (`Vertical`, `ThreeDimensional`, `Horizontal`) to use with `ScalarDiffusivity`, is it possible/worth it to use arrays, similar to what `Average()` does?. In this way, instead of specifying a `ConstantDiffusivity` as . ```julia; horizontal_closure = ScalarDiffusivity(ﾎｽ=1e-3, ﾎｺ=2e-3, isotropy=Horizontal()); ```. a user would write. ```julia; horizontal_closure = ScalarDiffusivity(ﾎｽ=1e-3, ﾎｺ=2e-3, isotropy=(1,2)); ```. Seems to me like this would be more general and it would also decrease the amount of code used, but I'm not very familiar with that part of the code (especially since the recent refactor) so can't be sure.

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2266:931,Integrability,depend,depending,931,"This PR is an attempt at unifying the directions used by `TurbulenceClosures` a bit, in addition to a few minor things. In summary, this PR. - Nukes the `Vertical` definition at `abstract_scalar_diffusivity_closure.jl` and uses the already-defined `ZDirection` instead. I think this decreases the amount of code but is also more accurate (since for rotated domains the `z` direction of the code isn't necessarily the ""physical"" vertical direction); - Renames `ThreeDimensional`, `Horizontal` to `XYZDirections` and `XYDirections` and moves their definition to `Grids`. This was done for consistency with `ZDirection` and also follows the same argument about rotated domains.; - Exports `XYZDirections`, `XYDirections` and `ZDirection` at the top level; - Makes minor improvements to documentation. I could also change the notation from `isotropy` to `dimensions`, according to https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2261, depending on how people feel. I haven't done that yet because there doesn't appear to be a consensus on what to do there as of writing this.

This model assumes that the surface wave spectrum is self-similar according to the Phillips spectrum to produce a Stokes drift profile. We're about to do some epic modeling so hold onto your hats --- no, really. In the version of ""theory wave"" that does _not_ account for directional spreading, the Stokes drift profile takes the form. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/155204195-dff6233d-a9b1-411b-a544-a9e106e2fad2.png). Note that we require the _vertical average of the Stokes shear_ for our finite volume model. This can be computed as the difference between the Stokes velocity at the top and bottom of a cell (let's take all the simple wins we can here). This model has two parameters: the wave number at the spectral peak, `k_p`, and the surface Stokes drift `u^S_Phil(0)`. Li et al propose. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/155204117-b111eccb-f94c-4273-9262-7b3e194d6b84.png). and. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/155204435-fe2b2215-ed24-40bf-ac38-cb2902e0e5d3.png). where V^S is the Stokes transport.

A few preliminary calibration results suggest that these changes are very promising, especially at coarse resolutions. A short summary is that, originally, CATKE was flexible enough to model both convection and shear-driven mixing --- just not at the same time (because TKE levels are much higher for shear-driven mixing). Adding a more explicit model for the modulation of the mixing length in the presence of shear allows CATKE to capture both convection and shear-driven regimes. We can update the default values for CATKE in this PR as well. This figure is a little out of context, but it shows agreement between LES (gray line) and the ""best parameters"" from a calibration run (blue line) at 8m resolution with five physical scenarios (from LESbrary's 4 day suite).

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2273:291,Modifiability,flexible,flexible,291,"This PR updates CATKE with an improved model for how the presence of shear modulates the mixing length and turbulent mixing. A few preliminary calibration results suggest that these changes are very promising, especially at coarse resolutions. A short summary is that, originally, CATKE was flexible enough to model both convection and shear-driven mixing --- just not at the same time (because TKE levels are much higher for shear-driven mixing). Adding a more explicit model for the modulation of the mixing length in the presence of shear allows CATKE to capture both convection and shear-driven regimes. We can update the default values for CATKE in this PR as well. This figure is a little out of context, but it shows agreement between LES (gray line) and the ""best parameters"" from a calibration run (blue line) at 8m resolution with five physical scenarios (from LESbrary's 4 day suite).

I think that'd make it easier for other people to contribute to those features and having them mature faster. The main motivation for me to ask this is that often users (myself included) will ask about a particular feature that's still under development (generally immersed solids or parallelism), and someone ends up describing the state of affairs at that point and pointing to a validation script and the user has to figure everything out from there. I realize all these things are available in issues and PRs, but it's hard to find the right ones and distill what's ""relevant"" information from there. I'm going through that this moment with `ImmersedBoundaryGrid`, which I'm trying to advance. I can work backwards from a given script to figure out how the implementation exists now and get a sense of to expand it, but it'd be way easier if I could read about what's implemented already, why that's the chosen implementation, bumps on the road, etc. Another motivation is that the code has grown so much lately that I sometimes see PRs/issues here about some features and I realize I simply don't recognize (and I'm fairly involved with Oceananigans' development). Some of those features might be useful for my research, or they may be things that I'd be interest in developing that I'm missing out on. Possible places to host that info would be a dedicated section of the docs possibly named ""Experimental features"", but maybe the easiest way would be allowing a wiki for that.

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2356:285,Usability,intuit,intuitive,285,I have recently realized that the current definition of `gravity_unit_vector` is a vector that's in the _opposite_ direction to gravity:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/10a9479ec462f4f5f053e7447ff667fdfe20542d/src/BuoyancyModels/buoyancy.jl#L11-L13. This sounds counter-intuitive to me. I wonder if we can come up with a better name. Maybe `buoyancy_unit_vector`? It can't be something like `vertical_unit_vector` because then we'd potentially run into inconsistencies (see https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2266).,MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2356

In this PR I also attempted to explore an alternative formulation of the FFT-based preconditioner:. ```; [竏ﾂｲ - 1 / (g Hﾌ ﾎ杯ﾂｲ)] ﾎｷ竅ｿ竅ｺﾂｹ = (竏ﾊｰ 站 Q笘 - ﾎｷ竅ｿ / ﾎ杯) / (g H ﾎ杯) - 竏ﾊｰ H 站 竏ﾊｰ ﾎｷ笘 / H,; ```. where `ﾎｷ笘` is the current solution in the conjugate gradient iteration. However, this caused the iteration to diverge. Perhaps it would be better to use `ﾎｷ竅ｿ`, but I'm not sure. On the right side, `H` is no longer constant but instead is the actual depth `H(x, y)`. I also tried using `HﾌЯ in the denominators above, but this apparently made no difference. # Other changes / improvements. To support this development, this PR implements some improvements to `PreconditionedConjugateGradientSolver`. Previously we would specify the argument `precondition!`, which was supposed to be a function that computed `P * r`, where `P` is often called the ""preconditioner"". Now we specify `preconditioner`, which must define a method. ```julia; precondition!(z, preconditioner, r, args...); ```. This API is more convenient for preconditioners that require some data storage or precomputation and thus must be objects of their own (rather than functions). - In the conjugate gradient loop, we launch broadcasts with `parent(a) .= parent(b)` rather than using Oceananigans internal broadcasting `a .= b`. This is a bit faster and saves some memory allocation.; - The default preconditioner for `PCGImplicitFreeSurface` is now `nothing`.; - We now always precompute and store `GridFittedBottom`, since it's rarely / never desired to compute on the fly and ""only supporting arrays"" simplifies our code.; - The interface for `PreconditionedConjugateGradientSolver` now resembles the interface to `cg` with properties `maxiter`, `abstol`, and `reltol`; - The default `reltol` for the `PCGImplicitFreeSurfaceSolver` is `max(1e-7, 10 * eps(eltype(grid)))`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2412

I propose that we implement a hierarchical specification system using a new object called `AdvectionScheme` that specifies. 1. The ""form"" of the advection operator for momentum and tracers (either `VectorInvariant` or `FluxForm` for momentum, always `FluxForm` for tracers); 2. For `FluxForm`, the reconstruction scheme for the advected component ; 3. For `VectorInvariant`, the stencil for _computing_ vorticity, as well as the method for _reconstructing_ vorticity at the momentum locations; 4. For `VectorInvariant` with WENO reconstruction, the type of the smoothness stencil (vorticity or velocity); 5. The method for reconstruction velocities in mass conservation (continuity) as well as tracer advection. We also may want to specify how we reconstruction _advecting_ velocities for flux form momentum advection (right now we use centered advection with an accuracy one order lower than the accuracy of the advected component reconstruction --- ie with `UpwindBiasedFifthOrder()` we reconstruct advecting components with a centered fourth order scheme). Finally, we need to allow different schemes for every tracer. This modular design will allow more detailed specification of an advection scheme and also us to remove the option for WENO reconstruction for vector invariant more easily, which @simone-silvestri pointed out is experimental. We also would like to explore alternative discretization for the continuity equation. For this we need a ""mass"" reconstruction scheme, and the advecting scheme for tracers needs to reconstruct `advected_velocity` in a way that's consistent with the mass reconstruction. Here's a sketch of what these new types might look like:. ```julia; """""" Specifies a reconstruction scheme for fluxes of the form u * c,; where u is the `advecting_velocity` and c is the `advected_quantity` """"""; struct FluxFormAdvection; adv",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2454

I'm wondering if we should implement behavior where `pickup=true` _overrides_ `overwrite_existing=true`. This would mean that if we pickup we _cannot_ overwrite an existing file (if for some reason we do want that, we'd have to delete it manually). I think this is really the behavior we want. However, it requires refactoring the output writers, because we have to move output writer initialization from the output writer constructor to another function that gets called after `run!(simulation)`. Not very hard, but something to ponder. Here's a few other random ideas that would also address this issue in slightly different ways. 1. Implement a ""pickup mode"" specified with an environment variable like `OCEANANIGANS_PICKUP=true` (rather than something we write in a script). Then output writer constructors can search for this environment variable and override `overwrite_existing` (with a warning?) in the output writer constructor. ""pickup mode"" has other usability benefits (ie it's annoying we have to change the run script / prepare the run script to be ""pickup"" aware: pickup mode avoids this so we can toggle to pickup mode from _outside_ the run script without internal changes) and also obviates the need to separate output writer constructor from output writer ""initialization"". 2. If we ""delay"" output writer construction, we can also extract the option ""overwrite_existing"" and put it elsewhere (eg as a global option `overwrite_existing_output` for all output writers in `run!`). This makes a stronger connection between `pickup` and `overwrite_existing`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2535

If we save data at high frequency but checkpoint at low frequency, then pickup the checkpoint and attempt to write data to the same JLD2 file, we can obtain the error:. ```; ERROR: LoadError: ArgumentError: a group or dataset named 12015 is already present within this group; ```. because the _first_ simulation ran past the checkpointed time and saved more data.

Other configurations that are decomposed in (x, y) but have too few Nz,; or any configuration decomposed in z, are not supported. Algorithm for two-dimensional decompositions; ============================================. When decomposition in two-dimensions for a three-dimensional problem,; there are three forward transforms, three backward transforms,; and 4 transpositions requiring MPI communication. In the following schematic, the first; dimension is always the local dimension. The following algorithm requires that `Nz > Rx`,; where `Nz` is the number of vertical cells and `Rx` is the number of ranks in x.; For `Nz < Rx` but `Nz > Ry`, a similar algorithm applies with x and y swapped:. 1. `first(storage)` is initialized with layout (z, x, y).; 2. Transform along z.; 3 Transpose + communicate to storage[2] in layout (x, z, y),; which is distributed into `(Rx, Ry)` processes in (z, y).; 4. Transform along x.; 5 Transpose + communicate to last(storage) in layout (y, x, z),; which is distributed into `(Rx, Ry)",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2536

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2597:1511,Availability,error,errors,1511,"This PR makes several improvements to CATKE:. 1. We add parameters to the TKE dissipation rate model, which is `ep = CD * e^(3/2) / L`. Previously `CD` was a constant; this PR makes `CD(Ri)` a function of the Richardson number `Ri`. We can interpret this physically as a relaxation of the assumption that the TKE dissipation length scale is equal (or scales identically with) the TKE transport mixing length. . 2. We simplify the stability function (cc @adelinehillier). Previously we used tanh; now we use piecewise linear, which is simpler and more performant (we are unsure if this matters, but we can use all the help we can get for performance). @adelinehillier also simplifies the formulation of the stability function. 3.

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2609:465,Usability,simpl,simply,465,"This question is a bit of a detour from the Ocean, but might occur in the oceanographic context sometime, maybe?. With @writingindy, we have put together a one-layer shallow water magnetohydrodynamic model as presented in [Gilman 2000](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/317291/meta). You can see the results of a simulation in the animation below and find the code [here](https://github.com/writingindy/SWMHD/blob/main/sw_mhd_adjustment.jl). To do this we simply needed to add a tracer for the magnetic potential and add a Lorentz force. Luckily, Oceananigans makes it easy to do both! In our formulation, we wrote the Lorentz force as Jacobian, which means that it tends to be noisy and needs dissipation for numerical stability. The Lorentz force can also be written in in terms of advection, but the advection is by a tracer field, which leads to the following question:. Can we use advection schemes in the forcing functions?. https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8239041/173368598-90b26027-63ab-4fcd-91e9-76618ae002bc.mp4",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2609

I've been working with @johnryantaylor, and we've been using Lagrangian Particles but have come across an issue. To preface, the issue be my miss understanding of how to use tracked fields but I can't find an obvious solution. Essentially the problem seems to be that to define an tracked field for a tracer you have to already have the model defined, but to do that you have to have the particles defined. A work around for this was to make the model, then define the particles, then redefine the model. This would run and not error, but would result in the tracked field property of the particles not actually being updated. Running it yet again appears to fix it and make it; work. In order to fix this I've modified the `update_particle_properties!` function to explicitly use the models tracer fields when it is a tracer field being tracked. I've also updated the tests which seem to run. If you run the tests on the previous version of the code then the property t does not get updated (but will run with this set up). I hope this is the best place for me to make this pull request since you're updating particle tracking anyway!.

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2681:321,Availability,error,error,321,"Hi all,. I've come across a strange issue with Lagrangian particles where if they're near the top of the domain they always jump down by ﾎ配 after the first intermediate time step. I have tracked this down to the boundary condition enforcement where there is an off by one error choosing the maximum allowed position. The error would also have occurred in the x and y directions too. I will pull request this fix: https://github.com/jagoosw/Oceananigans.jl/tree/particle_tracking. I realized @simone-silvestri is working on an overhaul of Lagrangian particle tracking but it seems to not be fixed in that branch either. Hope this helps!.

I'm currently building a model with lots of forced tracers with @johnryantaylor and @syou83syou83 and have come across an issue that I'm struggling to find a way around related to GPU compilation. I've spent a while looking through your previous similar issues (e.g. [PR #746](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/746)) and going through the error messages (below) the error message it gives and I'm fairly sure that its coming from the parameters size passed to the boundary tendency functions being too large. . I have looked through the source and while I think it would be possible to reduce the parameter size for the velocity tendencies by only passing them the T and S tracers as required (see the first, nonworking, step towards this [here](https://github.com/jagoosw/Oceananigans.jl/tree/reduce-gpu-params)) I don't see how this problem can be solved in the `tracer_tendency` function since tracer forcing/boundaries may depend on any number of fields.

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2700:607,Energy Efficiency,reduce,reduce,607,"Hi all,. I'm currently building a model with lots of forced tracers with @johnryantaylor and @syou83syou83 and have come across an issue that I'm struggling to find a way around related to GPU compilation. I've spent a while looking through your previous similar issues (e.g. [PR #746](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/746)) and going through the error messages (below) the error message it gives and I'm fairly sure that its coming from the parameters size passed to the boundary tendency functions being too large. .

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766:204,Security,validat,validation,204,"Dear Oceananigans team,. We are trying to use Oceananigans to create reference LES solutions for multiple canonical flows. We use a cubical domain and random perturbations to trigger the flow. During our validation tests, we noticed that we could not reproduce the results, i.e., running the same .jl script (same initial flow conditions) leads to different averaged solutions (see attached picture). We ran more than 16 simulations and never obtained the same solution. We tried to set the seed of the random perturbations constant, but this did not solve the problem. Do you observe this problem, and could you help us run reproducible simulations so other users can obtain the same solutions? We attached the .jl file we are using to define the simulations.

Basically the scenario is that I've running simulations with a given script for the past 6 months or so. The simulation and model itself has stayed the same, I've been running on the same GPUs, and the only changes that I made were those forced by changes in Oceanigans. . When I started this setup, I could run up to ~105 million points. Then as the versions increased I had to decrease to size of simulations to 100 million and then to 95 million. Now with the change to Julia 1.8 (I had been using Julia 1.6 until version 0.77.5) there was a steep increase in memory use and my max size went from 95 to 80 million. Compared to my original size of ~105 million, that's a decrease of about 25% in the grid size. Has anyone else noticed this? Is this expected since we added more features/flexibility to the code lately?. A few notes:. - My simulation is pretty complex (it's got IBM, forcings for every variable, a tracer, LES closures and drag BCs), so I think for most other simulations the max size would be smaller; - I understand that part of the memory allocation depends on the package dependencies (and the Julia version itself), not being directly controlled by Oceananigans code; - It's also worth noting that since the cluster I use (Casper) hasn't installed Julia 1.8, I started trying the newest version from the pre-compiled binaries for Julia 1.8. I don't know if that can somehow affect the memory allocation since the binaries aren't optimized for that specific machine (I haven't yet tried compiling Julia 1.8 from source).

https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2829:912,Availability,error,error,912,"Hey all,. Awesome software, I am really enjoying using it. I was wondering if you have any recommendations for compatibility with [DrWatson.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl)? In particular, I am hoping to combine the [`tagsave`](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/dev/save/#DrWatson.tagsave) functionality (which stores meta information about a simulation, like git commit, filename, etc) with `JLD2OutputWriter` somehow.

The current behavior is that for every grid type there are functions `xspacings()`, `xspacing()`, `xnodes()` and `xnode()` (and similarly for y and z) that follow the pattern illustrated below:. ```julia; julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(4, 4, 1), extent=(1, 1, 1)); 4ﾃ4ﾃ1 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 3ﾃ3ﾃ3 halo; 笏懌楳笏 Periodic x 竏 [0.0, 1.0) regularly spaced with ﾎ肺=0.25; 笏懌楳笏 Periodic y 竏 [0.0, 1.0) regularly spaced with ﾎ輩=0.25; 笏披楳笏 Bounded z 竏 [-1.0, 0.0] regularly spaced with ﾎ配=1.0. julia> xnodes(grid, Center(), Center(), Face()); 4-element view(OffsetArray(::StepRangeLen{Float64, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Int64}, -2:7), 1:4) with eltype Float64:; 0.125; 0.375; 0.625; 0.875. julia> xnode(2, 2, 2, grid, Center(), Center(), Face()); 0.375. julia> xspacings(grid, Center(), Center(), Face()); 0.25. julia> xspacing(1, 2, 3, grid, Center(), Center(), Face()); 0.25; ```. These functions also appropriately handle stretched coordinates. In addition, both `xspacings()` and `xnodes()` have a `with_halos` kwarg that controls whether of not halos points are included. Convenience functions with fewer arguments are also defined for the cases where that's possible. For example:. ```julia; julia> xnode(2,2,2, grid, Center(), Center(), Face()); 0.375. julia> xnode(2, grid, Center()); 0.375; ```.

Regridding is only supported for tracer fields (though it's not a huge amount of work to extend the schemes for any field). I believe the regridding is conservative for `RectilinearGrid`, and also conservative for `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` when the grids are aligned (ie when all grid lines of the coarser of the two grids is shared with the finer grid). In the case of partial overlaps on curvilinear grids, the volumes of the overlaps are approximated and thus the regridding is not perfectly conservative. It could make sense to emit a warning in this case. In principle, this should allow regridding in 3D by forming intermediate regridding in x, y, and z. We leave multi-dimensional regridding to the user for now. This PR also adds a `minimum_turbulent_kinetic_energy` and `negative_turbulent_kinetic_energy_damping_timescale` to `CATKEVerticalDiffusivity`, either of which can help stabilize 2D or 3D simulations with CATKE (where due to advection TKE may go negative).",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2881

This might be a headache in terms of understanding the cause of stability problems. Imagine a situation in which a model is characterized by 3 different velocities that all advect a centered second-order reconstruction of the tracer. If we run into stability problems it might not be immediately clear what the course of action is: is the instability caused by the interaction of the tracer with velocity 1, 2, or 3?. This is not the only issue with this implementation. The implementation is _wrong_ if we use an upwinding reconstruction of the tracer for any of the velocities e.g.:. Imagine we have a Background velocity $U_b = 1$ and an advective forcing $U_a = -1$ and we upwind separately.; The tracer advective flux should be zero everywhere, but, if we upwind:; $$(U_b c) + (U_a c) = c^L - c^R$$. If we want to be able to advect with different velocities consistently we have to ensure that; - the same scheme is used; - we _sum_ the velocities and _not_ apply reconstruction separately. A way to do it could by defining; ```; struct AdvectiveU{A, B, C, D}; u :: A; ubkg :: B; ufrc :: C; ubgc :: D; end. Base.getindex(u::AdvectiveU, i, j, k) = u.u[i, j, k] + u.ubkg[i, j, k] + u.ubcg[i, j, k] + u.ufrc[i, j, k]; ```; and passing this velocity to the tracer tendency kernel.",MatchSource.ISSUE,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2928
