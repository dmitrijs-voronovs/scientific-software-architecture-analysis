How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments).

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works. Use it at your own risk and after testing your; particular distribution, including tests run multithreaded,; if you intend to run PSI4 so. Use at least 0.2.15, and; pay attention to how it was compiled - unthreaded seems safe,; openmp-threaded is mostly safe, default pthreaded is not safe.

Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS.

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies.

CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance.

How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository.

It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt.

Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it. C++ and C Compilers (C++17 compliant); Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard; Linux distribution); Python interpreter and headers (3.8+) https://www.python.org/; CMake (3.15+) https://cmake.org/download/; NumPy (needed at runtime and buildtime) https://numpy.org/; System utilities: GNU make and GNU install or Ninja, POSIX threads (Pthreads) library. The following are also required for PSI4, but if not detected, the; build system will automatically download and build. gau2grid — [what is gau2grid?] [gau2grid min version]; Libint — [what is Libint?] [Libint min version] (Libint2 as of Nov 2020; added by v1.4).

Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. How to configure code to use high angular momentum basis sets¶; The Libint integral code handles; arbitrary order angular momentum (AM), but compiling that is; prohibitive. The build process for Libint2 takes longer than; for Libint1, so it’s recommended to use the conda packages. The AM controlling keyword MAX_AM_ERI; has definition changed a little from Libint1. It is used to ensure; that conventional energies can use at least MAX_AM_ERI zeta. See; psi4//external/upstream/libint2/CMakeLists.txt for a fuller; discussion of AM capabilities. Unless BUILD_Libint2_GENERATOR; is set to ON, an internal build of Libint2 will download a; pregenerated tarball of at least MAX_AM_ERI AM. If you; want to build completely from generator source, turn on the keyword,; but parts can only run in serial and parts benefit from parallel, so; it’s not recommended. All the AM generation settings would need to be; edited in the above CMakeLists.txt rather than passing them into; the PSI4 build directly.

If earlier Libint was built; internally (as opposed to detecting an external installation),; remove stage/include/libint/, stage/share/cmake/Libint/,; stage/lib/libint2.so.2. Edit MAX_AM_ERI; value in CMakeCache.txt. Reinvoke make and check the number; beside Found Libint in the CMake output.; Note that the same keyword MAX_AM_ERI controls Libint and simint. simint; can’t compile above AM7, so you’ll have to turn off simint to get an; internal compile of AM>=8 Libint. The keyword is only a lower bound for; detection, so you can set it at 7, have both Libint and simint enabled,; and point CMake toward a pre-built Libint AM8 just fine.

How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_osx-64 clang_osx-64 llvm-openmp intel-openmp. # To Build, activate environment (prepends PATH and defines environment variables CLANG, CLANGXX, HOST, etc):; >>> conda activate clang401; >>> echo ${CLANGXX}; /path/to/miniconda/envs/clang401/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-clang++; >>> echo ${HOST}; x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0. # build with Clang; >>> cmake -S. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${CLANG} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CLANGXX} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-stdlib=libc++"" \; -DOpenMP_CXX_FLAG=""-fopenmp=libiomp5"". # build with Intel; >>> cmake -S. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc \; -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-clang-name=${CLANG}"" \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-clang-name=${CLANG} -clangxx-name=${CLANGXX} -stdlib=libc++ -I${CONDA_PREFIX}/include/c++/v1"". # Configure and build.

And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn. This should; re-clone the Add-On, rebuild and install it, rebuild any parts of; PSI4 that interface to it, and relink the main core.so.; If you’re modifying the Add-On’s file or directory structure, be; smart and rm all traces of it within {objdir}/stage/,; especially any *.pyc files.; Alternatively and preferentially to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the PSI4 repository. This; is especially useful if you want to avoid full recompiles of the; Add-On at each change to the Add-On’s source. Build the Add-On; library dynamically (-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON) and mind any; “Psi4 wants” in the Add-On’s top-level CMakeLists.txt. Install the; Add-On and note the full path to AddOnConfig.cmake.

How to use logging in Psi4¶; A log file is generated alongside the output file and has extension; .log. Selected key information is sent to it. The log file contents; are provisional and haphazard, so don’t start relying upon them. It is; tentatively envisioned that log files will have much of the same results as output; files but more as structured data than narrative, nicely formatted data.; In some cases where external calls are involved, the most detailed; information may only be collectable in the log file. It is; worthwhile to check the log file if expected results are missing from; the usual output file. If the log file is empty, the logging level may; be set too low.; To change the logging level to DEBUG from the ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/build_planning.html

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; shebang line. To use a different Python with PSI4 in the long term,; edit the shebang line.; If you’re using PSI4 as a Python module, then PSI4 is running; the Python of which python. How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. >>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run.

How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt.

It may have a; .tmp extension, depending on whether the last test was interrupted and; a few other factors. Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation. From the executable; # smoke tests only in serial; psi4 --test; # smoke tests only in parallel; psi4 --test -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; # most tests; psi4 --test full.

Few (mostly packagers and; sysadmins) are expected to read this file as it is a broad guide to the; many choices in building this project. For a specific, well-tested,; and performance-tuned build path, see psicode.org/installs/latest; (select “source”). For pre-built binaries again well-tested,; performance-tuned, and available for all common operating systems,; see psicode.org/installs/latest (select “conda”). Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself .; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4. More detail is given here.; >>> cd {top-level-psi4-dir}; >>> cmake -S. -Bobjdir [your configuration options]; >>> cd objdir; >>> make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; >>> make install. How to build, test, and install Psi4, in detail¶; 1. Plan Directories. Get ahold of the PSI4 codebase, and navigate to the top level source; directory, hereafter top-level-psi4-dir. How to obtain Psi4: start with find-the-code quiz, end in {top-level-psi4-dir}. >>> cd {top-level-psi4",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/build_planning.html

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation; How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation. What are the tools and dependencies strictly required for building Psi4¶; The core PSI4 build requires the software below. Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it. C++ and C Compilers (C++17 compliant); Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard; Linux distribution); Python interpreter and headers (3.8+) https://www.python.org/; CMake (3.15+) https://cmake.org/download/; NumPy (needed at runtime and buildtime) https://numpy.org/; System utilities: GNU make and GNU install or Ninja, POSIX threads (Pthreads) library.

How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies. PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source. Examples. Build with detected compiler from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific (Intel) compiler from PATH. >>> cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort. What Fortran compilers are approved¶; On Linux and Mac, the following work nicely. GNU: gfortran; Intel: ifort. Packages to install for specific OS or package managers:. Ubuntu gfortran; conda gfortran_linux-64 or gfortran_osx-64 to get gfortran. How to obtain a Fortran compiler for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; Xcode does not provide a Fortran compiler. A way to get one is to download; the gfortran_osx-64 conda package. This provides; gfortran compilers for Mac. The version is 4.8.5, which is quite old,; but the Fortran compiler will work.

How to handle “runtime library may be hidden” when building with Anaconda Python¶; When building against Ana/Miniconda python (e.g., cmake; -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/conda/bin/python), the warning below often; appears.

Some of these libraries may not be found correctly. How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files.

It may have a; .tmp extension, depending on whether the last test was interrupted and; a few other factors. Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation. From the executable; # smoke tests only in serial; psi4 --test; # smoke tests only in parallel; psi4 --test -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; # most tests; psi4 --test full. From the library (PSI4 must be detectable as a Python; module. See setup at How to configure paths for PsiAPI; if needed.); # smoke tests only; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test('smoke')""; # most tests; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test()"".

It; is recommended that the PSI4 build be initially configured with; -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON (easier to notice changes). And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn. This should; re-clone the Add-On, rebuild and install it, rebuild any parts of; PSI4 that interface to it, and relink the main core.so.; If you’re modifying the Add-On’s file or directory structure, be; smart and rm all traces of it within {objdir}/stage/,; especially any *.pyc files.; Alternatively and preferentially to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the PSI4 repository. This; is especially useful if you want to avoid full recompiles of the; Add-On at each change to the Add-On’s source. Build the Add-On; library dynamically (-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON) and mind any; “Psi4 wants” in the Add-On’s top-level CMakeLists.txt. Install the; Add-On and note the full path to AddOnConfig.cmake. Pass; the path containing that file to PSI4‘s CMake as; -DAddon_DIR=/path/to/config/usually/ending/in/share/cmake/AddON; and build PSI4. The main core.so should be dynamically linked; to your dev AddOn dynamic lib and update automatically when you rebuild; the AddOn lib. Naturally, you may need to delete core.so and remake; as needed. How to use logging in Psi4¶; A log file is generated alongside the output file and has extension; .log. Selected key information is sent to it.

What is the directory layout of the installed or staged Psi4¶; After compilation (cd objdir && make), a directory structure like the; below will exist at objdir/stage. This may be tested and used; just like a full installation.; After installation (cd objdir && make && make install), a directory; structure like the below will exist at /prefix. This is a full; installation.; /; bin/ (executables for psi4 + any external proj); bin/psi4 (psi4 executable, actually just a py script); include/ (installed headers for psi4 + any external proj); include/psi4/ (header files for #include-ing); include/psi4/psi4-dec.h (primary psi4 header); include/psi4/masses.h (a project-wide psi4 header); include/psi4/libmints/ (psi4 library headers); include/psi4/libfock/ (ditto); share/ (read-only arch-indep files for psi4 + any external proj); share/cmake/psi4/ (files for detecting installed targets); share/cmake/psi4/psi4Config.cmake (psi4 build/install info); share/cmake/psi4/psi4ConfigVersion.cmake (psi4 cmake version info); share/doc/psi4/html/ (sphinx html documentation); share/psi4/ (text files needed by psi4); share/psi4/basis (basis sets); share/psi4/plugins (plugin template files); share/psi4",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/build_planning.html

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always n",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/build_planning.html

How to get a Psi4 logo file¶; All image files are stored in https://github.com/psi4/psi4media. How to use a local Add-On repository in the Psi4 build¶; For each Add-On, PSI4 pulls source from a specific online Git; repository and a specific tag/branch/commit in it. This ensures success; of the PSI4 build, reproducibility of the runtime results, and; freedom for continued upstream development. Sometimes, you’re the one; doing that development, and you need the CMake superbuild to pull source; from a local path rather than the approved codeset.; Find the CMakeLists.txt governing the target Add-On in; psi4/external and make changes analogous to the below:; #GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/jturney/ambit; #GIT_TAG 1.0; DOWNLOAD_COMMAND """"; SOURCE_DIR ""/path/to/ambit-directclone"".

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to configure a Psi4 build on Cray¶; Cray systems strongly prefer to build static libraries, but PSI4; needs to be dynamic to function as a Python module. Courtesy of @misha; at the forum and various supercomputer guides, building PSI4 on; Cray requires setting environment variables before running cmake.; CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes cmake ... CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE¶; Set to allow PSI4 to build as shared library on Cray supercomputers. CRAY_ADD_RPATH¶; Set to true to allow PSI4 to build on Cray supercomputers.

The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.9.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; she",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/build_planning.html

Capabilities and Alternate Implementations¶; Depending on the reference (e.g., RHF, UHF, ROHF), the integral treatment; (conventional CONV, density-fitted DF, and Cholesky-decomposed CD),; active orbitals, and derivative level, computational methods are; sometimes assembled from implementations by multiple coders. Conversely,; some capabilities may be implemented multiple times. Capabilities,; modules, algorithm types, and defaults are detailed for many ground-state; methods at Table Module Capabilities. Its; analogous summary table (with modules collapsed) is at Summary; Capabilities. PSI4 transparently selects the; most efficient implementation, so one generally needn’t consult this; table. However, to understand the details of what combinations are; accessible or what alternate implementations are available, read on.; Note that HF, DFT, and MPn (n<=3); default to density-fitted integrals, while all higher methods default to; conventional integrals.

PSI4. Theoretical Methods: SCF to FCI; Capabilities and Alternate Implementations. Capabilities and Alternate Implementations¶; Depending on the reference (e.g., RHF, UHF, ROHF), the integral treatment; (conventional CONV, density-fitted DF, and Cholesky-decomposed CD),; active orbitals, and derivative level, computational methods are; sometimes assembled from implementations by multiple coders. Conversely,; some capabilities may be implemented multiple times. Capabilities,; modules, algorithm types, and defaults are detailed for many ground-state; methods at Table Module Capabilities. Its; analogous summary table (with modules collapsed) is at Summary; Capabilities. PSI4 transparently selects the; most efficient implementation, so one generally needn’t consult this; table. However, to understand the details of what combinations are; accessible or what alternate implementations are available, read on.; Note that HF, DFT, and MPn (n<=3); default to density-fitted integrals, while all higher methods default to; conventional integrals. Therefore, for a closed-shell molecule:; # runs MP2 with default algorithm type ``DF`` with default implementation DFMP2; energy('mp2'). # runs MP2 with algorithm type ``CONV`` with default implementation OCC; set mp2_type conv; energy('mp2'). # runs MP2 with default algorithm type ``DF`` with implementation OCC; set qc_module occ; energy('mp2'). # runs MP2 with algorithm type ``CONV`` with implementation FNOCC; set mp2_type conv; set qc_module fnocc; energy('mp2'). Capabilities of PSI4, including details of overlapping modules. “✓” runs analytically. “∷” runs derivative with internal finite difference. Single underline “✓̲” or “∷̲” is default module when QC_MODULE unspecified. Double underline “✓̳” or “∷̳” is default algorithm type when type selector (e.g., CC_TYPE) unspecified.¶. ◻; ◻; name ↓ →; type[1] ↓ →; ◻.

Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantities with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., \(\langle ij | ab \rangle\) integrals) may be held in the cache. Type: integer; Default: 2. CACHETYPE¶. Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd codes. A value of LOW selects a “low priority” scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities. A value of LRU selects a “least recently used” scheme in which the oldest item in the cache will be the first one deleted.

Specification of strings and integers requires no; translation; booleans have extended freedom of; format; arrays must be translated into Python-style (square-bracket; bounded and comma delimited) of appropriate dimension. There are many; sample inputs in psi4/tests/cfour/ starting with sp- that take; examples from the Cfour manual and first run them in sandwich mode and; then run them as translated into PSI4 format. Note; PSI4 only recognizes keywords by their full name, so the common; Cfour keyword abbreviations CALC, REF, etc. must be replaced by their; proper names of CFOUR_CALC_LEVEL, CFOUR_REFERENCE, etc. Whenever the molecule is supplied in PSI4 format, it is possible to; perform geometry optimizations where Cfour supplies the gradient and the; PSI4 module optking drives the structural; changes. Because of the limitations on geometry specification for; optimizations in Cfour, optking-driven optimizations are the only; optimizations allowed in the P4C4 interface. (The exception is sandwich; mode, which, of course, permits optimizations with the Cfour optimizer.); Below is an example of a geometry optimization:; memory 200 mb. molecule {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A.

Gauss¶; Code author: Lori A. Burns; Section author: Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples; PSI4 contains code to interface to the Cfour quantum chemistry suite of; John F. Stanton (U. Texas, Austin) and Jürgen Gauss (U. Mainz),; which is available after a license agreement from; http://www.cfour.de/. Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH. If PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error; will be reported. Caution; The p4c4 interface hasn’t been fully adapted for the new March 2014 version. Cfour for PSI4 Users¶. Set memory as usual; Set molecule as usual; Set basis set as usual (Cfour only cares about orbital basis, no fitting; bases); Set the task as usual, indicating Cfour as the intended code by; prepending “c4-” to the method argument. So energy('scf') becomes; energy('c4-scf') and optimize('ccsd(t)') becomes; optimize('c4-ccsd(t)'). Find available methods for; energy() at Energy (CFOUR); and for optimize() at Gradient (CFOUR).; Generally, the p4c4 interface will handle best practices for path of; execution: vcc/ecc, derivative type, etc. The user is still; responsible for setting convergence, frozen core, guess, diis, etc.; For the moment, so-called “best-practices” keywords are summarized at; Best Practices.; For the type of computation intended, find appropriate options at; Keywords.

PSI4 for Cfour Users¶; In the simplest use of the Psi4/Cfour interface, a PSI4 input file; can simply “wrap” a ZMAT file and execute xcfour.

Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples; PSI4 contains code to interface to the Cfour quantum chemistry suite of; John F. Stanton (U. Texas, Austin) and Jürgen Gauss (U. Mainz),; which is available after a license agreement from; http://www.cfour.de/. Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH. If PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error; will be reported. Caution; The p4c4 interface hasn’t been fully adapted for the new March 2014 version. Cfour for PSI4 Users¶. Set memory as usual; Set molecule as usual; Set basis set as usual (Cfour only cares about orbital basis, no fitting; bases); Set the task as usual, indicating Cfour as the intended code by; prepending “c4-” to the method argument. So energy('scf') becomes; energy('c4-scf') and optimize('ccsd(t)') becomes; optimize('c4-ccsd(t)').

Warning; Because p4c4 does not inspect the contents of the cfour {...}; block, once the user specifies a PSI4-style molecule, the; interface cannot judge whether a sandwich mode (drop the PSI4 molecule; and use the cfour block as the entirety of the ZMAT) or a standard mode; (translate the PSI4 molecule and append additional input from the; cfour block) is intended. The latter is what actually occurs.

Therefore, if mixing sandwich and; standard or pure-PSI4 computations in an input file, place all; the sandwich jobs at the beginning before declaring PSI4; molecules.

Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples. Note; As of late June 2016, DMRG keywords in PSI4 have been; realigned with those of the chemps2 executable, plus a; “dmrg_” prefix. The only exceptions are the orbital space; PSI4 keywords RESTRICTED_DOCC (formerly; CheMPS2 used FROZEN_DOCC, contrary to its; definition) and ACTIVE which are passed along to; CheMPS2 keywords NOCC and NACT. A translation table; is available. Installation¶; Binary. CheMPS2 is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).; If using the PSI4 binary, CheMPS2 has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; CheMPS2 can be obtained through conda install chemps2.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect CheMPS2 and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove chemps2. Source.

CMake Variables. ENABLE_CheMPS2 — CMake variable toggling whether Psi4 builds with CheMPS2; CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For CheMPS2, set to an installation directory containing include/chemps2/DMRG.h; CheMPS2_DIR — CMake variable to specify where pre-built CheMPS2 can be found. Set to installation directory containing share/cmake/CheMPS2/CheMPS2Config.cmake; CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_CheMPS2 — CMake variable to force internal build of CheMPS2 instead of detecting pre-built; CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_CheMPS2 — CMake variable to force detecting pre-built CheMPS2 and not falling back on internal build.

Subscribe to our channel at https://anaconda.org/psi4 that contains the PSI4 package and several dependency packages.

Install PSI4. You can install into the main conda environment so that whenever commands conda or (Ana/Miniconda’s) python are available, then psi4 is available, too. >>> conda install psi4; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/bin/psi4. Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda. This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The conda activate command (conda >=4.4; December 2017) works in all shells, but if you’re using old source activate that only works for bash; adjust as needed for csh/tcsh.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> conda activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4.

Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals). DENSITYThis task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\), together; with the total density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) + \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\),; and the spin density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) - \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\).

This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option CUBEPROP_ISOCONTOUR_THRESHOLD. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals). DENSITYThis task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\r",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/cubeprop.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/cubeprop.html

BASIS_FUNCTIONSThis task is useful to produce cube files of the atomic orbital basis; functions \(\chi_\mu(\mathbf{r})\). ESPCalculates the total (nuclear + electronic) electrostatic potential; \(V(\mathbf{r})\). DUAL_DESCRIPTORCalculates the dual descriptor from frontier orbitals:; \(f^2(\mathbf{r})=\rho_{\mathrm{LUMO}}(\mathbf{r})-\rho_{\mathrm{HOMO}}(\mathbf{r})\).; The dual descriptor is a good measure of nucleophilicity and electrophilicity,; containing information essentially equivalent to both Fukui functions combined.; More details on the dual descriptor itself can be found in [Morell:2005:205],; while the current implementation is described in [Martinez-Araya:2015:451].; This feature is currently only supported for closed shell systems. Note; The ESP task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis; via the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword. Warning; It is important to specify the CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option when; dealing with large molecules to avoid running out of disk space.; For example, using the default grid spacing of; 0.2 Ångström, the size of a single cube file for a molecule like water; is of the order of 1.4 MB. For a molecule with 200 basis functions, the cube; files for all the orbitals occupy more than half a GB. Keywords¶. CUBEPROP_TASKS¶. Properties to compute.

Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the; AO_BASIS DISK option is recommended (set by default).; In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the AO_BASIS DISK option; is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm fo",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/dct.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/dct.html

Sokolov; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DCT. Theory¶; Density cumulant theory (DCT) is a density-based ab initio theory; that can compute electronic energies without the use of a wavefunction. The; theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and; two-particle density matrices (\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)):. \[E = h_p^q \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{2} g_{pq}^{rs} \gamma_{rs}^{pq}\]; Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices.; \(h_p^q\) and \(g_{pq}^{rs}\) are the standard one- and two-electron integrals, and; \(\gamma_p^q\) and \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) are the elements of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\),; respectively.

However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm for the closed-shell molecules, it; is recommended to set the QC_COUPLING option to FALSE for efficiency; reasons (set by default).; For the ODC computations, the user has a choice of performing the computation of the guess orbitals and cumulants; using the corresponding DC method (set ODC_GUESS to TRUE). This can often lead to; significant computational savings, since the orbital update step in the DC methods is cheap.; Convergence of the guess orbitals and cumulants can be controlled using the; GUESS_R_CONVERGENCE option. table of contents.

In DCT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; \(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\) and a correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\):. \[\gamma_p^q = \kappa_p^q + \tau_p^q\]; The idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) corresponds to a mean-field Hartree–Fock-like density,; while the non-idempotent correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\); depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.; Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:. \[E_{DCT} = \frac{1}{2} \left( h_p^q + f_p^q \right) \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{4} \bar{",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/dct.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/dct.html

First,; the energy is now a function of two sets of independent parameters, the; idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) (\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\)) and the density cumulant; (\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\)). As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,; which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability; problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) is; N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\).; In order to obtain the DCT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:. The energy must be stationary with respect to a set of orbitals. This can be done by; diagonalizing the generalized Fock operator (as in the DC-06 and DC-12 methods, see below),; which introduces partial orbital relaxation, or by fully relaxing the orbitals and minimizing the entire energy expression; (as in the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods).; The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density; cumulant \(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\), constrained to N-representability conditions. Making the energy stationary requires solution of two sets of coupled; equations for orbitals and density cumulant, respectively (also known as; residual equations).

Arbitrary Order Coupled-Cluster Theory¶; This DETCI-based version of this feature is not yet released. However,; the current version of the code does include an interface to; Kallay’s MRCC code.; The DETCI module is also capable of computing arbitrary-order; coupled-cluster energies, using an approach similar to that of Hirata; and Bartlett [Hirata:2000:216], or of Olsen [Olsen:2000:7140].; Notably, the approach in DETCI also allows arbitrary-order; active space coupled-cluster procedures. The general algorithm; for doing this in DETCI is inefficient compared to optimized; lower-order coupled-cluster codes and should not be used for CCSD,; where the CCENERGY module is much more efficient. For higher-order; CC (like CCSDT and beyond), the code is also not as efficient as the; MRCC code by Kállay, to which PSI4 can interface (see Section; Interface to MRCC by M. Kállay); however, it may allow certain truncations of the model; space that might not be available presently in MRCC. For very small; systems, the code can be useful for testing of, for example, CCSDTQ or; its active-space CCSDtq analog [Piecuch:1999:6103].; To perform arbitrary-order coupled-cluster, set the DETCI; option CC to TRUE, and set; CC_EX_LEVEL (note: not EX_LEVEL); to the desired coupled-cluster excitation level, and invoke; energy('detci').

A. Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; Th",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/detci.html

All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. It can also perform approximate; CASSCF computations in which one uses RAS restrictions on the CI excitations,; rather than doing a full CI in the active space. This is called a; RASSCF. CASSCF and RASSCF computations are types of multi-configurational; self-consistent-field procedures, and are described in MCSCF: Multi-Configurational Self-Consistent-Field.; As mentioned above, the DETCI module is designed for challenging; chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable. Because; CI wavefunctions which go beyond CISD (such as RAS CI) are fairly complex,; typically the DETCI code will be used in cases where the; tradeoffs between computational expense and completeness of the; model space are nontrivial. Hence, the user is advised to develop; a good working knowledge of multi-reference and RAS CI methods before; attempting to use the program for a production-level project.

Spin Multiplicities of Higher Roots¶; As mentioned above, DETCI works in a basis of Slater determinants, rather than; configuration state functions. The correct value of \(M_s\) is easily enforced; by fixing the number of alpha and beta electrons to be constant across all determinants; selected for the CI computation. However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/detci.html

This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy. The program then; sets MAX_NUM_VECS to the required order in the; wavefunction.; By default, the requested n-th order energy is saved as the current; energy to the process environment.

A. Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; Th",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/detci.html

For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are particularly inefficient for CISD and may result in the program; running out of memory and crashing for CISD except on very small molecules.; Instead, DETCI was designed to be efficient; in handling more highly correlated CI wavefunctions that can be helpful in more; challenging cases such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions.

A. Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants.

A. Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:.

Spin Multiplicities of Higher Roots¶; As mentioned above, DETCI works in a basis of Slater determinants, rather than; configuration state functions. The correct value of \(M_s\) is easily enforced; by fixing the number of alpha and beta electrons to be constant across all determinants; selected for the CI computation. However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/detci.html

However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)), the program; will typically return singlets and not triplets. However, if enough roots are sought,; higher-multiplicities may enter in. This can be avoided by ensuring that all the guess; vectors have the correct spin multiplicity, by setting CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE).; It is also possible to ask DETCI to compute roots of higher multiplicities.

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI]. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are pa",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/detci.html

An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. It can also perform approximate; CASSCF computations in which one uses RAS restrictions on the CI excitations,; rather than doing a full CI in the active space. This is called a; RASSCF.

Introduction¶; Second-order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor \({\cal O}(N^5)\) treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic \(ov\) products in the; bra- and ket- of the \((ov|ov)\)-type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference.

Introduction¶; Second-order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor \({\cal O}(N^5)\) treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic \(ov\) products in the; bra- and ket- of the \((ov|ov)\)-type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference. An efficient,; threaded, disk-based DF-MP2 code is available in PSI4 for all single; reference types available in the SCF module.; MP2 defaults in PSI4 to the density-fitted code.; The support for MP2 by the DFMP2 module in PSI4 is detailed in; Table DFMP2 Capabilities.

DFMP2 should be run with the \(ov\)-type RI or MP2FIT auxiliary; basis sets, not the -JKFIT basis sets. The automatic basis selector; should work fine for most all bases (exceptions are less common elements; at higher than quadruple-zeta). Generally, it is always better to specify; only the orbital basis set and let the auxiliary bases be chosen; automatically. If you want to specify manually, use the; DF_BASIS_MP2 keyword.; DFMP2 likes memory. At a minimum, \(2Q^2\) doubles are required,; where \(Q\) is the size of the auxiliary basis set.

Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral. An example is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # FRAC jobs will be be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do all kinds of weird stuff; basis aug-cc-pvdz # Augmented functions are very important on the anion side; scf_type df; }. # Argument is functional.; # Many optional arguments are available, see the python file; frac_traverse('wb97', molecule=h2o). The other macro is frac_nuke(), which strips several electrons out of the; system to gather information on the MSIE over a range of orbitals. The input is; identical to the above, except that the frac_traverse() call is substituted; for something like:; # Argument is the functional.; # A useful optional argument is nmax, the total number of electrons to; # strip out of the molecule, in this case, 2.; # Many optional arguments are available, see the python file; frac.frac_nuke('wb97', molecule=h2o, nmax = 2).

A -D functional (Such; as the much cheaper B97-D) should be used instead. Hybrid FunctionalsMany common hybrid functionals, including the ubiquitous B3LYP. PBE0 and the; B97 series are also quite good for many thermochemical problems. LRC FunctionalsLRC functionals are a particular area of interest of the PSI4 DFT team.; LRC functionals are all denoted by a lower-case “w” in front of the standard DFA; functional, such as wPBE. We offer a stable implementation of the Gill; association function for wS and Head-Gordon’s wB97/wB97X functionals.; Additionally, we are pleased to have recently completed a heavily conditioned; implementation of the HJS exchange-hole model, which provides an analytical form; for the short-range enhancement factor for wPBE, wPBEsol, and wB88. From a; physics perspective, this implementation of wPBE is extremely useful for; theoretical investigations, as it is parameter free, and properly integrated; against the partition function in the exchange hole. We would like to thank Dr.; Scuseria for providing helpful advice and a reference implementations of the; older HSE exchange-hole model which led to the successful implementation of the; HJS model. Double-Hybrid FunctionalsDouble hybrids are percolating into PSI4.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:.

The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integer (typically 50-100). The radial grids are “centered” on the Bragg-Slater; radius of each atom, as described in Becke’s 1988 paper. If inaccurate; integration is suspected in systems with anions or very diffuse basis functions,; the DFT_BS_RADIUS_ALPHA option may be increased from 1.0 to a larger value to force the radial grid to span a larger extent in space.; The atomic weighting scheme is controlled by the DFT_NUCLEAR_SCHEME; option, which may be one of TREUTLER, BECKE, STRATMANN, NAIVE,; or SBECKE. The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid).

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D. The “best-practice” input file for KS-DFT is:; memory 1 GB # As much as you've got, the DF algorithm can use. molecule {; H; H 1 0.7; }. set {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; guess sad; }. energy('b3lyp').

Note: we have made a sincere effort to rigorously test all functionals; implemented in PSI4 for correctness. If you find an error in a DFT; functional or have a request for a new functional, please let us know on our; forum or GitHub page. Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131. The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/dft.html

The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid). Our implementation of the TREUTLER scheme shows an; error of 0.02 kcal/mol for the same benchmark. Both also reduce the grid order by 1 for H; and He atoms and avoid any pruning of heavy atoms (Z >= 36) Other schemes mentioned in; the keyword documentation (e.g. P_SLATER) are experimental and should be considered expert-only.; Once the molecular quadrature grid is built, the points are partitioned into; blocks of points which are spatially close to each other. We use an octree; algorithm for this procedure, which produces a good balance between spatial; compactness of each block (which helps achieve linear scaling due to the; exponential decay of the basis functions), and retaining a large number of; points in each block (which helps keep the FLOP rate up by allowing for a; reasonably large amount of BLAS3/BLAS2 work to form the densities and potentials; in each block). For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/dft.html

Don’t worry, it; will definitely NaN on you if you try to use it. Meta FunctionalsWe have recently implemented the M05 classes of meta functionals in; PSI4. Note that these functionals are not appropriate for modeling; dispersion interactions, as they lack dispersion physics. A -D functional (Such; as the much cheaper B97-D) should be used instead. Hybrid FunctionalsMany common hybrid functionals, including the ubiquitous B3LYP. PBE0 and the; B97 series are also quite good for many thermochemical problems. LRC FunctionalsLRC functionals are a particular area of interest of the PSI4 DFT team.; LRC functionals are all denoted by a lower-case “w” in front of the standard DFA; functional, such as wPBE. We offer a stable implementation of the Gill; association function for wS and Head-Gordon’s wB97/wB97X functionals.; Additionally, we are pleased to have recently completed a heavily conditioned; implementation of the HJS exchange-hole model, which provides an analytical form; for the short-range enhancement factor for wPBE, wPBEsol, and wB88. From a; physics perspective, this implementation of wPBE is extremely useful for; theoretical investigations, as it is parameter free, and properly integrated; against the partition function in the exchange hole. We would like to thank Dr.; Scuseria for providing helpful advice and a reference implementations of the; older HSE exchange-hole model which led to the successful implementation of the; HJS model. Double-Hybrid FunctionalsDouble hybrids are percolating into PSI4. Note that these are; only available with density-fitted, not conventional, MP2 algorithms. -D FunctionalsWe have several -D2 functionals implemented. -D3 functionls are available; with the installation of Grimme’s DFTD3 program.; For now, the pure-GGA B97-D; functional of Grimme is remarkably accurate, and the hybrid B3LYP-D; functional is also quite reliable.

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D.

The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid). Our implementation of the TREUTLER scheme shows an; error of 0.02 kcal/mol for the same benchmark. Both also reduce the grid order by 1 for H; and He atoms and avoid any pruning of heavy atoms (Z >= 36) Other schemes mentioned in; the keyword documentation (e.g. P_SLATER) are experimental and should be considered expert-only.; Once the molecular quadrature grid is built, the points are partitioned into; blocks of points which are spatially close to each other.
