I refactored the 3 classes in order to reduce the specific processing in the unit test, i.e. reduce the number of `if`. - The 3 classes now inherit from a common base class `BaseLinearElasticityFEMForceField`. I moved everything that was common (only regarding the unit test. More common code is remaining) in this class. It includes:; - A common `Data` for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. This way, they share type, the same default value, and the same description. Note that Young's modulus in `FastTetrahedralCorotationalForceField` and `TetrahedralCorotationalFEMForceField` was a scalar, and now it's a vector of scalars. This requires to add a common way to access the Young's modulus of the i-th element. This is also a breaking change. This allows to define a typed unit test for all 3 classes.

In a Euler implicit integration scheme, the right hand side expression only contains terms coming for the internal and external forces taken at the begining of the timestep, and an inertial term constituted of the stiffness matrix, but no term coming from the constitutive damping. (see [Christian Duriez HDR](https://theses.hal.science/tel-00785118) for ref). The contribution of the damping forcefield is already taken into account through the `computeForce` call line 126, so the `b` coefficient should be put to 0 here otherwise the behavior is not correct. . This can bee reproduced by launching the scene `examples/Component/SolidMechanics/FEM/DampingForceField.scn` and putting the data `implicit` of the damping forcefield to true. This data might have been introduced to fix this error, because here we are in an implicit scheme, and setting this parameter to true when the `b` coef is equal to 1 changes the behavior. .

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/5003:1850,Availability,failure,failures,1850,"PR adds a first implementation of the augmented lagrangian collision (see [A Surface-to-Surface Finite Element Algorithm for Large Deformation Frictional Contact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056201/pdf/bio-17-1579_081013.pdf)). . To do so, because it is very close to the classical Unilateral constraint, I've tried to factorize code by adding a virtualization layer for both the constraints and the associated contact responses (see added class BaseContactLagrangianConstraint and BaseUnilateralContactResponse). It rely on a contact param template which is the only thing that differs in term of data and of course the type of ConstraintResolution used. . An example scene is introduced in the Demo folder, simply copying the falling beam example and replacing the response by the augmented lagrangian one. . There are still one todo for the future, even if this PR is already working on its own : adding the per-contact-point penalty modulation. This should be done by going back to the collision element using the DetectionOutput.elem attribute. This allows to go back to the topology. The only unknown is how to compute the element volume when the colliding topology is mapped to the simulated one. .

All these commands take an optional path argument, defaulting to the current working directory, but we could also build / develop / run any commit / tag / branch / fork of the project with eg. `nix build github:sofa-framework/sofa`(for master) or `nix run github:nim65s/sofa/58ae0644d117aea880ed284f6cc0beb7e9802f96`. While here, this also setup some CI for this packaging, mostly to detect early:; - if anything new in the repo would break the nix packaging; - if any update from a dependency in upstream [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) would break sofa. But also, a nix binary cache can be set up with eg. https://www.cachix.org/, so that once a commit is build in CI, users & developers can directly use that cache instead of compiling themselves.; (it is also true in the other way: developers with write access to the cache can send their build result to it so that the CI will be instantaneous cache hit). Here is an example of CI build log: https://github.com/nim65s/sofa/actions/runs/11306279152/job/31446709649. PS: I did not test on macos yet, so this is probably a bit early to expect it work. It at least require darwin signatures I guess, I'll try to test that this week, when I can use an apple system. ______________________________________________________.
