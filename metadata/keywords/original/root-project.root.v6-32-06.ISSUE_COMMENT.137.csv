Unfortunately we have to reject it for the following reasons:. * This would change ROOT in a way that fundamental classes like `TGraph` are not forward compatible anymore (old versions of ROOT can't read a `TGraph` written with a newer version); * That TGraphs share data when copied is quite a drastic change that would surely disturb users; * There is already a way to change the data in a TGraph as pointed out by Axel in the previous comment; * If you want to avoid TGraph copies in your user code, please fix this on your end. That being said, feel free to implement the move constructor for TGraph and friends, if it is not already implemented (as suggested by @Axel-Naumann )! That could be useful to avoid copies, without breaking compatibility!.

I agree that the order doesn't matter, as the RooAbsArg destructor is taking care that there are no dangling pointers in the client and server list. If the ASAN build doesn't complain after merging this, the PR should also be backported to 6.26.
