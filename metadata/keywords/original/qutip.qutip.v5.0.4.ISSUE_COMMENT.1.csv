The call is `mkl_spsolve` and it is a replacement for the SUPERLU solver that comes with scipy. The mkl module is only loaded for the Anaconda and Intel Python distributions. So you will need to have an if statement to check for it.

I think maybe Rob had originally included the mkl stuff, but I took it out when I was bug fixing. Will put it in, I didn't realize it gave such a big performance boost. thats cool. I will also follow your advice and stick in a finite frequency to make sure all the solvers work. . I had a poke around in discussion forums for numpy and scipy, and it seems like the problem is that they throw an exception when they decide L is ""exactly singular"" (which technically it is). Sometimes numerical rounding errors prevent this exception, as occurs in larger systems, or adding a finite frequency, so it tries to solve it anyway and succeeds, because the projector Q on the right-hand side guarantees a solution.

The way I am thinking I could do it right now is to put an extra `equal` parameter to `plot_wigner` which would have a default value and could be used to alternate between the two behaviors (with othonormal axes and without). I'd like a feedback on the best default value, each one having its own advantages:; * I could use `equal=False` as a default value, to keep the actual behavior. Using `equal=True`, users could alternate between the two behaviors.; * I could use `equal=True` as a default value. As far as I know, in the literature, Wigner plots often have orthonormal axes, so that a coherent state is a circular blob. This has the disadvantage of breaking the current behavior and code that may rely on it.

For vectorization, he suggested OPENMP 4+ as the way to go. They have a omp for simd pragma that was suggested. However, OPENMP 4+ requires GCC 4.9+ and some corresponding LLVM version that probably makes those methods a bit too specialized for a general qutip release.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/551#issuecomment-254498919

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/551#issuecomment-254817120:545,Deployability,UPDATE,UPDATE,545,I agree that the vectorization like in the links above is not what we need for sparse operations. The links are mostly only for reference on how to work with avx2.; For us the FMA is important since it should be faster and more precise. Maybe the compiler code is not optimal in usage of the fused operation. ; In principle there should be 4 FMA operations for one line:; `dot += data[jj]*vec[ind[jj]]`; and the compiler produces them with -ffast-math and -mfma options on (as godbolt shows). Maybe some over operations around are not optimal.; UPDATE:; Correction: compiler produces only 2 FMA for the line above. The other two are from `out[row] += a*dot`,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/551#issuecomment-254817120

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/652#issuecomment-284520576:42,Deployability,install,install,42,"To get OPENMP to work on OSX one needs to install the LLVM from homebrew. However, there is a libomp clash with the OPENMP from MKL as two libraries with the same name are simultaneously initialized. I believe that this is due to the fact that the llvm has its own openmp lib, where as the MKL was compiled against a different openmp lib (perhaps from the Intel compiler as Apple's clang does not have openmp). This likely also occurs on Windows if using mingwpy. The workaround is to set; `os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK'] = 'True'`. This is not recommended at all, but seems to work fine. Perhaps we should give an unsupported warning on platforms where this issues arrises.

The next bit is to get the latex circuit visualisation for this. I will get that working as soon as I can. I guess there is not testing for that and I have to check it by trying out different plots. The next bit will be to get a list of known states and create a map so that they can be converted to a proper `Qobj`. Finally, we should have a method in `QubitCircuit` to calculate the output states, given an initial input state and add it to the circuit. But, I guess I could work on that in a different PR.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/679#issuecomment-291664172:372,Availability,Down,Download,372,Well the most naive way I can think of is to overwrite the `circuit.py` file in your local installation of qutip with this new `circuit.py` file. It is located in `qutip/qutip/qip` in your local python package installation folder. If you can't find it then you can go for a fresh install with this file. - Remove your current qutip version with a `pip uninstall qutip`; - Download the latest qutip version from the [website](qutip.org) and replace the `circuit.py` file in `qutip/qip` folder with the one from here.; - Reinstall qutip by running `python setup.py install` from your qutip folder. Of course there are better ways to do this such as pulling this branch locally and updating your qutip version.

In short, for self-consistency, you must begin with the assumption that your Hilbert space is finite, built the corresponding operators, and go from there. You would check convergence by increasing the state space size until a desired tolerance is met. Using the infinite analytic formulas are incorrect for the truncated space, but people use them a lot since they are familiar.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/683#issuecomment-292995687

The issue could be that your LaTeX file is not getting compiled as you may be missing some required packages : pdflatex, pdfcrop, pdf2svg, imagemagick (convert). Also you may be missing. \usepackage{xy}; \xyoption{matrix}; \xyoption{frame}; \xyoption{arrow}; \xyoption{arc}; \usepackage{ifpdf}. Let me help you resolve this step by step. Could you try to see what is the result of the following snippet which tries to generate the LaTeX file and display the Image. ```; %matplotlib inline; from qutip import *; from qutip.qip.circuit_latex import _latex_compile; N = 3; qc = QubitCircuit(N). qc.add_gate(""CNOT"", targets=[0], controls=[2]). latex_code = qc.latex_code(); print(latex_code). compiled_latex = _latex_compile(latex_code); print(compiled_latex). from IPython.display import Image; Image(compiled_latex, embed=True); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/702#issuecomment-307548166

The test that you do should not be looking for a RHS file as the test is time-independent. Why this only happens on Win is an interesting question. I put up a fork that may work here:. https://github.com/nonhermitian/qutip/tree/config_reset_test. Let me know how it goes. It seemed to work on my Win7 VM. It basically removes the old td files from config every time it is not needed anymore. I am not sure why we did not do this before. It still needs to be checked that the rhs_reuse setting in the Options class still works.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/728#issuecomment-317316149

I understand that the general way of doing things in QuTiP would be something like; ```python; mesolve(H, rho0, tlist, c_ops, e_ops, ..); ```; which returns a `Result` object:; ```; An instance of the class :class:`qutip.Result`, which contains; either an *array* `result.expect` of expectation values for the times; specified by `tlist`, or an *array* `result.states` of state vectors or; density matrices corresponding to the times in `tlist` [if `e_ops` is; an empty list], or nothing if a callback function was given in place of; operators for which to calculate the expectation values.; ```; So, we could probably have a new solver wrapper called `pisolve` which works as:; ```; model = Pim(N, emmision, pumping); pisolve(model, rho0, tlist, ...); ```; The Hamiltonian does not change here I think, so instead of passing that, the user could pass an instance of a Pim object describing the particular system (N, emission, ...) and this new solver could return a `Result` object. I will discuss this with @nathanshammah and get back on how we can have the API similar to the other QuTiP solvers as this is slightly different from the standard master equation solving.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/753#issuecomment-332424552
https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/753#issuecomment-332725530:870,Performance,perform,perform,870,"A few points which came up:. - We can make the solve call very similar to `mesolve` where the user specifies a Hamiltonian, the coefficients describing the system and the size of the system as an argument dictionary. ```; system = {""N"": 100, ""emmission"": 0.5, ""loss"": 0.1}; pisolve(H, tlist, c_ops, e_ops, args=system); ```; - However this only works for Hamiltonians constructed with some specific operators. As the method is for dicke states only, the distinction between this solver and `mesolve` should be stated clearly. This is to prevent someone trying to pass a generic Hamiltonian. - Checks have to be included to make sure that the Hamiltonian and the operators specified are proper for the dicke states. - Since the user will not be concerned with the matrix M which governs the evolution `dp/dt = Mp`, we should probably find better ways to represent it and perform the dot product to generate RHS. @nonhermitian We have the M matrix as a pure dictionary of {(row, col): val}.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/753#issuecomment-332725530:517,Usability,clear,clearly,517,"A few points which came up:. - We can make the solve call very similar to `mesolve` where the user specifies a Hamiltonian, the coefficients describing the system and the size of the system as an argument dictionary. ```; system = {""N"": 100, ""emmission"": 0.5, ""loss"": 0.1}; pisolve(H, tlist, c_ops, e_ops, args=system); ```; - However this only works for Hamiltonians constructed with some specific operators. As the method is for dicke states only, the distinction between this solver and `mesolve` should be stated clearly. This is to prevent someone trying to pass a generic Hamiltonian. - Checks have to be included to make sure that the Hamiltonian and the operators specified are proper for the dicke states. - Since the user will not be concerned with the matrix M which governs the evolution `dp/dt = Mp`, we should probably find better ways to represent it and perform the dot product to generate RHS. @nonhermitian We have the M matrix as a pure dictionary of {(row, col): val}. We can write our own function for the dot product just by using this dictionary. Or, is it better to convert it into a sparse matrix and use Scipy's dot product function ?

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/753#issuecomment-360766438:356,Performance,optimiz,optimize,356,This is ready to be reviewed and added to QuTiP. Notebooks are in : https://github.com/nathanshammah/piqs/blob/master/notebooks/notebook_piqs.ipynb. One would need to change the import statement to `from qutip.models.dicke import *`. Perhaps some more testing could be done for the states and operators but I want to get this merged first before trying to optimize. The Liouvillian created here works with QuTiP's solver (thanks to Neill's suggestion). Thus one can easily work with ensembles of spins or even ensembles coupled to bosonic cavities and take full advantage of QuTiP machinery. We have an optimized solver for diagonal Hamiltonians which is faster and perhaps there is a scope to make this even faster with the correct RHS calculation.

I played with Gamma as well as with the number of time steps. Nothing helped. As I already mentioned in the previous post even setting Gamma to zero doesn't help. What I noticed though if I change the factor within the tanh function from 100 to 90 it works again. It's really weird, since it worked with factor 100 in the case of two two level atoms but not for two three level atoms even after increasing the number of time steps by a factor of 20.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/771#issuecomment-338362826:966,Integrability,depend,depend,966,"I quickly ran the problem, and it is still the slope is too large. Going from 100->50 in tanh resolves the issue. In order to look like a step pulse, you want the rate of change of the pulse to be much higher than the system time-scales. In your case, the system is on the time-scale of O(1), while, for tanh(100) the rate is ~60 at front and back, where as for tanh(50), it is ~30. In both cases, your system will see an effective step pulse. . My thinking is that if the argument of tanh is too large, then there is a big separation of time-scales in the problem. The ODE solver is trying to capture both the slow system dynamics, and the rapid step terms, and it is finding it difficult. This is a common issue with multiple, wide-ranging time scales. > On Oct 20, 2017, at 21:44, nlphysics <notifications@github.com> wrote:; > ; > Thanks. It's not that urgent.

Yes, I agree. But I was trying to just work out a simple problem which looks like. `dp[n]/dt = spre(Q)*p[n-1] + spost(Q)*p[n+1]. where p is a list of flattened density matrices. I understand that a better version of this would be to completely flatten p and write the RHS as a large `L` as Alex points out and then use `cy_ode_rhs`. But here is the issue, in the HEOM case, building `L` runs out of memory if we consider a large size for the set of auxiliary density matrices `p`. As such, I cannot completely build the `L` for the cases I am looking into. The approach that I was trying to take was to keep building the p's as we integrate. In this case, each RHS computation is a small dense matrix-vector computation and I can choose to keep or discard it depending on the max value of its elements. This gives the flexibility to truncate how many auxiliary density matrices I keep. The motivation is that in some papers on the Heom method, there is a dynamic filtering of the auxiliary matrices and it has been shown that with just a few 100s of auxiliary matrices, you can get a reasonable result. But the way we have the code in QuTiP now pre-computes the `L` and gets stuck due to memory limitations. @agpitch Thanks for the suggestions. I am trying to make the HEOM work without building the `L`. Perhaps I will still run into memory issues if I try to initialize the full set of `p` but if the dynamic filtering approach works out, then I can escape the memory problem by only building a few of the `p`'s and deciding to append them or not based on some conditions.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/831#issuecomment-368980965

Yes, I agree. But I was trying to just work out a simple problem which looks like. `dp[n]/dt = spre(Q)*p[n-1] + spost(Q)*p[n+1]. where p is a list of flattened density matrices. I understand that a better version of this would be to completely flatten p and write the RHS as a large `L` as Alex points out and then use `cy_ode_rhs`. But here is the issue, in the HEOM case, building `L` runs out of memory if we consider a large size for the set of auxiliary density matrices `p`. As such, I cannot completely build the `L` for the cases I am looking into. The approach that I was trying to take was to keep building the p's as we integrate. In this case, each RHS computation is a small dense matrix-vector computation and I can choose to keep or discard it depending on the max value of its elements. This gives the flexibility to truncate how many auxiliary density matrices I keep.

If the density matrices are mostly sparse, then there might be some benefit of having a ODE solver with sparse vector.

Examples could include a `temporal_basis` function which could enumerate all `temporal_basis_vector`s for a given configuration of waveguides and list of times, or a `to_ndarray` function which could create an n-dimensional numpy array containing the projections of the computed scattered state onto appropriate basis vectors. **Cons:**; - Making this a class seems to be at odds with the general style that QuTiP is coded in. In physics-related modules which users regularly interact with, QuTiP seems to reserve classes exclusively for physical things, like states and operators, instead using functions to represent physics calculations which can be done with these objects.

I generally agree with @sahmed95 that refactoring this (and many other QuTiP modules) into a more object-oriented class-based structure would be healthy for the ongoing development of QuTiP. . I began rewriting this module into a class this morning, but as I started coding, I realized that this does introduce one major complication which could limit usefulness, which is that class methods do not play well with Python multithreading/multiprocessing. If you look in the example notebook in [my `qutip-notebooks` PR](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks/pull/58), there are several instances where I create a 1- or 2-line helper function to multiprocess a parameter search of `scattering_probability` using `multiprocessing.pool.starmap`. . In my experience, implementing a parallelized parameter search will be much more difficult to do if `scattering_probability` is changed to become a class method. There are some [hacky workarounds to this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27318290/why-can-i-pass-an-instance-method-to-multiprocessing-process-but-not-a-multipro), but these add extra overhead to implementing multiprocessing and don't work with methods that are not functionally static. .

In my experience, implementing a parallelized parameter search will be much more difficult to do if `scattering_probability` is changed to become a class method. There are some [hacky workarounds to this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27318290/why-can-i-pass-an-instance-method-to-multiprocessing-process-but-not-a-multipro), but these add extra overhead to implementing multiprocessing and don't work with methods that are not functionally static. . Given that these scattering calculations are among the most computationally expensive in QuTiP, I don't think that making parallelism more difficult to work with is a direction we should go in. I am confident that, with significant effort, I can make a clean and parallelized way to perform a parameter search in a class-based version of this module; however, this will take some time, especially given that developing this module is no longer my primary research focus in grad school.

I have experience a similar problem when I tried to use MP with the control modules. Because there are back references to objects in the hierarchy it copied the whole object tree into memory for each process, which was hopelessly memory inefficient. It is one of the main reasons I am (slowly) work on a new implementation of the control modules. I did play around a bit and got something to work, but *I did not try Python 2*. Maybe we should consider dropping Python 2.x support in QuTiP v5? It's possible that new versions of Python 2.7 have resolved the instance method pickling issue.

But #437 makes a good point about using full storage. I'd add to that the [Lapack banded storage format](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/node124.html) which is extremely efficient for diagonal or tri-diagonal operators (or scipy's [DIA](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.dia_matrix.html#scipy.sparse.dia_matrix), which I think is mostly equivalent). I've actually had to solve the equivalent problem of allowing multiple internal formats in the [Fortran QDYN package](https://www.qdyn-library.net), so I'm not sure why I didn't think of that in the first place ;-). I can definitely vouch for the efficiency gained by being able to switch internal sparse representations. So yeah, you'd definitely have the most flexible solution by allowing `Qobj.data` to use varying storage classes from object to object. Maybe the ""protocol"" could be for `Qobj.data` to be any subclass of the [scipy `spmatrix` base class]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.spmatrix.html#scipy.sparse.spmatrix)? Then the `Qobj` constructor would probably need an additional parameter `format` for the class that should be used to convert the `inpt` argument to the `data` attribute. The onus would then be on Scipy to provide a full matrix that is a subtype of `scipy.spmatrix` (just to keep the interface contract), and also to have `int64` versions of all their existing sparse classes. From a community standpoint, it would seem like one would get much more bang for the buck to have this problem solved inside SciPy, instead of doing a lot of low-level stuff in QuTiP -- at least if they're amenable to pull requests, but worst case you can still define necessary new `scipy.spmatrix` subclasses externally.

I've actually had to solve the equivalent problem of allowing multiple internal formats in the [Fortran QDYN package](https://www.qdyn-library.net), so I'm not sure why I didn't think of that in the first place ;-). I can definitely vouch for the efficiency gained by being able to switch internal sparse representations. So yeah, you'd definitely have the most flexible solution by allowing `Qobj.data` to use varying storage classes from object to object. Maybe the ""protocol"" could be for `Qobj.data` to be any subclass of the [scipy `spmatrix` base class]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.spmatrix.html#scipy.sparse.spmatrix)? Then the `Qobj` constructor would probably need an additional parameter `format` for the class that should be used to convert the `inpt` argument to the `data` attribute. The onus would then be on Scipy to provide a full matrix that is a subtype of `scipy.spmatrix` (just to keep the interface contract), and also to have `int64` versions of all their existing sparse classes. From a community standpoint, it would seem like one would get much more bang for the buck to have this problem solved inside SciPy, instead of doing a lot of low-level stuff in QuTiP -- at least if they're amenable to pull requests, but worst case you can still define necessary new `scipy.spmatrix` subclasses externally.

That being said, I wonder whether the use of sparse matrices in QuTiP could be encapsulated completely, allowing do drop in arbitrary (external) sparse-matrix implementations. Importing the desired implementation could happen dynamically at import-time. This would allow to use `int32`, `int64`, or infinite `bigint` implementations (if any exist), as well as allowing to switch between pure-python implementations and the standard cython-optimized ones.

Update all packages and conda by running. ```; conda update --all; ```; and then trying to reinstall qutip from the default conda repo (and not conda-forge) with. ```; conda install qutip; ```. 2. Add the conda-forge channel as priority with . ```; conda config --add channels conda-forge; ```; and then update all with; ```; conda update --all; ```; and finally installing qutip with. ```; conda install -c conda-forge qutip; ```. The last option would be to uninstall conda, install the latest Miniconda which does not install any package by default and then installing qutip from the conda-forge version with; ```; conda install -c conda-forge qutip; ```. All three suggestions should just take a couple of minutes. If you could tell me the Anaconda version, it would be very helpful (```conda --version```)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/860#issuecomment-387719222

The way it stands, it also depends on [Eigen C++ header library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), but it should be easy to remove this dependency as it is only used to specify the input matrices. Other minor dependencies are easily removed.

By my rough tests, failure only occurs with any regularity when using `cvxpy` with operator inputs (not supers) of dimension 3 (not 2). I also find that using `dnorm(A, B)` with `A` and `B` drawn from `rand_unitary_haar` has a failure rate of 0.004(1), whereas drawing from `rand_unitary` instead has a failure rate about 3 times higher of 0.012(2). I'm sure if you have more (i.e. > 0) knowledge of the Haar measure than I do, that presumably gives you more information on what makes it likely for the optimisation to fail. Also, using `dnorm(A)` (i.e. taking `B` to be 0) produced no failures in 4000 tests of the same function. ## Testing strategy. Since each `dnorm` test is repeated 10 times and there's only one offending test, that's a current failure rate of about 4%.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/874#issuecomment-634292336:1419,Testability,Assert,AssertionError,1419,"Bumping this because I'm working on `test_metrics.py` and came across it. ## Attempting to isolate. With `cvxpy` and `cvxopt` from conda-forge, I can run all the `dnorm` tests, but as before (see #874, #880, #881) they fail too much of the time. By my rough tests, failure only occurs with any regularity when using `cvxpy` with operator inputs (not supers) of dimension 3 (not 2). I also find that using `dnorm(A, B)` with `A` and `B` drawn from `rand_unitary_haar` has a failure rate of 0.004(1), whereas drawing from `rand_unitary` instead has a failure rate about 3 times higher of 0.012(2). I'm sure if you have more (i.e. > 0) knowledge of the Haar measure than I do, that presumably gives you more information on what makes it likely for the optimisation to fail. Also, using `dnorm(A)` (i.e. taking `B` to be 0) produced no failures in 4000 tests of the same function. ## Testing strategy. Since each `dnorm` test is repeated 10 times and there's only one offending test, that's a current failure rate of about 4%. The offending test actually isn't even testing what it's supposed to test - it supposedly tests that special cases that are handled by QuTiP agree with the optimisations done by `cvxpy`, except that the offender isn't a handled special case. I'll remove that for now. I will also convert `dnorm` tests to quietly xfail if the optimisation fails, but cause a suite failure if they cause a proper `AssertionError`. ## Future. Since we have a new major version in the future, we do have the option to issue a `FutureWarning` and remove `dnorm` if we want to do so, but if so, we should get the warning out as soon as possible. It's probably worth mentioning that by-and-large, it seems like `dnorm` does actually work in most cases. > This has been the final straw. We have tried to keep dnorm supported. - @ajgpitch .

I cannot replicate the error on my end, the calibration takes only about a second for me.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/947#issuecomment-462591342:279,Availability,error,error,279,"`QobjEvo` have a `with_state` method `QobjEvo.with_state(t, psi, args={})` which can be used instead of `__call__` if needed. It compute the coefficient on the python side and send them to the cython part if needed.

It was a bit difficult to understand how to setup the solver to use this feature. I kind of got it to work and have a nice example that I can make into a tutorial. Will post soon. But we should definitely write some documentation about it both in the Qobj evo part, options section as well as mesolve. Is there an agreement on how this should be handled? Are we happy with passing it as an ""args""? I still am not sure why I have to use the ""state_as_Qobj=Qobj"" key in the args initialization to get this working. .

Without this low level optimization, we are essentially doing the same thing as scipy so should get similar times.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/949#issuecomment-463470158

Propagator uses the `t` as a list the same way `tlist` is used by `sesovle` or `mesolve` and those solver support continuing an evolution:; ```; H = [op1, [op2, f]]; res1 = qutip.sesolve(H, psi0, tlist=[0,1,2,3,4]); res2 = qutip.sesolve(H, res1.states[-1], tlist=[4,5,3,7,8]); ```; So if `tlist` is a list with one element, it does no evolution and the propagator is 1 (`qeye`). If you were to compute propagators with `tlist` with 3 or more elements, you would receive a list of propagator and the first one would always be 1. I am not sure where or if it is documented that evolution starts at the first element of the list of time, not at zero.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/950#issuecomment-463583335:1013,Availability,avail,available,1013,"Hi,. Thanks for digging into this! Given the docstring of `qutip.propagator`, this behavior was unexpected for me https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/propagator.py#L62-L76. Changing the propagator to consider a list with a single element as a single float value (`[t]` would be the same as `t`) would break the current API and could eventually break some scripts built using QuTiP and using the fact that `qutip.propagator` of `[t]` gives identity. The best way to fix this would probably be to edit the docstring to emphasize the expected behavior for a single `t` value and for a list of times. P.S.: Not directly related to this issue but when looking for QuTiP doc on search engines, it often sends to documentation for old versions of QuTiP. Typically http://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/apidoc/functions.html#module-qutip.propagator. What about putting a banner on these legacy documentations online stating that ""You are reading the documentation of an older version of QuTiP.

I was able to rebuild the image for 4.6 without the pain being _too_ excruciating, but it was a very manual process. In qutip/qutip-doc#137 I completely rewrote the `qutip-structure.py` file to map out arbitrary Python packages by importing it (not ideal if you're running it on untrusted code, but I assume we trust `qutip`!) and recursing through every known name and reference. That fixes the concerns people had above about the structure; you can see in the latest version of the docs that the visualisation isn't just a single layer any more. Right now, the main issue is getting `d3.js` to give us a proper image file without running it through an entire browser. If we're commited to using `d3.js`, then the right solution is presumably to use Node in CI with a small JS wrapper to dump out the correct SVG file. However, the new `qutip-structure.py` produces a pretty standard `dict`-tree representation of every name in the package and its parent, so it'd probably not be too difficult to use a Python visualisation package to do it for us.

Number one: Travis is [changing its pricing model for open source software](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing), and generally it seems like [it's going to become unfeasible for us](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/travis-cis-new-pricing-plan-threw-wrench-my-open-source-works). Over the past month or so, queue times on Linux builds have increased massively (from near-instant to up to 90 minutes), and the number of allowed concurrent builds has already limited the amount of testing we are able to do - we don't even have Windows tests because we couldn't fit them in. In around March 2021 we expect the old travis-ci.org that QuTiP is grandfathered onto to shut down completely, forcing us onto the new model on travis-ci.com. Number two: in November 2019, GitHub released their own CI, GitHub Actions. This is (as best as I can tell) completely free for open source, public repositories like QuTiP, and offers access to a large number of Linux, macOS and Windows containers. This completely free period of GitHub Actions might not last forever (you can imagine maybe they're just trying to drive adoption before increasing the cost), but especially with the new time pressure from Travis, this seems like the right choice for now. Our testing set up is fairly straightforward, so migrating to a new CI shouldn't be too difficult. I just wrote (#1429) a GitHub Actions workflow to build and distribute binary releases of QuTiP on Linux/Mac/Windows, and I'm pretty convinced by the power of their CI. It's got an awful lot of flexibility with a _lot_ of customisation so its initial learning curve is a little steep (or maybe I'm just not used to CI tools), but I'm impressed by what's available.

Over the past month or so, queue times on Linux builds have increased massively (from near-instant to up to 90 minutes), and the number of allowed concurrent builds has already limited the amount of testing we are able to do - we don't even have Windows tests because we couldn't fit them in.

This is (as best as I can tell) completely free for open source, public repositories like QuTiP, and offers access to a large number of Linux, macOS and Windows containers.

We have a special `HSolverUnderdampedBrownian` and I compare it with the more general `Heom` which takes in some ck and vk and gives the same results. For fun, I try to reproduce some plot from the paper where we see the effect of having the Matsubara terms in the picture vs removing them. I need to do more testing and re-factoring but we can start thinking of a more general `Heom` class now.
