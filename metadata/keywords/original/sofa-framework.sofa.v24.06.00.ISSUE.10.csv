Create the TopologyHandler at component init (internally through the TopologyData creation). ; 2. The TopologyHandler register itselft into the TopologyContainer to be able to receive topological events.; 3. When the simulation graph is destroyed, TopologyHandler is deleted and TopologyContainer is cleared. ### Limitation/Bug; Scenario like using the mouse picking is creating a temporary Node with springFF or attachedConstraint component which is creating a TopologyHandler. When the mouse is released the Node is destroyed, deleting the components and the TopologyHandler as well. ; But the TopologyHandler is not properly removed from the dynamic topologyContainer list of TopologyHandler. This is why in issue #3370 the scene crash as soon as a vertex is removed because the TopologyContainer is sending the POINTREMOVED event to all topologyHandler registered.

Falling back to the first compatible template: 'float'.; [DEPRECATED] [ContactIsolatingDOFBlock(ContactMethod)] The deprecated template 'float' has been replaced by f.; ```. Should I replace the template `float` by `sofa::defaulttype::DataTypeName<float>`? But in this case, I cannot get the `Real` (which should be float).

The initial PR purpose was to change the default behaviour of the `getValuePtr` methods from; ```; return &data[0];; ```; (which may lead to problems when dealing with an empty vector), to :; ```; return data.data();; ```. I found this behaviour in two other 'type info' files: `TypeInfo_Text.h` and `FixedArrayTypeInfo.h`, but I couldn't apply the same fix to `FixedArrayTypeInfo`, which involves, at some point, `RigidCoord` and `RigidDeriv` data (which don't have a `.data()` method), leading to this error at build:; ```; FixedArrayTypeInfo.h:195:21: error: ‘const DataType’ {aka ‘const class sofa::defaulttype::RigidDeriv<2, double>’} has no member named ‘data’; 195 | return data.data();; | ~~~~~^~~~; ```. I guess it would be a good thing to remove all occurrences of this kind of `&data[0]` in the code, but I'm not sure I will find the time to investigate on what would be a proper replacement for `TypeInfo_FixedArray.h`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/3511
