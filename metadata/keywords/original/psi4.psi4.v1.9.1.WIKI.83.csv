Introduction¶; The steep polynomial scaling (in both time and memory) of post-HF dynamic; correlation methods prohibits calculations on large systems, even for efficient; codes like PSI4‘s DF-MP2. This poor scaling is in part; due to the use of canonical HF orbitals, which are entirely delocalized across; the molecule. Canonical orbitals are commonly used because of mathematical; convenience. Another possible choice is localized orbitals. Any two orbitals; localized to separate regions of a molecule can be treated as non-interacting; to a good approximation. Thus, when working with localized orbitals, the number; of interacting orbital pairs (and triples, quadruples, etc.) scales linearly; with system size. If carefully implemented, programs that exploit this sparsity; can be made to scale linearly (or else with lower order than their canonical; counterparts) at the cost of of modest, controllable errors. This is the; defining insight of DLPNO-MP2 and all related “local correlation” methods.; The DLPNO-MP2 code is a linear-scaling alternative to the DF-MP2; code, and is intended for use with large systems for which DF-MP2 is intractable.; When running DLPNO-MP2 with default settings, approximately 99.9% of the DF-MP2; correlation energy is recovered.

Thus, when working with localized orbitals, the number; of interacting orbital pairs (and triples, quadruples, etc.) scales linearly; with system size. If carefully implemented, programs that exploit this sparsity; can be made to scale linearly (or else with lower order than their canonical; counterparts) at the cost of of modest, controllable errors. This is the; defining insight of DLPNO-MP2 and all related “local correlation” methods.; The DLPNO-MP2 code is a linear-scaling alternative to the DF-MP2; code, and is intended for use with large systems for which DF-MP2 is intractable.; When running DLPNO-MP2 with default settings, approximately 99.9% of the DF-MP2; correlation energy is recovered. The general outline of the method is as follows:. Localize the active occupied MOs (with the Foster-Boys method); Construct projected AOs (PAOs) from the virtual MOs; Calculate three-index integrals in the (sparse) LMO/PAO basis; Perform local density fitting to construct (sparse) exchange integrals; Transform local virtuals from PAOs to pair natural orbitals (PNOs), and truncate; Solve the iterative local MP2 equations in the LMO/PNO basis. An example input file is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c1; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set scf_type df; set freeze_core True; set pno_convergence normal. energy('dlpno-mp2'). The main difference between this input and a DF-MP2 input is the energy('dlpno-mp2'); call to energy(). The only other addition is the PNO_CONVERGENCE; keyword, which determines the accuracy of the local approximations underlying; the DLPNO-MP2 method. Note that the water molecule in this example is not large; enough for DLPNO",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/dlpnomp2.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/dlpnomp2.html

Updating the PSI4 Users’ and Programmers’ Manual¶; PSI4‘s documentation is generated by Sphinx; and lives in psi4/doc/sphinxman. It is available online at; http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/index.html; for the latest development branch. Installing Sphinx¶; Installing Sphinx is only necessary to build the documentation; yourself, locally. The docs are served from; from psicode, so most users and developers won’t need Sphinx; installed. Nevertheless, installation is easy.; Math is rendered through MathJax, so LaTeX and dvipng are no longer needed.; The sphinx executable should be in your path at CMake configure time for; documentation targets to be available.

Documentation Structure¶; Sphinx has nice capabilities for extracting docstrings from python files,; presenting both auto-generated and narrative documentation in the same; format, hyperlinking within and to external websites, and generating; documentation in different formats from the same source. PSI4‘s; documentation is a unified document covering information for both users; and programmers in separate sections.

LibECPInt is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS.; If using the PSI4 binary, LibECPInt has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; LibECPInt can be obtained through conda install libecpint.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_ecpint,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect LibECPInt and activate dependent code.; To remove a conda installation, conda remove libecpint. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want LibECPInt built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_ecpint,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code. How to configure LibECPInt for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, LibECPInt is a library that provides additional; quantum chemical capabilities (ECP integrals).; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) LibECPInt; Upstream Dependencies — LibECPInt \(\Leftarrow\) None.

Elementary Restart¶; The PSI4 intermediate files use the following naming scheme; psi.PID.name.filenumber. where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content.; For those modules providing restart capabilities, the previous file can; be provided through the``restart_file`` option; energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber'). Only the filenumber is necessary for the driver to appropriately rename the; file and copy it to the scratch directory where PSI4 will expect it.; The restart capabilities of a specific method (if any) are found in that method’s documentation.; To provide multiple files, pass them as arguments of a Python list; energy('scf',restart_file=['./file1.filenumber','./file2.filenumber']). Note that the restart_file options is only available for energy procedures as of now.; Executing PSI4 with the psi4 -m (for; messy) flag will prevent files being deleted at the end of the run:; psi4 -m. The mechanism for restarting HF/DFT calculations is described in details here. Saving the Wavefunction¶; A core object of PSI4 is the Wavefunction (short wfn) object; energy, wfn = energy('scf',return_wfn=True). This C++/Python object (psi4.core.Wavefunction) contains orbital; data, basis set information, result variables and more.; It can be saved either to a numpy file or converted to a python dictionary; # write the wavefunction to file; wfn.to_file('my_wfn'). # alternatively store the dict representation of the wavefunction in memory; wfn_dict = wfn.to_file(). In either form, its attributes can be set and edited.; This is an expert-level feature, though.; In general, let PSI4 create the Wavefunction, then treat it as read-only.; The back conversion to a Wavefunction object uses the .from_file() functionality; # read wavefun",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/external.html

Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables. Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1, 5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy(""scf/cc-pvdz""). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/external.html

This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

And then to clean up the scratch directories previously created:; foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Removing scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; end. Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; Each set of three commands below is completely equivalent, while the second set,; perhaps, is the most common usage.; >>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in; >>> psi4 -i descriptive_filename.in -o descriptive_filename.out; >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out. Command-line arguments to PSI4 can be accessed through psi4 --help. -a, --append¶; Append results to output file. Default: Truncate first. -h, --help¶; Display the command-line options and usage information. -i <filename>, --input <filename>¶; Input file name.

Can either be JSON or MessagePack input. -s <name>, --scratch <name>¶; This overrides the value of PSI_SCRATCH and provides; a path to the location of scratch files. -t <subset>, --test <subset>¶; Runs pytest tests.

Environment Variables¶; These environment variables will influence PSI4‘s behavior. CONDA_PREFIX¶; Set when a conda environment is activated. Note that if PSI4 has been; built against any library in CONDA_PREFIX, the path has been baked into the; program, so any available dependencies are liable to been loaded from the environment. HOST¶; Set when a conda environment with conda compilers is activated. Used; when compatibly building PSI4 from source against conda; dependencies. MKL_NUM_THREADS¶; Number of threads to use by operations with Intel threaded BLAS libraries. OMP_NESTED¶; Do access nested DGEMM in OpenMP sections in DFMP2 for multi-socket; platforms. This is very low-level access to OpenMP functions for; experienced programmers. Users should leave this variable unset or set; to False. OMP_NUM_THREADS¶; Number of threads to use by modules with OpenMP threading. PATH¶; Path for interfaced executables. Note; While once configuring PSI4 through PSIPATH was preferred; to modifying this environment variable, now PATH is preferred for; executables to accommodate QCEngine.

PSI_SCRATCH¶; Directory where scratch files are written. Overrides settings in ~/.psi4rc.; It is very important to ensure that PSI4 is writing its scratch files; to a disk drive physically attached to the computer running the computation.; If it is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; Modify PSI_SCRATCH through normal Linux shell commands before invoking psi4; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /scratch/user. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/scratch/user. PSIPATH¶; Path in which PSI4 looks for user extensions to the built-in; libraries. Specifically, directories containing; user basis sets,; EFP fragments,; databases,; plugins, and; interfaced executables (; dmrcc for MRCC and; dftd3 for DFTD3; ) should be placed in this colon-separated list.; PSI4 is designed so that user extensions that are findable through; PSIPATH can be used in input files entirely like their; built-in counterparts, without additional tagging as non-standard.; The typical search path is first the built-in libraries, next each; PSIPATH directory in order, and finally the execution; directory (I won’t swear everything tacks on the execution directory).; Path",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/external.html

PSIDATADIR¶; Path in which the PSI4 executable looks for its non-compiled; dependencies (i.e., basis sets, databases, quadratures, etc.).; This path is always known by the PSI4 program or shared library,; so this variable is relevant primarily to developers wanting a; non-standard location.

Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables. PBS job file¶; To run a PSI4 job on a PBS queueing system, you need to properly set up; all necessary variables in the PBS job file. Below is a minimal example of; a PBS job file for a threaded job, and a short explanation for each section.; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR; setenv myscratch /scratch/user/psi4.$PBS_JOBID. foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Creating scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; ssh $i mkdir -p $myscratch; end. unsetenv PSIDATADIR; setenv PSI_SCRATCH $myscratch; if !

The top section features PBS-specific commands. These depend on the; specific characteristics of your PBS queuing system but they may include:; #!/bin/tcsh; #PBS -j oe; #PBS -l pmem=2120mb; #PBS -N jobname; #PBS -V. The PBS -j oe option instructs PBS to write any output or error message; from the queuing system in dedicated files. PBS -l pmem=2120mb requests; 2120 MB of memory for each thread on the node. The total memory requested for; the job by PBS should generally be slightly greater than what indicated; in the input file (see memory setting).; Then, we move to the working directory using PBS variable $PBS_O_WORKDIR and; we create scratch directories on every node, using the $PBS_NODEFILE which; points to a file conta",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/external.html

The next section is very important as it sets the environment variables needed; by PSI4:; unsetenv PSIDATADIR; setenv PSI_SCRATCH $myscratch; if ! ( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/external/modules:${PSIPATH}; setenv PSIPATH /path/to/python/modules:${PSIPATH}. PSIDATADIR does not need to be set.; In the present example we unset it to make sure it does not interfere with the internal location-finding.; PSIPATH is needed only if you are using external modules or; plugins in PSI4 and should point to the directories where they can be found. In the; present example, we make sure the variable is set with if ! ( $?PSIPATH ) setenv PSIPATH """"; before adding more paths to it. Finally, PSI_SCRATCH should point to a fast, existing; local disk for temporary file storage. To use 4 threads for OpenMP parallelization; and threaded BLAS (see section Threading), we set -n4 below.; The next step is then to actually run the computation:; /psi/install/directory/bin/psi4 -i input.in -o input.out -n 4. And then to clean up the scratch directories previously created:; foreach i (`sort $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`); echo ""Removing scratch directory "" $myscratch "" on "" $i; ssh $i rm -rf $myscratch; end. Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; Each set of three commands below is completely equivalent, while the second set,; perhaps, is the most common usage.; >>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in; >>> psi4 -i descriptive_filename.in -o descriptive_filename.out; >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/external.html

Deprecated since version 1.1: Environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS; do not affect threading in PSI4. (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads. Note that is is not available for PsiAPI mode of operation.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1, 5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy(""scf/cc-pvdz""). In PsiAPI mode of operation, this syntax, psi4.set_num_threads(nthread), is; the primary way to control threading.; (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

Scratch Files¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell PSI4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like PSI4 can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; physically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or through the ~/.psi4rc file; (see section ~/.psi4rc File). Most of the time, PSI_SCRATCH; is preferred, and it overrides any existing ~/.psi4rc setting. You can set up; PSI_SCRATCH by issuing the following commands in a terminal,; or including them in the appropriate rc file.; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files.

PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 12; contains information about the internal coordiantes of a geometry optimization.; The user may want to retain this in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) to analyze the optimization.

All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to your input; file:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 12; contains information about the internal coordiantes of a geometry optimization.; The user may want to retain this in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) to analyze the optimization.

The mechanism for restarting HF/DFT calculations is described in details here. Saving the Wavefunction¶; A core object of PSI4 is the Wavefunction (short wfn) object; energy, wfn = energy('scf',return_wfn=True). This C++/Python object (psi4.core.Wavefunction) contains orbital; data, basis set information, result variables and more.; It can be saved either to a numpy file or converted to a python dictionary; # write the wavefunction to file; wfn.to_file('my_wfn'). # alternatively store the dict representation of the wavefunction in memory; wfn_dict = wfn.to_file(). In either form, its attributes can be set and edited.; This is an expert-level feature, though.; In general, let PSI4 create the Wavefunction, then treat it as read-only.; The back conversion to a Wavefunction object uses the .from_file() functionality; # read wavefunction from file; wfn_from_file = psi4.core.Wavefunction.from_file('my_wfn'). # make a wavefunction from the dict; wfn_from_dict = psi4.core.Wavefunction.from_file(wfn_dict). ~/.psi4rc File¶.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; std::thread for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model.

Note again that the specific commands for your PBS system may differ. Refer; to your system administrator. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; Each set of three commands below is completely equivalent, while the second set,; perhaps, is the most common usage.; >>> psi4; >>> psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in; >>> psi4 -i descriptive_filename.in -o descriptive_filename.out; >>> psi4 descriptive_filename.in descriptive_filename.out. Command-line arguments to PSI4 can be accessed through psi4 --help. -a, --append¶; Append results to output file. Default: Truncate first. -h, --help¶; Display the command-line options and usage information. -i <filename>, --input <filename>¶; Input file name. Default: input.dat. --inplace¶; Runs PSI4 with compiled code from <objdir> but driver code from source,; so no need to make between Python edits.

A guide to the contents of individual scratch files may be found at PSIOH Intermediate Files.; To circumvent difficulties with running multiple jobs in the same scratch, the; process ID (PID) of the PSI4 instance is incorporated into the full file; name; therefore, it is safe to use the same scratch directory for calculations; running simultaneously. Elementary Restart¶; The PSI4 intermediate files use the following naming scheme; psi.PID.name.filenumber. where by default, PID is the process number, name the name of the molecule,; and filenumber is listed in content.; For those modules providing restart capabilities, the previous file can; be provided through the``restart_file`` option; energy('scf',restart_file='./psi.PID.name.filenumber').

Interface to programs through FCHK files — fchk()¶; Code author: Andrew C. Simmonett; Section author: Andrew C. Simmonett; Many post-processing tools can read information from Gaussian’s formatted; checkpoint (FCHK) files.; To allow interoperability with such tools, PSI4 includes a utility to; generate FCHK files. Wavefunction information, such as orbitals, densities,; orbital energies and basis set information is currently supported, but geometry; optimization and vibrational frequency information are not supported at this; time. To generate a FCHK file, simply store the wavefunction from the energy; calculation, and hand it to the fchk driver function:; energy, wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True); fchk(wfn,'output.fchk'). The file will be written to the name passed to the fchk function.; Note that for MP2 and CCSD methods, the energy can be computed without; the expensive steps required to compute the density, so energy calls for these; methods will return a wavefunction that has the Hartree–Fock density. If a; density is required for these methods, the user should instead request a; gradient computation, to ensure that the density is updated appropriately:; grad, wfn = gradient('mp2', return_wfn=True); fchk(wfn,'output.fchk'). psi4.fchk(wfn, filename, *, debug=False, strict_label=True)[source]; Function to write wavefunction information in wfn to filename in; Gaussian FCHK format. Added in version 0.6. Returns:; None. Parameters:. wfn (Wavefunction) – set of molecule, basis, orbitals from which to generate fchk file; filename (str) – destination file name for FCHK file; debug (bool) – returns a dictionary to aid with debugging; strict_label (bool) – If true set a density label compliant with what Gaussian would write.

Ed’s code uses the -RI; basis sets for all SAPT terms, which can be problematic for heavy elements.; As such, Ed’s SAPT0 code will yield slightly different results than FISAPT.

F/I-SAPT: Functional Group and/or Intramolecular SAPT¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103]. There is also a reasonably-detailed; review of the aims of A/F/I-SAPT and the existing state-of-the-art in the field; in the introduction chapter on partitioned SAPT methods in Parrish’s thesis.; The scripts discussed below are located in psi4/psi4/share/psi4/fsapt.

Briefly, the interaction between the point charges in A(B); and fragment B(A) enters the SAPT0 interaction energy. It explicitly affects the electrostatics; and induction components, and implicitly affects other SAPT0 components by polarizing the orbitals.; If point charges are present in both subsystems A and B, an additional charge-charge interaction; term is also added to the electrostatic energy. When point charges are assigned to subsystem C, the point; charges in C only polarize the orbitals in both fragment A and B. However, the presence of charges in C does not; directly contribute to the SAPT0 interaction energy.; Examples fsapt-ext-abc and fsapt-ext-abc2; illustrate the use of point charges in F/I-SAPT procedure. Link Orbital Partitioning in I-SAPT¶; The assignment of the A-C and B-C linking electron pairs is controlled by the FISAPT_LINK_ASSIGNMENT; keyword. The default setting fisapt_link_assignment c assigns the entire pair to the linker C together with; a +1 nuclear charge from the connecting atoms of A/B to preserve the electrical neutrality of each fragment.; However, as already noticed in [Parrish:2015:051103], such a partitioning might result in unphysical dipole; moments at the interfragment boundaries. Imagine, for example, that I-SAPT is used to examine the interaction; of two methyl groups connected by some linker fragment. When the linking bonds are assigned to C, the carbon atoms; of the methyl groups are missing electrons on one of their sp^3 hybrid orbitals and a dipole moment appears.; These dipole moments have been observed to lead, in some cases, to I-SAPT energy contributions that do not make; physical sense, for example, to a strongly repulsive electrostatic energy between two fragments connected by an; intramolecular hydrogen bond.; To overcome this issue, Luu and Patkowski proposed a reassignment of the linking electron pairs so that each fragment; (C and A/B) gets one electron [Luu:2023:356].

The default setting fisapt_link_assignment c assigns the entire pair to the linker C together with; a +1 nuclear charge from the connecting atoms of A/B to preserve the electrical neutrality of each fragment.; However, as already noticed in [Parrish:2015:051103], such a partitioning might result in unphysical dipole; moments at the interfragment boundaries. Imagine, for example, that I-SAPT is used to examine the interaction; of two methyl groups connected by some linker fragment. When the linking bonds are assigned to C, the carbon atoms; of the methyl groups are missing electrons on one of their sp^3 hybrid orbitals and a dipole moment appears.; These dipole moments have been observed to lead, in some cases, to I-SAPT energy contributions that do not make; physical sense, for example, to a strongly repulsive electrostatic energy between two fragments connected by an; intramolecular hydrogen bond.; To overcome this issue, Luu and Patkowski proposed a reassignment of the linking electron pairs so that each fragment; (C and A/B) gets one electron [Luu:2023:356]. This electron is placed on a hybrid orbital of the connecting atom; pointing in the direction of the interfragment bond. Several schemes for determining this link hybrid were proposed; in [Luu:2023:356] and they all are implemented in PSI4. We recommend the so-called SIAO1 scheme,; fisapt_link_assignment siao1, as it has been observed to provide consistently meaningful I-SAPT terms and a; smooth basis set convergence.

Additional Notes¶. Caution; In constrast to Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code, FISAPT uses the -JKFIT; auxiliary basis sets for all Fock-type terms (e.g., electrostatics, exchange,; induction, and core Fock matrix elements in exchange-dispersion), and the -RI; auxiliary basis sets only for the dispersion term. Ed’s code uses the -RI; basis sets for all SAPT terms, which can be problematic for heavy elements.; As such, Ed’s SAPT0 code will yield slightly different results than FISAPT. The; differences should be very minor for up to and including second-row elements,; after which point one needs to use the DF_BASIS_ELST option in Ed’s code to; provide an accurate result. table of contents.

Link Orbital Partitioning in I-SAPT¶; The assignment of the A-C and B-C linking electron pairs is controlled by the FISAPT_LINK_ASSIGNMENT; keyword. The default setting fisapt_link_assignment c assigns the entire pair to the linker C together with; a +1 nuclear charge from the connecting atoms of A/B to preserve the electrical neutrality of each fragment.; However, as already noticed in [Parrish:2015:051103], such a partitioning might result in unphysical dipole; moments at the interfragment boundaries. Imagine, for example, that I-SAPT is used to examine the interaction; of two methyl groups connected by some linker fragment. When the linking bonds are assigned to C, the carbon atoms; of the methyl groups are missing electrons on one of their sp^3 hybrid orbitals and a dipole moment appears.; These dipole moments have been observed to lead, in some cases, to I-SAPT energy contributions that do not make; physical sense, for example, to a strongly repulsive electrostatic energy between two fragments connected by an; intramolecular hydrogen bond.; To overcome this issue, Luu and Patkowski proposed a reassignment of the linking electron pairs so that each fragment; (C and A/B) gets one electron [Luu:2023:356]. This electron is placed on a hybrid orbital of the connecting atom; pointing in the direction of the interfragment bond.

F/I-SAPT: Functional Group and/or Intramolecular SAPT¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, FISAPT; The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding “F/I-SAPT.” All F/I-SAPT computations; in PSI4 use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein’s SAPT0 code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.; F-SAPT is detailed over two papers: [Parrish:2014:044115] on our much-earlier; “atomic” SAPT (A-SAPT) and [Parrish:2014:4417] on the finished “functional; group” SAPT (F-SAPT). An additional paper describes how to use F-SAPT to analyze; differences under functional group substitutions [Parrish:2014:17386]. I-SAPT; is explained in [Parrish:2015:051103]. There is also a reasonably-detailed; review of the aims of A/F/I-SAPT and the existing state-of-the-art in the field; in the introduction chapter on partitioned SAPT methods in Parrish’s thesis.; The scripts discussed below are located in psi4/psi4/share/psi4/fsapt.

Adding Point Charges to F/I-SAPT Computations¶; Point charges can be added to the interacting subsystems A and B as well; as to the linking fragment C. Briefly, the interaction between the point charges in A(B); and fragment B(A) enters the SAPT0 interaction energy. It explicitly affects the electrostatics; and induction components, and implicitly affects other SAPT0 components by polarizing the orbitals.; If point charges are present in both subsystems A and B, an additional charge-charge interaction; term is also added to the electrostatic energy. When point charges are assigned to subsystem C, the point; charges in C only polarize the orbitals in both fragment A and B. However, the presence of charges in C does not; direct",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/fisapt.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/fisapt.html

This electron is placed on a hybrid orbital of the connecting atom; pointing in the direction of the interfragment bond. Several schemes for determining this link hybrid were proposed; in [Luu:2023:356] and they all are implemented in PSI4. We recommend the so-called SIAO1 scheme,; fisapt_link_assignment siao1, as it has been observed to provide consistently meaningful I-SAPT terms and a; smooth basis set convergence. The SIAO1 name implies that the projection to construct the link hybrids happens in the; intrinsic atomic orbital space (as opposed to the SAO1 method where the standard atomic orbital space is used), with; one iteration of fragment orbital optimization and link orbital orthogonalization, a process that very quickly; achieves self-consistency. Altogether, the allowed values for FISAPT_LINK_ASSIGNMENT are c (default),; ab (the opposite of c where the entire linking pair is assigned to A/B), sao0, sao1, sao2,; siao0, siao1 (recommended for all I-SAPT applications), and siao2 (essentially identical to siao1 but; slightly more expensive).

Coupled electron pair approximation¶; Coupled-pair methods can be viewed as approximations to CCSD or as; size-extensive modifications of CISD.

This convenient property allows density; matrices and 1-electron properties to be evaluated without any additional; effort. Note, however, that 1-electron properties are currently; unavailable when coupling these stationary CEPA-like methods with frozen; natural orbitals. Density-fitted coupled cluster¶; Density fitting (DF) [or the resolution of the identity (RI)] and Cholesky; decomposition (CD) techniques are popular in quantum chemistry to avoid; the computation and storage of the 4-index electron repulsion integral; (ERI) tensor and even to reduce the computational scaling of some terms.; DF/CD-CCSD(T) computations are available in PSI4, with or without the; use of FNOs, through the FNOCC module. The implementation and accuracy of; the DF/CD-CCSD(T) method are described in [DePrince:2013:2687].; The DF-CCSD(T) procedure uses two auxiliary basis sets. The first set is; that used in the SCF procedure, defined by the DF_BASIS_SCF; keyword. If this keyword is not specified, an appropriate -JKFIT set is; automatically selected. This auxiliary set defines the ERIs used to; build the Fock matrix used in the DF-CCSD(T) procedure. The second; auxiliary set is used to approximate all other ERIs in the DF-CCSD(T); procedure. The choice of auxiliary basis is controlled by the keyword; DF_BASIS_CC. By default, DF_BASIS_CC is the RI set; (optimized for DFMP2) most appropriate for use with the primary basis.; For example, if the primary basis is aug-cc-pVDZ, the default; DF_BASIS_CC will be aug-cc-pVDZ-RI.; Alternatively, the user can request that the DF-CCSD(T) procedure use a; set of vectors defined by the Cholesky decomposition of the",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/fnocc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/fnocc.html

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/fnocc.html:2659,Energy Efficiency,energy,energy,2659," the number of virtual; orbitals retained after the FNO truncation.; The general outline for the FNO procedure in PSI4 is:. construct the virtual-virtual block of the unrelaxed MP2 one-particle density matrix (OPDM); diagonalize this block of the OPDM to obtain a set of natural virtual orbitals; based on some occupancy threshold, determine which orbitals are unimportant and may be discarded; project the virtual-virtual block of the Fock matrix onto the truncated space; construct semicanonical orbitals by diagonalizing the virtual-virtual block of the Fock matrix; proceed with the QCISD(T) / CCSD(T) / MP4 computation in the reduced virtual space. A second-order correction based upon the MP2 energies in the full and; truncated spaces captures much of the missing correlation effects. More; details on the implementation and numerical accuracy of FNO methods in; PSI4 can be found in [DePrince:2013:293]. FNO computations; are controlled through the keywords NAT_ORBS and; OCC_TOLERANCE, or by prepending a valid method name with “fno” in; the energy call as; energy('fno-ccsd(t)'). If you wish to specify the number of active natural orbitals manually, use; the keyword ACTIVE_NAT_ORBS. This keyword will override the; keyword OCC_TOLERANCE. QCISD(T), CCSD(T), MP4, and CEPA¶; The FNOCC module in PSI4 supports several related many-body quantum; chemistry methods, including the CCSD(T) and QCISD(T) methods, several; orders of many-body perturbation theory (MP2-MP4), and a family methods; related to the coupled electron pair approximation (CEPA). Quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster¶; The quadratic configuration interaction singles doubles (QCISD) method of; Pople, Head-Gordon, and Raghavachari [Pople:1987:5968] was originally; presented as a size-consistent extension of configuration interaction; singles doubles (CISD).

Quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster¶; The quadratic configuration interaction singles doubles (QCISD) method of; Pople, Head-Gordon, and Raghavachari [Pople:1987:5968] was originally; presented as a size-consistent extension of configuration interaction; singles doubles (CISD). The method can also be obtained as a; simplified version of the coupled cluster singles doubles (CCSD); method [Purvis:1982]. Consider the set of equations defining CCSD:.

PSI4. Interfaces: Enhancing PSI4 Capabilities; Interface to gau2grid by D. G. A. Smith. Interface to gau2grid by D. G. A. Smith¶; Code author: D. G. A. Smith; Section author: Lori A. Burns. PSI4, relies upon the gau2grid library for Gaussian collocations for DFT. gau2grid; requires no; additional licence, downloads, or configuration. Conversely, PSI4; cannot build without gau2grid. Installation¶; Binary. gau2grid is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).; If using the PSI4 binary, gau2grid has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; gau2grid can be obtained through conda install gau2grid -c psi4.; Then, hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect gau2grid and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove gau2grid. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want gau2grid built from; from source also, let the build system fetch and build it and activate; dependent code. How to configure gau2gridfor building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, gau2grid is a library that provides essential; grid operations for DFT.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) gau2grid; Upstream Dependencies — gau2grid \(\Leftarrow\) None.

GDMA is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).; If using the PSI4 binary, gdma has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; gdma can be obtained through conda install gdma -c psi4.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_gdma,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect gdma and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove gdma. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want gdma built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_gdma,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code. Input¶; The distributed multipole analysis (DMA) technique, developed by Anthony J.; Stone and implemented by him into the GDMA package, is available in PSI4.; The current implementation simply embeds Stone’s GDMA code into the main; executable, and generates the appropriate input files automatically. The; program takes as input a data file, and a Gaussian formatted checkpoint (see; Section FCHK) file. The simplest usage of the GDMA code is; demonstrated below, along with a listing of the options supported; these; options correspond to the options described in the; GDMA manual.; If more advanced usage is desired, which is not is permitted by the options; listed below, the user may provide their own data file containing keywords",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/gdma.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/gdma.html

Role — In PSI4, GDMA is a library that provides additional; quantum chemical capabilities (multipole analysis).; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) gdma; Upstream Dependencies — gdma \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran. CMake Variables. ENABLE_gdma — CMake variable toggling whether Psi4 builds with gdma; CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For gdma, set to an installation directory containing include/GDMA/GDMA_MANGLE.h; gdma_DIR — CMake variable to specify where pre-built gdma can be found. Set to installation directory containing share/cmake/gdma/gdmaConfig.cmake; CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_gdma — CMake variable to force internal build of gdma instead of detecting pre-built; CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_gdma — CMake variable to force detecting pre-built gdma and not falling back on internal build. Examples. Build bundled. >>> cmake -DENABLE_gdma=ON. Build without gdma. >>> cmake. Link against pre-built. >>> cmake -DENABLE_gdma=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/gdma/root. >>> cmake -DENABLE_gdma=ON -Dgdma_DIR=/path/to/gdma/configdir. Build bundled despite pre-built being detectable. >>> cmake -DENABLE_gdma=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/unwanted/gdma/root/and/wanted/other/dependencies/root -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_gdma=ON. table of contents.

As of 1.0, the functionality provided by; cp() and cbs() should not be accessed directly. Instead, use the; cp kwarg and/or the extended method syntax like; 'mp3/aug-cc-pv[dt]z' to energy(), opt(), etc., respectively.; For many of the PSI4 Python functions described above, it makes scientific; sense that they could be called in combination. For instance, one could; optimize all the reagents in a database or compute a; counterpoise-corrected interaction energy with an extrapolated method. The; table below outlines permitted intercalls between functions, showing that; db(opt(cbs(energy()))) is allowed, while db(cp(energy())) is not. This; table is not yet validated for calls with cp(). Permitted nesting of Psithon functions¶. Caller; Callee. cp; db; opt; cbs; energy. Basis Set Superposition Corrections. —; Y; Y; Y. Database — database(); —. Y; Y; Y. Geometry Optimization — optimize() and gradient(); —; —. Y; Y. Complete Basis Set; —; —; —. Y. Single-Point Energy — energy(); —; —; —; —. The command db(opt(cbs(energy()))) is actually expressed as db(...,; db_func=opt, opt_func=cbs). The perhaps expected final argument of; cbs_func=energy is not necessary since energy() is always the function; called by default. Also, the outermost internal function call (db_func; above can be called as just func. Several examples of intercalls; between Python functions can be found in sample input pywrap-all.; All keyword arguments are passed along to each function traversed in the; Python driver, so there should be no concern for separating them, grouping; them, or designating them for a particular function when undertaking a; nested calculation. Where the same keyword is used by multiple functions,; prefixes are added, e.g., db_mode and opt_mode.; Function intercalls should",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/intercalls.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/intercalls.html

A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec.

The latest version of the; PSI4 program package may be obtained at psicode.org.; The package is available as a binary (Installing from Binary) for Linux, macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon), or Windows (both native and via Windows Subsystem for; Linux aka Bash on Ubuntu on Windows); or as source code (git repository or zipped archive from; https://github.com/psi4/psi4. CompilersPSI4 has been successfully compiled using Intel, GCC, and Clang; compilers. Compiler requirements are primarily; C++20 compliance (now GCC version 10.0 or above).; For some architectures, a precompiled binary is available. See Compiling and Installing for details.

Several parts of; the code feature shared-memory parallelization to run efficiently on; multi-core machines (see Sec. Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; PSI4 is, in many ways, a whole new package compared to Psi3.; While some libraries and modules remain the same, the majority of the code has; been rewritten from scratch based on a powerful set of new libraries written; in C++. A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec.

Introduction¶. Overview¶; PSI4 provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods using; state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms. Several parts of; the code feature shared-memory parallelization to run efficiently on; multi-core machines (see Sec. Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; PSI4 is, in many ways, a whole new package compared to Psi3.; While some libraries and modules remain the same, the majority of the code has; been rewritten from scratch based on a powerful set of new libraries written; in C++. A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec.

PSI4 features several initial guesses for the; molecular orbitals. The default guess is the superposition of atomic; densities (SAD), discussed in. “Principles for a direct SCF approach to LCAO-MO ab-initio; calculations”, J. Almlöf, K. Faegri, and K. Korsell,; J. Comput. Chem. 3, 385 (1982).; (doi: 10.1002/jcc.540030314).; “Starting SCF calculations by superposition of atomic; densities”, J. H. Van Lenthe, R. Zwaans, H. J. J. Van Dam,; and M. F. Guest, J. Comput. Chem. 27, 926 (2006).; (doi: 10.1002/jcc.20393). PSI4 also features a SAD natural orbital guess, an extended; Hückel guess that employs on-the-fly atomic calculations alike the SAD; guess, as well as a superposition of atomic potentials (SAP) guess; that is based on screening of atomic nuclei. The SAD natural orbitals,; Hückel and SAP guesses have been described in. “An assessment of initial guesses for self-consistent field; calculations. Superposition of Atomic Potentials: simple yet; efficient”, S. Lehtola, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15,; 1593 (2019) (doi: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01089). Density Cumulant Theory (DCT)¶; PSI4 features several formulations of newly-developed density cumulant; theory (DCT), also known as density cumulant functional theory (DCFT).; The theory and benchmark of this theory are discussed in the following papers:; DC-06 (also known as DCT-06):. “Density Cumulant Functional Theory: First Implementation and; Benchmark Results for the DCFT-06 Model,” A. C. Simmonett,; J. J. Wilke, H. F. Schaefer, and W. Kutzelnigg, J. Chem.

Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT)¶; PSI4 features an extremely efficient code to perform wavefunction-based; Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). A good review article for this; method is as follows:. “Perturbation Theory Approach to Intermolecular Potential Energy; Surfaces of van der Waals Complexes,” B. Jeziorski, R. Moszynski,; and K. Szalewicz, Chem. Rev. 94, 1887-1930 (1994).; (doi: 10.1021/cr00031a008). PSI4 benefits enormously from the introduction of density fitting (DF); into SAPT. There are several SAPT truncations available in PSI4. For; guidance on which one to choose, see the SAPT section of the manual; and refer to the following systematic study:. “Levels of Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). I. Efficiency and; Performance for Interaction Energies,’’ T. M. Parker, L. A. Burns, R. M.; Parrish, A. G. Ryno, and C. D. Sherrill, J. Chem. Phys. 140,; 094106 (2014).; (doi: 10.1063/1.4867135).

Namespacing in the directory structure used; to detect the addon should have this name (e.g.,; share/cmake/CheMPS2).; Restricted by the CMake project name, add-ons return CMake variables; and compile definitions of FOUND_AddOn_name and; USING_AddOn_name. For example: FOUND_libefp,; USING_CheMPS2, PCMSolver_LIBRARIES, USING_v2rdm_casscf.; The CMake target(s) formed use the full add-on name as the namespace,; AddOn_name::lib_name_without_lib.lower().

Anyone, core-dev or not, is encouraged to review PRs. It’s actually good practice for interacting with other open-source projects, where you don’t have the advantage of knowing or working with the contributors. Before venturing into projects on GitHub where you don’t know the maintainers, it doesn’t hurt to read https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/ .; Psi4 is a learning tool for all involved, so partial reviews in areas of confidence and questions and comments on PRs in general are encouraged.; Approving before CI completes is fine, though it can be mildly personally embarrassing when CI catches something you didn’t.; All main branches (master and 1.N.x maintenance) are protected by GitHub, including administrators, so even with write access, no one can accidentally push (master) or rewrite the history (master and maintenance).; PR owners who also have maintainer status can merge their PRs as GitHub enforces two external reviews.; Unless there’s been a lot of discussion on core-dev about merge order, generally the 2nd positive reviewer merges the PR.

Or, within the file, do sys.path.insert(0, {objdir}/stage/{prefix}/lib/{pymod_lib_dir}. How to find tests without output.ref¶; Ideally, each new test or much-altered test should add its own; output.ref. When that doesn’t happen, this command helps.; find tests/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d '!' -exec test -e ""{}/output.ref"" "";"" -print. How to do GitHub issue management and code review¶. Anyone, core-dev or not, is encouraged to review PRs. It’s actually good practice for interacting with other open-source projects, where you don’t have the advantage of knowing or working with the contributors. Before venturing into projects on GitHub where you don’t know the maintainers, it doesn’t hurt to read https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/ .; Psi4 is a learning tool for all involved, so partial reviews in areas of confidence and questions and comments on PRs in general are encouraged.; Approving before CI completes is fine, though it can be mildly personally embarrassing when CI catches something you didn’t.; All main branches (master and 1.N.x maintenance) are protected by GitHub, including administrators, so even with write access, no one can accidentally push (master) or rewrite the history (master and maintenance).; PR owners who also have maintainer status can merge their PRs as GitHub enforces two external reviews.; Unless there’s been a lot of discussion on core-dev about merge order, generally the 2nd positive reviewer merges the PR. Also fine to add review and leave merge for later.; Presently only Azure is set up as a required-to-merge service. Incomplete GHA Ecosystem or Docs won’t block merging, but we do usually let it complete before merging unless it’s a trivial PR.; We don’t enforce branches to be up to date before merging since that’d be a lot of extra CI time and coordination",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/master/manage_git.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/manage_git.html
