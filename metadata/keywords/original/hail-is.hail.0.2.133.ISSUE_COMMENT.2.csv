I read the docs now, and I'm not sure I agree with these sentences:; > The values are seeded when the function is called, so calling a random Hail function and then using it several times in the same expression will yield the same result each time.; > ; > Evaluating the same expression will yield the same value every time, but multiple calls of the same function will have different results. I think the trouble is with the meaning of ""called"", ""using"", and ""evaluating"". I see now that you mean calling the python function by ""called"", but that wasn't clear to me on first reading. ""Using"" I think just means appearing in the source code, which feels right. The last sentence, I think, is not true, given the below:. ```python; In [31]: z = hl.rand_unif(0, 1, seed=0); ...: ; ...: t = hl.utils.range_table(2); ...: t = t.annotate(; ...: x = hl.literal([1,2,3]).map(lambda i: hl.rand_unif(0,1,seed=0)),; ...: y = hl.literal([1,2,3]).map(lambda i: hl.rand_unif(0,1,seed=0)),; ...: z = hl.literal([1,2,3]).map(lambda i: z)); ...: ; ...: t.show(); ```.

This is the only place `px` is used, and indeed, copying `px` is sufficient to fix the bug. I'd say it's a breeze concurrency bug, except that not only does it go away whenever no single computer processes more than one partition (i.e. big partition or single-core workers), it also doesn't occur on my laptop or google VM.

It takes an iterator of intervals, sorted lexicographically (by left endpoint, then right endpoint), and produces an iterator of `(Interval, Array[Interval])` pairs. The intervals `i` of the pairs `(i, a)` are guaranteed to be disjoint (and still sorted), and `a` will contain all intervals from the original iterator containing `i`. The algorithm maintains a min-heap of intervals, with the weight of an interval given by the right endpoint, i.e. the interval with least right endpoint is at the top of the heap. The following pseudocode shows how to produce each `(Interval, Array[Interval])` pair, given the input iterator `it`.; ```; i = it.next(); while (heap.top disjoint i); heap.pop(); heap.push(i); while (it.head.left == i.left); heap.push(it.next()); iOut := Interval(i.left, min(heap.top.right, it.head.left)); emit(iOut, heap.toArray); ```. It's easy to see that at the time of the last line, `heap` contains all and only those intervals which contain `iOut`, and that `iOut` is the intersection of the intervals in `heap`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/4270#issuecomment-481240768

""In the GCC 5.1 release libstdc++ introduced a new library ABI that includes new implementations of std::string and std::list. These changes were necessary to conform to the 2011 C++ standard which forbids Copy-On-Write strings and requires lists to keep track of their size. In order to maintain backwards compatibility for existing code linked to libstdc++ the library's soname has not changed and the old implementations are still supported in parallel with the new ones. This is achieved by defining the new implementations in an inline namespace so they have different names for linkage purposes, e.g. the new version of std::list<int> is actually defined as std::__cxx11::list<int>. Because the symbols for the new implementations have different names the definitions for both versions can be present in the same library."". OSX doesn't have this ABI-compatibility issue because for several years it has been using; libc++ as the default library, and libc++ is a post-C++11 rewrite-from-scratch implementation; of the required standard-library functionality. My understanding is that it is perfectly feasible to mix and match different g++/clang++compiler; versions and different libstdc++ versions. It just doesn't happen very much because both the; g++ version and the libstdc++ are chosen at the same time, early in building a Linux distribution,; and then are frozen throughout the release's lifetime to ensure interoperability of binaries. So debian8's version of g++ and libstdc++ doesn't change.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4422#issuecomment-424797612

Yeah, upcast via MatrixMapRows can do it:. ```; val newRVRow = newRow.typ.asInstanceOf[TStruct].fieldOption(MatrixType.entriesIdentifier) match {; case Some(f) =>; assert(f.typ == child.typ.entryArrayType); newRow; case None =>; InsertFields(newRow, Seq(; MatrixType.entriesIdentifier -> GetField(Ref(""va"", child.typ.rvRowType), MatrixType.entriesIdentifier))); }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/4527#issuecomment-429190070

If the row key is empty, the only way to do this would be to explode the rows then shuffle to sort by col key. I'm not sure what behavior we want for this. The empty row key is just the extreme case of having too coarse a row key, so that the rows having a given row key are too large to fit one partition and sort the entries by [row key, col key]. Until we can dynamically estimate the data sizes, we have to make some assumption about when a key's worth of data fits on a partition, and otherwise we have to shuffle. If the col key was also empty, we could do this without a shuffle, because there is no ordering requirement on the entriesRVD.

Investigated using Inferno.js as a lighter alternative to React. Saves ~20-30KB bundle size, and is somewhat faster. However, main Inferno dev moved to React core team, and React is focusing on the optimizations present in Inferno for 2019 (DOM: move to native events where possible), as well as introducing optimizations not found in Inferno (compile time targets: initially inlining, future maybe web assembly binaries; move rendering work to separate thread / concurrent rendering). Furthermore, React ecosystem is orders of magnitude larger, so we can save a huge amount of dev time by avoiding Inferno (N modules * time to develop bespoke module avg), and have greater likelihood of LTS. Notably, I realized that most of my bundle size was coming from inefficient bundling of Material UI and due to Apollo's insanely large graphQL bundle. Removing these now. Lastly, React is actually very efficient. jQuery is ~31.1KB minified. React is 3KB, while React DOM is 33.8KB. In 2019 React DOM will shrink.

Removed all GraphQL libraries, besides graphql-tag, which I like, because 1) simple hash-based cache: no need to walk complex graph to normalize cache, because in most cases I'm perfectly fine with not re-using cache across different queries (that may have some shared fields). Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B.

To start a local instance of the web app, simply run:; `npm install && npm bootstrap`. To get a hot-reloading version of the web app (links to your browser, refreshes all changes): `cd packages/public && npm run dev`. To start the gateway: `cd packages/hail-api-gateway && nodemon index.js`. Dev mode routing is slow. To see a production, minified build: `cd packages/public && npm run build && npm run prod-test`.; * Build is a kind of compilation process. Dev dependencies are pruned, the app is split into static bundles, and minified. Some optimizations, like inlining of some React functions also occurs. This is independent of anything V8 does .

Don't take any of it too seriously. Some thoughts:. 1. I thought you wanted to support f-strings. By making the batch file quote double curly parens, that means if you use them in an f-string, you need to write `f'{{{{foo}}}}'` which is a bit much. But that means that non-batch uses of `{}` need to be double-quoted, so `awk '{{ ... }}'` and `f""awk '{{{{ ... }}}}'""`. Hmm. Maybe using the same escape syntax as f-strings is not ideal. . I don't have a no-brainer suggestion. Happy to brainstorm ideas offline. I think ultimately this is a minor syntactic choice. 2. Inputs seem ... almost redundant, because they also appear in the command strings. What about:. ```; .command('shapeit --bed-file {{<subset.ofile}} --chr ' + contig + ' --out {{>ofile}}'); ```. Then the question becomes, how do associate `subset` with the corresponding Python variable? You could use the task label, but then the user has to maintain two sets of names, which isn't ideal. Hmm, maybe this doesn't work. 3. I like arrays of resources!. > `.command('cat {{files}} >> {{ofile}}')`. I wonder, will we ever want arrays to be formatted other than joined with spaces? I worry the user will want more flexibility in formatting, and we'll want that in Python. What about if the argument is a function, it takes a dictionary from resource names to their string representation, and you can format however you want?

I was lazy and used the Jinja template engine to parse and find the variable declarations. I need to write a custom parser, but wanted to figure out exactly what we're going to support. Which makes me worried that I don't want to implement an expr language or it should be minimal. 2. Tim suggested something similar: `%%IN bfile%%` and `%%OUT ofile%%. Requires the custom parser. See comment 1 above. 3. I was also concerned about the formatting of arrays. I tried using lambdas for comment 4 and it got complicated. I like your proposal but want to think about it more. 4. PLINK, etc. output lots of files and you specify the file root and then it outputs a bunch of files with different extensions. We must be able to support this and make it easy for users.

Here's my attempt to fix the problems outlined above. The tradeoff made is that we have to refer to the object (ex: `subset`). So instead of thinking of writing the command as a template where `inputs` specifies how to substitute into the template, writing commands in this interface is the same as using Python to generate the correct string to output. I'm not sure that I like this better. One of the advantages of writing commands as templates is they are reusable. In the latter case, the strings are reusable if they are written as `.format()` templates instead of `f-strings`.
