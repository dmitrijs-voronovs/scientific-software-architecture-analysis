Cromwell support for optional Docker runtimes would enable me to write FireCloud WDLs with quicker development iterations. It would also enable faster and more resilient automated testing (i.e., unit testing) of such WDLs. My current approach to developing WDLs intended for FireCloud is to add Cromwell and my WDL (`foo.wdl`) into the Docker image that contains my workflow dependencies (e.g. Python and R code). ; Then, from my local machine, I execute in my Docker container an equivalent version of my FireCloud WDL with a command like `docker exec $containerId java -jar cromwell-36.1.jar run foo_test.wdl --inputs test_inputs.json --options options.json`. Without a way to override the `runtime` attribute (or ignore its `docker` key) in `foo.wdl`, I resort to commenting out the attribute and copying the content to `foo_test.wdl`. This enables fast development and unit testing, but requires manually syncing `foo.wdl` and `foo_test.wdl`. That, of course, has poor maintainability -- my approach is a kludge.

I've been looking at how to transfer WDL related issues from this repo to that one but in the meantime note that the way to have changes find their way into the spec would be to discuss the topic on the mail list/gitter and ultimately to open a PR with proposed changes to the spec.

My point in my last reply is that someone might see it at some point and make a PR for you but there's no guarantee of that happening in a timely fashion whereas opening a PR against the spec yourself does guarantee that happening :). FWIW I realize that the switcharoo in process can be frustrating. As an example of how we feel the pain as well, there are cases where we (Cromwell team) forgot to update the spec document when we made changes which now means that those changes aren't actually part of the spec. So for instance [this PR](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/pull/148) is just trying to specify behavior Cromwell already does but is likely to wind up different than what we did & thus making Cromwell non-conforming.

However, using that API I looked for evidence of preemption in four submissions, each launching 1000 workflows, and each workflow conducting a 25-way scatter. All of these scatter jobs are set to run on preemptiible VMs. So that is 4 X 1000 X 25 = 100K jobs run on preemptible machines. Each job takes between 30 minutes and an hour to run. I saw no reported incidents of preemption. I'm not sure that I believe this is the case, and am wondering if either I'm access the preemption data incorrectly, or if cromwell is not reporting is correctly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1860#issuecomment-274493127

As you can see from the numbers used it'll vary by the oomph your computer has but you'll want to find a number closer to the ""it starts happening here"" point vs some arbitrarily huge number as IIRC some of the initial chokepoints were less bad than deeper ones but at huge numbers were still horrible to wait through.

When docker runs a container as root, it isolates the user/groups from the host definitions and instead remaps them. This could be important to a user for two reasons. Once, files written as root in the container will instead be written as this remapped user. Second, since IO on the underlying host VM is currently done as root, the container can read files as root.

The akka docs somewhere make the point that for performance reasons one wants to completely handle an exception as close to the call site as possible and then transform into some other object which won't ever do stack unwinding and such. We often do the opposite, passing exceptions all the way back out and then handling them there.

Part of the confusion (that I just want someone to get right!) is what that list should be. There's v2 and v3, which are ""right"" but only about 1000 shards. Then there are several flavors of what was used to do the 20k, which is the ~20k shards. . So the task is simply getting someone who knows to (a) pick the best starting point (something with the right territory and somewhat even) and (b) do the splitting . Thinking out loud... Do you think that the balance of the shards changes with the number of samples? That is... could you take a 100-sample call set and use it to empirically balance the shards and then that would scale to 50k? or does the distribution change significantly as you add more samples?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2175#issuecomment-294230149

If you want an interval list for hg38 then that is the best interval list we have created thus far. `v1` is our first crack at creating an interval list that was ""even"" in terms of run times starting with histograms created from the 1000 genomes vcfs (converted from hg19). `v2` is `v1` after taking the 15 longest running shards from the callset we used `v1` on and chopped them into 10 equal parts by bases. `v3` was created once we realized that `v2` nor `v1` covered all of the genome territory that our calling intervals cover so we added the parts of the genome that were missing (they're small so they shouldn't be problem causing). If you wanted to split this interval list without any kind of model helping you make smart splits you will probably run into what we did with gnomad of having to iteratively split the same intervals multiple times to hit acceptable run times which is no fun. . You can always overfit the problem and just make a crazy number of intervals where you can guarantee that even in the worst case for each of those intervals, it will still be under some run time you want to beat but that probably isn't the best strategy for many reasons. Alot of it has to do with the content of the callset which is something we are not good at predicting. The callset we used `v2` on had one interval that was multiple times longer than the next longest shard but in the callset we used `v1` on that same interval was one of the faster ones. Both callsets had around the same number of samples. Currently we are always retroactively ""fixing"" our interval list",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2175#issuecomment-295265998

I'm not sure how to organize the configs and the code to harmonize these two retry world's, so I'll leave it to you except to state that we do want some kind of ""Retry"" in the GridEngine use case. .

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/2176#issuecomment-296215555:124,Availability,failure,failure,124,"@cowmoo is there a way for Cromwell to tell from the result of running the ""begin execution"" command, or from the resulting failure, that the task should be retryable?. I like the idea of retrying certain things, but a blanket ""retry everything n times, regardless of problem"" is probably going to annoy more people than it helps (especially if they're paying for it directly in cloud compute!). One thing we previously considered was a ""retryOnStdoutRegex"" attribute, maybe something like:; ```; command {; # ...; }; runtime {; retryOnStdoutRegex: ""path not found:""; }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/2176#issuecomment-296215555

This PR goes beyond the scope of what we're comfortable with as it paints with a pretty broad brush. If either of you were interested in implementing something which retried job submission for the config backend only (e.g. SGE, SLURM, etc) we'd be interested in that. We'll likely get to it ourselves at some point but not immediately. If that's something either of you (or anyone else coming across this) are interested in let us know and we can point you in the right direction.

Singularity is not special. It's just a binary. ## Why has it been so confusing?. We get Singularity confused with Docker, because they are both containers. Same thing right? Sort of, but not exactly. Docker is a container technology, but actually it's older and has had time to develop a full API for services. It meets the criteria for both a backend and an executable, and this is because it can be conceptualized as both ""a thing that you run"" and ""the thing that is the container you run in."" But it's confusing. The distinction is that although Singularity is also a container, Singularity is **not** like Docker because it doesn't have the fully developed services API (yet!). This problem is hard because the language for Singularity containers communicating between one another, and even to the host, is not completely implemented yet. This comes down to OCI compliance, and having a way for some host to manage all of its Singularity containers. Right now we just have start and stop, but we can't connect containers, define ports, or even easily get a PID. It could (sort of?) be hacked, but we would be better off waiting for that nice standard. ## Reproducible Binary (Workflow Step) vs. Environment. There is also a distinction that I haven't completely wrapped my head around. Docker is very commonly used as an environment - you put a bunch of software (e.g., samtools, bwa aligner, etc.) and then issue commands to the container with custom things. Singularity, in my mind, to be truly a reproducible thing is more of the workflow step or script. It will have the software inside, but better should have those same commands represented with internal modularity. I could arguably completely do away with the external workflow dependency if a single binary told me how to run itself, and then had more than one entrypoint defined for each step.

You guys seem pretty busy, so likely your best bet would be to just wait, because the community is going in that direction anyway. The other representation is to rethink this. An approach that I like is to move away from micro managing the workflow / software, and to set requirements for the data. If you set standard formats (meaning everything from the organization of files down to the headers of a data file) on the data itself, then the software gets built around that. A researcher can have confidence that the data he is collecting will work with software because it's validated to the format. The developers can have confidence their tools will work with data because of that same format. A new graduate student knows how to develop a new tool because there are nicely defined rules. A good example is to look at the BIDS (brain imaging data structure) that (has several file formats under it) but it revolutionizing how brain imaging analysis is done. (e.g, take a look at [https://www.openneuro.org](https://www.openneuro.org). # Development of my Thinking; Finally, I want to share how I came to the thinking above. Here are the steps that I've taken in the last few weeks, and resulting thoughts from them. I started with this issue board actually, and a general goal to ""Add Singularity to Cromwell."" Ok. ### Question 1: How do I develop Cromwell?; It first was hard for me",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2177#issuecomment-416418214

I had this growing feeling that started to solidify that there are too many layers. I am developing things and I **still** don't understand (or think Singularity is ready yet) to be any kind of backend. I'm forcing a dog into a cat shaped hole just because this is the hole I'm supposed to fill. Is that a good idea? I've lost sight of what the tool is trying to do. Cromwell is trying to make it easy to run a Singularity container. But if that's the case, then why has this command:. ```bash; singularity run shub://vsoch/hello-world; ```. turned into needing Cromwell (java and the jar), an inputs json file, a wdl specification, a backend configuration, and a runtime command that I can't seem to remember, and then the entire thing takes much longer than an instance to echo a tiny Rawwwwr! If this is the goal we are going for, is this making life easier for the scientist? If I'm a programmer person, and this is the minimum I am allowed for this to just run a simple container, what happens when it gets harder? I realized that without a proper services API, singularity is no more special than python, bash, samtools, it's just a binary. . And I realize also that it's easy to get caught up in details like ""Should we use Travis or Circle?"" Does it work on Amazon with this kind of input? And there will always be bugs! But I think the forest is being a bit lost for the trees. . ## Question 4: What is the direction to go in?. You can probably take what I'm saying with a grain of salt because I'm new to this entire universe, and there is so much invested there is no turning back or rethinking. But all of this seems too complicated, and too hard. What is needed is a solution that is just really stupid and simple. You have a container that understands its data. You point the container at a dataset and run it.

Ok. ### Question 1: How do I develop Cromwell?; It first was hard for me to know where to start to develop Cromwell, because the docs just went into how to compile it on a host. So it made sense to make it easy for the developer to develop Cromwell so I made a Dockerfile to do that:; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4002. Woohoo merged! We needed to have tests too, so I followed up on that:; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4015 . But unfortunately it was decided that CircleCI was too new / needed to learn stuff (this is ok!) so it's going to be closed. . ## Question 2: How do we add a Singularity backend?. But this is actually ok, because we realize that we don't need to add Singularity to Cromwell proper, it can just be a backend! But I didn't understand wdl, or any of the formats, so my crew in Cherry lab gave me a solid repo to startwith, and then it started to click!; - https://github.com/vsoch/wgbs-pipeline/pull/1. I was waiting for the Dockerfile test PR to pass, but realized it probably wouldn't, so I jumped on adding the example backend workflows (still without totally understanding what/why/how, but figuring out as I went):; - https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4039. ## Question 3: But what about Cromwell+Singularity on Travis?. I got confused again when there were [requests for additional tests](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4039#issuecomment-416313519) (and something entirely different) that it made me step back. I had this growing feeling that started to solidify that there are too many layers. I am developing things and I **still** don't understand (or think Singularity is ready yet) to be any kind of backend. I'm forcing a dog into a cat shaped hole just because this is the hole I'm supposed to fill. Is that a good idea? I've lost sight of what the tool is trying to do.

If this is the goal we are going for, is this making life easier for the scientist? If I'm a programmer person, and this is the minimum I am allowed for this to just run a simple container, what happens when it gets harder? I realized that without a proper services API, singularity is no more special than python, bash, samtools, it's just a binary. . And I realize also that it's easy to get caught up in details like ""Should we use Travis or Circle?"" Does it work on Amazon with this kind of input? And there will always be bugs! But I think the forest is being a bit lost for the trees. . ## Question 4: What is the direction to go in?. You can probably take what I'm saying with a grain of salt because I'm new to this entire universe, and there is so much invested there is no turning back or rethinking.

It meets the criteria for both a backend and an executable, and this is because it can be conceptualized as both ""a thing that you run"" and ""the thing that is the container you run in."" But it's confusing. The distinction is that although Singularity is also a container, Singularity is **not** like Docker because it doesn't have the fully developed services API (yet!). This problem is hard because the language for Singularity containers communicating between one another, and even to the host, is not completely implemented yet. This comes down to OCI compliance, and having a way for some host to manage all of its Singularity containers. Right now we just have start and stop, but we can't connect containers, define ports, or even easily get a PID.

I've been thinking more about this and testing, and I want to offer my thoughts here. ; I think overall my conclusions are:. - We are trying to shove Singularity in as a backend **and** a workflow component, it's one or the other; - It's probably more appropriately the latter - a command you would put into a workflow (e.g., like python, any binary really) because services and standards (OCI) aren't fully developed.; - The time is soon, but it's not now, to define a Singularity backend; - For now, give users examples of just using containers as executables, nothing special. TLDR let's not try shoving a dog into a cat hole because the ears look similar. They are two different technologies, the latter (Singularity) is probably going to do great things for Cromwell **because** it is a single binary (and not a collection of tarballs) but we need that version 3.0 with OCI compliance to really have a well formulated language for Cromwell to talk to, period. I can go into more detail. First, let's define the parties involved:. ## Definitions. - **cromwell** is a workflow executor. It understands backends, and workflows. The backends run the workflows, and cromwell is just a manager for that.; - **backend** is an API really for services. The basic needs for this API are generally ""start, ""stop"", ""status,"" etc., and other kinds of ""controller"" commands for a particular executable. You have to be able to list what is going on, and get PIDs, and issue stop and status commands for the guts inside.; - **executable** is a script, binary, etc. that the scientist has written all the magic into, that takes some input arguments (data, poutputs, thresholds, etc.) and ""does the scientific thing"" to return to the workflow manager (cromwell) that is controlling its run via the backend. ## What does Singularity + Cromwell look like?.

But unfortunately it was decided that CircleCI was too new / needed to learn stuff (this is ok!) so it's going to be closed. . ## Question 2: How do we add a Singularity backend?.

You can just take the; location where you mention the location of the executable, and put the; wrapper to your singularity image there. I bet this is what most people do; anyway. A next step would be to give it its own section within the workflow; components. Maybe the comment of oneillkza is a high impact one, just; define Singularity as a CAP/ISOblablabla compliant workflow component; within Cromwell. Another take (and not per se mutually exclusive from the take mentioned; above) would be to, again, fix Singularity as a workflow component, and; create a set of options and functions around it that focus on abstraction; of data access etcetera.

We have had success using this in our Slurm Cromwell by launching the docker docker through `submit` ourselves and giving the docker run the parameter to mount . `${'--mount type=tmpfs,destination='+mount_tmpfs}`. It would be great if declaring a tmpfs mount point could also be supported by cromwell in google cloud submissions. Thanks!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2190#issuecomment-373077355
https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2190#issuecomment-413995155:170,Availability,avail,available,170,"+1 on `tmpfs`. Currently, we have to create a directory under `/dev/` and rely on the assumption that that directory gets mounted by default as a `tmpfs` with 1/2 of the available RAM (at least on GCP). This is obviously not ideal. Delocalization of such files is problematic as well. Our use case is exactly the same, to unpack/process tens or hundreds of thousands of small files (in a BCL). Doing so with any ""normal"" disk is much slower than with RAM.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2190#issuecomment-413995155

The numbers are averages so it's possible that it kinds of flattens out around ~20/30ms, and the 10000 happened to have slightly better runs. It does it 30 times for each of the sizes. The minimum time value would be a better indicator maybe. Edit: Did the same with min times. There's still a weird timing where 8K was longer.; The main difference between the 2 approaches is that before we would go through the list of ""done"" keys one by one until we find the one we want. Which means the longer the list the longer the time in average.

The other main argument which tends to come up is that this effectively locks the workflow to using the docker container, vs systems where one could ensure the appropriate software is installed.

I'd like to use Objects to group together related items so we can pass them as a single sample to processes. This enables things like batch or tumor/normal calling where you have multiple samples together and want to bundle each of items with each other. I've got a mock up of how I'd use it in a real somatic workflow here:. https://github.com/bcbio/test_bcbio_cwl/blob/master/somatic/somatic-wdl/main_somatic.wdl. The issue with current objects is that the items are typed so platforms can't identify files for localizing them.

The first use case is for representing JSON objects; it turns out that the syntax is very similar. I don't know if that is a coincidence. Presently, I am having trouble with the WDL object typing. For example, the workflow below: . ```; workflow wf_complex {; Object z = {""a"": 3, ""b"": 1}. output {; Int sum = z.a + z.b; }; }; ```; When evaluated with Cromwell; ```; java -jar cromwell-29.jar run wf_complex.wdl; ```; reports: ; ```; ""outputs"": {; ""wf_complex.sum"": 31; }; ```; However, I would think `a` and `b` are integers, and the addition result should be `4`. Clearly, Cromwell thinks these are strings, and the addition concatenates `3` to `1` instead. Had `z` been a JSON object, the values would have been interpreted as integers, as intended. . 1) Can the experts shed light on the situation? ; 2) How do I create a WDL object literal?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2283#issuecomment-326138202

There are two ways I can think of going about this:. 1. Fix call caching to handle FOFNs specifically. This is tricky I think, but is most robust. In this case, I want Cromwell to understand a File of File references as a specific type but just for call caching purposes. 2. Change call caching to re-use files rather than copying, thus the path of the file doesn't changes, the FOFN doesn't change, and the call cache hits. This is how I ended up working around this by splitting the WDL into pieces where I supply the inputs to avoid the cache-miss step. I believe we have this option in the SFS?.

IIRC the irritation I had here was that it'd not give me all the errors at once so i'd think i was done only to get hit by yet another block :). I mentioned the unused vars in slack. There are some *definite* unused ones in there. Most of them were due to our (over?)reliance on overloaded function signatures where we may or may not use all of the args.

Alternatively you could increase the JVM stack-overflow limit when running Cromwell to accommodate the number of constraints you need.; - Medium term, we should catch this (either in advance or literally catch the exception) and return ""unsupported operation"", rather than allowing this to bring down the entire Cromwell server.; - Longer term, we could try to restructure the query to support this level of querying.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2450#issuecomment-423597827

The solution shouldn't be ""turn your buffers up"", but rather a more appropriate scheme instead of just dropping stuff to the floor.
