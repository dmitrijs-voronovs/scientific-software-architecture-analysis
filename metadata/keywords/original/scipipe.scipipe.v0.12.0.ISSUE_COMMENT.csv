I'm at the moment trying to figure out how to solve a very similar problem, how to integrate reduce operation naturally into a Go's FBP data processing pipeline. Something that I'm considering is to specify in each IPs belonging to the same reduce group a reference to a channel that's used to perform the reduce operation. The tricky part is that the process in charge of doing the reduce operation has to maintain state during the operation (cannot be shared) and reset itself or die once it completes and sends the result back to the network. This would mean creating processes on demand per reduce operation or group of IPs to be reduced and I'm not sure how all this would fit within the FBP paradigm. The proposal is still not clear in my head so this is just a vague idea that has come up reading your comments.

This request is timely, as I'm looking at refactoring the IP (possibly corresponding to what you call ""resource""?) into a more composable core, which different types of implementations can extend, via struct embedding. I actually started this, which can be seen in the naming of the IP interface, the BaseIP struct and the FileIP one, in https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/blob/master/ip.go ... but this is unfinished work, and not really cleaned up in that particular file (be warned!). I have successfully created a re-usable core for Process and Tasks, but the IP one requires a bit more thinking to get right. . There is some really tricky things to think through to get this right. I have some notes spread out over issues and my journal etc. Will see if I can try to collect them in one place, perhaps in this issue.

I was wondering what this IP stuff meant (Information Packet, right?). So I can kind of imagine where this is going (we have various types of IPs flowing through a data pipeline). . So when I use the word Resource, I'm referring to a machine where Tasks can be executed. You have your current local machine (LocalResource) from which you start the pipeline, but maybe you also have SSH access to a powerful workstation somewhere or a virtual machine in the cloud (SSHResource). Finally, maybe you're an academic that has access to a big cluster running the SLURM job scheduler (SLURMResource). Each of these Resources would be able do the following things:. 1) Consume a Task given to it by a Process. 2) Copy any input IPs for the Task to the remote location. This might get tricky if you're using pipes and not files, but you could still stream input data up to the remote resource. It's also fine for there to be many input IPs for a single Task, we just need to copy them all. . 3) Execute the Task on the remote resource. 4) Copy any output IP's back to the local machine you started the pipeline from. . 5) Notify the Process object that the Task has completed. I'm not sure how this is currently handled in the code. Do you check for the presence of specified outputs to signify a task is done?.

Some thoughts coming to mind off arm: ""Resource"" might be a slightly vague term, as it is often used to refer to other things like the data items (which is why I thought you were referring to the IPs (which also might not have the optimal name :D)). Could it be ""Executor"" or similar? A clear name might help think more clearly about how it would fit into the code base as well. I'll need to think more about how it can fit into the code base, but I like the general direction, and would love it if we could find a simple yet robust way of ""light-weight task distribution""!

I think this is a very relevant question, as python is a much more popular language in data science in general, and in bioinformatics in particular. There are a number of reasons why we switched to Go, after using the python-based [Luigi engine](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), with our helper library [SciLuigi](https://github.com/pharmbio/sciluigi) on top:. ## Performance. Firstly, Go lets us run each task concurrently in a ""light-weight thread"" (coroutine, or goroutine) instead of completely separate python processes. This allows us to keep thousands of tasks in their own goroutines, without performance problems, while in Luigi, we got communication problems between the processes when going over 64 workers. Go is also in general very performant, as being a compiled language, that has gotten a lot of optimization work by Google engineers. This is the primary driving reason for our switch. . Then there are a number of other factors that play in as well:. ## Catching errors early. With Python/Luigi, we often had many small bugs show up only when running a workflow. Sometimes a HPC job would fail on the 7th day of a 7-day run, just because of a simple dict key error. With Go, since it is compiled, we catch much more of these simple bugs already at compile time. ## An excellent dataflow / flow-based programming language. Also, we realized that the concurrency primitives in Go (channels, goroutines etc) makes it really easy to create scheduling code which is very very easy to reason about, by letting the workflow be a dataflow network, that acts as an ""implicity scheduler"".
