Hence, the; references used might be considered CAS-CI references, but not CASSCF; references (CASSCF implies that the orbitals have been optimized specifically; to minimize the energy of the CAS-CI reference). However, if one wishes to; use two-configuration self-consistent-field (TCSCF) orbitals, those can; be obtained using the multi-configuration self-consistent-field (MCSCF); component of PSIMRCC (specifying REFERENCE to be twocon).; This is suitable for describing diradicals. Otherwise, one may use RHF or; ROHF orbitals as input to PSIMRCC. Due to a current limitation in the code,; one must obtain orbitals using PSIMRCC’s MCSCF module regardless of what; orbital type is chosen, twocon, rhf, or rohf. An example of the; MCSCF input is given below.; PSIMRCC is most commonly used for low-spin cases (singlets or open-shell; singlets). It is capable of performing computations on higher spin states; (e.g., triplets), but in general, not all the required matrix elements have; been coded for high-spin cases, meaning that results will correspond to an; approximate Mk-MRCC computation for high-spin cases. A Simple Example¶; The CORR_WFN allows you to select one of three methods; Mk-MRPT2 [PT2], Mk-MRCCSD [CCSD], or Mk-MRCCSD(T) [CCSD_T].; The CORR_MULTP option allows you to select the Slater; determinants with a particular \(M_s\) value. The WFN_SYM; keyword is neccesary if you do not want to compute the energy of the; totally-symmetric state. The FOLLOW_ROOT option may be used; to follow different roots of the effective Hamiltonian. A value of 1; instructs PSIMRCC to follow the solution with the lowest energy given; a certain set of determinants.; molecule o2 {; 0 3; O; O 1 2.265122720724; units au; }; set {; basis cc-pvtz; }; set mcscf {; reference rohf; docc [3,0,0,0,0,2,1,1] # Doubly occupied MOs; socc [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] # Singly occupied MOs; }; set ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/psimrcc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/psimrcc.html

However, unless you’re assured of having only one job running on a node at; a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with ~/.psi4rc have similar memory; capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a; per-calculation basis.; That same command can be used for PsiAPI mode:; psi4.set_memory(int(5e8)). Note; For parallel jobs, the memory keyword represents the total memory; available to the job, not the memory per thread. Molecule and Geometry Specification¶.

To add EFP fragments to a molecule, see Molecule Specification. Job Control Keywords¶; PSI4 comprises a number of C++ modules that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/psithoninput.html

Note that these values; should be of correct type, strings for strings, floats for floats like; convergences. The function ~psi4.core.clean_options that reinitializes; all options may also be useful to separate calculations in a PsiAPI; session.; psi4.set_options({; 'scf_type': 'pk',; 'e_convergence': 1.e-5,; 'soscf': True,; 'optking__geom_maxiter': 50; }).

However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed. See scf4 for analogous Z-matrix; and Cartiesian scans. Tables of Results¶; The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the Table() Psithon; function. For example, in the following potential energy surface scan for water; molecule h2o {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]; Avals=range(100,102,2). table=Table(rows=[""R"",""A""], cols=[""E(SCF)"",""E(SCS)"",""E(DFMP2)""]). set basis cc-pvdz. for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('mp2'); escf = get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY'); edfmp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); escsmp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); table[R][A] = [escf, escsmp2, edfmp2]. print table; relative=table.copy(); relative.absolute_to_relative(); print relative. we first define a table (on line 10) with two row indices and three column; indices.

The relative energies are reported with; respect to the lowest value in each column. More examples of how to control the; formatting of the tables can be found in the sample input files provided; see; Appendix Test Suite and Sample Inputs for a complete listing. Python Wrappers¶; The Python foundations of the PSI4 driver and Psithon syntax permit; many commonly performed post-processing procedures to be integrated into; the PSI4 suite.; As seen in the neon dimer example from the tutorial section,; the nbody() wrapper provides automatic computation of; counterpoise-corrected interaction energies between two molecules. For; example,; energy('mp2', bsse_type='cp'). will compute the counterpoise-corrected density-fitted MP2 interaction energy; between two molecules.; PSI4 also provides the cbs() wrapper,; which automatically computes a complete-basis-set extrapolation (and; automatically sets up the computations with different basis sets required to; do the extrapolation). For example,:; # all equivalent. energy('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2) and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc-pVT",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/psithoninput.html

For example,:; database('mp2', 'S22', cp=1, benchmark='S22B'). will perform DF-MP2 counterpoise-corrected interaction energies; (cp=1) on all members of Hobza’s S22 database set of van der Waals; dimers, and then compare the results against the S22B benchmark energies.; Built-in databases include S22, A24, HTBH, HBC6, HSG, S22by5, S66, JSCH,; NCB31, S66by8, and NBC10, among others.; These wrapper functions are discussed separately in; Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation.

To add EFP fragments to a molecule, see Molecule Specification. Job Control Keywords¶; PSI4 comprises a number of C++ modules that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, viz.:; set {; docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]; }. List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening [ is; on the same line as the name of the keyword.; Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the set keyword. Omitting the module; name, or using the name global or globals will result in the keyword being; applied to all modules. For example, in the following input; molecule{; o; h 1 roh; h 1 roh 2 ahoh. roh = 0.957; ahoh = 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1; energy('ccsd'). the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print; level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs cou",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/psithoninput.html

Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, any of which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets = [""cc-pVDZ"", ""cc-pVTZ"", ""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of basis_sets is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed.

Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, PSI4 was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; PSI4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level PSI4 source directory and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all PSI4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the PSI4 code (which; are obtained from NIST CODATA 2014; are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that the user’s ~/.psi4rc values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).; The physical constants used within PSI4, which are automatically; made available within all PSI4 input files are in Physical Constants.; In Psithon input files, prepend physical constants with psi_ to; prevent clashes with user-defined variables (e.g., psi_h).

While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 GB of RAM is available; to PSI4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 GB. memory 2000 MB. memory 2000000 kB. Please note that memory can be specified both in IEC binary units (1 KiB = 1024 bytes) and SI units (1 kB = 1000 bytes). PSI4 recognizes and obeys both of them correctly. The units are not case sensitive (Kb and KB are equivalent to kB).; By default, PSI4 performs a “sanity check” when parsing Psithon input files, enforcing a minimum memory requirement of 250 MiB. While it is generally not recomennded to do so, expert users can bypass this check by directly setting the number of bytes availble to PSI4:; # setting available memory to 2 MB; set_memory_bytes(2000000). Please note that this memory setting only governs the maximal memory; usage of the major data structures, and actual total memory usage; is slightly higher. This is usually a negligible amount, except when; setting tiny memory allowances.; One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. ~/.psi4rc File). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 GB.; set_memory(2000000000). However, unless you’re assured of having only one job running on a node at; a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with ~/.psi4rc have similar memory; capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a; per-calculation basis.; That same command can be used for P",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/psithoninput.html

PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results; of each computation available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of; H2 and H atom:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol * (2*h_energy - h2_energy); print ""De=%f"" % D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command print_variables(). Note that PSI variables; are cleared at the start of each energy(), etc. in an input; file by clean_variables().; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables() command, the; last will include SCF TOTAL ENERGY but not; FCI TOTAL ENERGY.; The entire dictionary of PSI variables can be obtained through; get_variables().

Psithon: Structuring an Input File. Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, PSI4 was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; PSI4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level PSI4 source directory and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all PSI4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the PSI4 code (which; are obtained from NIST CODATA 2014; are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that the user’s ~/.psi4rc values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).; The physical constants used within PSI4, which are automatically; made available within all PSI4 input files are in Physical Constants.; In Psithon input files, prepend physical constants with psi_ to; prevent clashes with user-defined variables (e.g., psi_h).

The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY').

If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/psithonmol.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/psithonmol.html

Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the \(^2B_1\); state of water cation, we can specify; SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure.

In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice for symbol.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with \(D_{2h}\) symmetry in \(C_{2v}\), the; \(C_2\) axis can be chosen as either the \(x\), the \(y\), or the \(z\); these can; be specified by requesting the symmetry as c2vx, c2vy, or c2vz, respectively.; Likewise the c2x, c2y, c2z, c2hx, c2hy, and c2hz; labels are valid. For \(C_s\) symmetry the labels csx, csy, and; csz request the \(yz\), \(xz\), and \(xy\) planes be used as the mirror plane,; respectively. If no unique axis is specified, PSI4 will choose an appropriate; subgroup.; Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational; frequencies, might lower the symmetry of the molecule. When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the \(^2B_1\); state of water cation, we can specify; SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic.

PSI4. Psithon: Structuring an Input File; Molecule and Geometry Specification. Molecule and Geometry Specification¶. Coordinates¶; PSI4 has a very flexible input parser that allows the user to provide; geometries as Cartesian coordinates, Z-matrix variables, or a combination of; both. The use of fixed values and variables are supported for both. For; example, the geometry for H2 can be specified a number of ways, using the; molecule optional_molecule_name {...} block.; molecule {; H; H 1 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H; H 1 r; r = 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H1; H2 H1 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 -r; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.45; }. Blank lines are ignored and, unlike regular Python syntax, indentation within; the molecule block does not matter, although the molecule keyword itself must; be aligned within the input according to standard Python syntax.

Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }.

Multiple Molecules¶; To facilitate more elaborate computations, it is possible to provide a name for; each molecule and tell PSI4 which one should be used in a given; calculation. For example, consider the following input file:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; energy('scf') # on H2. clean(). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; energy('scf') # on H.

The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, PSI4 can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem] database.; For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; PSI4 to search PubChem for a starting structure. The search is actually; performed for compounds whose name contains “benzene”, so multiple; entries will be returned. If the name provided (“benzene” in the above; example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used. If no; exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier; (CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more; specific name. For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a; compound whose name(s) contain “benzene”, but we’re not sure of the exact IUPAC; name, the following input can be used:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene*; }. Appending the “*” prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time; of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file:; Chemical ID IUPAC Name; 241 benzene; 7371 benzenesulfonic acid; 91526 benzenesulfonate; 244 phenylmethanol; 727 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane; 240 benzaldehyde; 65723 benzenesulfonohydrazide; 74296 N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide; 289 benzene-1,2-diol; 243 benzoic acid; 7370 ben",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/psithonmol.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/psithonmol.html

Note that some of these results do not contain the string “benzene”; these; compounds have synonyms containing that text. We can now replace the; “benzene*” in the input file with one of the above compounds using either the; IUPAC name or the CID provided in the list, viz:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:637563; }. or; molecule benzene {; pubchem:1-methoxy-4-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]benzene; }. Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, PSI4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjunction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group.

In this case, the charge and multiplicity of each interacting fragment is; explicitly specified. If the charge and multiplicity are specified for the; first fragment, it is assumed to be the same for all fragments. When; considering interacting fragments, the overall charge is simply the sum of all; fragment charges, and any unpaired electrons are assumed to be coupled to; yield the highest possible \(M_s\) value.; Having defined a molecule containing fragments like eneyne above, it; is a simple matter to perform calculations on only a subset of the; fragments. For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene; fragment alone (extract_subsets(1) pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms; and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the; ethyne fragment ghosted (extract_subsets(1,2) pulls out fragment 1 as; Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. extract_subsets(2,[1,3]):; mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'). clean(). mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf').

UnitsBy default, Ångström units are used; this is changed by adding; a line that reads units spec, where spec is one; of ang, angstrom, a.u., au, or bohr. OrientationCertain computations require that the molecule is not reoriented. This; can be achieved by adding either no_reorient or noreorient.; To prevent even recentering of the molecule, add no_com or nocom. PubChemA line reading pubchem:mol fetches the geometry for molecule; mol from the PubChem database, where mol is either; the IUPAC molecule name or the CID number. See PubChem Database for; details. SymmetryThe symmetry can be specified by a line reading symmetry; symbol, where symbol is the Schönflies symbol; of the (Abelian) point group to use for the computation, one of one of; c1, c2, ci, cs, d2, c2h, c2v, or d2h.; This need not be specified, as the molecular symmetry is automatically; detected by PSI4.

Multiple Molecules¶; To facilitate more elaborate computations, it is possible to provide a name for; each molecule and tell PSI4 which one should be used in a given; calculation. For example, consider the following input file:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; energy('scf') # on H2. clean(). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; energy('scf') # on H. Here, two separate jobs are performed on two different molecules; the first is; performed on H2, while the second is for H atom. The last molecule to be; specified is the “active” molecule by default. To explicitly activate a named; molecule, the activate command is provided.

For example, water (\(C_{2v}\) symmetry) has three doubly occupied \(A_1\); orbitals, as well as one each of \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) symmetry; the; corresponding DOCC array is therefore:; DOCC = [3, 0, 1, 1]. Although PSI4 will detect the symmetry automatically, and use the largest; possible Abelian subgroup, the user might want to run in a lower point group.; To do this the molecule keyword symmetry symbol can be used; (see Molecule Keywords). In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice for symbol.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with \(D_{2h}\) symmetry in \(C_{2v}\), the; \(C_2\) axis can be chosen as either the \(x\), the \(y\), or the \(z\); these can; be specified by requesting the symmetry as c2vx, c2vy, or c2vz, respectively.; Likewise the c2x, c2y, c2z, c2hx, c2hy, and c2hz; labels are valid.

Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods.

The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure.

In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. \[H=F_A+W_A+F_B+W_B+V\]; Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, \(F\), the fluctuation potential of each monomer, \(W\), and the; interaction potential, \(V\). The monomer Fock operators, \(F_A+F_B\), are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of \(V\), \(W_A\), and \(W_B\).; Through first-order in \(V\), electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in \(V\).

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions.

Finally, it will print a summary of the; charge-transfer results:; SAPT Charge Transfer Analysis; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; SAPT Induction (Dimer Basis) -2.0970 [mEh] -1.3159 [kcal/mol] -5.5057 [kJ/mol]; SAPT Induction (Monomer Basis) -1.1396 [mEh] -0.7151 [kcal/mol] -2.9920 [kJ/mol]; SAPT Charge Transfer -0.9574 [mEh] -0.6008 [kcal/mol] -2.5137 [kJ/mol].

It is also possible to run a closed-shell SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set. Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example; molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation. Note that an error will be thrown if each atom in the; third monomer is not a ghost to prevent confusion with three-body SAPT which is; not currently supported by Psi4. Interpreting SAPT Results¶; We will examine the results of a SAPT2+3/aug-cc-pVDZ computation on the; water dimer. This computation can be performed with the following; input:; molecule water_dimer {; 0 1; O -1.551007 -0.114520 0.000000; H -1.934259 0.762503 0.000000; H -0.599677 0.040712 0.000000; --; 0 1; O 1.350625 0.111469 0.000000; H 1.680398 -0.373741 -0.758561; H 1.680398 -0.373741 0.758561; units angstrom; }. set globals {; basis aug-cc-pvdz; guess sad; scf_type df; }. set sapt {; print 1; nat_orbs_t2 true; freeze_core true; }. energy('sapt2+3'). To reiterate some of the options mentioned above: the; NAT_ORBS_T2 option will compute MP2 natural orbitals and use; them in the evaluation of the triples correction to dispersion, and the; FREEZE_CORE option will freeze the core throughout the SAPT; computation.

To compensate these deviations, Parker et al.

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions. Publications resulting from the use of the SAPT0 code; should cite the following publications: [Hohenstein:2010:184111] and; [Hohenstein:2011:174107]. If the open-shell SAPT0 code is used,; [Gonthier:2016:134106] should be additionally cited. Basic SAPT0 Keywords¶. SAPT_LEVEL¶. The level of theory for SAPT.

The factorization of the SAPT energy; expressions, as implemented in PSI4, assumes the use of density-fitted; two-electron integrals, therefore, the closed-shell SAPT module cannot be run with; exact integrals. In practice, we have found that the density-fitting; approximation introduces negligible errors into the SAPT energy; (often less than 0.01 kcal/mol for small dimers) and greatly; improves efficiency.; The latest addition to the SAPT code is the SAPT0 method for open-shell; monomers [Gonthier:2016:134106]. This code is available for both exact and density fitted integrals,; except for the dispersion terms which implementation relies on a density fitting; factorization. Both UHF and ROHF REFERENCE can be used, but coupled; induction computations are currently not supported with ROHF. This means that orbital; relaxation is not included for ROHF and the uncoupled induction term is computed instead.; If both monomers are open-shell, their coupling is assumed to be high spin, i.e.; two doublets would interact to form a triplet. The S2 approximation and scaling¶; All exchange terms in SAPT arise from the antisymmetrization; of the wavefunctions of monomers A and B. Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the \(S^{2}\); approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron; pair between monomers.; The \(S^{2}\) approximation is usually pretty good, but may; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate these deviations, Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommend to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; where the recommended exponent is \(\alpha = 1\).

SAPT(DFT)¶; In general, SAPT(DFT) should provide more accurate interaction energy; components, and overall interaction energies, than SAPT0.

Like higher-order SAPT, SAPT(DFT) requires; sufficient memory to hold \(2ovN_aux\) doubles.; SAPT(DFT) requires a few special treatments to obtain accurate; result. The DFT functionals used in SAPT(DFT) need to be asymptotically; corrected with Gradient Regulated Asymptotic Correction scheme (GRAC),; in order to recover the correct long-range asymptotic behavior; (approaching \(-1/r\) as \(r\) approaches infinity). The program; requires manual input of GRAC shift parameter for each monomer through; keywords SAPT_DFT_GRAC_SHIFT_A and SAPT_DFT_GRAC_SHIFT_B,; which should be equal to the difference of the actual ionization; potential and the corresponding Kohn-Sham HOMO energy.

Higher-Order SAPT¶; For smaller systems (up to the size of a nucleic acid base pair), more; accurate interaction energies can be obtained through higher-order SAPT; computations. The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies for closed-shell systems; only. Publications resulting from the use of the higher-order SAPT code; should cite the following:; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].; For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106], whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors.

Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example; molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation.

A final note is that both Disp22(T); and Est.Disp22(T) results appear if MP2 natural orbitals are; used to evaluate the triples correction to dispersion. The Disp22(T); result is the triples correction as computed in the truncated NO basis;; Est.Disp22(T) is a scaled result that attempts to recover; the effect of the truncated virtual space and is our best estimate.

In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. \[H=F_A+W_A+F_B+W_B+V\]; Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, \(F\), the fluctuation potential of each monomer, \(W\), and the; interaction potential, \(V\). The monomer Fock operators, \(F_A+F_B\), are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of \(V\), \(W_A\), and \(W_B\).; Through first-order in \(V\), electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in \(V\). For; a complete description of SAPT, the reader is referred to the excellent; review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz [Jeziorski:1994:1887].; Several truncations of the closed-shell SAPT expansion are available in the SAPT; module of PSI4.

The S2 approximation and scaling¶; All exchange terms in SAPT arise from the antisymmetrization; of the wavefunctions of monomers A and B. Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the \(S^{2}\); approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron; pair between monomers.; The \(S^{2}\) approximation is usually pretty good, but may; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate these deviations, Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommend to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; where the recommended exponent is \(\alpha = 1\). To obtain SAPT energies with this scaling,; simply set the keyword exch_scale_alpha true. Alternatively, another value for \(\alpha\); can be specified by setting EXCH_SCALE_ALPHA to a value. For example,; set exch_scale_alpha 1.0. will set \(\alpha = 1.0\) and scale exchange energies with \(p_{EX}(1.0)\).; Instead of this straightforward scaling, SAPT0 energies benefit from a slightly modified; recipe that involves an empirically adjusted exponent \(\alpha = 3.0\).; To distinguish it from its unscaled counterpart, this energy is denoted sSAPT0 (see [Parker:2014:094106]).

Thanks to; natural orbital methods [Parrish:2013:174102], the SAPT code; is able to include CCD dispersion with only a modest additional cost.; Computations employing CCD dispersion should cite [Parrish:2013:174102].; To request CCD dispersion treatment in a SAPT computation, simply append; (ccd) to the name of the method, as in the following examples; energy('sapt2+(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)').

These results are for the water dimer geometry shown above computed with; SAPT0/aug-cc-pVDZ. Monomer-Centered Basis Computations¶; The charge-transfer analysis above is carried out by taking the; difference between SAPT induction as calculated in the dimer-centered; basis (i.e., each monomer sees the basis functions on both monomers); vs. the monomer-centered basis (i.e., each monomer utilizes only its; own basis set). It is also possible to run a closed-shell SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set. Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation.

Initial Guess¶; In each step of the SCF procedure, a new Fock or Kohn–Sham potential is built; according to the previous density, following which the potential is diagonalized; to produce new molecular orbitals, from which a new density is computed. This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. COREDiagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems. READ becomes the default for the second and later iterations; of geometry optimizations. SAD [Default]Superposition of Atomic Densities. Builds the initial density as the; spin-averaged sum of atomic UHF computations in the current basis. If an; open-shell system, uniform scaling of the spin-averaged density matrices is; performed. If orbitals are needed (e.g., in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems. SADNONatural orbitals from Superposition of Atomic Densities.

The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations \(N,N+2,\ldots\), invoking; MOM_START N can often rescue the convergence of the SCF. MOM can; be used in concert with DIIS, though care should be taken to not turn MOM on; until the oscillatory behavior begins. Damping [Off by Default]In some cases, a static mixing of Fock Matrices from adjacent; iterations can quench oscillations. This mixing, known as; “damping” can be activated by setting the; DAMPING_PERCENTAGE keyword to a nonzero percent. Damping is; turned off when the DIIS error is smaller than; DAMPING_CONVERGENCE. Level shifting [Off by default]A commonly used alternative to damping is to use level shifting,; which decreases the mixing of occupied and unoccupied orbitals in; the SCF update by moving the unoccupied orbitals up in energy. It; can be shown that the SCF procedure always converges with a; suitably large level shift; however, the larger the shift is, the; slower the convergence becomes, and the calculation may end up; converging onto a higher lying SCF solution. Because of this, in; practice level shifting is most useful in the initial phase of the; calculation to reduce the orbital error enough for DIIS to work; well. The level shift is controlled by the parameter; LEVEL_SHIFT, and it is turned off when the DIIS error is; smaller than LEVEL_SHIFT_CUTOFF. Reasonable values for; the shift and convergence threshold are 5.0 and 1e-2,; respectively. SOSCF [Off by Default]See Second-order Convergence.

The accuracy of the Cholesky; decomposition is controlled by the keyword CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE.; This algorithm is similar to the DF algorithm, but it is not suitable; for gradient computations. The algorithm to obtain the Cholesky; vectors is not designed for computations with thousands of basis; functions. COSXAn algorithm based on the semi-numerical “chain of spheres exchange” (COSX); approach described in [Neese:2009:98]. The coulomb term is computed with a; direct density-fitting algorithm. The COSX algorithm uses no I/O, scales; well with system size, and requires minimal memory, making it ideal for; large systems and multi-core CPUs. See the COSX section below for more information. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen.

At; this point, the code switches on the requested Direct integrals technology, which; requires only four full iterations to reach convergence, starting from the DF; guess. This hybrid DF/Direct procedure can significantly accelerate SCF; computations requiring exact integrals.; After the iterations are completed, a number of one-electron properties are; printed, and some bookkeeping is performed to set up possible correlated; computations. Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; PRINT option. Also printed are the occupied and virtual orbital energies,; which are useful in elucidating the stability and reactivity of the system. Theory¶; The objective of Hartree–Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) \(\{\psi_i\}\),. \[\psi_i(\vec x_1) = C_{\mu i} \phi_{\mu} (\vec x_1).\]; Here, \(\{\phi_{\mu}\}\) are the basis functions, which, in PSI4 are; contracted Cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs). The matrix \(C_{\mu i}\) contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree–Fock. The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. \[\begin{split}| \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |\end{split}\]; This form for the Hartree–Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; \(\mathbb{R}^6\) instead of a more complicated effect in; \(\mathbb{R}^N\).; Considering the electronic Hamiltonian,. \[\hat H = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html

Because of this, SCF is a nonlinear procedure, which; terminates when the generating orbitals are self-consistent with the Fock matrix; they generate.; The formation of the Coulomb matrix \(J\) and the exchange matrix; \(K^{\alpha}\) dominate the computational effort of the SCF procedure. For; very large systems, diagonalization of the Fock matrix can also present a; significant hurdle.

As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:04224].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; option S_TOLERANCE, which defaults to 1E-7.

SAPSuperposition of Atomic Potentials. This is essentially a; modification of the core Hamiltonian, which includes screening; effects by using a radially screened effective atomic charge. The; screening effects have been calculated at the complete basis set; limit with finite-element calculations, see [Lehtola:2019:25945]; and [Lehtola:2020:012516]. The guess and its implementation have; been described in [Lehtola:2019:1593]. The guess is evaluated on a; DFT quadrature grid, so the guess energy depends slightly on the; used DFT quadrature. The current implementation is based on; exchange-only local density calculations that are but nanohartree; away from the complete basis set limit [Lehtola:2020:012516]. These are all set by the GUESS keyword. Also, an automatic Python; procedure has been developed for converging the SCF in a small basis, and then; casting up to the true basis. This can be done by adding; BASIS_GUESS = SMALL_BASIS to the options list. We recommend the; 3-21G or pcseg-0 basis for the small basis due to its efficient mix of flexibility and; compactness.

In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword “DF”; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; PSI4‘s internal routines. Expert users can manually switch between MEM_DF and; DISK_DF; however, they may find documented exceptions during use as several; post SCF algorithms require a specific implementation.; For some of these algorithms, Schwarz and/or density sieving can be used to; identify negligible integral contributions in extended systems.

This keyword is; used to determine the radial extent of the each basis shell, and it is the; COSX analogue to DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE.; The COSX_INCFOCK keyword (defaults to true) increases performance; by constructing the Fock matrix from differences in the density matrix, which; are more amenable to screening.

LinK Exchange¶. Warning; The LinK code is currently under development and should not be used. Large SCF calculations can benefit from specialized screening procedures that further reduce the scaling of the ERI contribution to the Fock matrix.; LinK, the linear-scaling exchange method described in [Ochsenfeld:1998:1663], is available with the direct SCF algorithm (SCF_TYPE set to DIRECT).; LinK achieves linear-scaling by exploiting shell pair sparsity in the density matrix and overlap sparsity between shell pairs.; This method is most competitive when used with non-diffuse orbital basis sets, since orbital and density overlaps decay slower with diffuse functions.; LinK is especially powerful when combined with density-matrix based ERI screening (set SCREENING to DENSITY) and incremental Fock builds (set INCFOCK to TRUE), which decrease the number of significant two-electron integrals to calculate.; NOTE",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used.; This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:04224].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; option",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html

Convergence Stabilization¶; A summary of Psi’s supported convergence stabilization techniques is presented below:. DIIS [On by Default]DIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock matrix together; with an error criterion based on the orbital gradient to produce an informed; estimate of the next Fock Matrix. DIIS is almost always necessary to converge; the SCF procedure and is therefore turned on by default. In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via options. ADIIS [On by Default]ADIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock and density matrices to produce an; informed estimate of the next Fock matrix. ADIIS estimates are based on minimizing; an energy estimate rather than zeroing the residual, so this performs best in the early; iterations. By default, Psi will start using ADIIS before blending the ADIIS step with; the DIIS step, eventually using the pure DIIS step. The closely-related EDIIS procedure; may be used instead by setting SCF_INITIAL_ACCELERATOR. This is formally identical; to ADIIS for HF, but the methods will differ for more general DFT. MOM [Off by Default]MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations.

This is typically visible in the output as a non-converging; SCF which eventually settles down to steady oscillation between two (or more); different total energies. This behavior can be ameliorated by choosing occupied; orbitals by “shape” instead of by orbital eigenvalue, i.e., by choosing the set; of new orbitals which looks most like some previously known “good” set. The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations \(N,N+2,\ldots\), invoking; MOM_START N can often rescue the convergence of",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html

ERI Algorithms¶; The key difficulty in the SCF procedure is treatment of the four-index ERI; contributions to the Fock Matrix. A number of algorithms are available in; PSI4 for these terms. The algorithm is selected by the SCF_TYPE; keyword, which may be one of the following. PK [Default]An out-of-core, presorted algorithm using exact ERIs. Quite fast for a; zero-error algorithm if enough memory is available. Integrals are; generated only once, and symmetry is utilized to reduce number of; integrals. OUT_OF_COREAn out-of-core, unsorted algorithm using exact ERIs. Overcomes the; memory bottleneck of the current PK algorithm.

This algorithm is brand new, but seems to be reasonably fast; up to 1500 basis functions, uses zero disk (if DF pre-iterations are; turned off), and can obtain significant; speedups with negligible error loss if INTS_TOLERANCE; is set to 1.0E-8 or so. DF [Default]A density-fitted algorithm designed for computations with thousands of; basis functions. This algorithm is highly optimized, and is threaded; with a mixture of parallel BLAS and OpenMP. Note that this algorithm; should use the -JKFIT series of auxiliary bases, not the -RI or; -MP2FIT bases.

Second-order Convergence¶; Second-order convergence takes into account both the gradient and Hessian to; take a full Newton step with respect to the orbital parameters. This results in; quadratic convergence with respect to density for SCF methods. For cases where; normal acceleration methods either fail or take many iterations to converge,; second-order can reduce the total time to solution.; Solving second-order (SO) methods exactly would require an inversion of the; orbital Hessian (an expensive \(\mathbb{N}^6\) operation); however, these; ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html

If one or more constraints have to be relaxed to reach; a lower-energy solution, there is an external instability. In PSI4, the only external instability; that can be checked at present is the RHF \(\rightarrow\) UHF one.; Currently, two algorithms exist in PSI4 for stability analysis: the original; Direct Inversion and the newly implemented Davidson algorithms. We will first describe; options common to both algorithms. To request a stability analysis at the end of the SCF,; set the keyword STABILITY_ANALYSIS. Value CHECK only computes the electronic; Hessian eigenvalue and checks if an actual SCF minimum has been found, while value FOLLOW; rotates the converged orbitals along the lowest eigenvector, then invokes the SCF; procedure again to lower the energy. In case the minimization does not succeed; or ends up on the same unstable solution, you can tune the scale factor for the orbital; rotation through the keyword FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE.; The rotation angle is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\mbox{ } \cdot\) (FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE). The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess, and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS;; the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS. Note; Setting the option STABILITY_ANALYSIS to FOLLOW is only avalible for UHF. When using; RHF and ROHF instabilities can be checked, but not followed. If you want to attempt to find a lower energy solution; you should re-run the calculation with REFERENCE set to UHF. The main algorithm available in PSI4 is the Direct Inversion algorithm.

Warning; Prior to May 2022, v1.6, Psi4 used a built-in ECP code. Analytic derivatives of ECPs were not available. The HF and DFT derivatives were implemented in a semi-numerical scheme, where numerical ECP gradients were added to analytic SCF gradients. For post-SCF methods, the entire gradient computation needed to be run as finite difference of energies. Warning; As of May 2022, v1.6, Psi4 uses the LibECPInt library, and analytic derivatives and Hessians of ECPs are available. Analytic derivatives of molecular systems including ECPs should be available whenever the method has analytic derivatives, but these have so far only been verified for HF and DFT. Warning; ECPs have not been tested with projected basis set guesses or with FI-SAPT calculations. If you require this functionality, please contact the developers on GitHub and/or the forum. External potentials and QM/MM¶; In addition to the implementation of EFP for accurate QM/MM; computations, PSI4 can perform more rudimentary QM/MM procedures via the; EXTERN keyword.

Restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) [Default]Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical. Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF)Appropriate for most open-shell systems and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the \(\hat S^2\) operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to a; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem. Restricted Open-Shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF)Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical). Constrained Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (CUHF)A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used.; This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:04224].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; option",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html

If the smallest; eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical orthogonalization is; forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues below the; cutoff are eliminated.; If the eigendecomposition is detected to be numerically unstable - the; reciprocal condition number of the overlap matrix to be smaller than; the machine epsilon - the partial Cholesky decomposition is undertaken; until S_CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE, which defaults to 1E-8.; Use of symmetric, canonical, and partial Cholesky orthogonalization; can be forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to; SYMMETRIC, CANONICAL, or PARTIALCHOLESKY,; respectively.; Note that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within; each irrep from the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as; Unique Symmetry Orbitals (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization,; this implies that the number of MOs and OSOs per irrep may be slightly; smaller than the number of USOs per irrep.; A contrived example demonstrating OSOs/MOs vs. AOs with symmetry is shown; below:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c2 # Two irreps is easier to comprehend; }. set {; s_tolerance 0.0001 # Set an unreasonably tight; # tolerance to force canonical; basis aug-cc-pv5z # This diffuse basis will have; # small-ish eigenvalues for even H2O",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html

The accuracy of the Cholesky; decomposition is controlled by the keyword CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE.; This algorithm is similar to the DF algorithm, but it is not suitable; for gradient computations. The algorithm to obtain the Cholesky; vectors is not designed for computations with thousands of basis; functions. COSXAn algorithm based on the semi-numerical “chain of spheres exchange” (COSX); approach described in [Neese:2009:98]. The coulomb term is computed with a; direct density-fitting algorithm. The COSX algorithm uses no I/O, scales; well with system size, and requires minimal memory, making it ideal for; large systems and multi-core CPUs. See the COSX section below for more information. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword “DF”; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; PSI4‘s internal routines.

To turn on this option, set INCFOCK to true.; We have added the automatic capability to use the extremely fast DF; code for intermediate convergence of the orbitals, for SCF_TYPE; DIRECT. At the moment, the code defaults to cc-pVDZ-JKFIT as the; auxiliary basis, unless the user specifies DF_BASIS_SCF manually.

COSX Exchange¶; The semi-numerical COSX algorithm described in [Neese:2009:98] evaluates; two-electron ERIs analytically over one electron coordinate and numerically; over the other electron coordinate, and belongs to the family of pseudospectral; methods originally suggested by Friesner. In COSX, numerical integration is performed on standard; DFT quadrature grids, which are described in DFT: Density Functional Theory.; Both the accuracy of the COSX algorithm and also the computational; cost are directly determined by the size of the integration grid, so selection; of the grid is important. This COSX implementation uses two separate grids.; The SCF algorithm is first converged on a smaller grid, followed by a final SCF; iteration on a larger grid. This results in numerical errors comparable to; performing the entire SCF on the expensive larger grid at a computational cost; much closer to the smal",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html

The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess, and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS;; the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS. Note; Setting the option STABILITY_ANALYSIS to FOLLOW is only avalible for UHF. When using; RHF and ROHF instabilities can be checked, but not followed. If you want to attempt to find a lower energy solution; you should re-run the calculation with REFERENCE set to UHF. The main algorithm available in PSI4 is the Direct Inversion algorithm. It can only; work with SCF_TYPE PK, and it explicitly builds the full electronic Hessian; matrix before explicitly inverting it. As such, this algorithm is very slow and it should; be avoided whenever possible. Direct Inversion is automatically invoked if the newer algorithm; is not available.; The Davidson algorithm for stability analysis was implemented recently.; Only the lowest eigenvalues of the electronic Hessian are computed, and Hessian-vector; products are computed instead of the full Hessian. This algorithm is thus; much more efficient than the Direct Inversion, but at present, it is only available for UHF \(\rightarrow\) UHF stability; analysis. The capabilities of both algorithms are summarized below:. Stability analysis methods available in PSI4¶. Algorithm; REFERENCE; Stability checked; STABILITY_ANALYSIS; SCF_TYPE.

SOLVER_MAXITER: maximum number of iterations; SOLVER_CONVERGENCE: eigenvector convergence threshold; SOLVER_N_ROOT: Solve for N eigenvectors in each irreducible representation; SOLVER_N_GUESS: Use N guess vectors, this needs to be larger than the number of roots so that the lowest ones can be captured reliably. Default within this context: 3; SOLVER_MIN_SUBSPACE: Minimum size of the subspace when collapsing.; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE: Maximum size of the subspace. Default within this context: 12. In case convergence problems are encountered during the Davidson procedure,; it is recommended to first increase SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE, especially if you solve; for a large number of roots. This will result in a higher computational cost of each iteration, but should; make the solver better behaved. However, note that SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE should never be larger than; the full subspace minus the number of desired roots to avoid adding artificial zero eigenvalues.; This may happen in minimal basis sets, especially with symmetry, but the code automatically adjusts; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE if it is too large.; If the solver seems to converge on the wrong eigenvalue, try increasing SOLVER_N_GUESS.; Otherwise, if the solver is almost converged but reaches the maximum number of iterations, try increasing; SOLVER_MAXITER.

Theory¶; The objective of Hartree–Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) \(\{\psi_i\}\),. \[\psi_i(\vec x_1) = C_{\mu i} \phi_{\mu} (\vec x_1).\]; Here, \(\{\phi_{\mu}\}\) are the basis functions, which, in PSI4 are; contracted Cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs). The matrix \(C_{\mu i}\) contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree–Fock. The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. \[\begin{split}| \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |\end{split}\]; This form for the Hartree–Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; \(\mathbb{R}^6\) instead of a more complicated effect in; \(\mathbb{R}^N\).; Considering the electronic Hamiltonian,. \[\hat H = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \sum_{i} \sum_{A} -; \frac{Z_A}{r_{iA}} + \sum_{i>j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}},\]; the Hartree–Fock energy is, by Slater’s rules,. \[E_{\mathrm{HF}} =; \langle \Psi_0 | \hat H | \Psi_0 \rangle; = \sum_{i} \langle i | \hat h | i \rangle; + \frac 1 2 \sum_{i,j} [ii|jj] - [ij",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/scf.html

Recommendations¶; The SCF code is quite flexible and powerful.; We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your orbital basis/atom type.

First, an initial CISD computation is run to get the natural orbitals; this allows a meaningful partitioning of the virtual orbitals into groups of different importance. Next, the RASCI is run. The split-virtual CISD[TQ] takes all singles and doubles, and all triples and quadruples with no more than 2 electrons in the secondary virtual subspace (RAS 3). If any electrons are present in the tertiary virtual subspace (RAS 4), then that excitation is only allowed if it is a single or double. props3; DF-SCF cc-pVDZ multipole moments of benzene, up to 7th order and electrostatic potentials evaluated at the nuclear coordinates. cc17; Single point energies of multiple excited states with EOM-CCSD. omp2-1; OMP2 cc-pVDZ energy for the H2O molecule. pywrap-db2; Database calculation, run in sow/reap mode. cisd-opt-fd; H2O CISD/6-31G** Optimize Geometry by Energies. olccd-freq1; OLCCD cc-pVDZ freqs for C2H2. sapt9; usapt example with empty beta. dfmp2-grad4; DF-MP2 cc-pVDZ gradient for the NO molecule. lccd-grad1; LCCD cc-pVDZ gradient for the H2O molecule. psimrcc-fd-freq2; Mk-MRCCSD frequencies. \(^1A_1\) O$_3` state described using the Ms = 0 component of the singlet.

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/thermo.html:3557,Deployability,update,updated,3557,"325. ROTATIONAL_SYMMETRY_NUMBER¶. Rotational symmetry number for thermodynamic analysis. Default is set from the full point group (e.g., Td for methane) as opposed to the computational point group (e.g., C2v for methane). Default takes into account symmetry reduction through asymmetric isotopic substitution and is unaffected by user-set symmetry on molecule, so this option is the sole way to influence the symmetry-dependent aspects of the thermodynamic analysis.

Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #! Optimize H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'). This should perform a series of gradient computations. The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation and grep-able with ~), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; Step Total Energy Delta E MAX Force RMS Force MAX Disp RMS Disp ~; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; 1 -76.026632734857 -76.026632734857 0.01523505 0.01245744 0.02742199 0.02277500 ~; 2 -76.027022668419 -0.000389933562 0.00178749 0.00142923 0.01007985 0.00594840 ~; 3 -76.027032729361 -0.000010060942 0.00014016 0.00008485 0.00077279 0",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/tutorial.html

However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True, dertype=1). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements. From this, it can obtain the harmonic vibrational; frequencies, given below (roundoff errors of around 0.1 cm-1; may exist):; Irrep Harmonic Frequency; (cm-1); -----------------------------------------------; A1 1775.6480; A1 4113.3794; B2 4212.1826; -----------------------------------------------.

Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = energy('ccsd(t)', bsse_type='cp'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index.

Note; Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with PSI4. In; Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language; (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then; submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into; pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure; Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind; the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any “.in” or “.dat” extension by “.out”). Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples. A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory.

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!.

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge. At; the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the; perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.; Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical; understanding about the interaction between the two monomers. Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy with Psithon¶; Finally, let’s consider an example that shows how the Python driver; in PSI4 simplifies some routine tasks. PSI4 can interpret; valid Python code in addition to the computational chemistry directives; we’ve seen in the previous examples; we call this mixture Psithon.; The Python computer language is very easy to pick up, and even users; previously unfamiliar with Python can use it to simplify tasks by; modifying some of the example input files supplied with PSI4; in the psi4/samples directory.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as; computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various; interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; L",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/tutorial.html

Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #! Sample UHF/6-31G** CH2 computation. molecule ch2 {; 0 3; C ; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A. R = 1.075; A = 133.93; }. set basis 6-31G**; set reference uhf; energy ('scf').

If it works, it should print; the final energy as; @UHF Final Energy: -38.92533462456894. Notice we added a new keyword, set reference uhf, to the input. For; open-shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree–Fock, or UHF), or restricted orbitals (restricted; open-shell Hartree–Fock, or ROHF).

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics; analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation.; You can see this in the next section of the output file. The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = energy('ccsd(t)', bsse_type='cp'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index. Note we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. The built-in; Psithon function nbody() does it all for us, automatically.; Near the very end of the output file, the counterpoise correction Python; function will print a nice summary of the results of the counterpoise; computation (the energies of the dimer, of monomer 1 with the ghost functions; of monomer 2, of monomer 2 with the ghost functions of monomer 1, and the; overall counterpoise-corrected interaction energy):; N-Body: Computing complex (1/2) with fragments (2,) in the basis of fragments (1, 2).; ...; N-Body: Complex Energy (fragments = (2,), basis = (1, 2): -128.70932405488924); ...; N-Body: Computing complex (2/2) with fragments (1,",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/tutorial.html

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }. Here’s the second half of the input, where we specify the computation; options:; set {; basis jun-cc-pVDZ; scf_type DF; freeze_core True; }. energy('sapt0'). Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array.

This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any “.in” or “.dat” extension by “.out”). Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples. A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory. Running a Basic Hartree–Fock Calculation¶; In our first example, we will consider a Hartree–Fock SCF computation; for the water molecule using a cc-pVDZ basis set. We will specify the; geometry of our water molecule using a standard Z-matrix.; # Any line starting with the # character is a comment line; #!

Any user options need to; be set before the procedure they are meant to affect. For your convenience, the above example can be found in; tu1-h2o-energy.; You can run it if you wish.; Once PSI4 is in your path (see the; User Configuration; section of the installation instructions), you can run this computation by typing; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat. If everything goes well, the computation should complete and should report; a final restricted Hartree–Fock energy in a section like this:; Energy converged. @RHF Final Energy: -76.02663273410671. By default, the energy should be converged to about \(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\), so agreement; is only expected for about the first 6 digits after the decimal. If the; computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the; compilation or installation of the program (see the installation; instructions in Sec. Compiling and Installing from Source).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3).

If it works, it should print; the final energy as; @UHF Final Energy: -38.92533462456894. Notice we added a new keyword, set reference uhf, to the input. For; open-shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree–Fock, or UHF), or restricted orbitals (restricted; open-shell Hartree–Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

Since we’re using density fitting for the SAPT,; we might as well also use it for the Hartree–Fock computations that are; performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that with; scf_type DF.; Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that; pair with the primary basis set. Fortunately, PSI4 is usually smart; enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given; computation. In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set; (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set); that PSI4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT; auxiliary basis for the Hartree–Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set; for the SAPT procedure.; To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to; freeze the core electrons with freeze_core True.

Ground state energy terms like MP2 correlation energy, MP3 correlation energy,; MP2 total energy, MP3 total energy, current correlation energy and current energy.; MP2 dipole X and the other components: Ground state dipole moments at MP(2) level.; number of iterations: The number of iterations the iterative solver required to converge.; number of excited states: The number of excited states, which were computed.; More variables are summarized in PSI Variables by Alpha. The following attribute is set on returned wavefunctions:. adcc_state: The adcc.ExcitedStates; object used by adcc to store the ADC(n) excitation energies and all precomputed data; in the format used by adcc.; Provides direct access to analysis and plotting capabilities from adcc.; For example adcc_state.plot_spectrum() plots a broadened excited states spectrum; in matplotlib. See the adcc calculations documentation; for details. Tips for convergence issues.; If you encounter convergence issues inside adcc, the following parameters; are worth tweaking:. MAX_NUM_VECS: Specifies the maximal number of subspace vectors; in the Jacobi-Davidson scheme before a restart occurs. The defaults are usually; good, but do not be shy to increase this value if you encounter convergence problems.; NUM_GUESSES: By default adcc uses twice as many guess vectors as; states to be computed. Sometimes increasing this value by a few vectors can be helpful.; If you encounter a convergence to zero eigenvalues, than decreasing this parameter might; solve the problems. table of contents.

For a PSI4 user, tests provide models of inputs that should work; “as-is” and a searchable collection of syntax and capabilities.; The test suite also allows high-quality development snapshots of the; codebase to be built automatically for users.; For a user who has PSI4 as part of a complex computational molecular software environment, a test suite alongside installed PSI4 can be used to show that the PSI4 piece is working.; For a feature developer, adding tests provides confidence that you; can leave your code untouched and still advertise that the feature works; years later. With tests, proposed changes to PSI4 that break your; code fall upon the change proposer to fix, rather than being merged; silently and lying in wait for a concientious user to detect and report; and then likely falling upon you to fix.; For a general developer, the test suite allows confidence in refactoring, switching out underlying libraries, maintenance, and upgrading.

Adding PSIthon Test Cases¶; To create a new test case, first make a folder in psi4/tests or, for an addon, a subfolder under the addon folder.; Use hyphens, not spaces or underscores, in the directory name.; Add the directory name to the list of tests in psi4/tests/CMakeLists.txt or, for an addon, tests/<addon>/CMakeLists.txt",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/add_tests.html

Of those small modifications, first, note the special comment at the top (starting with the #! comment marker). This should be descriptive since it is inlined into the manual (unless !nosample in the comment) as a sample input.; Reference values are often assigned to variables for later use.; The compare_values function (along with several relatives in psi4/psi4/driver/p4util/testing.py for comparing strings, matrices, etc.) checks that the computed values match these reference values to suitable precision. This function prints an error message and signals that the test failed to the make system, if the values don’t match. Any lines of the input associated with the validation process should be flagged with #TEST at the end of each line, so that they can be removed when copying from the tests to the samples directory. output.ref¶; When your test case is in final form, run it locally, rename the output to output.ref, and check it into the repository alongside input.dat.; While this isn’t used for any testing machinery, it can be handy for users or developers to consult. test_input.py¶; Starting March 2022, one can also run tests designed as above for CTest through pytest.; To bring the test to pytest’s notice, add a file to the directory named test_input.py.; Below is an example for the psi4/tests/ci-property/test_input.py; from addons import *. @ctest_labeler(""quick;ci;cas;properties;cart;noc1""); def test_ci_property():; ctest_runner(__file__, [""grid.dat""]).

Test Suite¶; A test suite plays a vital role in open-source software use and development. For a PSI4 user, tests provide models of inputs that should work; “as-is” and a searchable collection of syntax and capabilities.; The test suite also allows high-quality development snapshots of the; codebase to be built automatically for users.; For a user who has PSI4 as part of a complex computational molecular software environment, a test suite alongside installed PSI4 can be used to show that the PSI4 piece is working.; For a feature developer, adding tests provides confidence that you; can leave your code untouched and still advertise that the feature works; years later. With tests, proposed changes to PSI4 that break your; code fall upon the change proposer to fix, rather than being merged; silently and lying in wait for a concientious user to detect and report; and then likely falling upon you to fix.; For a general developer, the test suite allows confidence in refactoring, switching out underlying libraries, maintenance, and upgrading. CTest and pytest, PSIthon and PsiAPI¶; In designing a test, sometimes you want it to be a model input for the user in a single file or you don’t want a lot of psi4. or Python syntax cluttering the input.; In this case, follow Adding PSIthon Test Cases to prepare as PSIthon (psi4 input.dat) for, roughly speaking, running through ctest.; The PSIthon/CTest test suite occupies the whole of psi4/tests except psi4/tests/pytests.; At other times you want the test to check several variations of a template job or you want to test error handling or you want to focus on PsiAPI rather than PSIthon or you want to control the compute conditions with environment variables.; In this case, follow Adding PsiAPI Test Cases to prepare as PsiAPI (import psi4) for, roughly speaking, running through pytest.; The PsiAPI/pytest test suite occupies psi4/tests/pytests.;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/add_tests.html

Test Contents¶. Most PSI4 tests will be integration tests focusing on non-regression of user input to answers, and we insist on having these.; But if you find unit tests helpful, by all means add them to the test suite.; Most tests should store reference results (from literature or another implementation or a carefully run PSI4 calculation),; run quantum chemistry, then apply one or more of the Comparison Functions so that the test will fail if the answer is unexpected.; The functions are the same in CTest and pytest, but in the former they are, for example, compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...) while in the latter it’s asserted, like assert compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...).; The main advantage of the testing functions is that they provide helpful error printing upon failure. Deep down, they’re NumPy functions.; In preparing the test case reference values, aim for the converged value rather than many digits from your computer under default convergence conditions.; This will make the test more robust for different OS, different BLAS libraries, and variations in SC",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.7.x/add_tests.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.7.x/add_tests.html

Test Suite¶; A test suite plays a vital role in open-source software use and development. For a PSI4 user, tests provide models of inputs that should work; “as-is” and a searchable collection of syntax and capabilities.; The test suite also allows high-quality development snapshots of the; codebase to be built automatically for users.; For a user who has PSI4 as part of a complex computational molecular software environment, a test suite alongside installed PSI4 can be used to show that the PSI4 piece is working.; For a feature developer, adding tests provides confidence that you; can leave your code untouched and still advertise that the feature works; years later.

Test Contents¶. Most PSI4 tests will be integration tests focusing on non-regression of user input to answers, and we insist on having these.; But if you find unit tests helpful, by all means add them to the test suite.; Most tests should store reference results (from literature or another implementation or a carefully run PSI4 calculation),; run quantum chemistry, then apply one or more of the Comparison Functions so that the test will fail if the answer is unexpected.; The functions are the same in CTest and pytest, but in the former they are, for example, compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...) while in the latter it’s asserted, like assert compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...).; The main advantage of the testing functions is that they provide helpful error printing upon failure.

If you see labels to add or rename, please do.; A test requiring over 15 minutes should be labeled longtests. A short test under 30 seconds used for general bug checking should be labeled quicktests. A test that confirms PSI4 is operational should be labeled smoketests.; If a test needs extra input files like grid.dat or extra reference files for checking against, like fchk, specify these in the CMakeLists.txt as shown above. Such tests must be run through ctest and don’t usually work when run “by hand” from the objdir via stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/directory_name/input.dat.; If a test is multiple minutes long, load-balancing a parallel CTest run requires the test to be started early.
