This includes sequences such as: <F4 90 80 80>, <C0 80>,; or <A0> in UTF-8, and values above 0x10FFFF in UTF-32. Conformant code; must check for illegal sequences. When the flag is set to lenient, characters over 0x10FFFF are converted; to the replacement character; otherwise (when the flag is set to strict); they constitute an error. Output parameters:; The value ""sourceIllegal"" is returned from some routines if the input; sequence is malformed. When ""sourceIllegal"" is returned, the source; value will point to the illegal value that caused the problem. E.g.,; in UTF-8 when a sequence is malformed, it points to the start of the; malformed sequence. Author: Mark E.

It is part of; // the Inter-Procedural Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation (IPSCCP) pass.; // The transformation runs iteratively a number of times which is controlled; // by the option `funcspec-max-iters`. Running it multiple times is needed; // for specializing recursive functions, but also exposes new opportunities; // arising from specializations which return constant values or contain calls; // which can be specialized.; //; // Function Specialization supports propagating constant parameters like; // function pointers, literal constants and addresses of global variables.; // By propagating function pointers, indirect calls become direct calls. This; // exposes inlining opportunities which we would have otherwise missed. That's; // why function specialization is run before the inliner in the optimization; // pipeline; that is by design.; //; // Cost Model:; // -----------; // The cost model facilitates a utility for estimating the specialization bonus; // from propagating a constant argument. This is the InstCostVisitor, a class; // that inherits from the InstVisitor. The bonus itself is expressed as codesize; // and latency savings. Codesize savings means the amount of code that becomes; // dead in the specialization from propagating the constant, whereas latency; // savings represents the cycles we are saving from replacing instructions with; // constant values. The InstCostVisitor overrides a set of `visit*` methods to; // be able to handle different types of instructions. These attempt to constant-; // fold the instruction in which case a constant is returned and propagated; // further.; //; // Function pointers are not handled by the InstCostVisitor.
