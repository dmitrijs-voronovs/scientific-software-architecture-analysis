In addition to being fast and functional, we aim to make Clang extremely user; friendly. As far as a command-line compiler goes, this basically boils down to; making the diagnostics (error and warning messages) generated by the compiler; be as useful as possible. There are several ways that we do this. This section; talks about the experience provided by the command line compiler, contrasting; Clang output to GCC 4.9's output in some cases. Column Numbers and Caret Diagnostics; First, all diagnostics produced by clang include full column number; information. The clang command-line compiler driver uses this information; to print ""point diagnostics"".; (IDEs can use the information to display in-line error markup.); This is nice because it makes it very easy to understand exactly; what is wrong in a particular piece of code.; The point (the green ""^"" character) exactly shows where the problem is, even; inside of a string. This makes it really easy to jump to the problem and; helps when multiple instances of the same character occur on a line.

In the following example, not only do we tell you; that there is a problem with the *; and point to it, we say exactly why and tell you what the type is (in case it is; a complicated subexpression, such as a call to an overloaded function).

Typedef Preservation and Selective Unwrapping; Many programmers use high-level user defined types, typedefs, and other; syntactic sugar to refer to types in their program. This is useful because they; can abbreviate otherwise very long types and it is useful to preserve the; typename in diagnostics. However, sometimes very simple typedefs can wrap; trivial types and it is important to strip off the typedef to understand what; is going on. Clang aims to handle both cases well.; The following example shows where it is important to preserve; a typedef in C. $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:15:11: error: can't convert between vector values of different size ('__m128' and 'int const *'); myvec[1]/P;; ~~~~~~~~^~.

""Fix-it"" hints are most useful for; working around common user errors and misconceptions.

The clang command-line compiler driver uses this information; to print ""point diagnostics"".; (IDEs can use the information to display in-line error markup.); This is nice because it makes it very easy to understand exactly; what is wrong in a particular piece of code.; The point (the green ""^"" character) exactly shows where the problem is, even; inside of a string. This makes it really easy to jump to the problem and; helps when multiple instances of the same character occur on a line.

Note that modern versions of GCC have followed Clang's lead, and are; now able to give a column for a diagnostic, and include a snippet of source; text in the result. However, Clang's column number is much more accurate,; pointing at the problematic format specifier, rather than the ); character the parser had reached when the problem was detected.; Also, Clang's diagnostic is colored by default, making it easier to; distinguish from nearby text.; Range Highlighting for Related Text; Clang captures and accurately tracks range information for expressions,; statements, and other constructs in your program and uses this to make; diagnostics highlight related information. In the following somewhat; nonsensical example you can see that you don't even need to see the original source code to; understand what is wrong based on the Clang error. Because clang prints a; point, you know exactly which plus it is complaining about. The range; information highlights the left and right side of the plus which makes it; immediately obvious what the compiler is talking about.; Range information is very useful for; cases involving precedence issues and many other cases. $ gcc-4.9 -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c: In function 'int f(int, int)':; t.c:7:39: error: invali",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/diagnostics.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/diagnostics.html

Utility and Applications. Library Based Architecture. A major design concept for clang is its use of a library-based; architecture. In this design, various parts of the front-end can be cleanly; divided into separate libraries which can then be mixed up for different needs; and uses. In addition, the library-based approach encourages good interfaces; and makes it easier for new developers to get involved (because they only need; to understand small pieces of the big picture). ""The world needs better compiler tools, tools which are built as libraries.; This design point allows reuse of the tools in new and novel ways. However,; building the tools as libraries isn't enough: they must have clean APIs, be as; decoupled from each other as possible, and be easy to modify/extend. This; requires clean layering, decent design, and keeping the libraries independent of; any specific client."".

Support Diverse Clients. Clang is designed and built with many grand plans for how we can use it. The; driving force is the fact that we use C and C++ daily, and have to suffer due to; a lack of good tools available for it.

Because; validity analysis and code generation can largely be done on the fly, there is; not hard requirement that the front-end actually build up a full AST for all; the expressions and statements in the code. TCC and GCC are examples of; compilers that either build no real AST (in the former case) or build a stripped; down and simplified AST (in the later case) because they focus primarily on; codegen.; On the opposite side of the spectrum, some clients (like refactoring) want; highly detailed information about the original source code and want a complete; AST to describe it with. Refactoring wants to have information about macro; expansions, the location of every paren expression '(((x)))' vs 'x', full; position information, and much more. Further, refactoring wants to look; across the whole program to ensure that it is making transformations; that are safe.

Internal Design and Implementation. A real-world, production quality compiler. Clang is designed and built by experienced compiler developers who are; increasingly frustrated with the problems that existing open source; compilers have. Clang is carefully and thoughtfully designed and; built to provide the foundation of a whole new generation of; C/C++/Objective C development tools, and we intend for it to be; production quality.; Being a production quality compiler means many things: it means being high; performance, being solid and (relatively) bug free, and it means eventually; being used and depended on by a broad range of people. While we are still in; the early development stages, we strongly believe that this will become a; reality. A simple and hackable code base. Our goal is to make it possible for anyone with a basic understanding; of compilers and working knowledge of the C/C++/ObjC languages to understand and; extend the clang source base. A large part of this falls out of our decision to; make the AST mirror the languages as closely as possible: you have your friendly; if statement, for statement, parenthesis expression, structs, unions, etc, all; represented in a simple and explicit way.; In addition to a simple design, we work to make the source base approachable; by commenting it well, including citations of the language standards where; appropriate, and designing the code for simplicity.

End-User Features. Fast compiles and Low Memory Use. A major focus of our work on clang is to make it fast, light and scalable.; The library-based architecture of clang makes it straight-forward to time and; profile the cost of each layer of the stack, and the driver has a number of; options for performance analysis. Many detailed benchmarks can be found online.; Compile time performance is important, but when using clang as an API, often; memory use is even more so: the less memory the code takes the more code you can; fit into memory at a time (useful for whole program analysis tools, for; example).; In addition to being efficient when pitted head-to-head against GCC in batch; mode, clang is built with a library based; architecture that makes it relatively easy to adapt it and build new tools; with it. This means that it is often possible to apply out-of-the-box thinking; and novel techniques to improve compilation in various ways. Expressive Diagnostics. In addition to being fast and functional, we aim to make Clang extremely user; friendly. As far as a command-line compiler goes, this basically boils down to; making the diagnostics (error and warning messages) generated by the compiler; be as useful as possible. There are several ways that we do this, but the; most important are pinpointing exactly what is wrong in the program,; highlighting related information so that it is easy to understand at a glance,; and making the wording as clear as possible.; Here is one simple example that illustrates the quality of Clang diagnostic:. $ clang -fsyntax-only t.c; t.c:7:39: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('int' and 'struct A'); return y + func(y ? ((SomeA.X + 40) + SomeA) / ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html

Many users just want their; code to compile, they don't care to argue about whether it is pedantically C99; or not.; As mentioned above, all; extensions are explicitly recognized as such and marked with extension; diagnostics, which can be mapped to warnings, errors, or just ignored. Utility and Applications. Library Based Architecture. A major design concept for clang is its use of a library-based; architecture. In this design, various parts of the front-end can be cleanly; divided into separate libraries which can then be mixed up for different needs; and uses. In addition, the library-based approach encourages good interfaces; and makes it easier for new developers to get involved (because they only need; to understand small pieces of the big picture). ""The world needs better compiler tools, tools which are built as libraries.; This design point allows reuse of the tools in new and novel ways. However,; building the tools as libraries isn't enough: they must have clean APIs, be as; decoupled from each other as possible, and be easy to modify/extend. This; requires clean layering, decent design, and keeping the libraries independent of; any specific client."".

Integration with IDEs. We believe that Integrated Development Environments (IDE's) are a great way; to pull together various pieces of the development puzzle, and aim to make clang; work well in such an environment. The chief advantage of an IDE is that they; typically have visibility across your entire project and are long-lived; processes, whereas stand-alone compiler tools are typically invoked on each; individual file in the project, and thus have limited scope.; There are many implications of this difference, but a significant one has to; do with efficiency and caching: sharing an address space across different files; in a project, means that you can use intelligent caching and other techniques to; dramatically reduce analysis/compilation time.; A further difference between IDEs and batch compiler is that they often; impose very different requirements on the front-end: they depend on high; performance in order to provide a ""snappy"" experience, and thus really want; techniques like ""incremental compilation"", ""fuzzy parsing"", etc. Finally, IDEs; often have very different requirements than code generation, often requiring; information that a codegen-only frontend can throw away.

We actively intend for clang (and LLVM as a whole) to be used for; commercial projects, not only as a stand-alone compiler but also as a library; embedded inside a proprietary application.

Internal Design and Implementation. A real-world, production quality compiler. Clang is designed and built by experienced compiler developers who are; increasingly frustrated with the problems that existing open source; compilers have. Clang is carefully and thoughtfully designed and; built to provide the foundation of a whole new generation of; C/C++/Objective C development tools, and we intend for it to be; production quality.; Being a production quality compiler means many things: it means being high; performance, being solid and (relatively) bug free, and it means eventually; being used and depended on by a broad range of people. While we are still in; the early development stages, we strongly believe that this will become a; reality. A simple and hackable code base. Our goal is to make it possible for anyone with a basic understanding; of compilers and working knowledge of the C/C++/ObjC languages to understand and; extend the clang source base. A large part of this falls out of our decision to; make the AST mirror the languages as closely as possible: you have your friendly; if statement, for statement, parenthesis expression, structs, unions, etc, all; represented in a simple and explicit way.; In addition to a simple design, we work to make the source base approachable; by commenting it well, including citations of the language standards where; appropriate, and designing the code for simplicity.

Because; validity analysis and code generation can largely be done on the fly, there is; not hard requirement that the front-end actually build up a full AST for all; the expressions and statements in the code.

Making this efficient and getting this right requires a; significant amount of engineering and algorithmic work that simply are; unnecessary for a simple static compiler.; The beauty of the clang approach is that it does not restrict how you use it.; In particular, it is possible to use the clang preprocessor and parser to build; an extremely quick and light-weight on-the-fly code generator (similar to TCC); that does not build an AST at all. As an intermediate step, clang supports; using the current AST generation and semantic analysis code and having a code; generation client free the AST for each function after code generation.

Beyond that, clang offers; a set of AST dumpers, printers, and visualizers that make it easy to put code in; and see how it is represented. A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++,; and Objective C++. Clang is the ""C Language Family Front-end"", which means we intend to support; the most popular members of the C family. We are convinced that the right; parsing technology for this class of languages is a hand-built recursive-descent; parser. Because it is plain C++ code, recursive descent makes it very easy for; new developers to understand the code, it easily supports ad-hoc rules and other; strange hacks required by C/C++, and makes it straight-forward to implement; excellent diagnostics and error recovery.; We believe that implementing C/C++/ObjC in a single unified parser makes the; end result easier to maintain and evolve than maintaining a separate C and C++; parser which must be bugfixed and maintained independently of each other. Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their; variants. When you start work on implementing a language, you find out that there is a; huge gap between how the language works and how most people understand it to; work. This gap is the difference between a normal programmer and a (scary?; super-natural?) ""language lawyer"", who knows the ins and outs of the language; and can grok standardese with ease.; In practice, being conformant with the languages means that we aim to support; the full language, including the dark and dusty corners (like trigraphs,; preprocessor arcana, C99 VLAs, etc).

""The world needs better compiler tools, tools which are built as libraries.; This design point allows reuse of the tools in new and novel ways. However,; building the tools as libraries isn't enough: they must have clean APIs, be as; decoupled from each other as possible, and be easy to modify/extend. This; requires clean layering, decent design, and keeping the libraries independent of; any specific client."". Currently, clang is divided into the following libraries and tool:. libsupport - Basic support library, from LLVM.; libsystem - System abstraction library, from LLVM.; libbasic - Diagnostics, SourceLocations, SourceBuffer abstraction,; file system caching for input source files.; libast - Provides classes to represent the C AST, the C type system,; builtin functions, and various helpers for analyzing and manipulating the; AST (visitors, pretty printers, etc).; liblex - Lexing and preprocessing, identifier hash table, pragma; handling, tokens, and macro expansion.; libparse - Parsing.

However, the; MSys utilities provided by git for Windows have been known to work.; Cygwin has worked in the past, but is not well tested.; If you don't already have the core utilies from some other source, get; gnuwin32 from ; http://getgnuwin32.sourceforge.net/. Check out LLVM and Clang:; ; git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git. Note: Some Clang tests are sensitive to the line endings. Ensure; that checking out the files does not convert LF line endings to CR+LF. If; you're using git on Windows, make sure your core.autocrlf setting; is false.

Clang Compiler Driver (Drop-in Substitute for GCC); The clang tool is the compiler driver and front-end, which is; designed to be a drop-in replacement for the gcc command. Here are; some examples of how to use the high-level driver:. $ cat t.c; #include <stdio.h>; int main(int argc, char **argv) { printf(""hello world\n""); }; $ clang t.c; $ ./a.out; hello world. The 'clang' driver is designed to work as closely to GCC as possible to; maximize portability. The only major difference between the two is that; Clang defaults to gnu99 mode while GCC defaults to gnu89 mode. If you see; weird link-time errors relating to inline functions, try passing -std=gnu89; to clang.; Examples of using Clang. $ cat ~/t.c; typedef float V __attribute__((vector_size(16)));; V foo(V a, V b) { return a+b*a; }.

Some of the goals for the project include the following:; End-User Features:. Fast compiles and low memory use; Expressive diagnostics (examples); GCC & MSVC compatibility. Utility and; Applications:. Modular library based architecture; Support diverse clients (refactoring, static analysis, code generation,; etc.); Allow tight integration with IDEs; Use the LLVM 'Apache 2'; License. Internal Design and; Implementation:. A real-world, production quality compiler; A simple and hackable code base; A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++, and Objective C++; Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their variants. Of course this is only a rough outline of the goals and features of; Clang. To get a true sense of what it is all about, see the Features section, which breaks; each of these down and explains them in more detail. Why?.

Please see the; C++ status report page to find out what is; missing.; StringRef'ize APIs: A thankless but incredibly useful project is; StringRef'izing (converting to use llvm::StringRef instead of const; char * or std::string) various clang interfaces. This generally; simplifies the code and makes it more efficient.; Configuration Manager: Clang/LLVM works on a large number of; architectures and operating systems and can cross-compile to a similarly large; number of configurations, but the pitfalls of choosing the command-line; options, making sure the right sub-architecture is chosen and that the correct; optional elements of your particular system can be a pain. A tool that would investigate hosts and targets, and store the configuration; in files that can later be used by Clang itself to avoid command-line options,; especially the ones regarding which target options to use, would greatly alleviate; this problem. A simple tool, with little or no dependency on LLVM itself, that; will investigate a target architecture by probing hardware, software, libraries; and compiling and executing code to identify all properties that would be relevant; to command-line options (VFP, SSE, NEON, ARM vs. Thumb etc), triple settings etc.; The first stage is to build a CFLAGS for Clang that would produce code on the; current Host to the identified Target.; The second stage would be to produce a configuration file (that can be used; independently of the Host) so that Clang can read it and not need a gazillion; of command-line options. Such file should be simple JSON / INI or anything that; a text editor could change. If you hit a bug with Clang, it is very useful for us if you reduce the code; that demonstrates the problem down to something small.

Non-retained out parameters, identified using; LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED applied to parameters, e.g.:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). Such functions write a non-retained object into an out parameter, and the; caller has no further obligations.; 2. Retained out parameters,; identified using LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). In such cases a retained object is written into an out parameter, which the caller has then to release in order to avoid a leak. These two cases are simple - but in practice a functions returning an out-parameter usually also return a return code, and then an out parameter may or may not be written, which conditionally depends on the exit code, e.g.:. bool maybeCreateObject(LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED OSObject **obj);. For such functions, the usual semantics is that an object is written into on ""success"", and not written into on ""failure"".; For LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED we assume the following definition of; success:; For functions returning OSReturn or IOReturn; (any typedef to kern_return_t) success is defined as having an output of zero (kIOReturnSuccess is zero).; For all others, success is non-zero (e.g. non-nullptr for pointers); 3. Retained out parameters on zero return; The annotation LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED_ON_ZERO states; that a retained object is written into if and only if the function returns a zero value:. bool OSUnserializeXML(void *data, LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED_ON_ZERO OSString **errString);. Then the caller has to release an object if the function has returned zero.; 4. Retained out parameters on non-zero return; Similarly, LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED_ON_NONZERO specifies that a; retained object is written into the parameter if and only if the function has; returned a non-zero value.; Note that for non-retained out parameters conditionals do not",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html

In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute.

Running scan-build over this source produces the following; output:. Mac OS X API Annotations. Cocoa & Core Foundation Memory Management; Annotations. The analyzer supports the proper management of retain counts for; both Cocoa and Core Foundation objects. This checking is largely based on; enforcing Cocoa and Core Foundation naming conventions for Objective-C methods; (Cocoa) and C functions (Core Foundation). Not strictly following these; conventions can cause the analyzer to miss bugs or flag false positives.; One can educate the analyzer (and others who read your code) about methods or; functions that deviate from the Cocoa and Core Foundation conventions using the; attributes described here. However, you should consider using proper naming; conventions or the objc_method_family; attribute, if applicable.; Attribute 'ns_returns_retained'; (Clang-specific); The GCC-style (Clang-specific) attribute 'ns_returns_retained' allows one to; annotate an Objective-C method or C function as returning a retained Cocoa; object that the caller is responsible for releasing (via sending a; release message to the object).

A function can also return an object to a caller by a means of an out parameter; (a pointer-to-OSObject-pointer is passed, and a callee writes a pointer to an; object into an argument).; Currently the analyzer does not track unannotated out; parameters by default, but with annotations we distinguish four separate cases:. 1. Non-retained out parameters, identified using; LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED applied to parameters, e.g.:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). Such functions write a non-retained object into an out parameter, and the; caller has no further obligations.; 2. Retained out parameters,; identified using LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). In such cases a retained object is written into an out parameter, which the caller has then to release in order to avoid a leak. These two cases are simple - but in practice a functions returning an out-parameter usually also return a return code, and then an out parameter may or may not be written, which conditionally depends on the exit code, e.g.:. bool maybeCreateObject(LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED OSObject **obj);. For such functions, the usual semantics is that an object is written into on ""success"", and not written into on ""failure"".; For LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED we assume the following definition of; success:; For functions returning OSReturn or IOReturn; (any typedef to kern_return_t) success is defined as having an output of zero (kIOReturnSuccess is zero).; For all others, success is non-zero (e.g. non-nullptr for pointers); 3. Retained out parameters on zero return; The annotation LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED_ON_ZERO states; that a retained object is written into if and only if the function returns a zero value:. bool OSUnserializeXML(void *data, LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED_ON_ZERO OSString **errString);.

For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed.

Custom Assertion Handlers. The analyzer exploits code assertions by pruning off paths where the; assertion condition is false. The idea is capture any program invariants; specified in the assertion that the developer may know but is not immediately; apparent in the code itself. In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed.

Out Parameters. A function can also return an object to a caller by a means of an out parameter; (a pointer-to-OSObject-pointer is passed, and a callee writes a pointer to an; object into an argument).; Currently the analyzer does not track unannotated out; parameters by default, but with annotations we distinguish four separate cases:. 1. Non-retained out parameters, identified using; LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED applied to parameters, e.g.:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). Such functions write a non-retained object into an out parameter, and the; caller has no further obligations.; 2. Retained out parameters,; identified using LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). In such cases a retained object is written into an out parameter, which the caller has then to release in order to avoid a leak. These two cases are simple - but in practice a functions returning an out-parameter usually also return a return code, and then an out parameter may or may not be written, which conditionally depends on the exit code, e.g.:. bool maybeCreateObject(LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED OSObject **obj);. For such functions, the usual semantics is that an object is written into on ""success"", and not written into on ""failure"".; For LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED we assume the following definition of; success:; For functions returning OSReturn or IOReturn; (any typedef to kern_return_t) success is defined as having an output of zero (kIOReturnSuccess is zero).; For all others, success is non-zero (e.g. non-nullptr for pointers); 3.

Null Pointer Checking; Attribute 'nonnull'; The analyzer recognizes the GCC attribute 'nonnull', which indicates that a; function expects that a given function parameter is not a null pointer. Specific; details of the syntax of using the 'nonnull' attribute can be found in GCC's; documentation.; Both the Clang compiler and GCC will flag warnings for simple cases where a; null pointer is directly being passed to a function with a 'nonnull' parameter; (e.g., as a constant). The analyzer extends this checking by using its deeper; symbolic analysis to track what pointer values are potentially null and then; flag warnings when they are passed in a function call via a 'nonnull'; parameter.; Example. $ cat test.m; int bar(int*p, int q, int *r) __attribute__((nonnull(1,3)));. int foo(int *p, int *q) {; return !p ? bar(q, 2, p); : bar(p, 2, q);; }. Running scan-build over this source produces the following; output:. Mac OS X API Annotations. Cocoa & Core Foundation Memory Management; Annotations. The analyzer supports the proper management of retain counts for; both Cocoa and Core Foundation objects. This checking is largely based on; enforcing Cocoa and Core Foundation naming conventions for Objective-C methods; (Cocoa) and C functions (Core Foundation). Not strictly following these; conventions can cause the analyzer to miss bugs or flag false positives.; One can educate the analyzer (and others who read your code) about methods or; functions that deviate from the Cocoa and Core Foundation conventions using the; attributes described here.

A function can also return an object to a caller by a means of an out parameter; (a pointer-to-OSObject-pointer is passed, and a callee writes a pointer to an; object into an argument).; Currently the analyzer does not track unannotated out; parameters by default, but with annotations we distinguish four separate cases:. 1. Non-retained out parameters, identified using; LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED applied to parameters, e.g.:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). Such functions write a non-retained object into an out parameter, and the; caller has no further obligations.; 2. Retained out parameters,; identified using LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED:. void getterViaOutParam(LIBKERN_RETURNS_NOT_RETAINED OSObject **obj). In such cases a retained object is written into an out parameter, which the caller has then to release in order to avoid a leak. These two cases are simple - but in practice a functions returning an out-parameter usually also return a return code, and then an out parameter may or may not be written, which conditionally depends on the exit code, e.g.:. bool maybeCreateObject(LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED OSObject **obj);. For such functions, the usual semantics is that an object is written into on ""success"", and not written into on ""failure"".; For LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED we assume the following definition of; success:; For functions returning OSReturn or IOReturn; (any typedef to kern_return_t) success is defined as having an output of zero (kIOReturnSuccess is zero).; For all others, success is non-zero (e.g. non-nullptr for pointers); 3. Retained out parameters on zero return; The annotation LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED_ON_ZERO states; that a retained object is written into if and only if the function returns a zero value:. bool OSUnserializeXML(void *data, LIBKERN_RETURNS_RETAINED_ON_ZERO OSString **errString);. Then the caller has to release an object if the function has returned zero.; 4.

The BugReport class represents a specific occurrence of a bug. In; the most common case, three parameters are used to form a BugReport:. The type of bug, specified as an instance of the BugType class.; A short descriptive string. This is placed at the location of the bug in; the detailed line-by-line output generated by scan-build.; The context in which the bug occurred. This includes both the location of; the bug in the program and the program's state when the location is reached. These are; both encapsulated in an ExplodedNode. In order to obtain the correct ExplodedNode, a decision must be made; as to whether or not analysis can continue along the current path. This decision; is based on whether the detected bug is one that would prevent the program under; analysis from continuing. For example, leaking of a resource should not stop; analysis, as the program can continue to run after the leak. Dereferencing a; null pointer, on the other hand, should stop analysis, as there is no way for; the program to meaningfully continue after such an error. If analysis can continue, then the most recent ExplodedNode; generated by the checker can be passed to the BugReport constructor; without additional modification. This ExplodedNode will be the one; returned by the most recent call to CheckerContext::addTransition.; If no transition has been performed during the current callback, the checker should call CheckerContext::addTransition(); and use the returned node for bug reporting. If analysis can not continue, then the current state should be transitioned; into a so-called sink node, a node from which no further analysis will be; performed. This is done by calling the ; CheckerContext::generateSink function; this function is the same as the; addTransition function, but marks the state as a sink node.

The explored execution traces are represented with; ExplodedGraph object.; Each node of the graph is; ExplodedNode,; which consists of a ProgramPoint and a ProgramState.; ; ProgramPoint; represents the corresponding location in the program (or the CFG).; ProgramPoint is also used to record additional information on; when/how the state was added.

This should be minimized as much as possible. More detail about; implementing custom program state is given in section Custom Program States.; ; Checker Registration; All checker implementation files are located in; clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/Checkers folder. The steps below describe; how the checker SimpleStreamChecker, which checks for misuses of; stream APIs, was registered with the analyzer.; Similar steps should be followed for a new checker. A new checker implementation file, SimpleStreamChecker.cpp, was; created in the directory lib/StaticAnalyzer/Checkers.; The following registration code was added to the implementation file:. void ento::registerSimpleStreamChecker(CheckerManager &mgr) {; mgr.registerChecker<SimpleStreamChecker>();; }. A package was selected for the checker and the checker was defined in the; table of checkers at include/clang/StaticAnalyzer/Checkers/Checkers.td.; Since all checkers should first be developed as ""alpha"", and the SimpleStreamChecker; performs UNIX API checks, the correct package is ""alpha.unix"", and the following; was added to the corresponding UnixAlpha section of Checkers.td:. let ParentPackage = UnixAlpha in {; ...; def SimpleStreamChecker : Checker<""SimpleStream"">,; HelpText<""Check for misuses of stream APIs"">,; DescFile<""SimpleStreamChecker.cpp"">;; ...; } // end ""alpha.unix"". The source code file was made visible to CMake by adding it to; lib/StaticAnalyzer/Checkers/CMakeLists.txt. After adding a new checker to the analyzer, one can verify that the new checker; was successfully added by seeing if it appears in the list of available checkers:; $clang -cc1 -analyzer-checker-help; Events, Callbacks, and Checker Class Structure; All checkers inherit from the ; Checker template class; the template parameter(s) describe the type of; events that the checker is interested in processing.

This prevents false positives in the cases where; the analyzer cannot be sure whether the file was closed or not. These events that will be used for each of these actions are, respectively, PreCall,; PostCall,; DeadSymbols,; and PointerEscape.; The high-level structure of the checker's class is thus:. class SimpleStreamChecker : public Checker<check::PreCall,; check::PostCall,; check::DeadSymbols,; check::PointerEscape> {; public:. void checkPreCall(const CallEvent &Call, CheckerContext &C) const;. void checkPostCall(const CallEvent &Call, CheckerContext &C) const;. void checkDeadSymbols(SymbolReaper &SR, CheckerContext &C) const;.

Custom Program States; Checkers often need to keep track of information specific to the checks they; perform. However, since checkers have no guarantee about the order in which the; program will be explored, or even that all possible paths will be explored, this; state information cannot be kept within individual checkers. Therefore, if; checkers need to store custom information, they need to add new categories of; data to the ProgramState. The preferred way to do so is to use one of; several macros designed for this purpose. They are:. REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE:; Used when the state information is a single value. The methods available for; state types declared with this macro are get, set, and; remove.; REGISTER_LIST_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE:; Used when the state information is a list of values.

Some MemRegions represents abstract; symbolic chunks of memory, and thus are also based on symbols. SVals are just; references to values, and can reference either MemRegions, Symbols, or concrete; values (e.g., the number 1). Idea for a Checker; Here are several questions which you should consider when evaluating your; checker idea:; ; Can the check be effectively implemented without path-sensitive; analysis? See AST Visitors.; How high the false positive rate is going to be? Looking at the occurrences; of the issue you want to write a checker for in the existing code bases might; give you some ideas. ; How the current limitations of the analysis will effect the false alarm; rate? Currently, the analyzer only reasons about one procedure at a time (no; inter-procedural analysis). Also, it uses a simple range tracking based; solver to model symbolic execution.; Consult the GitHub Issues; to get some ideas for new checkers and consider starting with improving/fixing; bugs in the existing checkers. Once an idea for a checker has been chosen, there are two key decisions that; need to be made:; ; Which events the checker should be tracking. This is discussed in more; detail in the section Events, Callbacks, and; Checker Class Structure.; What checker-specific data needs to be stored as part of the program; state (if any).

Custom Program States; Checkers often need to keep track of information specific to the checks they; perform. However, since checkers have no guarantee about the order in which the; program will be explored, or even that all possible paths will be explored, this; state information cannot be kept within individual checkers. Therefore, if; checkers need to store custom information, they need to add new categories of; data to the ProgramState. The preferred way to do so is to use one of; several macros designed for this purpose. They are:. REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTAT",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/checker_dev_manual.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/checker_dev_manual.html

The; key for this map will be a pointer to a symbolic expression; (SymbolRef). If the data type to be associated with the symbolic; expression is an integer, then the custom category of state information would be; declared as. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ExampleDataType, SymbolRef, int). The data would be accessed with the function. ProgramStateRef state;; SymbolRef Sym;; ...; int currentlValue = state->get<ExampleDataType>(Sym);. and set with the function. ProgramStateRef state;; SymbolRef Sym;; int newValue;; ...; ProgramStateRef newState = state->set<ExampleDataType>(Sym, newValue);. In addition, the macros define a data type used for storing the data of the; new data category; the name of this type is the name of the data category with; ""Ty"" appended. For REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE, this will simply; be passed data type; for the other three macros, this will be a specialized; version of the llvm::ImmutableList,; llvm::ImmutableSet,; or llvm::ImmutableMap; templated class. For the ExampleDataType example above, the type; created would be equivalent to writing the declaration:. using ExampleDataTypeTy = llvm::ImmutableMap<SymbolRef, int>;. These macros will cover a majority of use cases; however, they still have a; few limitations. They cannot be used inside namespaces (since they expand to; contain top-level namespace references), and the data types that they define; cannot be referenced from more than one file. Note that ProgramStates are immutable; instead of modifying an existing; one, functions that modify the state will return a copy of the previous state; with the change applied.

This ExplodedNode will be the one; returned by the most recent call to CheckerContext::addTransition.; If no transition has been performed during the current callback, the checker should call CheckerContext::addTransition(); and use the returned node for bug reporting. If analysis can not continue, then the current state should be transitioned; into a so-called sink node, a node from which no further analysis will be; performed. This is done by calling the ; CheckerContext::generateSink function; this function is the same as the; addTransition function, but marks the state as a sink node. Like; addTransition, this returns an ExplodedNode with the updated; state, which can then be passed to the BugReport constructor. After a BugReport is created, it should be passed to the analyzer core; by calling CheckerContext::emitReport. AST Visitors; Some checks might not require path-sensitivity to be effective. Simple AST walk; might be sufficient. If that is the case, consider implementing a Clang; compiler warning. On the other hand, a check might not be acceptable as a compiler; warning; for example, because of a relatively high false positive rate. In this; situation, AST callbacks checkASTDecl and; checkASTCodeBody are your best friends. Testing; Every patch should be well tested with Clang regression tests.

You actually never return nil.; You do return nil sometimes, and callers are supposed to handle that. This; includes cases where your method is documented to return nil given certain; inputs.; You return nil based on some external condition (such as an out-of-memory; error), but the client can't do anything about it either.; You return nil only when the caller passes input documented to be invalid.; That means it's the client's fault.; You return nil in some totally undocumented case. In (1) you should annotate the method as returning a _Nonnull; object.; In (2) the method should be marked _Nullable.; In (3) you should probably annotate the method _Nonnull. Why?; Because no callers will actually check for nil, given that they can't do; anything about the situation and don't know what went wrong. At this point; things have gone so poorly that there's basically no way to recover.; The least happy case is (4) because the resulting program will almost; certainly either crash or just silently do the wrong thing.; If this is a new method or you control the callers, you can use; NSParameterAssert() (or the equivalent) to check the precondition and; remove the nil return. But if you don't control the callers and they rely on; this behavior, you should return mark the method _Nonnull and return; nil cast to _Nonnull anyway.; (Note that (4) doesn't apply in cases where the caller can't know they passed; bad parameters.

It is also possible to use; a symbolic link to scan-build, such one located in a directory; in your path. When scan-build runs it will automatically; determine where to find its accompanying files.; Other Platforms (Building the Analyzer from Source); For other platforms, you must build Clang and LLVM manually. To do; so, please follow the instructions for building Clang from; source code.; Once the Clang is built, you need to add the following to your path:. The location of the clang binary. For example, if you built a Debug+Asserts build of LLVM/Clang (the; default), the resultant clang binary will be in $(OBJDIR)/Debug+Asserts/bin; (where $(OBJDIR) is often the same as the root source directory). You; can also do make install to install the LLVM/Clang libraries and; binaries to the installation directory of your choice (specified when you run; configure).; The locations of the scan-build and scan-view; programs. These are installed via make install into the bin directory; when clang is built.
