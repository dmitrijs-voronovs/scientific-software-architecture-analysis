My understanding is that this comes from the dicts that are loaded on startup. Looking for `GetPoolSize`, here's the relevant part of the LLVM IR:; ```llvm; ; Function Attrs: noinline uwtable; define i32 @_ZNK4ROOT8Internal9TExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::Internal::TExecutor""*) #0 align 2 {; ; contains calls to; %seq = call i32 @_ZNK4ROOT19TSequentialExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TSequentialExecutor""* %9); %thread = call i32 @_ZNK4ROOT15TThreadExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TThreadExecutor""* %13); %process = call i32 @_ZNK4ROOT16TProcessExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TProcessExecutor""* %17); }. ; Function Attrs: noinline nounwind uwtable; define linkonce_odr i32 @_ZNK4ROOT19TSequentialExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TSequentialExecutor""*) #1 comdat align 2 {; ; ...; }. declare i32 @_ZNK4ROOT15TThreadExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TThreadExecutor""*) #2; ```. So the dict contains the definition of `Executor::GetPoolSize()`, which is not `inline`, and references `TThreadExecutor::GetPoolSize()` defined in `libImt.so`, but obviously not in the dict. This symbol remains unresolved during JIT, leading to the error message we're seeing. Notice that `TSequentialExecutor::GetPoolSize()` is `linkonce_odr` due to being `inline`. When adding the `inline` keyword to `TExecutor::GetPoolSize()` (thanks Philippe for the less intrusive proposal), all these functions disappear from the loaded `llvm::Module` because unused `linkonce_odr` are dropped (recursively) before passing to JIT. So in essence I think this is not about symbols not being exported or inlined by the compiler, but what we need is the semantics of `inline` that the function can be dropped from the `llvm::Module`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7033#issuecomment-760022478

When adding the `inline` keyword to `TExecutor::GetPoolSize()` (thanks Philippe for the less intrusive proposal), all these functions disappear from the loaded `llvm::Module` because unused `linkonce_odr` are dropped (recursively) before passing to JIT.

We might have to call some ROOT clean-up routine that is usually called by the ROOT-injected exit handler to make sure TFiles are closed correctly and similar. @pcanal might know if there is a simple way to do that. I think that's `gSystem->Exit(0)` that was used before. You can pass a second parameter (called `mode` and effectively undocumented AFAICT) that makes it call `_exit()` instead of `exit()`. However, I'm not sure if we need to close `TFile`s because the workers don't open them, the parent should handle them.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7075#issuecomment-764677587

In the future we would like to introduce the possibility to specify something like ""if this branch is not there, use this default value instead"" but it's a bit tricky, `TChain` and `TTreeReader` (which RDF uses under the hood) are not really built for this case. A workaround of course is to do a first pass over the files and use `df.GetColumnNames()` to separate the files with all branches from the ones where some branches are missing, and process the ""weird"" files separately.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7084#issuecomment-766678850

Where things start to differ is *how* to do that, Darwin expects extension whereas the generic method is ""direct"". I suppose the latter means filling with zeros in practice, so `(short)-1 = 0xffff -> 0x0000ffff = 65535`. Setting up the target triple in a different way in #7787 allows Clang's Driver logic to compute the ABI correctly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7090#issuecomment-814088514

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7100#issuecomment-767654480:485,Modifiability,variab,variables,485,"> @Axel-Naumann that seems a clang codegen/jit issue -- I'd rather have it properly fixed in the relevant places of llvm. Am I missing something?. It might be an issue of `RuntimeDyldMachO` not being able to handle more than one text section. On the other hand, one could argue that Clang should not use more than one section when generating code for JITting (which it doesn't know AFAICT). In the end, the ""root cause"" is that `TCling` can catch exceptions for constructors of global variables. This is impossible in compiled C++ programs. So the only component that know about this is Cling (hoisting the values), which is why I implemented the fix where I put it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7100#issuecomment-767654480

I tested the code now with a modified `rooArgusModel` example from https://root.cern/manual/roofit/. What I changed:; * Number of generated toy events increased from 2000 to 200000; * Changed fitting command to `model.fitTo(*data, RooFit::Offset(true), RooFit::Extended(false));`. The offset has to be enabled to cover the changes suggested in this PR. The extended term has to be disabled for the same reason that the offset subtraction has been changed in this PR: the extra term is of the similar order of magnitude as the Kahan sum over events but is summed with the Kahan algorithm. Therefore, the carry is lost and becomes zero. But if the carry is zero, we can't see what's different in the offset subtraction with this PR. In the first three iterations, I printed the result and carry before and after offset subtraction (without this PR):; ```; Without PR. 1.
