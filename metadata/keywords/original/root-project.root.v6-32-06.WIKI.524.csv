First, we define the arrays of coordinates and then create the graph. The coordinates can be arrays of doubles or floats.; Int_t n = 20;; Double_t x[n], y[n];; for (Int_t i=0; i<n; i++) {; x[i] = i*0.1;; y[i] = 10*sin(x[i]+0.2);; }; TGraph *gr1 = new TGraph (n, x, y);; An alternative constructor takes only the number of points n. It is expected that the coordinates will be set later.; TGraph *gr2 = new TGraph(n);; The default constructor can also be used. Further calls to SetPoint() will extend the internal vectors.; TGraph *gr3 = new TGraph();; 4.1.1 Graph Draw Options; The various drawing options for a graph are explained in TGraph::PaintGraph. They are:. “L” A simple poly-line between every points is drawn; “F” A fill area is drawn; “F1” Idem as “F” but fill area is no more repartee around X=0 or Y=0; “F2” draw a fill area poly line connecting the center of bins; “A” Axis are drawn around the graph; “C” A smooth curve is drawn; “*” A star is plotted at each point; “P” The current marker of the graph is plotted at each point; “B” A bar chart is drawn at each point; “[]” Only the end vertical/horizontal lines of the error bars are drawn. This option only applies to the TGraphAsymmErrors.; “1” ylow = rwymin. The options are not case sensitive and they can be concatenated in most cases. Let us look at some examples.; 4.1.1.1 Continuous Line, Axis and Stars (AC*).

Such plots can be drawn for two datasets, or for one dataset and a theoretical distribution function.; 4.8.1 Two Datasets. Examples of qq-plots of 2 datasets. Quantile-quantile plots are used to determine whether two samples come from the same distribution. A qq-plot draws the quantiles of one dataset against the quantile of the other. The quantiles of the dataset with fewer entries are on Y-axis, with more entries - on X-axis. A straight line, going through 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles is also plotted for reference. It represents a robust linear fit, not sensitive to the extremes of the datasets. If the datasets come from the same distribution, points of the plot should fall approximately on the 45 degrees line. If they have the same distribution function, but different parameters of location or scale, they should still fall on the straight line, but not the 45 degrees one.; The greater their departure from the straight line, the more evidence there is that the datasets come from different distributions. The advantage of qq-plot is that it not only shows that the underlying distributions are different, but, unlike the analytical methods, it also gives information on the nature of this difference: heavier tails, different location/scale, different shape, etc.; 4.8.2 One Dataset.

For example, when fitting a k-dimensional histogram, the independent variables X are the bin center coordinates and Y is the bin weight.; The model function needs to be expressed as function of some unknown parameters. The fitting will find the best parameter value to describe the observed data.; We can use the ROOT TF1 class, the parametric function class, to describe the model function. However the ROOT::Fit::Fitter class, to be independent of the ROOT Hist library, takes as input a more general parametric function object, the interface (abstract) class ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim, which describe a generic one or multi-dimensional function with parameters. This interface extends the abstract class ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim, with methods to set/retrieve parameter values and to evaluate the function given the independent vector of values X and vector of parameters P. More information about the different ROOT::Math function interfaces is available in the Mathematical Library chapter.; An end-user can convert a TF1 object in a ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim, using the wrapper class ROOT::Math::WrapperMultiTF1:; TF1 * f1 = new TF1(""f1"",""gaus"");; ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1 fitFunction(f1, f1->GetNdim() );; ROOT::Fit::Fitter fitter;; fitter.SetFunction( fitFunction, false);; When creating the wrapper, the parameter values stored in TF1 will be copied in the ROOT::Math::WrappedMultiTF1 object.

The parameter derivatives of the model function can be useful to some minimization algorithms, such as Fumili. However, in general is better to leave the minimization algorithm (e.g. Minuit) to compute the needed derivatives using its own customised numerical differentiation algorithm. In order to not provide to the fitter the parameter derivatives, we explicitly passed in Fitter::SetFunction a false value.; 5.7.3 Fit Configuration; The configuration of the fit is done via the ROOT::Fit::FitConfig class and its contained ROOT::Fit::ParameterSettings class. These are the possible allowed fit configurations:. setting the initial values of the parameters;; setting the parameter step sizes;; setting eventual parameter bounds;; setting the minimizer library and the particular algorithm to use;; setting different minimization options (print level, tolerance, max iterations, etc…); setting the type of parameter errors to compute (parabolic error, Minos errors, re-normalize errors using fitted chi2 values). The initial parameter values can be set directly in the input model function object. However, for setting parameter bounds and step sizes to values different than the automatically computed ones, one needs to use the ROOT::Fit::ParameterSetting class.

In the ROOT implementation, the function FCN is defined via the Minuit SetFCN member function when an histogram fitting is invoked. The value of FCN will in general depend on one or more variable parameters.; 5.9.2 The Transformation of Limited Parameters; For variable parameters with limits, Minuit uses the following transformation:; Pint = arcsin(2((Pext-a)/(b-a))-1); Pext = a+((b-a)/(2))(sinPint+1); so that the internal value Pint can take on any value, while the external value Pext can take on values only between the lower limit a and the ext upper limit b. Since the transformation is necessarily non-linear, it would transform a nice linear problem into a nasty non-linear one, which is the reason why limits should be avoided if not necessary. In addition, the transformation does require some computer time, so it slows down the computation a little bit, and more importantly, it introduces additional numerical inaccuracy into the problem in addition to what is introduced in the numerical calculation of the FCN value. The effects of non-linearity and numerical round off both become more important as the external value gets closer to one of the limits (expressed as the distance to nearest limit divided by distance between limits). The user must therefore be aware of the fact that, for example, if they put limits of (0, 1010) on a parameter, then the values 0.0 and 1. 0 will be indistinguishable to the accuracy of most machines.; The transformation also affects the parameter error matrix, of course, so Minuit does a transformation of the error matrix (and the ‘’parabolic’’ parameter errors) when there are parameter limits. Users should however realize that the transformation is only a linear approximation, and that it cannot give a meaningful result if one or more parameters is very close to a limit, where \(\frac{\partial Pext}{\partial Pint} \neq 0\).

If you’re used to structures in C, a class is a struct that is a group of related variables, which is extended with functions and routines specific to this structure (class). What is the interest? Consider a struct that is defined this way:; struct Line {; float x1;; float y1;; float x2;; float y2;; }; This structure represents a line to be drawn in a graphical window. (x1,y1) are the coordinates of the first point, (x2,y2) the coordinates of the second point.

However, most people in HEP who use FORTRAN will have experience of a memory manager and the act of creating a bank is a good equivalent of a heap object. For those who know systems like ZEBRA, it will come as a relief to learn that objects do not move, C++ does not garbage collect, so there is never a danger that a pointer to an object becomes invalid for that reason. However, having created an object, it is the user’s responsibility to ensure that it is deleted when no longer needed, or to pass that responsibility onto to some other object. Failing to do that will result in a memory leak, one of the most common and most hard-to-find C++ bugs.; To send a message to an object via a pointer to it, you need to use the “->” operator e.g.:; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; Although we chose to call our pointer my_objptr, to emphasize that it is a pointer, heap objects are so common in an object-oriented program that pointer names rarely reflect the fact - you have to be careful that you know if you are dealing with an object or its pointer! Fortunately, the compiler won’t tolerate an attempt to do something like:; root[] my_objptr.Solve();; As we have seen, heap objects have to be accessed via pointers, whereas stack objects can be accessed directly. They can also be accessed via pointers:; root[] Quad stack_quad(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *stack_ptr = &stack_quad;; root[] stack_ptr->Solve();; Here we have a Quad pointer that has been initialized with the address of a stack object. Be very careful if you take the address of stack objects. As we shall see soon, they are deleted automatically, which could leave you with an illegal pointer. Using it will corrupt and may as well crash the program!; It is time to look at the destruction of objects.

These are:. Calling rootcling to create a dictionary using rootcling.; Calling the compiler to build the shared library from the script.; If there are errors, it calls the compiler to build a dummy executable to clearly report unresolved symbols. ACLiC makes a shared library with a dictionary containing the classes and functions declared in the script. It also adds the classes and functions declared in included files with the same name as the script file and any of the following extensions: .h, .hh, .hpp, .hxx, .hPP, .hXX. This means that, by default, you cannot combine scripts from different files into one library by using #include statements; you will need to compile each script separately. In a future release, we plan to add the global variables declared in the script to the dictionary also. If you are curious about the specific calls, you can raise the ROOT debug level: gDebug=3 and ACLiC will print these steps.

This table is a linked list, which can be accessed from the gROOT object (see TROOT::GetListOfColors()). Each color has an index and when a basic color is defined, two “companion” colors are defined: the dark version and the bright version. Two static functions are available that return the bright or dark color number corresponding to a given color index. If these variants don’t already exist, they are created as needed:; Int_t dark = TColor::GetColorDark(color_index);; Int_t bright = TColor::GetColorBright(color_index);; The dark and bright colors are used to give 3-D effects when drawing various boxes (see TWbox, TPave, TPaveText, TPaveLabel, etc). If you have a black and white copy of the manual, here are the basic colors and their indices. The basic ROOT colors. The list of currently supported basic colors (here dark and bright colors are not shown) are shown. The color numbers specified in the basic palette, and the picture above, can be viewed by selecting the menu entry Colors in the View canvas menu. The user may define other colors. To do this, one has to build a new TColor:; TColor(Int_t color,Float_t r,Float_t g,Float_t b,const char* name); One has to give the color number and the three Red, Green, Blue values, each being defined from 0 (min) to 1(max).

It includes a discussion on compression, and file recovery. Then we explain the logical file, the class TFile and its methods. We show how to navigate in a file, how to save objects and read them back. We also include a discussion on Streamers. Streamers are the methods responsible to capture an objects current state to save it to disk or send it over the network. At the end of the chapter is a discussion on the two specialized ROOT files: TNetFile and TWebFile.; 11.1 The Physical Layout of ROOT Files; A ROOT file is like a UNIX file directory. It can contain directories and objects organized in unlimited number of levels. It also is stored in machine independent format (ASCII, IEEE floating point, Big Endian byte ordering). To look at the physical layout of a ROOT file, we first create one.

This class is describing the ROOT file (that has the extension “.root”). In the next section, we will cover TFile in details. The last line of the example closes the file.

ROOT provides an intelligent and elegant file recovery mechanism using the redundant directory information in the record header.; If a file that has been not properly closed is opened again, it is scanned and rebuilt according to the information in the record header. The recovery algorithm reads the file and creates the saved objects in memory according to the header information. It then rebuilds the directory and file structure. If the file is opened in write mode, the recovery makes the correction on disk when the file is closed; however if the file is opened in read mode, the correction can not be written to disk.

If there is another pointer to the object in the same I/O operation, the first object is referenced i.e. it is not saved again. When reading the file, the object is rebuilt and the references recalculated. Streaming object pointers. In this way, the network of pointers and their objects is rebuilt and ready to use the same way it was used before it was persistent. If the pointer hold the address of an object which in embedded in another object (as opposed to being pointed to by a pointer), the object will be duplicate at read time. To avoid this, make the pointer a transient data member.; 11.4.2 Motivation for the TRef Class; If the object is split into several files or into several branches of one or more TTrees, standard C++ pointers cannot be used because each I/O operation will write the referenced objects, and multiple copies will exist. In addition, if the pointer is read before the referenced object, it is null and may cause a run time system error. To address these limitations, ROOT offers the TRef class.; TRef allows referencing an object in a different branch and/or in a different file. TRef also supports the complex situation where a TFile is updated multiple times on the same machine or a different machine. When a TRef is read before its referenced object, it is null. As soon as the referenced object is read, the TRef points to it. In addition, one can specify an action to be taken by TRef in the case it is read before its reference object (see“Action on Demand” below).; 11.4.3 Using TRef; A TRef is a lightweight object pointing to any TObject. This object can be used instead of normal C++ pointers in case:. The referenced object R and the pointer P are not written to the same file; P is read before R; R and P are written to different Tree branches.

In case a URL specifies a local file, a TFile object will be returned (and of course no login information is needed). The arguments of the Open() function are the same as the ones for the TFile constructor.; Using ReOpen() method it is possible to reopen a file with a different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE, RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either “READ” or “UPDATE”. The method returns:. 0 in case the mode was successfully modified;; 1 in case the mode did not change (it was already as requested or there were wrong input arguments);; -1 in case of failure. In the last case the file cannot be used anymore. 11.7 Remotely Access to ROOT Files; ROOT files can be accessed remotely in many ways, on the base of the protocol URL. Among the most popular are XRootD (protocols ‘root://’ and ‘xrd://’) and a Web server (protocl ‘http://’ or ‘https://’).; The rootd daemon is deprecated and has been removed in version 6.16/00.; Please refer to the XRootD documentation for starting and ensuring that such a daemon is running.; Reading and writing ROOT files over the net can be done by creating a TFile object using the static method TFile::Open() object. This will instantiate the appropriate derivation of TFile to handle the request. Inheriting from the TFile class, the returned instance will have exactly the same interface and behavior of TFile. The only difference is that it reads and writes from a remote service.

To create a TTree we use its constructor. Then we design our data layout and add the branches. A tree can be created by giving a name and title:; TTree t(""MyTree"",""Example Tree"");; 12.7.1 Creating a Tree from a Folder Hierarchy; An alternative way to create a tree and organize it is to use folders (see “Folders and Tasks”). You can build a folder structure and create a tree with branches for each of the sub-folders:; TTree folder_tree(""MyFolderTree"",""/MyFolder"");; The second argument ""/MyFolder""",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

You fill the tree by placing the data into the folder structure and calling TTree::Fill.; 12.7.2 Tree and TRef Objects; MyTree->BranchRef();; This call requests the construction of an optional branch supporting table of references (TRefTable). This branch (TBranchRef) will keep all the information needed to find the branches containing referenced objects at each Tree::Fill, the branch numbers containing the referenced objects are saved in the table of references. When the Tree header is saved (via TTree::Write for example), the branch is saved, keeping the information with the pointers to the branches having referenced objects. Enabling this optional table, allow TTree::Draw to automatically load the branches needed to dereference a TRef (or TRefArray) object.; 12.7.3 Autosave; Autosave gives the option to save all branch buffers every n byte. We recommend using Autosave for large acquisitions. If the acquisition fails to complete, you can recover the file and all the contents since the last Autosave. To set the number of bytes between Autosave you can use the TTree::SetAutosave() method. You can also call TTree::Autosave in the acquisition loop every nentry.; 12.7.4 Trees with Circular Buffers; When a TTree is memory resident, you set it up so that it retains retain only the last few entries. For example, this can be very useful for monitoring purpose.; void TTree::SetCircular(Long64_t maxEntries);; where maxEntries is the maximum number of entries to be kept in the buffers. When the number of entries exceeds this value, the first entries in the Tree are deleted and the buffers used again. An example of a script using a circular buffer is shown below:; void circular() {; gROOT->cd(); //make sure that the Tree is memory resident; TTree *T = new TTree(""T"",""test circular buffers"");; TRandom r;; Float_t px,py,pz;; Double_t random;; UShort_t i;; T->Branch(""px"",&px,""px/F"");; T->Branch(""py"",&py,""py/F"");; T->Branch(""pz"",&pz,""pz/F"");; T",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

In case an expression is specified, the equivalent expression must be computed when calling GetEntryWithIndex(). To build an index with only majorname, specify minorname=""0"" (default).; Note that once the index is built, it can be saved with the TTree object with:; tree.Write(); //if the file has been open in ""update"" mode; The most convenient place to create the index is at the end of the filling process just before saving the tree header. If a previous index was computed, it is redefined by this new call.; Note that this function can also be applied to a TChain. The return value is the number of entries in the Index (< 0 indicates failure).; 12.8 Branches; The organization of branches allows the designer to optimize the data for the anticipated use. The class for a branch is called TBranch. If two variables are independent, and the designer knows the variables will not be used together, they should be placed on separate branches. If, however, the variables are related, such as the coordinates of a point, it is most efficient to create one branch with both coordinates on it. A variable on a TBranch is called a leaf (yes - TLeaf). Another point to keep in mind when designing trees is that branches of the same TTree can be written to separate files. To add a TBranch to a TTree we call the method TTree::Branch(). Note that we DO NOT use the TBranch constructor.; The TTree::Branch method has several signatures. The branch type differs by what is stored in it. A branch can hold an entire object, a list of simple variables, contents of a folder, contents of a TList, or an array of objects",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The TTree::Draw method is a powerful yet simple way to look and draw the trees contents. It enables you to plot a variable (a leaf) with just one line of code. However, the Draw method falls short once you want to look at each entry and design more sophisticated acceptance criteria for your analysis. For these cases, you can use TTree::MakeClass. It creates a class that loops over the trees entries one by one. You can then expand it to do the logic of your analysis.; The TTree::MakeSelector is the recommended method for ROOT data analysis. It is especially important for large data set in a parallel processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several processors and you can specify which entries to send to each processor.

For each variable the minimum value sits on the circle’s center, and the maximum on the circle’s radius.

If the 24000 events are plotted as solid lines and no special techniques are used to clarify the picture, the result is the previous picture which is very cluttered and useless. To improve the readability of the Parallel Coordinates output and to explore interactively the data set, many techniques are available. We have implemented a few in ROOT. First of all, in order to show better where the clusters on the various axes are, a 1D histogram is associated to each axis. These histograms (one per axis) are filled according to the number of lines passing through the bins. The histogram’s axis can be represented with colors or as bar charts. These histograms can be represented which colors (get from a palette according to the bin contents) or as bar charts. Both representations can be cumulated on the same plot. This technique allows seeing clearly where the clusters are on an individual axis but it does not give any hints about the correlations between the axes.; Avery simple technique allows to make the clusters appearing: Instead of painting solid lines we paint dotted lines. The cluttering of each individual line is reduced and the clusters show clearly as we can see on the next figure.

We will now go through the steps of using MakeClass with a simplified example. The methods used here obviously work for complex event loop calculations.; These are our assumptions: we would like to do selective plotting and loop through each entry of the tree and tracks. We chose a simple example: we want to plot fPx of the first 100 tracks of each entry. We have a ROOT tree with a branch for each data member in the “Event” object.

The methods of MyClass are:. MyClass(TTree *tree=0) - this constructor has an optional tree for a parameter. If you pass a tree, MyClass will use it rather than the tree from which it was created.; void Init(TTree *tree) - it is called by the constructor to initialize the tree for reading. It associates each branch with the corresponding leaf data member.; ~MyClass() -the destructor, nothing special.; Int_t GetEntry(Int_t entry) - it loads the class with the entry specified. Once you have executed GetEntry, the leaf data members in MyClass are set to the values of the entry. For example, GetEntry(12) loads the 13th event into the event data member of MyClass (note that the first entry is 0). GetEntry returns the number of bytes read from the file. In case the same entry is read twice, ROOT does not have to do any I/O. In this case GetEntry returns 1. It does not return 0, because many people assume a return of 0 means an error has occurred while reading.; Int_t LoadTree(Int_t entry) and void Notify() - these two methods are related to chains. LoadTree will load the tree containing the specified entry from a chain of trees.

We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small compared to the total processing time. In this case, if the I/O operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage of the total time and it may very well save a factor of 10 on disk space. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression may slow down the program’s performance.

It contains universal (also called automatic or black-box) algorithms that can generate random numbers from large classes of continuous (in one or multi-dimensions), discrete distributions, empirical distributions (like histograms) and also from practically all standard distributions. An extensive online documentation is available at the UNU.RAN Web Site http://statmath.wu-wien.ac.at/unuran/; The ROOT class TUnuran is used to interface the UNURAN package. It can be used as following:. With the UNU.RAN native, string API for pre-defined distributions (see UNU.RAN documentation for the allowed string values at http://statistik.wu-wien.ac.at/unuran/doc/unuran.html ):. TUnuran unr;; // initialize unuran to generate normal random numbers using; // a ""arou"" method; unr.Init(""normal()"",""method=arou"");; ...; // sample distributions N times (generate N random numbers); for (int i = 0; i<N; ++i); double x = unr.Sample();. For continuous 1D distribution object via the class TUnuranContDist that can be created for example from a TF1 function providing the pdf (probability density function) . The user can optionally provide additional information via TUnuranContDist::SetDomain(min,max) like the domain() for generating numbers in a restricted region. // 1D case: create a distribution from two TF1 object; // ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Similar functionality is currently provided by the CLHEP and packages and the ROOT Physics vector classes (See “Physics Vectors”). It also re-uses concepts and ideas from the CMS Common Vector package. In contrast to CLHEP or the ROOT physics libraries, GenVector provides class templates for modeling the vectors. The user can control how the vector is internally represented. This is expressed by a choice of coordinate system, which is supplied as a template parameter when the vector is constructed. Furthermore, each coordinate system is itself a template, so that the user can specify the underlying scalar type.; The GenVector classes do not inherit from TObject, therefore cannot be used as in the case of the physics vector classes in ROOT collections.; In addition, to optimize performances, no virtual destructors are provided.

We have deliberately avoided the use of any virtual function and even virtual destructors in the classes. In addition, as much as possible functions are defined as inline. For this reason, we have chosen to use template classes to implement the GenVector concepts instead of abstract or base classes and virtual functions. It is then recommended to avoid using the GenVector classes polymorphically and developing classes inheriting from them.; 13.12.1.2 Points and Vector Concept; Mathematically vectors and points are two distinct concepts.

This allows an easy connection with the linear algebra package, which in turn, allows creation of matrices using C arrays (like the ROOT TMatrix classes) or iterators (SMatrix classes).

Except for ROOT v3.10, the algorithms are all based on an LUfactorization followed by forward/back-substitution. ROOT v3.10 is using the slower Gaussian elimination method. The numerical accuracy of the CLHEP routine is poor:. up to 6x6 the numerical imprecise Cramer multiplication is hard-coded. For instance, calculating U=H*H-1, where H is a (5x5) Hilbert matrix, results in off-diagonal elements of \(10^{-7}\) instead of the \(10^{-13}\) using an LUaccording to Crout.; scaling protection is non-existent and limits are hard-coded, as a consequence inversion of a Hilbert matrix for sizes>(12x12) fails. In order to gain speed the CLHEP algorithm stores its permutation info of the pivots points in a static array, making multi-threading not possible. GSL uses LU decomposition without the implicit scaling of Crout. Therefore, its accuracy is not as good. For instance a (10x10) Hilbert matrix has errors 10 times larger than the LU Crout result.

A class with the ClassDef macro has the ability to obtain a TClass with the IsA method.; TClass *cl = obj->IsA();; It returns a TClass. In addition, an object can directly get the class name and the base classes by:; const char* name = obj->ClassName();; If the class is a descendent of TObject, you can check if an object inherits from a specific class, you can use the InheritsFrom method.

A default constructor is a constructor with zero parameters or with one or more parameters all with default values. An I/O constructor is a constructor with exactly one parameter which type is a pointer to one of the type marked as an ‘io constructor type’. We will come back to this context in a few paragraphs. This default or I/O constructor is called whenever an object is being read from a ROOT database. Be sure that you do not allocate any space for embedded pointer objects in this constructor. This space will be lost (memory leak) while reading in the object. For example:; class T49Event : public TObject {; private:; Int_t fId;; TCollection *fTracks;; ...; public:; // Error space for TList pointer will be lost; T49Event() { fId = 0; fTrack = new TList; }; // Correct default initialization of pointer; T49Event() { fId = 0; fTrack = 0; }; ...; };; The memory will be lost because during reading of the object the pointer will be set to the object it was pointing to at the time the object was written. Create the fTrack list when you need it, e.g. when you start filling the list or in a not-default constructor.; ...; if (!fTrack) fTrack = new TList;; ...; The constructor actually called by the ROOT I/O can be customized by using the rootcling pragma:; #pragma link C++ ioctortype UserClass;; For example, with this pragma and a class named MyClass, the ROOT I/O will call the first of the following 3 constructors which exists and is public:; MyClass(UserClass*);MyClass(TRootIOCtor*);; MyClass(); // Or a constructor with all its arguments defaulted.; When more than one pragma ioctortype is used, the first seen as priority.

However, if the Linkdef.h order is reversed then rootcling can generate the specialized Tmpl<int>::Streamer() before it is needed (and thus never instantiated by the compiler).; 15.5.1.2 Other Useful Pragma Statements; The complete list of pragma statements currently supported by Cling is:; #pragma link [C|C++|off] all [class|function|global|typedef];; #pragma link [C|C++|off]; [class|struct|union|enum|namespace|protected][name];; #pragma link [C|C++|off] [global|typedef][name];; #pragma link [C|C++|off] [nestedclass|nestedtypedef];. #pragma link [C++|C|off|MACRO] function [name]<(argtypes)>;; #pragma link; [C++|C|off|MACRO] function [classname]::[name]<(argtypes)>;; #pragma link off all methods;; #pragma link [C|C++|off] defined_in [filename];; #pragma link; [C|C++|off] defined_in [class|struct|namespace] [name];; #pragma link [C|C++|off] all_function [classname];; #pragma link [C|C++|off] all_datamember [classname];; The [classname] and the [name] can also contain wildcar",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

An exhaustive documentation of the CLI switches of genreflex can be inspected with the genreflex --help command.; The entity corresponding to the LinkDef file for genreflex is the selection XML file, also called selection XML or simply selection file. A selection XML file allows to describe a list of classes for which the dictionaries are to be created. In addition, it allows to specify properties of classes or data members, without the need to add comments in the source code. This is of primary importance when dictionaries must be created for classes residing in code which cannot be modified. For a complete description of the structure of the selection XML files and the way in which attributes can be set, refer to the genreflex --help command.; It is important to observe that selection XML files can be used in presence of rootcling invocations instead of LinkDef files.; 15.6.1 The ROOT::Meta::Selection namespace; Not only LinkDef and selection files allow to select the classes for which the dictionaries must be created: a third method is available. This is represented by the ROOT::Meta::Selection namespace. The idea behind this technique is that all the classes which are located in this special namespace are automatically selected for dictionary generation. All the properties and annotations allowed by LinkDef and selection XML files are possible.

Casting to the wrong class will give wrong results and may well crash the program! Therefore, the user has to be very careful. Often a container only contains one class of objects, but if it really contains a mixture, it is possible to ask each object about its class using the InheritsFrom method.; For example if myObject is a TObject pointer:; if (myObject->InheritsFrom(""TParticle"") {; printf(""myObject is a TParticlen"");; }; As the name suggests, this test works even if the object is a subclass of TParticle.

This method is therefore the key element for the creation of a hierarchical link between two volumes. As it will be described further on in this document, there are few other methods performing similar actions, but let us keep things simple for the time being. In addition, notice that there are some visualization-related calls in the example followed by a final TGeoVolume::Draw()call for the top volume. These are explained in details in the section “Visualization Settings and Attributes”. At this point, you will probably like to see how this geometry looks like. You just need to run the example and you will get the following picture that you can rotate using the mouse; or you can zoom / move it around (see what the Help menu of the GL window displays).; % root rootgeom.C.

A half space has to be defined using the constructor:. TGeoHalfSpace (const char *name, Double_t *point[3],; Double_t *norm[3]);; 18.3.3 Composite Shapes; Composite shapes are Boolean combinations of two or more shape components. The supported Boolean operations are union (+), intersection (*) and subtraction(-). Composite shapes derive from the base TGeoShape class, therefore providing all shape features: computation of bounding box, finding if a given point is inside or outside the combination, as well as computing the distance to entering/exiting. They can be directly used for creating volumes or used in the definition of other composite shapes.; Composite shapes are provided in order to complement and extend the set of basic shape primitives. They have a binary tree internal structure, therefore all shape-related geometry queries are signals propagated from top level down to the final leaves, while the provided answers are assembled and interpreted back at top. This CSG (composite solid geometry) hierarchy is effective for small number of components, while performance drops dramatically for large structures. Building a complete geometry in this style is virtually possible but highly not recommended.; 18.3.3.1 The Structure of Composite Shapes; A composite shape can always be looked as the result of a Boolean operation between only two shape components. All information identifying these two components as well as their positions with respect to the frame of the composite is represented by an object called Boolean node. A composite shape has a pointer to such a Boolean node. Since the shape components may also be composites, they will also contain binary Boolean nodes branching out other two shapes in the hierarchy. Any such branch ends-up when the final leaves are no longer composite shapes, but basic primitives.

This will create a special volume that will not be directly used in the geometry, but whenever positioned will require a list of actual parameters for the current shape that will be created in this process. Such volumes having shape parameters known only when used have to be positioned only with TGeoManager::Node() method (see ‘Creating and Positioning Volumes’).; Other case when shape parameterizations are quite useful is scaling geometry structures. Imagine that we would like to enlarge/shrink a detector structure on one or more axes. This happens quite often in real life and is handled by “fitting mother” parameters. This is accomplished by defining shapes with one or more invalid (negative) parameters. For instance, defining a box having dx=10., dy=10., and dz=-1 will not generate an error but will be interpreted in a different way: A special volume TGeoVolumeMulti will be created. Whenever positioned inside a mother volume, this will create a normal TGeoVolume object having as shape a box with dz fitting the corresponding dzof the mother shape. Generally, this type of parameterization is used when positioning volumes in containers having a matching shape, but it works also for most reasonable combinations.; 18.4 Geometry Creation; A given geometry can be built in various ways, but one has to follow some mandatory steps. Even if we might use some terms that will be explained later, here are few general rules:. Volumes need media and shapes in order to be created.; Both containers and contained volumes must be created before linking them together, and the relative transformation matrix must be provided.; Any volume have to be positioned somewhere otherwise it will not be considered as part of the geometry.; Visibility or tracking properties of volumes can be provided both at build time or after geo",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The meaning of the axis index is the following: for all volumes having shapes like box, trd1, trd2, trap, gtraorpara -1, 2, 3 mean X, Y, Z; for tube, tubs, cone, cons -1 means Rxy, 2 means phi and 3 means Z; for pcon and pgon - 2 means phi and 3 means Z; for spheres 1 means Rand 2 means phi.; In fact, the division operation has the same effect as positioning volumes in a given order inside the divided container - the advantage being that the navigation in such a structure is much faster. When a volume is divided, a volume family corresponding to the slices is created. In case all slices can be represented by a single shape, only one volume is added to the family and positioned N times inside the divided volume, otherwise, each slice will be represented by a distinct volume in the family.; Divisions can be also performed in a given range of one axis. For that, one has to specify also the starting coordinate value and the step:; TGeoVolume *slicex = box->Divide(""SLICEX"",1,N,start,step);; A check is always done on the resulting division range: if not fitting into the container limits, an error message is posted. If we will browse the divided volume we will notice that it will contain N nodes starting with index 1 up to N. The first one has the lower X limit at START position, while the last one will have the upper X limit at START+N*STEP. The resulting slices cannot be positioned inside another volume (they are by default positioned inside the divided one) but can be further divided and may contain other volumes:; TGeoVolume *slicey = slicex->Divide(""SLICEY"",2,N1);; slicey->AddNode(other_vol,index,some_matrix);; When doing that, we have to remember that SLICEY represents a family, therefore all members of the family will be divided on Y and the other volume will be added as node inside all.; In the example above all the resulting slices had the same shape as the divided volume (box).

The flag cross can be used in case the step is made on a boundary and specifies if user wants to cross or not the boundary. The returned node represents the new current node after the step was made. Making a geometrically contained step with boundary crossing (is_geom=kTRUE, cross=kTRUE) - This is the default method behavior. In this case, the step size is supposed to be already set by a previous TGeoManager::FindNextBoundary() call. Due to floating-point boundary uncertainties, making a step corresponding exactly to the distance to next boundary does not insure boundary crossing. If the method is called with this purpose, an extra small step will be made in order to make the crossing the most probable event (epsil=10-6cm).

Here \(\vec{d}\) represents the current direction. The next crossing point represents the point where a ray shot from the current point along the current direction crosses the surface.; Double_t *TGeoManager::FindNormal(Bool_t forward=kTRUE);; The method above computes the normal to the next crossed surface in forward or backward direction (i.e. the current one), assuming the state corresponding to a current arbitrary point is initialized. An example of usage of normal computation is ray tracing.; The two most important features of the geometrical modeller concerning tracking are scalability and performance as function of the total number of physical nodes. The first refers to the possibility to make use of the available memory resources and at the same time be able to resolve any geometrical query, while the second defines the capability of the modeller to respond quickly even for huge geometries. These parameters can become critical when simulating big experiments like those at LHC.; 18.5.8 Creating and Visualizing Tracks; In case the modeller is interfaced with a tracking engine, one might consider quite useful being able to store and visualize at least a part of the tracks in the context of the geometry.

The owner of such regions cannot be determined based on hierarchical considerations; therefore they will be considered as belonging to the node from which the current track is coming from. When coming from their container, the ownership is totally unpredictable. Again, the ownership of overlapping regions highly depends on the current track parameters.; We must say that even the overlaps of type A) and B) are allowed in case the corresponding nodes are created using TGeoVolume::AddNodeOverlap() method. Navigation is performed in such cases by giving priority to the non-overlapping nodes. The modeller has to perform an additional search through the overlapping candidates. These are detected automatically during the geometry closing procedure in order to optimize the algorithm, but we will stress that extensive usage of this feature leads to a drastic deterioration of performance. In the following we will focus on the non-declared overlaps of type A) and B) since this is the main source of errors during tracking.

Its interoperability with other programming languages, both for extending Python as well as embedding it, is excellent and many existing third-party applications and libraries have therefore so-called “Python bindings.” PyROOT provides Python bindings for ROOT: it enables cross-calls from ROOT/Cling into Python and vice versa, the intermingling of the two interpreters, and the transport of user-level objects from one interpreter to the other. PyROOT enables access from ROOT to any application or library that itself has Python bindings, and it makes all ROOT functionality directly available from the python interpreter.; 19.1 PyROOT Overview; The Python scripting language is widely used for scientific programming, including high performance and distributed parallel code (see http://www.scipy.org). It is the second most popular scripting language (after Perl) and enjoys a wide-spread use as a “glue language”: practically every library and application these days comes with Python bindings (and if not, they can be easily written or generated).; PyROOT, a Python extension module, provides the bindings for the ROOT class library in a generic way using the Cling dictionary. This way, it allows the use of any ROOT classes from the Python interpreter, and thus the “glue-ing” of ROOT libraries with any non-ROOT library or applications that provide Python bindings. Further, PyROOT can be loaded into the Cling interpreter to allow (as of now still rudimentary) access to Python classes.

In C++, however, memory handling is done either by hand, or by an application specific, customized mechanism (as is done in ROOT). Although PyROOT is made aware of ROOT memory management, there are still a few boundary conditions that need to be dealt with by hand. Also, the heuristics that PyROOT employs to deal with memory management are not infallible. An understanding in some detail of the choices that are made is thus important.; 19.1.6.1 Automatic Memory Management; There are two global policies that can be set: heuristics and strict.

When the object goes out of scope on the C++ side, the Python object will change type into an object that largely behaves like None. The strict policy differs in that it will never relinquish ownership when passing an object as a parameter to a function. It is then up to the developer to prevent double deletes.

Here is an example for working with the latter only:; from ROOT import TFile, TTree; from array import array. h = TH1F('h1','test',100,-10.,10.); f = TFile('test.root','recreate'); t = TTree('t1','tree with histos'); maxn = 10; n = array('i',[0]); d = array('f',maxn*[0.]); t.Branch('mynum',n,'mynum/I'); t.Branch('myval',d,'myval[mynum]/F'). for i in range(25):; n[0] = min(i,maxn); for j in range(n[0]):; d[j] = i*0.1+j; t.Fill(). f.Write(); f.Close(); The use of arrays is needed, because the pointer to the address of the object that is used for filling must be given to the TTree::Branch() call, even though the formal argument is declared a ’void*'. In the case of ROOT objects, similar pointer manipulation is unnecessary, because the full type information is available, and TTree::Branch() has been Pythonized to take care of the call details. However, data members of such objects that are of built-in types, still require something extra since they are normally translated to Python primitive types on access and hence their address cannot be taken. For that purpose, there is the AddressOf() function. As an example:; from ROOT import TFile, TTree; from ROOT import gROOT, AddressOf. gROOT.ProcessLine(; ""struct MyStruct { Int_t fMyInt1; Int_t fMyInt2; Int_t fMyInt3; Char_t fMyCode[4]; };"" );. from ROOT import MyStruct; mystruct = MyStruct(); f = TFile('mytree.root','RECREATE'); tree = TTree('T','Just A Tree'); tree.Branch('myints',mystruct,'MyInt1/I:MyInt2:MyInt3'); tree.Branch('mycode',AddressOf(mystruct,'fMyCode'),'MyCode/C'); for i in range(0,10):; mystruct.fMyInt1 = i; mystruct.fMyInt2 = i*i; mystruct.fMyInt3 = i*i*i; mystruct.fMyCode = ""%03d"" % i # note string assignment. tree.Fill(). f.Write(); f.Close(); The C++ class is def",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Most of the above is for ROOT version 5.02 and later only. For older releases, and without further support, here is an example as to how you can get hold of a pointer-to-pointer to a ROOT object:; h = TH1F(); addressofobject = array('i',[h.IsA().DynamicCast(h.IsA(),h)]); 19.1.10 Using Your Own Classes; A user’s own classes can be accessed after loading, either directly or indirectly, the library that contains the dictionary. One easy way of obtaining such a library, is by using ACLiC:; $ cat MyClass.C; class MyClass {; public:. MyClass(int value = 0) {; m_value = value;; }. void SetValue(int value) {; m_value = value;; }. int GetValue() {; return m_value;; }. private:; int m_value;; };. $ echo .L MyClass.C+ | root.exe -b; [...]; Info in <TUnixSystem::ACLiC>: creating shared library [..]/./MyClass_C.so; $; Then you can use it, for example, like so:; from ROOT import gSystem. # load library with MyClass dictionary; gSystem.Load('MyClass_C'). # get MyClass from ROOT; from ROOT import MyClass; # use MyClass; m = MyClass(42); print(m.GetValue()); You can also load a macro directly, but if you do not use ACLiC, you will be restricted to use the default constructor of your class, which is otherwise fully functional. For example:; from ROOT import gROOT. # load MyClass definition macro (append '+' to use ACLiC); gROOT.LoadMacro('MyClass.C'). # get MyClass from ROOT; from ROOT import MyClass. # use MyClass; m = MyClass(); m.SetValue(42); print(m.GetValue()); 20 The Tutorials and Tests; This chapter is a guide to the examples that come with the installation of ROOT.

In multi-threaded systems, these properties are divided between processes and threads.; 23.1.1 Process Properties; A process in a multi-threaded system is the changeable entity. It must be considered as an execution frame. It has all traditional process attributes, such as:. Process ID, process group ID, user ID, and group ID; Environment; Working directory. A process also provides a common address space and common system resources:. File descriptors; Signal actions; Shared libraries; Inter-process communication tools (such as message queues, pipes, semaphores, or shared memory). 23.1.2 Thread Properties; A thread is the schedulable entity. It has only those properties that are required to ensure its independent flow of control. These include the following properties:. Stack; Scheduling properties (such as policy or priority); Set of pending and blocked signals; Some thread-specific data (TSD). An example of thread-specific data is the error indicator, errno. In multi-threaded systems, errno is no longer a global variable, but usually a subroutine returning a thread-specific errno value. Some other systems may provide other implementations of errno. With respect to ROOT, a thread specific data is for example the gPad pointer, which is treated in a different way, whether it is accessed from any thread or the main thread.; Threads within a process must not be considered as a group of processes (even though in Linux each thread receives an own process id, so that it can be scheduled by the kernel scheduler). All threads share the same address space. This means that two pointers having the same value in two threads refer to the same data. Also, if any thread changes one of the shared system resources, all threads within the process are affected. For example, if a thread closes a file, the file is closed for all threads.; 23.1.3 The Initial Thread; When a process is created, one thread is automatically created.

So give a name to the thread in compiled use:; root[] TThread *th = new TThread(""MyThread"", UserFun, UserArgs);; You can pass arguments to the thread function using the UserArgs-pointer.

As all of them inherit from TGObject and most from TGWidget, these base classes are described first.; 25.5.1 TGObject; TGObject is the base class for all ROOT GUI classes. It inherits from TObject. The two data members of this class contain important information about X11/Win32 window identifier and the connection to the host’s graphics system. Every GUI element, which derives from TGObject has access to the TGClient via the data member fClient of TGObject. TGClient creates the connection with the host’s graphics system and sets up the complete graphics system for all widgets.; 25.5.2 TGWidget; The widgets base class TGWidget is typically used as a mix-in class via multiple inheritances. Its properties are available for all deriving widgets: TGButton, TGComboBox, TGTab, TGColorPalette, TGColorPick, TGDoubleSlider, TGListTree, TGNumberEntry, TGScrollBar, TGShutterItem, TGTextEntry, TGSlider, TGListBox, TGView.; This class has four data members keeping information about the widget id - important for event processing, the window which handles the widget’s events, the widget status flags and the assigned command (if there is any). The general properties of TGWidget are specified by SetFlags(Int_t flags) and ClearFlags(Int_t flags) methods. The status flags are: kWidgetWantFocus, kWidgetHasFocus, and kWidgetIsEnabled. The method Associate(const TGWindow* w) - sets the window which handles the widget events. SetCommand(const char* command) - sets the command to be executed. The command string can be gathering via GetCommand() method. For example, the third parameter in TGTextButton constructor can be omitted and set later in your program, i.e. instead of:; TGTextButton *exit = new TGTextButton(hframe,""&Exit"",; ""gApplication->Terminate()"");; You will have the following the two lines:; ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

There are two general ways for the user to interact with an application: the keyboard and the mouse. The Graphical User Interface is as a bridge between the user and the program - it provides methods to detect the user actions and instruments that do something as a reaction of these actions. The user communicates with an application through the window system. The window system reports interaction events to the application.

We already used its constructor in the example. The button label indicates the action to be taken when the button is selected or pressed. The text can be a hot string defining a hot key (known as shortcut key also) for this selection. The hot key is an underlined character in a button label that shows the assigned keyboard mnemonic for its choice. A button that prompts more information for users has the label generally followed by ellipsis (…). As we saw the hot strings “&Draw” and “&Exit” define the text labels “Draw” and “Exit” and keyboard mnemonics Alt+D, Alt+E for their selection. The letter D and E appear underlined on the screen. All text buttons should have a unique shortcut key with the exception of OK and Cancel.; These buttons are usually placed within a window to provide fast access to frequently used or critical commands. They help in situations where a command is not available through the menu bar. You already know that a command string can be passed in the text button via the constructor:; TGTextButton(const TGWindow *p, const char *s, const char *cmd,; Int_t id, GContext_t norm, FontStruct_t font,; UInt_t options);; A button label can be changed by SetText(new_label). There are important guidelines to be followed about a button label. The text has to provide a meaningful description of the performed action. The single-word label should be used whenever possible, only two-three words for clarity, if necessary. Do not number labels. Always follow all platform presentation and usage guidelines for standard button functions. Let’s remember a few standard names and definitions of well known buttons:; OK - any changed information in a window is accepted and the window is closed;; Cancel - closes window without implementing submitted changes;; Reset- resets defaults and cancels any changed information that has not be submitted;; Apply - any chan",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

These buttons may appear alone or placed in a group at the window’s top or side. They are most frequently used to quickly access commands, many of which are normally accessed through the tool bar. For example, the picture buttons below can be used to provide different styles of a histogram drawing. Here is the example how to create the first button:; TGPictureButton *fPicture = new TGPictureButton(parent,; gClient->GetPicture(""h1_s.xpm""), 11);; The picture of file h1_s.xpm is used in the button. All .xpm files are located in the directory $ROOTSYS/icons. You can assign a command directly as a parameter of the picture button constructor. The picture of TGPictureButton can be changed by:; fPicture->SetPicture(""h2_s.xpm"");; The advantage of command buttons is that they are always visible, providing a reminder of their existence. They can be inscribed with a meaningful description of what they do by TGToolTip(""Some describing text""). Their activation is much easier and faster than using a two-step menu bar/pull-down sequence. The only disadvantage of the text and picture buttons is that they consume considerable screen space if they are many. Having no more than six command buttons per window or dialog box helps to appropriately balance the application’s effectiveness, its real efficiency, and the operational simplicity.; The classes TGRadioButton and TGCheckButton present the option buttons in ROOT. Like the text buttons, they have text or hot string as a label. Radio buttons are grouped in logical sets of two or more and appear with a text label to the right. The choices are mutually exclusive and only one setting is permitted at one time. They represent visually all alternatives and it is easy to access and compare choices. They facilitate the situations where all alternatives cannot be easily remembered or where displaying the alternatives together helps to understand and select the proper choice.

If the number of choices exceeds this maximum, it is better to use a multiple selection list box.; The method IsToggleButton() gives the information whether a radio button or a check button is selected. An option button can be set or unset via its method PSetState(EButtonState state).; The method HandleKey(event) is called when the defined hotkey is hit for any button. It sets the selected option button or clicks the selected text button and invokes its defined action.; 25.8.2 Text Entries; A TGTextEntry is a one-line text input widget. It contains text that is entered or modified through the keyboard. This text may be displayed in different way according to the set echo mode. Users can control them bySetEchoMode(), GetEchoMode() methods. kNormal - display characters as they are entered (default);; kNoEcho - do not display anything;; kPassword - display asterisks instead of the characters actually entered.

A number entry is a single-line field followed by two small, vertically arranged up-down buttons. Its purpose is to make a selection by either scrolling through a small set of meaningful predefined choices or typing numbers. The TGNumberFormat class contains enum types to specify the numeric format. The number entry widget is based on TGTextEntry. It allows only numerical input. The widget supports numerous formats including integers, hex numbers, real numbers, fixed fraction real and time/date formats. It also allows to restrict input values to non-negative or positive numbers and to specify explicit limits. The following styles are supported:. kNESInteger - integer number; kNESRealOne - real number with one digit (no exponent); kNESRealTwo - real number with two digits (no exponent); kNESRealThree - real number with three digits (no exponent); kNESRealFour - real number with four digits (no exponent); kNESReal - arbitrary real number; kNESDegree - angle in degree:minutes:seconds format; kNESMinSec - time in minutes:seconds format;",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The number entry widgets also support using the up and down cursor keys to change the numerical values. The step size can be selected with control and shift keys:. –small step (1 unit/factor of 3); Shift medium step (10 units/factor of 10); Controllarge step (100 units/factor of 30); Shift+Controlhuge step (1000 units/factor of 100).

The menu system classes are TGMenuBar, TGMenuTitle, TGPopupMenu, and TGMenuEntry.; The TGMenuBar class implements a menu bar widget. It is used to specify and provide access to common and frequently used application actions described in menu titles, implemented by TGMenuTitle class.

If you use a single tool bar, it should fill the complete width of its parent. When using more than one, you should also think about setting the bar size to the end of the most right button. This way other bars can be displayed in the same row below the menu bar.; Tool bar buttons should have equal size, meaningful and unique icons, and short meaningful tool tip text. The related buttons should be grouped together by frequency or sequence of use, or importance. Potentially destructive buttons must be separated from them to avoid accidental activation and potentially catastrophic results. Temporarily not available items should be displayed grayed out.; 25.8.6 List Boxes; The purpose of a list box is to display a collection of items from which single or multiple selection can be made. It is always visible, having a scroll bar when the displayed area is not enough to show all items. The choices may be mutually exclusive (a list box with single selection) or not mutually exclusive (a list box with multiple selection). The proper usage of the list boxes is for selecting values, or objects, or setting attributes. You have to create them to display 4 to 8 choices at one time (3 is a required minimum in case of lack of screen space). The list should contain not more than 40 items accessible by scrolling view (vertical scroll bar). If more are required, you should provide a method for using search criteria or scoping the options. The best list boxes use is for textual data or choices. They should be wide enough to display fully all items.

The selected choices should be visible - you have several choices to do this:. to mark selected choices with a check mark or highlight them; to provide a summary list box to the right of the list box, containing the selected choices; to provide a display-only text control indicating the number of selected choices (its position should be justified upper-right above the list box); if the actions Select All or Deselect All must be quickly or frequently performed, use command buttons. 25.8.7 Combo Boxes; A combo box is as single-selection list box that shows only the currently selected entry and a prompt button displayed as a downward arrow. The prompt button provides a visual cue that a list box is hidden. Its main advantage is consuming of quite a bit of screen space. When the user clicks on it, a list pops up, from which a new choice can be made. After a new item is chosen the combo box folds again showing the new selection. The combo box widget is represented by the user callable class TGComboBox. The class TGComboBoxPopup is a service class. The combo box constructor is very similar to the list box one. The first parameter is a parent widget pointer again, the second - an integer value that will be used as combo box ID. The method used for adding entries is very similar to the list box method we used before. The method Select(entryID) sets the current combo box entry.; char tmp[20];; // combo box layout hints; fLcombo = new TGLayoutHints(kLHintsTop | kLHintsLeft,5,5,5,5);; // combo box widget; TGComboBox *fCombo = new TGComboBox(parent,100);",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

It may be oriented horizontally or vertically. In both cases it provides an excellent indication of where a value exists within a range of values. The class TGHSlider represents the horizontal slider; TGVSlider - the vertical one. Both inherit from the base class TGSlider that creates the main slider parameters: the range of values within a value can be selected; the indicator type; the tick mark scale. Using its methods SetRange, SetPosition and SetScale you can set these parameters. To retrieve the set slider value you can call GetPosition method.; Next sample code creates a horizontal slider hslider with a tick mark of type kSlider1. Its width is 150 pixels, and its scale is placed down (kScaleDownRight). The last parameter in the TGHSlider constructor is the slider ID. It will be used for event processing. The methods SetRange and SetPosition set the range and the current tick mark position of the slider.; hslider = new TGHSlider(parent,150,kSlider1|kScaleDownRight,sID);; hslider->SetRange(0,50);; hslider->SetPosition(39);; Slider values can be set by using the mouse to drag the slider across the scale until the desired value is reached. Another way is to click in the slider trough instead of dragging.; 25.8.8.1 Double Slider; Double slider widgets allow easy selection of a min and a max value out of a range. They can be either horizontal or vertical oriented. There is a choice of different types of tick marks: kDoubleScaleNo, kScaleDownRight, kDoubleScaleBoth.; To change the min value you should press the left mouse button near to the left (TGDoubleHSlider) or bottom (TGDoubleHSlider) edge of the slider.

A TGCanvas is a frame containing two scrollbars (horizontal and vertical) and a viewport (TGViewPort). The viewport acts as the window through which we look at the contents of the container frame. A TGContainer frame manages a content area. It can display and control a hierarchy of multi-column items, and provides the ability to add new items at any time. By default it doesn’t map sub-windows, which are items of the container. In this case sub-window must provide DrawCopy method, see for example TGLVEntry class. It is also possible to use option which allows mapping sub-windows. This option has much slower drawing speed in case of more than 1000 items placed in container. To activate this option the fMapSubwindows data member must be set to kTRUE (for example TTVLVContainer class).; A scroll bar only is available when scrolling is necessary.

Each editor tab is a resource shared among all the class-editors. Tabs must be created from the constructor of your editor-class by using the method:; TGVerticalFrame* TGedFrame::CreateEditorTabSubFrame(const Text_t *name),; It returns a pointer to a new tab container frame ready for use in your class. If you need to hide/show this frame depending on the object’s status, you should store it in a data member. See for examples: TH1Editor, TH2Editor.; 25.9.2.3 Base-Class Editors Control; Full control over base-class editors can be achieved by re-implementing virtual method void TGedFrame::ActivateBaseClassEditors(TClass *cl). It is called during each compound editor rebuild and the default implementation simply offers all base-classes to the publishing mechanism.; To prevent inclusion of a base-class into the compound editor, call:; void TGedEditor::ExcludeClassEditor(TClass* class, Bool_t recurse); Pointer to the compound GED-editor is available in TGedFrame‘s data-member:; TGedEditor *fGedEditor; Ordering of base-class editor frames follows the order of the classes in the class hierarchy. This order can be changed by modifying the value of TGedFrame’s data member Int_t fPriority. The default value is 50; smaller values move the frame towards to the top. This priority should be set in the editor constructor.; 25.10 Drag and Drop; Drag and Drop support is introduced for Linux (via Xdnd - the drag and drop protocol for X window system) and for Windows (via Clipboard). Users can selects something in ROOT with a mouse press, drags it (moves the mouse while keeping the mouse button pressed) and releases the mouse button someplace else. When the button is released the selected data is “dropped” at that location. This way, a histogram from an opened ROOT file in the browser can be dragged to any TCanvas. A script file from the browser can be dropped to a TGTextView or TGTextEdit widget in TGTextEditor.; On Linux,",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Preface; In late 1994, we decided to learn and investigate Object Oriented programming and C++ to better judge the suitability of these relatively new techniques for scientific programming.

Finally, after about four months we had a histogramming package that was faster and more efficient than the well-known FORTRAN based HBOOK histogramming package. This gave us enough confidence in the new technologies to decide to continue the development. Thus was born ROOT. Since its first public release at the end of 1995, ROOT has enjoyed an ever-increasing popularity. Currently it is being used in all major High Energy and Nuclear Physics laboratories around the world to monitor, to store and to analyse data. In the other sciences as well as the medical and financial industries, many people are using ROOT. We estimate the current user base to be around several thousand people. In 1997, Eric Raymond analysed in his paper “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” the development method that makes Linux such a success. The essence of that method is: “release early, release often and listen to your customers”. This is precisely how ROOT is being developed. Over the last five years, many of our “customers” became co-developers. Here we would like to thank our main co-developers and contributors:; Masaharu Goto wrote the C++ interpreter CINT that was an essential part of ROOT before ROOT 6. Despite being 8 time zones ahead of us, we have the feeling he has been sitting in the room next door since 1995.; Andrei and Mi",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Currently it is being used in all major High Energy and Nuclear Physics laboratories around the world to monitor, to store and to analyse data. In the other sciences as well as the medical and financial industries, many people are using ROOT. We estimate the current user base to be around several thousand people.

First, we explain what we mean by a framework and then why it is an object-oriented framework.; 1.4.1 What Is a Framework?; Programming inside a framework is a little like living in a city. Plumbing, electricity, telephone, and transportation are services provided by the city. In your house, you have interfaces to the services such as light switches, electrical outlets, and telephones. The details, for example, the routing algorithm of the phone switching system, are transparent to you as the user. You do not care; you are only interested in using the phone to communicate with your collaborators to solve your domain specific problems.; Programming outside of a framework may be compared to living in the country. In order to have transportation and water, you will have to build a road and dig a well. To have services like telephone and electricity you will need to route the wires to your home. In addition, you cannot build some things yourself. For example, you cannot build a commercial airport on your patch of land. From a global perspective, it would make no sense for everyone to build their own airport. You see you will be very busy building the infrastructure (or framework) before you can use the phone to communicate with your collaborators and have a drink of water at the same time. In software engineering, it is much the same way. In a framework, the basic utilities and services, such as I/O and graphics, are provided. In addition, ROOT being a HEP analysis framework, it provides a large selection of HEP specific utilities such as histograms and fitting. The drawback of a framework is that you are constrained to it, as you are constraint to use the routing algorithm provided by your telephone service. You also have to learn the framework interfaces, which in this analogy is the same as learning how to use a telephone.; If you are interested in doing physics, a good HEP framework will save you much work. Next is a list of the more commonly used components ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

You also have to learn the framework interfaces, which in this analogy is the same as learning how to use a telephone.; If you are interested in doing physics, a good HEP framework will save you much work. Next is a list of the more commonly used components of ROOT: Command Line Interpreter, Histograms and Fitting, Writing a Graphical User Interface, 2D Graphics, Input/Output , Collection Classes, Script Processor.; There are also less commonly used components, as: 3D Graphics, Parallel Processing (PROOF), Run Time Type Identification (RTTI), Socket and Network Communication, Threads.; 1.4.1.1 Advantages of Frameworks; The benefits of frameworks can be summarized as follows:. Less code to write - the programmer should be able to use and reuse the majority of the existing code. Basic functionality, such as fitting and histogramming are implemented and ready to use and customize.; More reliable and robust code - the code inherited from a framework has already been tested and integrated with the rest of the framework.; More consistent and modular code - the code reuse provides consistency and common capabilities between programs, no matter who writes them. Frameworks make it easier to break programs into smaller pieces.; More focus on areas of expertise - users can concentrate on their particular problem domain. They do not have to be experts at writing user interfaces, graphics, or networking to use the frameworks that provide those services. 1.4.2 Why Object-Oriented?; Object-Oriented Programming offers considerable benefits compared to Procedure-Oriented Programming:. Encapsulation enforces data abstraction and increases opportunity for reuse.; Sub classing and inheritance make it possible to extend and modify objects.; Class hierarchies and containment containment hierarchies provide a flexible mechanism for modeling real-world objects and the relationships among them.; Complexity is reduced because there is little growth of ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

You may work on a platform where your system administrator has already installed ROOT.

The ROOT source code automatically generates this documentation, so each class is explicitly documented on its own web page, which is always up to date with the latest official release of ROOT.; The ROOT Reference Guide web pages can be found at class index reference guide https://root.cern/doc/master/classes.html. Each page contains a class description, and an explanation of each method. It shows the class inheritance tree and lets you jump to the parent class page by clicking on the class name. If you want more details, you can even see the source. There is a help page available in the little box on the upper right hand side of each class documentation page. You can see on the next page what a typical class documentation web page looks like.

There are two examples to click through and learn how to use the GUI. We continue by using the command line, and explaining the coding conventions, global variables and the environment setup. If you have not installed ROOT, you can do so by following the instructions in the appendix, or on the ROOT web site: http://root.cern.ch/root/Availability.html; 2.1 Setting the Environment Variables; Before you can run ROOT you need to set the environment variable ROOTSYS and change your path to include root/bin and library path variables to include root/lib. Please note: the syntax is for bash, if you are running tcsh you will have to use setenv instead of export. Define the variable $ROOTSYS to the directory where you unpacked the ROOT:. $ export ROOTSYS=$HOME/root. Add ROOTSYS/bin to your PATH:. $ export PATH=$PATH:$ROOTSYS/bin. Setting the Library Path.

Histograms of all types may have positive or/and negative bin contents.; 3.5 Random Numbers and Histograms; TH1::FillRandom() can be used to randomly fill a histogram using the contents of an existing TF1 function or another TH1 histogram (for all dimensions). For example, the following two statements create and fill a histogram 10 000 times with a default Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and sigma 1 :; root[] TH1F h1(""h1"",""Histo from a Gaussian"",100,-3,3);; root[] h1.FillRandom(""gaus"",10000);; TH1::GetRandom() can be used to get a random number distributed according the contents of a histogram. To fill a histogram following the distribution in an existing histogram you can use the second signature of TH1::FillRandom(). Next code snipped assumes that h is an existing histogram (TH1 ).; root[] TH1F h2(""h2"",""Histo from existing histo"",100,-3,3);; root[] h2.FillRandom(&h1, 1000);; The distribution contained in the histogram h1 ( TH1 ) is integrated over the channel contents. It is normalized to one. The second parameter (1000) indicates how many random numbers are generated.; Getting 1 random number implies:. Generating a random number between 0 and 1 (say r1 ); Find the bin in the normalized integral for r1; Fill histogram channel. You can see below an example of the TH1::GetRandom() method which can be used to get a random number distributed according the contents of a histogram.; void getrandomh() {; TH1F *source = new TH1F(""source"",""source hist"",100,-3,3);; source->FillRandom(""gaus"",1000);; TH1F *final = new TH1F(""final"",""final hist"",100,-3,3);. // continued... for (Int_t i=0;i<10000;i++) {; final->Fill(source->GetRandom());; }; TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas(""c1"",""c1"",800,1000);; c1->Divide(1,2);; c1->cd(1);; source->Draw();; c1->cd(2);; final->Draw();; c1->cd();; }; 3.6 Adding, Dividing, and Multiplying; Many types of operations are supported on histograms or between histograms:.

The THistPainter class specializes in the drawing of histograms. It allows logarithmic axes (x, y, z) when the CONT drawing option is using. The THistPainter class is separated from the histogram so that one can have histograms without the graphics overhead, for example in a batch program. The choice to give each histogram has its own painter rather than a central singleton painter, allows two histograms to be drawn in two threads without overwriting the painter’s values. When a displayed histogram is filled again, you do not have to call the Draw method again. The image is refreshed the next time the pad is updated. A pad is updated after one of these three actions:. A carriage control on the ROOT command line; A click inside the pad; A call to TPad::Update(). By default, the TH1::Draw clears the pad before drawing the new image of the histogram. You can use the ""SAME"" option to leave the previous display intact and superimpose the new histogram. The same histogram can be drawn with different graphics options in different pads. When a displayed histogram is deleted, its image is automatically removed from the pad. To create a copy of the histogram when drawing it, you can use TH1::DrawClone(). This will clone the histogram and allow you to change and delete the original one without affecting the clone.

To change the current style for histograms, the TStyle class provides a multitude of methods ranging from setting the fill color to the axis tick marks.

You will need to call UseCurrentStyle() on each histogram. When reading many histograms from a file and you wish to update them to the current style, you can use gROOT::ForceStyle and all histograms read after this call will be updated to use the current style. See “Graphics and the Graphical User Interface”. When a histogram is automatically created as a result of a TTree::Draw , the style of the histogram is inherited from the tree attributes and the current style is ignored. The tree attributes are the ones set in the current TStyle at the time the tree was created. You can change the existing tree to use the current style, by calling TTree::UseCurrentStyle() .; 3.8.2 Draw Options; The following draw options are supported on all histogram classes:. “AXIS”: Draw only the axis.; “HIST”: When a histogram has errors, it is visualized by default with error bars.

Asymmetry = (h1 - h2)/(h1 + h2); //where h1 = this. It works for 1D , 2D , etc. histograms. The parameter c2 is an optional argument that gives a relative weight between the two histograms, and dc 2 is the error on this weight. This is useful, for example, when forming an asymmetry between two histograms from two different data sets that need to be normalized to each other in some way. The function calculates the errors assuming Poisson statistics on h1 and h2 (that is, dh=sqrt(h)). In the next example we assume that h1 and h2 are already filled:. h3 = h1->GetAsymmetry(h2);. Then h3 is created and filled with the asymmetry between h1 and h2 ; h1 and h2 are left intact.; Note that the user’s responsibility is to manage the created histograms.; TH1::Reset() - resets the bin contents and errors of a histogram. 3.13 Important note on returned statistics (GetMean, GetStdDev, etc.); By default, histogram statistics are computed at fill time using the unbinned data used to update the bin content. This means the values returned by GetMean, GetStdDev, etc., are those of the dataset used to fill the histogram, not those of the binned content of the histogram itself, unless one of the axes has been zoomed. (See the documentation on TH1::GetStats().) This is useful if you want to keep track of the mean and standard deviation of the dataset you are visualizing with the histogram, but it can lead to some unintuitive results.; For example, suppose you have a histogram with one bin between 0 and 100, then you fill it with a Gaussian dataset with mean 20 and standard deviation 2:; TH1F * h = new TH1F(""h"", ""h"", 1, 0, 100);; for(int i=0; i<10000; i++) h->Fill(gRandom->Gaus(20, 2));; Right now, h->GetMean() will return 20 and h->GetStdDev() will return 2; ROOT calculated these values as we filled h.

There are several graph classes; they are TGraph, TGraphErrors, TGraphAsymmErrors, and TMultiGraph.; 4.1 TGraph; The TGraph class supports the general case with non-equidistant points, and the special case with equidistant points.

When using the Fit method the minimization package (and its options) can be selected using the static methods of the ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions class. For example to select Minuit2 instead of Minuit for fitting an histogram do:; ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer(""Minuit2"");; // fit the histogram histo with the gaussian pre-defined function; histo->Fit(""gaus"");; In the following we will give some brief description of the minimization packages.

The variables in the various Minuit labeled common blocks have been changed to the TMinuit class data members; The internal arrays with a maximum dimension depending on the maximum number of parameters are now data members’ arrays with a dynamic dimension such that one can fit very large problems by simply initializing the TMinuit constructor with the maximum number of parameters; The include file Minuit.h has been commented as much as possible using existing comments in the code or the printed documentation; The original Minuit subroutines are now member functions; Constructors and destructor have been added; Instead of passing the FCN function in the argument list, the addresses of this function is stored as pointer in the data members of the class.

In particles physics neural networks are mainly used for classification tasks (signal over background discrimination). A vast majority of commonly used neural networks are multilayer perceptrons. This implementation of multilayer perceptrons is inspired from the MLPfit package, which remains one of the fastest tools for neural networks studies.; 5.12.2 The MLP; The multilayer perceptron is a simple feed-forward network with the following structure showed on the left. It is made of neurons characterized by a bias and weighted links in between - let’s call those links synapses. The input neurons receive the inputs, normalize them and forward them to the first hidden layer. Each neuron in any subsequent layer first computes a linear combination of the outputs of the previous layer. The output of the neuron is then function of that combination with f being linear for output neurons or a sigmoid for hidden layers.; Such a structure is very useful because of two theorems:; 1- A linear combination of sigmoids can approximate any continuous function.; 2- Trained with output=1 for the signal and 0 for the background, the approximated function of inputs X is the probability of signal, knowing X.; 5.12.3 Learning Methods; The aim of all learning methods is to minimize the total error on a set of weighted examples. The error is defined as the sum in quadrate, divided by two, of the error on each individual output neuron. In all methods implemented in this library, one needs to compute the first derivative of that error with respect to the weights.

Fortunately, the compiler won’t tolerate an attempt to do something like:; root[] my_objptr.Solve();; As we have seen, heap objects have to be accessed via pointers, whereas stack objects can be accessed directly. They can also be accessed via pointers:; root[] Quad stack_quad(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *stack_ptr = &stack_quad;; root[] stack_ptr->Solve();; Here we have a Quad pointer that has been initialized with the address of a stack object. Be very careful if you take the address of stack objects. As we shall see soon, they are deleted automatically, which could leave you with an illegal pointer. Using it will corrupt and may as well crash the program!; It is time to look at the destruction of objects. A destructor is a special C++ function that releases resources for (or destroys) an object of a class. It is the opposite of a constructor that creates the object of a class when it is called. The compiler will provide a destructor that does nothing if none is provided. We will add one to our Quad class so that we can see when it is called. The class names the destructor but with a prefix ~ which is the C++ one’s complement i.e. bit wise complement, and hence has destruction overtones! We declare it in the .h file and define it in the .cxx file. It does not do much except print out that it has been called (still a useful debug technique despite today’s powerful debuggers!).; Now run root, load the Quad class and create a heap object:; root[] .L Quad.cxx; root[] Quad *my_objptr = new Quad(1.,2.,-3.);; To delete the object:; root[] delete my_objptr;; root[] my_objptr = 0;; You should see the print out from its destructor.

It is used for the prompt, both C++ and Python. It also serves as a source of information to store C++ objects, and provides the back-end for ROOT’s signal/slot and plug-in mechanisms.; This chapter focuses on the parts of cling that you will encounter while interacting with ROOT.; 7.1 The ROOT Prompt; Start up a ROOT session by typing root at the system prompt.; $ root; -------------------------------------------------------------------------; | Welcome to ROOT 6.10/01 http://root.cern.ch |; | (c) 1995-2017, The ROOT Team |; | Built for macosx64 |; | From heads/v6-10-00-patches@v6-10-00-25-g9f78c3a, Jul 03 2017, 11:39:44 |; | Try '.help', '.demo', '.license', '.credits', '.quit'/'.q' |; -------------------------------------------------------------------------. root [0]; Now we create a TLine object:; root [1] TLine l;; root [2] l.Print(); TLine X1=0.000000 Y1=0.000000 X2=0.000000 Y2=0.000000; root [3] l.SetX1(10); root [4] l.SetY1(11); root [5] l.Print(); TLine X1=10.000000 Y1=11.000000 X2=0.000000 Y2=0.000000; root [6] .g l; .g l; ROOT_prompt_0 1 (address: NA) class TLine l, size = 72; root [7] l.GetX1();; root [8] l.GetX1(); (Double_t) 1.000000e+01; Note some of the features of the ROOT prompt: - Terminating with ‘;‘ is not required, see “C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting” below. - Emacs style command line editing. - Raw interpreter commands start with a dot; .g l for instance shows the interpreter information on the global called l. - To show the result of an expression just do not type the trailing ;.; For the further examples we will “a",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

These are:. Calling rootcling to create a dictionary using rootcling.; Calling the compiler to build the shared library from the script.; If there are errors, it calls the compiler to build a dummy executable to clearly report unresolved symbols. ACLiC makes a shared library with a dictionary containing the classes and functions declared in the script. It also adds the classes and functions declared in included files with the same name as the script file and any of the following extensions: .h, .hh, .hpp, .hxx, .hPP, .hXX. This means that, by default, you cannot combine scripts from different files into one library by using #include statements; you will need to compile each script separately. In a future release, we plan to add the global variables declared in the script to the dictionary also. If you are curious about the specific calls, you can raise the ROOT debug level: gDebug=3 and ACLiC will print these steps. If you need to keep the intermediate files around, for example when debugging the script using gdb, use gDebug=7.; 7.4.5 Moving between Interpreter and Compiler; The best way to develop portable scripts is to make sure you can always run them with both, the interpreter and with ACLiC. To do so, do not use the Cling extensions and program around the Cling limitations. When it is not possible or desirable to program around the Cling limitations, you can use the C preprocessor symbols defined for Cling and rootcling.; The preprocessor symbol __CLING__ is defined for both ROOT and rootcling. The symbol __ROOTCLING__ (and __MAKECINT__ for backward compatibility) is only defined in rootcling.; Use !defined(__CLING__) || defined(__ROOTCLING__) to bracket code that needs to be seen by the compiler and rootcling, but wil",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

First, let’s see how it is done in the GUI.; 9.2.1.1 The Left Mouse Button; As was just seen moving or resizing an object is done with the left mouse button. The cursor changes its shape to indicate what may be done:; Point the object or one part of it: ; Rotate: ; Resize (exists also for the other directions): ; Enlarge (used for text): ; Move: ; Here are some examples of:; Moving: Resizing: ; Rotating: ; 9.2.1.2 With C++ Statements (Programmatically); How would one move an object in a script? Since there is a tight correspondence between what is seen on the screen and the object in memory, changing the object changes it on the screen. For example, try to do:; root[] a.SetX1(0.9); This should change one of the coordinates of our line, but nothing happens on the screen. Why is that? In short, the canvas is not updated with each change for performance reasons. See “Updating the Pad”.; 9.2.2 Selecting Objects; 9.2.2.1 The Middle Mouse Button; Objects in a canvas, as well as in a pad, are stacked on top of each other in the order they were drawn. Some objects may become “active” objects, which mean they are reordered to be on top of the others. To interactively make an object “active”, you can use the middle mouse button. In case of canvases or pads, the border becomes highlighted when it is active.; 9.2.2.2 With C++ Statements (Programmatically); Frequently we want to draw in different canvases or pads. By default, the objects are drawn in the active canvas. To activate a canvas you can use the TPad::cd() method.; root[] c1->cd(); 9.2.3 Context Menus: the Right Mouse Button; The context menus are a way to interactively call certain methods of an object.

Remember, when you build a class that you want to use in the ROOT environment, you use rootcling that builds the so-called stub functions and the dictionary. These functions and the dictionary contain the knowledge of the used classes. To do this, rootcling parses all the header files. ROOT has defined some special syntax to inform Cling of certain things, this is done in the comments so that the code still compiles with a C++ compiler.; For example, you have a class with a Draw() method, which will display itself. You would like a context menu to appear when on clicks on the image of an object of this class. The recipe is the following:. The class has to contain the ClassDef/ClassImp macros; For each method you want to appear in the context menu, put a comment after the declaration containing *MENU* or *TOGGLE* depending on the behavior you expect. One usually uses Set methods (setters). The *TOGGLE* comment is used to toggle a boolean data field.

The class has to contain the ClassDef/ClassImp macros; For each method you want to appear in the context menu, put a comment after the declaration containing *MENU* or *TOGGLE* depending on the behavior you expect. One usually uses Set methods (setters). The *TOGGLE* comment is used to toggle a boolean data field. In that case, it is safe to call the data field fMyBool where MyBool is the name of the setter SetMyBool. Replace MyBool with your own boolean variable.; You can specify arguments and the data members in which to store the arguments. For example:; class MyClass : public TObject {; private:; int fV1; // first variable; double fV2; // second variable; public:; int GetV1() {return fV1;}; double GetV2() {return fV2;}; void SetV1(int x1) { fV1 = x1;} // *MENU*; void SetV2(double d2) { fV2 = d2;} // *MENU*; void SetBoth(int x1, double d2) {fV1 = x1; fV2 = d2;}. ClassDef (MyClass,1); }; To specify arguments:; void SetXXX(Int_t x1, Float_t y2); //*MENU* *ARGS={x1=>fV1}; This statement is in the comment field, after the *MENU*. If there is more than one argument, these arguments are separated by commas, where fX1 and fY2 are data fields in the same class.; void SetXXX(Int_t x1, Float_t y2); //*MENU* *ARGS={x1=>fX1,y2=>fY2}; If the arguments statement is present, t",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

We indicate to the system which argument corresponds to which data member of the class.; 9.2.4 Executing Events when a Cursor Passes on Top of an Object; This paragraph is for class designers. When a class is designed, it is often desirable to include drawing methods for it. We will have a more extensive discussion about this, but drawing an object in a canvas or a pad consists in “attaching” the object to that pad. When one uses object.Draw(), the object is NOT painted at this moment. It is only attached to the active pad or canvas.; Another method should be provided for the object to be painted, the Paint() method. This is all explained in the next paragraph. As well as Draw() and Paint(), other methods may be provided by the designer of the class. When the mouse is moved or a button pressed/released, the TCanvas function named HandleInput() scans the list of objects in all it’s pads and for each object calls some standard methods to make the object react to the event (mouse movement, click or whatever).; The second one is DistancetoPrimitive(px,py). This function computes a “distance” to an object from the mouse position at the pixel position (px, py, see definition at the end of this paragraph) and returns this distance in pixel units. The selected object will be the one with the shortest computed distance. To see how this works, select the “Event Status” item in the canvas “Options” menu. ROOT will display one status line showing the picked object. If the picked object is, for example, a histogram, the status line indicates the name of the histogram, the position x,y in histogram coordinates, the channel number and the channel content.; It is nice for the canvas to know what the closest object from the mouse is, but it’s even nicer to be able to make this object react. The third standard method to be provided is ExecuteEvent(). This method actually does ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This statement calls method of TObject that just adds the pointer of the object, here a histogram, to the list of objects attached to the current pad. Since this is a TObject’s method, every object may be “drawn”, which means attached to a pad.; When is the painting done then ? The answer is: when needed. Every object that derives from TObject has a Paint() method. It may be empty, but for graphical objects, this routine contains all the instructions to paint effectively it in the active pad. Since a Pad has the list of objects it owns, it will call successively the Paint() method of each object, thus re-painting the whole pad on the screen. If the object is a sub-pad, its Paint() method will call the Paint() method of the objects attached, recursively calling Paint() for all the objects. Pad painting. In some cases a pad need to be painted during a macro execution. To force the pad painting gPad->Update() (see next section) should be performed.; The list of primitives stored in the pad is also used to pick objects and to interact with them.; 9.3.1 The Global Pad: gPad; When an object is drawn, it is always in the so-called active pad. For every day use, it is comfortable to be able to access the active pad, whatever it is. For that purpose, there is a global pointer, called gPad. It is always pointing to the active pad. If you want to change the fill color of the active pad to blue but you do not know its name, do this.; root[] gPad->SetFillColor(38); To get the list of colors, go to the paragraph “Color and color palettes” or if you have an opened canvas, click on the View menu, selecting the Colors item.; 9.3.1.1 Finding an Object in a Pad; Now that we have a pointer to the active pad, gPad and that we know this pad contains some objects, it is sometimes interesting to access one of those objects.

In that case, the “name” is the name of the class. To know the name of an object, just click with the right button on it. The name appears at the top of the context menu. In case of multiple unnamed objects, a call to GetPrimitive(""className"") returns the instance of the class that was first created. To retrieve a later instance you can use GetListOfPrimitives(), which returns a list of all the objects on the pad. From the list you can select the object you need.; 9.3.1.2 Hiding an Object; Hiding an object in a pad can be made by removing it from the list of objects owned by that pad. This list is accessible by the GetListOfPrimitives() method of TPad. This method returns a pointer to a TList. Suppose we get the pointer to the object, we want to hide, call it obj (see paragraph above). We get the pointer to the list:; root[] li = gPad->GetListOfPrimitives(); Then remove the object from this list:; root[] li->Remove(obj); The object will disappear from the pad as soon as the pad is updated (try to resize it for example). If one wants to make the object reappear:; root[] obj->Draw(); Caution, this will not work with composed objects, for example many histograms drawn on the same plot (with the option “same”). There are other ways! Try to use the method described here for simple objects.; 9.3.2 The Coordinate Systems of a Pad; There are coordinate systems in a TPad: user coordinates, normalized coordinates (NDC), and pixel coordinates. Pad coordinate systems. 9.3.2.1 The User Coordinate System; The most common is the user coordinate system. Most methods of TPad use the user coordinates, and all graphic primitives have their parameters defined in terms of user coordinates. By default, when an empty pad is drawn, the user coordinates are set to a range from 0 to 1 starting at the lower left corner. At this point they are equivalent of the NDC coordinates (see below).

Dividing a pad into 6 sub-pads. If pad1 is a pad then, it will divide the pad into 3 columns of 2 sub-pads. The generated sub-pads get names pad1_i where the index i=1 to nxm (in our case pad1_1, pad1_2…pad1_6). The names pad1_1etc… correspond to new variables in Cling, so you may use them as soon as the executed method was pad->Divide(). However, in a compiled program, one has to access these objects. Remember that a pad contains other objects and that these objects may themselves be pads. So we can use the GetPrimitive() method:; TPad* pad1_1 = (TPad*)(pad1->GetPrimitive(""pad1_1"")); One question remains. In case one does an automatic divide, how one can set the default margins between pads? This is done by adding two parameters to Divide(), which are the margins in x and y:; root[] pad1->Divide(3,2,0.1,0.1); The margins are here set to 10% of the parent pad width.; 9.3.5 Updating the Pad; For performance reasons, a pad is not updated with every change. For example, changing the coordinates of the pad does not automatically redraw it. Instead, the pad has a “bit-modified” that triggers a redraw. This bit is automatically set by:.

Also note that a call to pad->Update() where pad is a sub pad of canvas, calls canvas->Update() and recursively updates all the pads on the canvas.; 9.3.6 Making a Pad Transparent; As we will see in the paragraph “Fill Attributes”, a fill style (type of hatching) may be set for a pad.; root[] pad1->SetFillStyle(istyle); This is done with the SetFillStyle method where istyle is a style number, defined in “Fill Attributes”. A special set of styles allows handling of various levels of transparency. These are styles number 4000 to 4100, 4000 being fully transparent and 4100 fully opaque. So, suppose you have an existing canvas with several pads. You create a new pad (transparent) covering for example the entire canvas. Then you draw your primitives in this pad. The same can be achieved with the graphics editor.

The pad is painted automatically after the script is finished executing or if you force the painting with TPad::Modified() followed by a TCanvas::Update().

For example:; ndiv = 0: no tick marks.; ndiv = 2: 2 divisions, one tick mark in the middle of the axis.; ndiv = 510: 10 primary divisions, 5 secondary divisions; ndiv = -10: exactly 10 primary divisions; 9.5.4 Zooming the Axis; You can use TAxis::SetRange or TAxis::SetRangeUser to zoom the axis.; TAxis::SetRange(Int_t binfirst,Int_t binlast); The SetRange method parameters are bin numbers. They are not axis. For example if a histogram plots the values from 0 to 500 and has 100 bins, SetRange(0,10) will cover the values 0 to 50. The parameters for SetRangeUser are user coordinates. If the start or end is in the middle of a bin the resulting range is approximation. It finds the low edge bin for the start and the high edge bin for the high.; TAxis::SetRangeUser(Axis_t ufirst,Axis_t ulast); Both methods, SetRange and SetRangeUser, are in the context menu of any axis and can be used interactively. In addition, you can zoom an axis interactively: click on the axis on the start, drag the cursor to the end, and release the mouse button.; 9.5.5 Drawing Axis Independently of Graphs or Histograms; An axis may be drawn independently of a histogram or a graph. This may be useful to draw for example a supplementary axis for a graph. In this case, one has to use the TGaxis class, the graphical representation of an axis. One may use the standard constructor for this kind of objects:; TGaxis(Double_t xmin, Double_t ymin, Double_t xmax, Double_t ymax,; Double_t wmin, Double_t wmax, Int_t ndiv = 510,; Option_t* chopt,Double_t gridlength = 0); The arguments xmin, ymin are the coordinates of the axis’ start in the user coordinates system, and xmax, ymax are the end coordinates. The arguments wmin and wmax are the minimum (at the start) and maximum (at the end) values to be represented on the axis; ndiv is the number of divisions. The options, given by the “chopt” string are the following:. chopt = 'G': logarithmic scale, default is linear.; chopt = 'B': Blank ax",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

To do so, the class inherits from the TAttText class (a secondary inheritance), which defines text attributes. TLatex and TText inherit from TAttText.; 9.6.1.1 Setting Text Alignment; Text alignment may be set by a method call. What is said here applies to all objects deriving from TAttText, and there are many. We will take an example that may be transposed to other types. Suppose “la” is a TLatex object. The alignment is set with:; root[] la->SetTextAlign(align); The parameter align is a short describing the alignment:; align = 10*HorizontalAlign + VerticalAlign; For horizontal alignment, the following convention applies:. 1 = left; 2 = centered; 3 = right.

CMY and CMYK models are subtractive color models unlike RGB which is an additive. They are mainly used for printing purposes. CMY means Cyan Magenta Yellow to convert RGB to CMY it is enough to do: C=1-R, M=1-G and Y=1-B. CMYK has one more component K (black). The conversion from RGB to CMYK is:; Double_t Black = TMath::Min(TMath::Min(1-Red,1-Green),1-Blue);; Double_t Cyan = (1-Red-Black)",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

There are three manipulators for the three basic geometries transformations. In each case, the manipulator consists of three components, one for each local axis of the object, shown in standard colors: red (X), green (Y) and blue (Z). GL Viewer object manipulators. Activate the manipulator by moving the mouse over one of these components (which turns yellow to indicate active state). Click with left mouse and drag this active component to perform the manipulation. Toggle between the manipulator types using the ‘x’, ‘c’, ‘v’ keys while the mouse cursor is above the manipulator. Note: Manipulators cannot be controlled via the API at present.; 9.13.2.7 Guides; Guides are visual aids drawn into the viewer world. Controls for these are under the “Guides” tab:; Viewer Controls Pane Guides Tab; Axes show the world (global) frame coordinatedirections: X (red), Y (green) and Z (blue). The negative portion of the axis line is shown in dark color, the positive in bright. The axis name and minimum / maximum values are labeled in the same color. There are three options for axes drawing - selected by radio buttons:. None - not drawn (default).; Edge - draw axes on the (minimum) edge of the scene extents box.; Origin - drawn axes through the origin. For edge axes, the zero value for each axis is marked on the axis line with a colored sphere. For origin axes, a single white sphere is shown at the origin.; Edge axes are depth clipped - i.e. are obscured by 3D objects in front of them.

The <class> is the name of the ROOT class (T-something). The <variable> is the name of the object. The cycle number along with the variable name uniquely identifies the object.

It is now your responsibility to delete this histogram object once you are finished with it. To change the default that automatically adds the histogram to the current directory, you can call the static function:; TH1::AddDirectory(kFALSE);; In this case, you will need to do all the bookkeeping for all the created histograms.; 11.2.6 Saving Objects to Disk; In addition to histograms and trees, you can save any object in a ROOT file. For example to save a canvas to the ROOT file you can use either TObject::Write() or TDirectory::WriteTObject(). The example:; root[] c1->Write(); This is equivalent to:; root[] f->WriteTObject(c1); For objects that do not inherit from TObject use:; root[] f->WriteObject(ptr,""nameofobject""); Another example:; root[] TFile *f = new TFile(""hsimple.root"",""UPDATE""); root[] hpx->Draw(); <TCanvas::MakeDefCanvas>: created default TCanvas with name c1; root[] c1->Write(); root[] f->ls(); TFile** hsimple.root; TFile* hsimple.root; OBJ: TH1F hpx This is the px distribution : 0; KEY: TH1F hpx;2 This is the px distribution; KEY: TH1F hpx;1 This is the px distribution; KEY: TH2F hpxpy;1 py vs px; KEY: TProfile hprof;2 Profile of pz versus px; KEY: TProfile hprof;1 Profile of pz versus px; KEY: TNtuple ntuple;1 Demo ntuple; KEY: TCanvas c1;1 c1; 11.2.7 Saving Collections to Disk; All collection classes inherit from TCollection and hence inherit the TCollection::Write() method. When you call TCollection::Write() each object in the container is written individually into its own key in the file. To write all objects into one key you can specify the name of the key and use the optionTObject::kSingleKey. For example:; root[] TList * list = new TList;; root[] TNamed * n1, * n2;; root[] n1 = new TNamed(""name1"",""title1"");; root[] n2 = new TNamed(""name2"",""title2"");; root[] list->Add(n1);; root[] list->Add(n2);; root[] gFile-",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

It does not write the buffer to a file, it simply populates a buffer with bytes representing the object. This allows us to write the buffer to a file or do anything else we could do with the buffer. For example, we can write it to a socket to send it over the network. This is beyond the scope of this chapter, but it is worthwhile to emphasize the need and advantage of separating the creation of the buffer from its use. Let us look how a buffer is written to a file. The dictionary for a class needs to be loaded before any object of that type can be saved.; The TObject::Write method does the following:. Creates a TKey object in the current directory; Creates a TBuffer object which is part of the newly created TKey; Fills the TBuffer with a call to the class::Streamer method; Creates a second buffer for compression, if needed; Reserves space by scanning the TFree list. At this point, the size of the buffer is known.; Writes the buffer to the file; Releases the TBuffer part of the key. In other words, the TObject::Write calls the Streamer method of the class to build the buffer. The buffer is in the key and the key is written to disk. Once written to disk the memory consumed by the buffer part is released. The key part of the TKey is kept. A diagram of a streamed TH1F in the buffer. The key consumes about 60 bytes, whereas the buffer, since it contains the object data, can be very large.; 11.3.9 Ignore Object Streamers; Your class can ignore the TObject Streamerwith the MyClass->Class::IgnoreObjectStreamer() method. When the class kIgnoreTObjectStreamerbit is set (by calling the IgnoreTObjectStreamermethod), the automatically generated Streamerwill not call TObject::Streamer, and the TObject part of the class is not streamed to the file. This is useful in case you do not use the TObject fBits and fUniqueIDdata members.

In this way, the network of pointers and their objects is rebuilt and ready to use the same way it was used before it was persistent. If the pointer hold the address of an object which in embedded in another object (as opposed to being pointed to by a pointer), the object will be duplicate at read time. To avoid this, make the pointer a transient data member.; 11.4.2 Motivation for the TRef Class; If the object is split into several files or into several branches of one or more TTrees, standard C++ pointers cannot be used because each I/O operation will write the referenced objects, and multiple copies will exist. In addition, if the pointer is read before the referenced object, it is null and may cause a run time system error. To address these limitations, ROOT offers the TRef class.; TRef allows referencing an object in a different branch and/or in a different file. TRef also supports the complex situation where a TFile is updated multiple times on the same machine or a different machine. When a TRef is read before its referenced object, it is null. As soon as the referenced object is read, the TRef points to it. In addition, one can specify an action to be taken by TRef in the case it is read before its reference object (see“Action on Demand” below).; 11.4.3 Using TRef; A TRef is a lightweight object pointing to any TObject. This object can be used instead of normal C++ pointers in case:. The referenced object R and the pointer P are not written to the same file; P is read before R; R and P are written to different Tree branches. Below is a line from the example in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.cxx.; TRef fLastTrack; //pointer to last track; ...; Track *track = (Track*)fTracks->ConstructedAt(fNtrack++);; track->Set(random);; // Save reference to last Track in the collection of Tracks; fLastTrack = track;; The track and its reference fLastTrack can be written with two separate I/O calls in the same or in different fil",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

When a schema changes, existing persistent data can become inaccessible unless the system provides a mechanism to access data created with previous versions of the schema. In the lifetime of collaboration, the class definitions (i.e. the schema) are likely to change frequently. Not only can the class itself change, but any of its parent classes or data member classes can change also. This makes the support for schema evolution necessary.; ROOT fully supports schema evolution. The next figure below illustrates some of the scenarios. The ROOT schema evolution. The top half represents different versions of the shared library with the class definitions. These are the in-memory class versions. The bottom half represents data files that contain different versions of the classes. An old version of a shared library and a file with new class definitions - this can be the case when someone has not updated the library and is reading a new file.; Reading a file with a shared library that is missing a class definition (i.e. missing class D).; Reading a file without any class definitions. This can be the case where the class definition is lost, or unavailable.; The current version of a shared library and an old file with old class versions (backward compatibility). This is often the case when reading old data.; Reading a file with a shared library built with MakeProject. This is the case when someone has already read the data without a shared library and has used ROOT MakeProject feature to reconstruct the class definitions and shared library (MakeProject is explained in detail later on). In case of a mismatch between the in-memory version and the persistent version of a class, ROOT maps the persistent one to the one in memory. This allows you to change the class definition at will, for example:.

If the split-level is 2, the data member objects will be split also, and a split level of 3 its data members objects, will be split. As the split-level increases so does the splitting depth. The ROOT default for the split-level is 99. This means the object will be split to the maximum.; 12.10.1.1 Memory Considerations when Splitting a Branch; Splitting a branch can quickly generate many branches. Each branch has its own buffer in memory. In case of many branches (say more than 100), you should adjust the buffer size accordingly. A recommended buffer size is 32000 bytes if you have less than 50 branches. Around 16000 bytes if you have less than 100 branches and 4000 bytes if you have more than 500 branches. These numbers are recommended for computers with memory size ranging from 32MB to 256MB. If you have more memory, you should specify larger buffer sizes. However, in this case, do not forget that your file might be used on another machine with a smaller memory configuration.; 12.10.1.2 Performance Considerations when Splitting a Branch; A split branch is faster to read, but slightly slower to write. The reading is quicker because variables of the same type are stored consecutively and the type does not have to be read each time. It is slower to write because of the large number of buffers as described above. See ""; Performance Benchmarks"" for performance impact of split and non-split mode.; 12.10.1.3 Rules for Splitting; When splitting a branch, variables of different types are handled differently. Here are the rules that apply when splitting a branch. If a data member is a basic type, it becomes one branch of class TBranchElement.; A data member can be an array of basic types.

For example, if one variable in the tree was computed with a certain algorithm, you may want to try another algorithm and compare the results. One solution is to add a new branch, fill it, and save the tree. The code below adds a simple branch to an existing tree. Note that the kOverwrite option in the Write method overwrites the existing tree. If it is not specified, two copies of the tree headers are saved.; void tree3AddBranch() {; TFile f(""tree3.root"",""update"");; Float_t new_v;; TTree *t3 = (TTree*)f->Get(""t3"");; TBranch *newBranch = t3-> Branch(""new_v"",&new_v,""new_v/F"");; //read the number of entries in the t3; Int_t nentries = (Int_t)t3->GetEntries();; for (Int_t i = 0; i < nentries; i++){; new_v= gRandom->Gaus(0,1);; newBranch->Fill();; }; t3->Write("""",TObject::kOverwrite); // save only the new version of; // the tree; }; Adding a branch is often not possible because the tree is in a read-only file and you do not have permission to save the modified tree with the new branch. Even if you do have the permission, you risk loosing the original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification. Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains). We encourage you to use TTree::AddFriend rather than adding a branch manually.; 12.16.2 TTree::AddFriend; A tree keeps a list of friends. In the context of a tree (or a chain), friends",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Beginning with ROOT 3.0, an object can be placed on a branch even though it does not inherit from TObject. In previous releases branches were restricted to objects inheriting from the TObject. However, it has always been possible to write a class not inheriting from TObject to a tree by encapsulating it in a TObject descending class as is the case in EventHeader and Event.; class EventHeader {; private:; Int_t fEvtNum;; Int_t fRun;; Int_t fDate;; // ... list of methods; ClassDef(EventHeader,1) //Event Header; };; 12.17.3 The Track Class; The Track class descends from TObject since tracks are in a TClonesArray (i.e. a ROOT collection class) and contains a selection of basic types and an array of vertices.

A TBranch object is created for each variable in the expression. The total number of rows read from the file is returned.; 12.19 Trees in Analysis; The methods TTree::Draw, TTree::MakeClass and TTree::MakeSelector are available for data analysis using trees. The TTree::Draw method is a powerful yet simple way to look and draw the trees contents. It enables you to plot a variable (a leaf) with just one line of code. However, the Draw method falls short once you want to look at each entry and design more sophisticated acceptance criteria for your analysis. For these cases, you can use TTree::MakeClass. It creates a class that loops over the trees entries one by one. You can then expand it to do the logic of your analysis.; The TTree::MakeSelector is the recommended method for ROOT data analysis. It is especially important for large data set in a parallel processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several processors and you can specify which entries to send to each processor. With MakeClass the user has control over the event loop, with MakeSelectorthe tree is in control of the event loop.; 12.20 Simple Analysis Using TTree::Draw; We will use the tree in cernstaff.root that was made by the macro in $ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/staff.C.; First, open the file and lists its contents.; root[] TFile f (""cernstaff.root""); root[] f.ls(); TFile** cernstaff.root; TFile* cernstaff.root; KEY: TTree T;1 staff data from ascii file; We can see the TTree“T” in the file.

We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small compared to the total processing time. In this case, if the I/O operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage of the total time and it may very well save a factor of 10 on disk space. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression may slow down the program’s performance.

The program was invoked with:; Event 400 comp split. comp = 0 means: no compression at all.; comp = 1 means: compress everything if split = 0.; comp = 1 means: compress only the tree branches with integers if split = 1.; comp = 2 means: compress everything if split=1.; split = 0 : the full event is serialized into one single buffer.; split = 1 : the event is split into branches.

The high 8 bits are reserved for the system usage; the low 24 bits are user settable. fUniqueID is a data member used to give a unique identification number to an object. It is initialized to zero by the TObject constructor. ROOT does not use this data member. The two data members (fBits and fUniqueID) are streamed out when writing an object to disk. If you do not use them, you can save some space and time by specifying:; MyClass::Class()->IgnoreTObjectStreamer();; This sets a bit in the TClass object. If the file is compressed, the savings are minimal since most values are zero; however, it saves some space when the file is not compressed. A call toIgnoreTObjectStreamer also prevents the creation of two additional branches when splitting the object. If left alone, two branches called fBits and fUniqueID will appear.; 15.2 Motivation; If you want to integrate and use your classes with ROOT, to enjoy features like, extensive RTTI (Run Time Type Information) and ROOT object I/O and inspection, you have to add the following line to your class header files:; ClassDef(ClassName,ClassVersionID); //The class title; For example in TLine.h we have:; ClassDef(TLine,1); //A line segment; The ClassVersionID is used by the ROOT I/O system. It is written on the output stream and during reading you can check this version ID and take appropriate action depending on the value of the ID. See “Streamers”. Every time you change the data members of a class, you should increase its ClassVersionID by one. The ClassVersionID should be >=1. Set ClassVersionID=0 in case you don’t need object I/O. To be able to generate properly documentation for your classes using THtml you must add the statement:; ClassImp(ClassName); For example in TLine.cxx:; ClassImp(TLine); Note that you should provide a default constructor for your classes, i.e. a constructor with zero parameters or with one or more parameters all with default values in case you want to use object I/O.

For example with:; #pragma link C++ ioctortype UserClass1;; #pragma link C++ ioctortype UserClass2;; We look for the first existing public constructor in the following order:; MyClass(UserClass1*);; MyClass(UserClass2*);; MyClass(TRootIOCtor*);; MyClass(); // Or a constructor with all its arguments defaulted.; 15.4 rootcling: The Cling Dictionary Generator; A way in which dictionaries can be generated is via the rootcling utility. This tool generates takes as input a set of headers and generates in output the dictionary C++ code and a pcm file. This latter file is fundamental for the correct functioning of the dictionary at runtime. It should be located in the directory where the shared library is installed in which the compiled dictionary resides.; NOTA BENE: the dictionaries that will be used within the same project must have unique names. In other words, compiled object files relative to dictionary source files cannot reside in the same library or in two libraries loaded by the same application if the original source files have the same name. This loose limitation is imposed by the registration mechanism ROOT has in place to keep track of dynamically loaded libraries.; In the following example, we walk through the steps necessary to generate a dictionary, I/O, and inspect member functions. Let’s start with a TEvent class, which contains a collection of TTracks.; The TEvent.h header is:; #ifndef __TEvent__; #define __TEvent__; #include ""TObject.h""; #include ""TCollection.h"". class TTrack;. class TEvent : public TObject {; private:; Int_t fId; // event sequential id; Float_t fTotalMom; // total momentum; TCollection *fTracks; // collection of tracks; public:; TEvent() { ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

To generate a dictionary for a class from the STL, e.g.; std::vector<MyClass>, you would normally pass the header defining MyClass and std::vector. The latter is a compiler specific header and cannot be passed to rootcling directly. Instead, create a little header file that includes both headers, and pass that to rootcling.; Often ROOT knows where MyClass and the templated class (e.g. vector) are defined, for example because the files got #included. Knowing these header files ROOT can automatically generate the dictionary for any template combination (e.g. vector<myClass>) when it is needed, by generating files starting with AutoDict*. You can toggle this feature on or off at the ROOT prompt by executing .autodict.; 15.5 Adding a Class with a Shared Library; Step 1: Define your own class in SClass.h and implement it in SClass.cxx. You must provide a default constructor or an I/O constructor for your class. See the “The Default Constructor” paragraph in this chapter.; #include <iostream.h>; #include ""TObject.h""; class SClass : public TObject {; private:; Float_t fX; //x position in centimeters; Float_t fY; //y position in centimeters; Int_t fTempValue; //! temporary state value; public:; SClass() { fX = fY = -1; }; void Print() const;; void SetX(float x) { fX = x; }; void SetY(float y) { fY = y; }. ClassDef(SClass, 1); };; Step 2: Add a call to the ClassDef macro to at the end of the class definition (in the SClass.h file). ClassDef(SClass,1). Add a call to the ClassImp macro in the implementation file (SClass.cxx): ClassImp(SClass).; // SClass.cxx:; #include ""SClass.h""; ClassImp(SClass);; void SClass::Print() const {; cout << ""fX = "" << fX << "", fY = ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

If default is set to ‘off’, nothing will be included in the generated dictionary. The next statement explicitly set linkage to each item:; #pragma link [C|C++|off] [class|function|global]; This pragma statement must be given before rootcling reads any C/C++ definitions from header files.

The tool to create Reflex dictionaries was a Python script called genreflex and was very successful in the user community. Even if version 6 has only one type of dictionaries, cling dictionaries, a re-implementation of genreflex is provided. More precisely, in ROOT6, genreflex is nothing but a wrapper around rootcling, which offers an identical CLI and behaviour to the old Python tool. The input to genreflex is a C++ header file, a set of switches and a selection XML file. The output, as for rootcling, is a C++ dictionary source and a pcm files. An exhaustive documentation of the CLI switches of genreflex can be inspected with the genreflex --help command.; The entity corresponding to the LinkDef file for genreflex is the se",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

These must geometrically contain their belongings (positioned volumes) so that these do not extrude its shape boundaries. Not respecting this rule generally leads to unpredictable results. Therefore A and B together must fit into C that has to fit also into D,E, and F. This is not always straightforward to accomplish, especially when instead of A and B we have many more volumes.; In order to avoid these problems, one can use for the difficult cases the class TGeoVolumeAssembly, representing an assembly of volumes. This behaves like a normal container volume supporting other volumes positioned inside, but it has neither shape nor medium. It cannot be used directly as a piece of the geometry, but just as a temporary structure helping temporary assembling and positioning volumes.; If we define now C as an assembly containing A and B, positioning the assembly into D,E and F will actually position only A and Bdirectly into these volumes, taking into account their combined transformations A/B to C and C to D/E/F. This looks much nicer, is it? In fact, it is and it is not. Of course, we managed to get rid of the ‘unnecessary’ volume C in our geometry, but we end-up with a more flat structure for D,E and F (more daughters inside). This can get much worse when extensively used, as in the case: assemblies of assemblies.; For deciding what to choose between using virtual containers or assemblies for a specific case, one can use for both cases, after the geometry was closed:; gGeoManager->SetTopVolume(ptr_D);; gGeoManager->Test();; gGeoManager->RestoreMasterVolume();; The ptr_D is a pointer to volume D containing the interesting structure. The test will provide the timing for classifying 1 million random points inside D.; 18.4.2.5 Examples of Volume Positioning; Now let us make a simple volume representing a copper wire.

On the other hand, all objects belonging to the geometrical hierarchy will always be written. The idea is to be able to retrieve the geometry in a ready state, ignoring what the state variables that can be always re-initialized. When the code is generated for a given TGeoVolume in the geometry, just the branch starting with that volume will be saved in the file. Executing the generated code will create a geometry that has MyVolume as top volume.

A state is always associated to a transformation matrix M of the touchable with respect to the global reference frame (obtained by piling-up all local transformations of nodes in the branch with respect to their containers). The current state and the corresponding global matrix are updated whenever the geometry depth is modified. The global transformations corresponding to all nodes in the current branch are kept in an array: (MTOP_1, MA_1, MB_3, …). Navigation in the geometry hierarchy. The elementary operations for changing the state are:; TGeoManager::CdUp();; TGeoManager::CdDown(i);; TGeoManager::CdTop(); The current state accounting and global matrix handling after these operations are depicted in the figure below. Now let us suppose that we have a particle at position P(x,y,z). The first thing needed for transporting it is the current object our particle is into, so that we can retrieve its material properties. This task is done by:; TGeoNode *TGeoManager::FindNode(x,y,z); Note that the current particle position can be set using SetCurrentPosition(x,y,z) method of the manager class, in which case FindNode() can be called without arguments.

This task is done by:; TGeoNode *TGeoManager::FindNode(x,y,z); Note that the current particle position can be set using SetCurrentPosition(x,y,z) method of the manager class, in which case FindNode() can be called without arguments. The method returns a pointer to the deepest node that geometrically contains P (in our case let us suppose it is B_3). Since a node is just a positioned volume, we can then get a pointer to the volume, medium or material objects related to it. Deepest means that B_3 still contains point P (as well as A_1 and TOP_1), but none of the daughters of volume B does. After finding out the node containing the particle, one can check if the geometry state is different compared to the last located point:; Bool_t *TGeoManager::IsSameLocation(); The algorithm for finding where a point is located in geometry is presented in the figure 17-36.; It always starts by checking if the last computed modeller state is the answer. This optimizes the search when continuously tracking a particle. The main actions performed are:. moving up and down in the logical node tree while updating the current node and its global matrix; converting the global position into the local frame of the current node/volume; checking whether the local position lies within the geometrical shape of the current volume - if this is the case continue the search downwards for the daughters of the current node, otherwise search upwards its containers until the top level is reached.; the number of candidate nodes to be checked at a given level is minimized by an additional optimization structure: voxels. This is effective even in case there is only one daughter of the current volume.; in case the current node is declared as possibly overlapping, the method FindInCluster() is invoked. This method checks all different possibilities within the cluster of overlapping candidates. One of the candidates is prioritized if one of the following conditions id fulfilled (in order):; Is",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The returned value is again compared to the maximum allowed step (the proposed one) and in case the distance is safe no other action is performed and the proposed step is approved. In case the boundary is closer, the computed distance is taken as maximum allowed step. For optimization purposed, for particles starting very close to the current volume boundary (less than 0.01 microns) and exiting the algorithm stops here.; After computing the distance to exit the current node, the distance to the daughter of the current volume which is crossed next is computed by TGeoManager::FindNextDaughterBoundary(). This computes the distance to all daughter candidates that can be possibly crossed by using volume voxelization. The algorithm is efficient in average only in case the number of daughters is greater than 4. For fewer nodes, a simple loop is performed and the minimum distance (from a point outside each shape) is taken and compared to the maximum allowed step. The step value is again updated if step<stepmax .; A special case is when the current node is declared as possibly overlapping with something else. If this is the case, the distance is computed for all possibly overlapping candidates, taking into account the overlapping priorities (see also: "" Overlapping volumes "").; The global matrix describing the next crossed physical node is systematically computed in case the value of the proposed step is negative. In this case, one can subsequently call TGeoManager::ComputeNormalFast() to get the normal vector to the crossed surface, after propagating the current point with the TGeoManager::GetStep() value. This propagation can be done like:; Double_t *current_point = gGeoManager->GetCurrentPoint();; Double_t *current_dir = gGeoManager->GetCurrentDirection();; for (Int_t i=0; i<3; i++); current_point[i] += step * current_dir[I];; Note: The method TGeoManager::FindNextBoundary() does not modify the current point/direction nor the current volume/state.

PyROOT provides this for users who want to do analysis in Python with ROOT classes. The following example shows how to fill and display a ROOT histogram while working in Python. Of course, any actual analysis code may come from somewhere else through other bindings, e.g. from a C++ program.; When run, the next example will display a 1-dimensional histogram showing a Gaussian distribution.

An example usage:; >>> from ROOT import std; >>> v = std.vector(int)(); >>> for i in range(0,10):; ... v.push_back(i); ...; >>> for i in v:; ... print(i, end=' '); 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; >>>; >>> list(v); [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; >>>; The parameters to the template instantiation can either be an actual type or value (as is used here, “int”), or a string representation of the parameters (e.g. “‘double’”), or a mixture of both (e.g. “‘TCanvas, 0’” or “‘double’, 0” ). The “std::vector<int>” class is one of the classes builtin by default into the Cling extension dlls. You will get a non-functional class (instances of which can still be passed around to C++) if the corresponding dictionary doesn’t exist.; 19.1.5.3 Access to ROOT Globals; Most globals and global functions can be imported directly from the ROOT.py module, but some common ones (most notably gMinuit, although that variable now exists at startup from release 5.08 onward) do not exist yet at program startup, as they exist in modules that are loaded later (e.g. through the auto-loading mechanism). An example session should make this clear:; >>> from ROOT import *; >>> gROOT # directly available; <ROOT.TROOT object at 0x399c30>; >>> gMinuit # library not yet loaded: not available; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in ?; NameError: name 'gMinuit' is not defined; >>> TMinuit # use of TMinuit class forces auto-loading; <class '__main__.TMinuit'>; >>> gMinuit # now gMinuit is available; <__main__.TMinuit object at 0x1458c70>; >>> not not gMinuit # but it is the null pointer, until set; False; >>> g = TMinuit(); >>> not not gMinuit; True; It is also possible to create globals interactively, either by executing a Cling macro, or by a call to gROOT.ProcessLine().

Otherwise, a gROOT->GetClass() call is required first.; 19.1.5.5 Callbacks; The simplest way of setting a callback to Python from Cling, e.g. for a button, is by providing the execution string. See for example tutorials/pyroot/demo.py that comes with the ROOT installation:; # [..]; bar = ROOT.TControlBar('vertical','Demos'); bar.AddButton('Help on Demos',r'TPython::Exec(""execfile('demoshelp.py')"");','Click Here For Help on Running the Demos'); bar.AddButton('browser',r'TPython::Exec(""b = Tbrowser()"");','Start the ROOT browser'); # [..]; Here, the callback is a string that will be interpreted by Cling to call TPython::Exec(), which will, in turn, interpret and execute the string given to it. Note the use of raw strings (the ‘r’ in front of the second argument string), in order to remove the need of escaping the backslashes.; 19.1.5.6 Cling Commands; In interactive mode, the Python exception hook is used to mimic some of the Cling commands available. These are: .q, .!, .x, .L, .cd, .ls, .pwd, .? and .help. Note that .x translates to Python ‘execfile()’ and thus accepts only Python files, not Cling macros.; 19.1.6 Memory Handling; The Python interpreter handles memory for the user by employing reference counting and a garbage collector (fo",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

When the object goes out of scope on the C++ side, the Python object will change type into an object that largely behaves like None.

See $ROOTSYS/tutorials/pyroot/zdemo.py (available in the latest release) for an example. Alternatively, one can tell python to give up ownership for individual instances:; o = ROOT.TObject(); ROOT.SetOwnership( o, False ) # True to own, False to release; 19.1.6.2 Memory Management by Hand; If needed, you can explicitly destroy a ROOT object that you own through its associated TClass:; myobject.IsA().Destructor(myobject); which will send out the deletion notification to the system (thus you do not need to care anymore at this point about Python reference counting, the object will go, even if it’s reference count it non-zero), and free the memory.; 19.1.7 Performance; The performance of PyROOT when programming with ROOT in Python is similar to that of Cling.

After the fit, you can retrieve the fit parameters from the TF1 instance.

The TTree implementation uses pointers and dedicated buffers to reduce the memory usage and to speed up access. Consequently, mapping TTree functionality to Python is not straightforward, and most of the following features are implemented in ROOT release 4.01/04 and later only, whereas you will need 5.02 if you require all of them.; 19.1.9.1 Accessing an Existing Tree; Let us assume that you have a file containing TTrees, TChains, or TNtuples and want to read the contents for use in your analysis code. This is commonly the case when you work with the result of the reconstruction software of your experiment (e.g. the combined ntuple in ATLAS). The following example code outlines the main steps (you can run it on the result of the tree1.C macro):; from ROOT import TFile. # open the file; myfile = TFile('tree1.root'). # retrieve the ntuple of interest; mychain = myfile.Get('t1'); entries = mychain.GetEntriesFast(). for jentry in xrange(entries):; # get the next tree in the chain and verify; ientry = mychain.LoadTree(jentry); if ientry < 0:; break. # copy next entry into memory and verify; nb = mychain.GetEntry(jentry); if nb<=0:; continue. # use the values directly fro",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

For that purpose, there is the AddressOf() function. As an example:; from ROOT import TFile, TTree; from ROOT import gROOT, AddressOf. gROOT.ProcessLine(; ""struct MyStruct { Int_t fMyInt1; Int_t fMyInt2; Int_t fMyInt3; Char_t fMyCode[4]; };"" );. from ROOT import MyStruct; mystruct = MyStruct(); f = TFile('mytree.root','RECREATE'); tree = TTree('T','Just A Tree'); tree.Branch('myints',mystruct,'MyInt1/I:MyInt2:MyInt3'); tree.Branch('mycode',AddressOf(mystruct,'fMyCode'),'MyCode/C'); for i in range(0,10):; mystruct.fMyInt1 = i; mystruct.fMyInt2 = i*i; mystruct.fMyInt3 = i*i*i; mystruct.fMyCode = ""%03d"" % i # note string assignment. tree.Fill(). f.Write(); f.Close(); The C++ class is defined through the gROOT.ProcessLine() call, and note how the AddressOf() function is used for data members of built-in type. Most of the above is for ROOT version 5.02 and later only. For older releases, and without further support, here is an example as to how you can get hold of a pointer-to-pointer to a ROOT object:; h = TH1F(); addressofobject = array('i',[h.IsA().DynamicCast(h.IsA(),h)]); 19.1.10 Using Your Own Classes; A user’s own classes can be accessed after loading, either directly or indirectly, the library that contains the dictionary.

The program stress takes one argument, the number of events to process. The default is 1000 events. Be aware that executing stress with 1000 eventswill create several files consuming about 100 MB of disk space; running stress with 30 events will consume about 20 MB. The disk space is released once stress is done.; There are two ways to run stress:; From the system prompt or from the ROOT prompt using the interpreter.; > cd $ROOTSYS/test; > stress // default 1000 events; > stress 30 // test with 30 events; Start ROOT with the batch mode option (-b) to suppress the graphic output.; > root -b; root[] .L stress.cxx; root[] stress(1000)// test with 1000 events; root[] stress(30)// test with 30 events; The output of stress includes a pass/fail conclusion for each test, the total number of bytes read and written, and the elapsed real and CPU time.

All threads share the same address space. This means that two pointers having the same value in two threads refer to the same data. Also, if any thread changes one of the shared system resources, all threads within the process are affected. For example, if a thread closes a file, the file is closed for all threads.; 23.1.3 The Initial Thread; When a process is created, one thread is automatically created. This thread is called the initial thread or the main thread. The initial thread executes the main routine in multi-threaded programs.; Note: At the end of this chapter is a glossary of thread specific terms; 23.2 Implementation of Threads in ROOT; The TThread class has been developed to provide a platform independent interface to threads for ROOT.; 23.2.1 Installation; For the time being, it is still necessary to compile a threaded version of ROOT to enable some very special treatments of the canvas operations. We hope that this will become the default later.; To compile ROOT, just do (for example on a debian Linux):; ./configure linuxdeb2 --with-thread=/usr/lib/libpthread.so; gmake depend; gmake; This configures and builds ROOT using /usr/lib/libpthread.so as the Pthread library, and defines R__THREAD.; This enables the thread specific treatment of gPad, and creates $ROOTSYS/lib/libThread.so.; Note: The parameter linuxdeb2 has to be replaced with the appropriate ROOT keyword for your platform.; 23.2.2 Classes; TThread class implements threads . The platform dependent implementation is in the TThreadImp class and its descendant classes (e.g. TPosixThread ).; TMutex class implements mutex locks. A mutex is a mutually exclusive lock. The platform dependent implementation is in the TMutexImp class and its descendant classes (e.g. TPosixMutex); TCondition class implements a condition variable.

Create a thread instance (see also example RunMhs3.CorRunPi.C) with:; root[] TThread *th = new TThread(UserFun,UserArgs);; When called from the interpreter, this gives the name “UserFun” to the thread. This name can be used to retrieve the thread later. However, when called from compiled code, this method does not give any name to the thread. So give a name to the thread in compiled use:; root[] TThread *th = new TThread(""MyThread"", UserFun, UserArgs);; You can pass arguments to the thread function using the UserArgs-pointer. When you want to start a method of a class as a thread, you have to give the pointer to the class instance as UserArgs. Running. root[] th->Run();; root[] TThread::Ps(); // like UNIX ps c.ommand;; With the mhs3 example, you should be able to see a canvas with two pads on it. Both pads keep histograms updated and filled by three different threads.

Some actions can be dangerous. For example, when two threads create a histogram object, ROOT allocates memory and puts them to the same collection. If it happens at the same time, the results are undetermined. To avoid this problem, the user has to synchronize these actions with:; TThread::Lock() // Locking the following part of code; ... // Create an object, etc...; TThread::UnLock() // Unlocking; The code between Lock() and UnLock() will be performed uninterrupted. No other threads can perform actions or access objects/collections while it is being executed.

Ulong_t now,then,delta; // seconds; TDatime myTime; // root daytime class; myTime.Set(); // myTime set to ""now""; now=myTime.Convert(); // to seconds since 1970. Return value wait of MyCondition.TimedWait should be 0, if MyCondition.Signal() was received, and should be nonzero, if timeout was reached. The conditions example shows how three threaded functions are synchronized using TCondition: a ROOT script condstart.C starts the threads, which are defined in a shared library (conditions.cxx, conditions.h).; 23.2.4.3 Xlib Connections; Usually Xlib is not thread safe. This means that calls to the X could fail, when it receives X-messages from different threads. The actual result depends strongly on which version of Xlib has been installed on your system. The only thing we can do here within ROOT is calling a special function XInitThreads()(which is part of the Xlib), which should (!) prepare the Xlib for the usage with threads.; To avoid further problems within ROOT some redefinition of the gPad pointer was done (that’s the main reason for the recompilation). When a thread creates a TCanvas, this object is actually created in the main thread; this should be transparent to the user. Actions on the canvas are controlled via a function, which returns a pointer to either thread specific data (TSD) or the main thread pointer. This mechanism works currently only for gPad, gDirectory, gFile and will be implemented soon for other global Objects as e.g. gVirtualX.; 23.2.4.4 Canceling a TThread; Canceling of a thread is a rather dangerous action. In TThread canceling is forbidden by default. The user can change this default by calling TThread::SetCancelOn().

The other signals have no other behavior then that to call any registered TSignalHandler::Notify().; When building in interactive application the use of the TRint object handles the kSigInterrupt signal. It causes the printing of the message: *** Break *** keyboard interruptand makes a long jump back to the ROOT command prompt. If no TRint object is created, there will be no kSigInterrupt handling. All signals can be reset to their default UNIX behavior via the call of TSytem::ResetSignal(). All signals can be ignored via TSytem::IgnoreSignal(). The TSytem::IgnoreInterrupt() is a method to toggle the handling of the interrupt signal. Typically it is called to prevent a SIGINT to interrupt some important call (like writing to a ROOT file).; If TRint is used and the default ROOT interrupt handler is not desired, you should use GetSignalHandler() of TApplication to get the interrupt handler and to remove it by RemoveSignalHandler()of TSystem .; 23.5 Glossary; The following glossary is adapted from the description of the Rogue Wave Threads.h++ package.; A process is a program that is loaded into memory and prepared for execution. Each process has a private address space. Processes begin with a single thread.; A thread is a sequence of instructions being executed in a program. A thread has a program counter and a private stack to keep track of local variables and return addresses. A multithreaded process is associated with one or more threads. Threads execute independently.

To ensure correct code, only one thread at a time may execute in a critical section. In other words, the section is not reentrant.; A mutex, or mutual exclusion lock, is a synchronization object with two states locked and unlocked. A mutex is usually used to ensure that only one thread at a time executes some critical section of code. Before entering a critical section, a thread will attempt to lock the mutex, which guards that section. If the mutex is already locked, the thread will block until the mutex is unlocked, at which time it will lock the mutex, execute the critical section, and unlock the mutex upon leaving the critical section.; A semaphore is a synchronization mechanism that starts out initialized to some positive value. A thread may ask to wait on a semaphore in which case the thread blocks until the value of the semaphore is positive. At that time the semaphore count is decremented and the thread continues. When a thread releases semaphore, the semaphore count is incremented. Counting semaphores are useful for coordinating access to a limited pool of some resource.; Readers/Writer Lock - a multiple-reader, single-writer lock is one that allows simultaneous read access by many threads while restricting write access to only one thread at a time. When any thread holds the lock for reading, other threads can also acquire the lock reading. If one thread holds the lock for writing, or is waiting to acquire the lock for writing, other threads must wait to acquire the lock for either reading or writing.; Use a condition variable in conjunction with a mutex lock to automatically block threads until a particular condition is true.; Multithread Safe Levels - a possible classification scheme to describe thread-safety of libraries:.

There is no need to call AddFrame() since the buttons are added automatically with a default layout hint to their parent by TGButtonGroup::Show() as shown in the previous example. The buttons in the group have assigned identifiers. Any button in a group emits a Clicked() signal with this identifier when it is clicked. This giving an ideal solution to connect several Clicked() signals to one slot.; An exclusive button group switches off all toggle buttons except the selected one. The group is by default non-exclusive but its entire radio buttons will be mutually exclusive.; TGHButtonGroup and TGVButtonGroup are convenience classes that offer you a thin layer on top of TGButtonGroup. TGHButtonGroup organize button widgets in a group of one horizontal row, TGVButtonGroup in a group of one column. You can also organize buttons in rows and columns using the provided constructor and TGMatrixLayout.; Do not use a radio button to indicate the presence or absence of a state - use a check box instead. To have the check button “Event Status” and to set it as selected we need to write:; TGCheckButton *estat = new TGCheckButton(p, ""Event Status"",1);; estat->SetState(kButtonDown);; Check boxes show the selected choices and any number of them can be selected, including none.

If the number of choices exceeds this maximum, it is better to use a multiple selection list box.; The method IsToggleButton() gives the information whether a radio button or a check button is selected. An option button can be set or unset via its method PSetState(EButtonState state).; The method HandleKey(event) is called when the defined hotkey is hit for any button. It sets the selected option button or clicks the selected text button and invokes its defined action.; 25.8.2 Text Entries; A TGTextEntry is a one-line text input widget. It contains text that is entered or modified through the keyboard. This text may be displayed in different way according to the set echo mode. Users can control them bySetEchoMode(), GetEchoMode() methods. kNormal - display characters as they are entered (default);; kNoEcho - do not display anything;; kPassword - display asterisks instead of the characters actually entered. The way in which typed characters are inserted in the text entry is defined by TGTextEntry::EInsertMode and can be toggled by the Insert key:. kInsert - typed character are inserted (cursor has shape of short line); kReplace - entered characters substitute already typed ones (cursor has the shape of filled rectangle). ; There ate different text alignment modes defined by TGWidget::ETextJustification. They are valid until text fits the frame width of the text entry field. kTextLeft - left-side text alignment; kTextRight - right-side text alignment; kTextCenterX - center text alignment along x direction; kTextTop - top-side text alignment; kTextBottom - bottom-side text alignment; kTextCenterY - center text alignment along y direction. 25.8.3 Number Entries; The TGNumberEntry class present number entry widgets. A number entry is a single-line field followed by two small, vertically arranged up-down buttons. Its purpose is to make a selection by either scrolling through a small set of meaningful predefined choices or typing numbers.

They are usually generated externally, which poses problems with where to keep the images, and how to keep them up to date. THtml solves this by offering a few special documentation elements: macro and latex directives.; 27.3.1 Latex Directive; Documentation surrounded by the keywords BEGIN_LATEX / END_LATEX will be passed to ROOT Latex engine TLatex. The keywords can be written with small or capital letters (case insensitive). The output will be stored to an image file, which gets automatically included in the documentation.; // This function calculates BEGIN_LATEX; // F(x_{#frac{1}{2}}) = #prod(x < x_{#frac{1}{2}}) = #frac{1}{2}; // END_LATEX; THtml will inject the following picture:. The image file name is generated from the formula and will be unique for all the documentation. It is stored along-side the documentation, and it will be automatically regenerated when the documentation is updated. The handling of the Latex directive is done by the class TDocLatexDirective.; The BEGIN_LATEX keyword can take the following parameters:. fontsize: sets the TLatex font size. The default value is 16.; separator: sets a list of characters for which a new column will be started. This allows aligned, multi-line, multi-column layout, which can be useful for e.g. mathematical derivations. It is unset by default, meaning the Latex directive will only generate one column.; rseparator: like separator, but a regular expression. Columns start with a match of this regular expression. Only one of separator or rseparator can be given.; align: defines the alignment of the columns. Note that the column delimiter counts as a column itself!. Example invocation, where the font size is set to 10, new columns are started by the characters ‘=’ and ‘,’, and the two columns are left aligned with the separator column centered:; Begin_Latex(fontsize=1",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Occurrences of class MyClass of MyLib will now be referenced as ../mylib/MyClass.html.; 27.4.2 Search Engine; THtml can invoke external search engines. The ROOT reference guide sets Root.Html.Search to http://www.google.com/search?q=%s+site%3A%u. Calling THtml::SetSearchStemURL() will set the same. If this URL stem is set, THtml will create search fields in the index pages. It will send the words entered in these search fields as %s in the URL; %u will be replaced by the current document’s path, allowing a site- and directory-specific search.; 27.4.3 ViewCVS; Most code is managed in a version control system like CVS. ViewCVS is a WWW reader interface to the versioning control system that allows e.g. tracking a file’s changes. THtml will reference these pages automatically if the .rootrc variable Root.Html.ViewCVS is set to the URL stem of the ViewCVS. installation. Alternatively, one can call THtml::SetViewCVS().; 27.4.4 Wiki Pages; In some contexts it might be desirable to let users comment on classes, e.g. for suggestions of use or alternatives, details of behavior, and cross references to other relevant classes.

Preface; In late 1994, we decided to learn and investigate Object Oriented programming and C++ to better judge the suitability of these relatively new techniques for scientific programming. We knew that there is no better way to learn a new programming environment than to use it to write a program that can solve a real problem. After a few weeks, we had our first histogramming package in C++. A few weeks later we had a rewrite of the same package using the, at that time, very new template features of C++. Again, a few weeks later we had another rewrite of the package without templates since we could only compile the version with templates on one single platform using a specific compiler. Finally, after about four months we had a histogramming package that was faster and more efficient than the well-known FORTRAN based HBOOK histogramming package. This gave us enough confidence in the new technologies to decide to continue the development. Thus was born ROOT. Since its first public release at the end of 1995, ROOT has enjoyed an ever-increasing popularity. Currently it is being used in all major High Energy and Nuclear Physics laboratories around the world to monitor, to store and to analyse data. In the other sciences as well as the medical and financial industries, many people are using ROOT. We estimate the current user base to be around several thousand people. In 1997, Eric Raymond analysed in his paper “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” the development method that makes Linux such a success. The essence of that method is: “release early, release often and listen to your customers”. This is precisely how ROOT is being developed. Over the last five years, many of our “customers” became co-developers.

Although still very popular, these tools could not scale up to the challenges offered by the Large Hadron Collider, where the data is a few orders of magnitude larger than anything seen before.; At the same time, computer science had made leaps of progress especially in the area of Object Oriented Design, and René and Fons were ready to take advantage of it.; ROOT was developed in the context of the NA49 experiment at CERN. NA49 has generated an impressive amount of data, around 10 Terabytes per run. This rate provided the ideal environment to develop and test the next generation data analysis.; ROOT was, and still is, developed in the “Bazaar style”, a term from the book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” by Eric S. Raymond. It means a liberal, informal development style that heavily relies on the diverse and deep talent of the user community. The result is that physicists developed ROOT for themselves; this made it specific, appropriate, useful, and over time refined and very powerful. The development of ROOT is a continuous conversation between users and developers with the line between the two blurring at times and the users becoming co-developers.; When it comes to storing and mining large amount of data, physics plows the way with its Terabytes, but other fields and industry follow close behind as they acquiring more and more data over time. They are ready to use the true and tested technologies physics has invented. In this way, other fields and industries have found ROOT useful and they have started to use it also.; In the bazaar view, software is released early and frequently to expose it to thousands of eager co-developers to pound on, report bugs, and contribute possible fixes. More users find more bugs, because they stress the program in different ways. By now, after ten years, the age of ROOT is quite mature.

The styles in used are described below.; To show source code in scripts or source files:; {; cout << "" Hello"" << endl;; float x = 3.;; float y = 5.;; int i = 101;; cout <<"" x = ""<<x<<"" y = ""<<y<<"" i = ""<<i<< endl;; }; To show the ROOT command line, we show the ROOT prompt without numbers. In the interactive system, the ROOT prompt has a line number (root[12]); for the sake of simplicity, the line numbers are left off.; root[] TLine l; root[] l.Print(); TLine X1=0.000000 Y1=0.000000 X2=0.000000 Y2=0.000000; Italic bold monotype font indicates a global variable, for example gDirectory.; When a variable term is used, it is shown between angled brackets. In the example below the variable term <library> can be replaced with any library in the $ROOTSYS directory: $ROOTSYS/<library>/inc.; 1.4 The Framework; ROOT is an object-oriented framework aimed at solving the data analysis challenges of high-energy physics. There are two key words in this definition, object oriented and framework. First, we explain what we mean by a framework and then why it is an object-oriented framework.; 1.4.1 What Is a Framework?; Programming inside a framework is a little like living in a city. Plumbing, electricity, telephone, and transportation are services provided by the city. In your house, you have interfaces to the services such as light switches, electrical outlets, and telephones. The details, for example, the routing algorithm of the phone switching system, are transparent to you as the user. You do not care; you are only interested in using the phone to communicate with your collaborators to solve your domain specific problems.; Programming outside of a framework may be compared to living in the country. In order to have transportation and water, you will have to build a road and dig a well. To have services like telephone and electricity you w",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html
https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html:14129,Energy Efficiency,reduce,reduced,14129," with the rest of the framework.; More consistent and modular code - the code reuse provides consistency and common capabilities between programs, no matter who writes them. Frameworks make it easier to break programs into smaller pieces.; More focus on areas of expertise - users can concentrate on their particular problem domain. They do not have to be experts at writing user interfaces, graphics, or networking to use the frameworks that provide those services. 1.4.2 Why Object-Oriented?; Object-Oriented Programming offers considerable benefits compared to Procedure-Oriented Programming:. Encapsulation enforces data abstraction and increases opportunity for reuse.; Sub classing and inheritance make it possible to extend and modify objects.; Class hierarchies and containment containment hierarchies provide a flexible mechanism for modeling real-world objects and the relationships among them.; Complexity is reduced because there is little growth of the global state, the state is contained within each object, rather than scattered through the program in the form of global variables.; Objects may come and go, but the basic structure of the program remains relatively static, increases opportunity for reuse of design. 1.5 Installing ROOT. To install ROOT you have the choice to download the binaries or the source. The source is quicker to transfer since it is only ~22 MB, but you will need to compile and link it. The binaries compiled with no debug information range from ~35 MB to ~45 MB depending on the target platform.; The installation and building of ROOT is described in Appendix A: Install and Build ROOT. You can download the binaries, or the source. The GNU g++ compiler on most UNIX platforms can compile ROOT.; Before downloading a binary version make sure your machine contains the right run-time environment. In most cases it is not possible to run a version compiled with, e.g., gcc4.0 on a platform where only gcc 3.2 is installed.

In most cases it is not possible to run a version compiled with, e.g., gcc4.0 on a platform where only gcc 3.2 is installed. In such cases you’ll have to install ROOT from source.; ROOT is currently running on the following platforms: supported platforms. GNU/Linux x86-32 (IA32) and x86-64 (AMD64)(GCC,Intel/icc, Portland/PGCC,KAI/KCC); Intel Itanium (IA64) GNU/Linux (GCC, Intel/ecc, SGI/CC); FreeBSD and OpenBSD (GCC); GNU/Hurd (GCC); HP HP-UX 10.x (IA32) and 11 (IA64) (HP CC, aCC, GCC); IBM AIX 4.1 (xlC compiler, GCC); Sun Solaris for SPARC (SUN C++ compiler, GCC); Sun Solaris for x86 (SUN C++ compiler, KAI/KCC); Compaq Alpha (GCC, KAI/KCC, DEC/CXX); SGI Irix 32 and 64 bits (GCC, KAI/KCC, SGI C++ compiler); Windows >= 95 (Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, Cygwin/GCC); MacOS X PPC, x86-32, x86-64 (GCC, Intel/ICC, IBM/xl); PowerPC with GNU/Linux and GCC, Debian v2; PowerPC64 with GNU/Linux and GCC; ARM with GNU/Linux and GCC; LynxOS. 1.6 The Organization of the ROOT Framework; Now after we know in abstract terms what the ROOT framework is, let us look at the physical directories and files that come with the ROOT installation. You may work on a platform where your system administrator has already installed ROOT. You will need to follow the specific development environment for your setup and you may not have write access to the directories.

Using root-config instead of enumerating the libraries by hand allows you to link them in a platform independent way. Also, if ROOT library names change you will not need to change your Makefile.; A batch program that does not have a graphic display, which creates, fills, and saves histograms and trees, only needs to link the core libraries (libCore, libRIO), libHist and libTree. If ROOT needs access to other libraries, it loads them dynamically. For example, if the TreeViewer is used, libTreePlayer and all libraries libTreePlayer depends on are loaded also. The dependent libraries are shown in the ROOT reference guide’s library dependency graph. The difference between reference guide libHist and libHistPainter is that the former needs to be explicitly linked and the latter will be loaded automatically at runtime when ROOT needs it, by means of the Plugin Manager. plugin manager; In the Figure 1-2, the libraries represented by green boxes outside of the core are loaded via the plugin manager plugin manager or equivalent techniques, while the white ones are not. Of course, if one wants to access a plugin library directly, it has to be explicitly linked. An example of a plugin library is libMinuit. To create and fill histograms you need to link libHist.so. If the code has a call to fit the histogram, the “fitter” will dynamically load libMinuit if it is not yet loaded.; 1.6.2.3 Plugins: Runtime Library Dependencies for Linking; plugin manager The Plugin Manager TPluginManager allows postponing library dependencies to runtime: a plugin library will only be loaded when it is needed. Non-plugins will need to be linked, and are thus loaded at start-up. Plugins are defined by a base class (e.g. TFile) that will be implemented in a plugin, a tag used to identify the plugin (e.g. ^rfio: as part of the protocol string), the plugin class of which an object will be created (e.g. TRFIOFile), the library to be loaded (in short libRFIO.so to RFIO), and the c",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Be warned: after finishing the execution of the script, ROOT will normally enter a new session.; -q process command line script files and exit. For example if you would like to run a script myMacro.C in the background, redirect the output into a file myMacro.log, and exit after the script execution, use the following syntax:; root -b -q myMacro.C > myMacro.log; If you need to pass a parameter to the script use:; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(3)' > myMacro.log; Be mindful of the quotes, i.e. if you need to pass a string as a parameter, the syntax is:; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(""text"")' > myMacro.log; You can build a shared library with ACLiC and then use this shared library on the command line for a quicker execution (i.e. the compiled speed rather than the interpreted speed). See also “Cling the C++ Interpreter”.; root -b -q myMacro.so > myMacro.log; ROOT has a powerful C/C++ interpreter giving you access to all available ROOT classes, global variables, and functions via the command line. By typing C++ statements at the prompt, you can create objects, call functions, execute scripts, etc. For example:; root[] 1+sqrt(9); (const double)4.00000000000000000e+00; root[] for (int i = 0; i<4; i++) cout << ""Hello"" << i << endl; Hello 0; Hello 1; Hello 2; Hello 3; root[] .q; To exit the ROOT session, type .q.; root[] .q; 2.3 Using the GUI; The basic whiteboard on which an object is drawn in ROOT is called a canvas (defined by the class TCanvas). Every object in the canvas is a graphical object in the sense that you can grab it, resize it, and change some characteristics using the mouse. The canvas area can be divided in several sub areas, so-called pads (the class TPad). A pad is a canvas sub area that can contain other pads or graphical objects. At any one time, just one pad is the so-called active pad. Any object at the moment of drawing will be drawn in the active pad.

The commands are recorded in the history file $HOME/.root_hist. It is a text file, and you can edit, cut, and paste from it. You can specify the history file in the system.rootrc file, by setting the Rint.Historyoption. You can also turn off the command logging in the system.rootrc file with the option: Rint.History: -; The number of history lines to be kept can be set also in .rootrc by:; Rint.HistSize: 500; Rint.HistSave: 400; The first value defines the maximum of lines kept; once it is reached all, the last HistSave lines will be removed. One can set HistSize to 0 to disable history line management. There is also implemented an environment variable called ROOT_HIST. By setting ROOT_HIST=300:200 the above values can be overriden - the first value corresponds to HistSize, the (optional) second one to HistSave. You can set ROOT_HIST=0 to disable the history.; 2.7.3 Tracking Memory Leaks; You can track memory usage and detect leaks by monitoring the number of objects that are created and deleted (see TObjectTable). To use this facility, edit the file $ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc or .rootrc if you have this file and add the two following lines:; Root.ObjectStat: 1; In your code or on the command line you can type the line:; gObjectTable->Print();; This line will print the list of all active classes and the number of instances for each class. By comparing consecutive print outs, you can see objects that you forgot to delete. Note that this method cannot show leaks coming from the allocation of non-objects or classes unknown to ROOT.; 2.8 Converting from PAW to ROOT; The web page at: http://root.cern.ch/root/HowtoConvertFromPAW.html#TABLE gives the “translation” table of some commonly used PAW commands into ROOT.

If the cell content is N, the color index used will be the color number in colors[N] . If the maximum cell content is greater than ncolors , all cell contents are scaled to ncolors. If ncolors<=0, a default palette of 50 colors is defined. This palette is recommended for pads, labels. It defines:. Index 0 to 9: shades of gray; Index 10 to 19:shades of brown; Index 20 to 29:shades of blue; Index 30 to 39: shades of red; Index 40 to 49:basic colors. The color numbers specified in this palette can be viewed by selecting the menu entry Colors in the View menu of the canvas menu bar. The color’s red, green, and blue values can be changed via TColor::SetRGB.; If ncolors == 1 && colors == 0, then a Pretty Palette with a spectrum violet to red is created with 50 colors. That’s the default rain bow palette.; Other predefined palettes with 255 colors are available when colors == 0. The following value of ncolors (with colors = 0) give access to:. ncolors = 51 : Deep Sea palette.; ncolors = 52 : Grey Scale palette.; ncolors = 53 : Dark Body Radiator palette.; ncolors = 54 : Two-color hue palette palette.

Show Marker - sets markers as visible or invisible.; Exclusion Zone - specifies the exclusion zone parameters :. ’+-‘ check button: sets on which side of the line the exclusion zone will be drawn;; Width combo box: defines the width of the zone. 5 Fitting Histograms; To fit a histogram you can use the Fit Panel on a visible histogram via the context menu, or you can use the TH1::Fit method. The Fit Panel, which is limited, is best for prototyping. The histogram needs to be drawn in a pad before the Fit Panel is invoked. The method TH1::Fit is more powerful and is used in scripts and programs.; 5.1 The Fit Method; The Fit method is implemented in ROOT for the histogram classes TH1, the sparse histogram classes, THnSparse, the graph classes, TGraph, TGraph2D and TMultiGraph for fitting a collection of Graphs with the same function.; 5.1.1 The TH1::Fit Method; To fit a histogram programmatically, you can use the TH1::Fit method.

For example, this line fits histogram object hist with a Gaussian.; root[] hist.Fit(""gaus"");; The initial parameter values (and eventual limits) for pre-defined functions are set automatically. For overriding the default limits values use the fit option B.; The list of pre-defined functions that can be used with the Fit method is the following:. “gaus” Gaussian function with 3 parameters: f(x) = p0*exp(-0.5*((x-p1)/p2)^2); “expo”An Exponential with 2 parameters: f(x) = exp(p0+p1*x); “polN” A polynomial of degree N, where N is a number between 0 and 9: f(x) = p0 + p1*x + p2*x2 +...; “chebyshevN” A Chebyshev polynomial of degree N, where N is a number between 0 and 9: f(x) = p0 + p1*x + p2*(2*x2-1) +...; “landau” Landau function with mean and sigma. This function has been adapted from the CERNLIB routine G110 denlan (see TMath::Landau).; “gausn” Normalized form of the gaussian function with 3 parameters f(x) = p0*exp(-0.5*((x-p1)/p2)^2)/(p2 *sqrt(2PI)). 5.2.2 Creating User-Defined Functions (TF1); You can create a TF1 object and use it in the call the TH1::Fit.

Parameters are Tau and Reset, which defines the epochs where the direction is reset to the steepest descent.; 5.12.4 Using the Network; Neural network are build from a set of “samples”. A sample is a set of values defining the inputs and the corresponding output that the network should ideally provide. In ROOT this is a TTree entry. The first thing to be decided is the network layout. This layout is described in a string where the layers are separated by semicolons. The input/output layers are defined by giving the expression for each neuron, separated by comas. Hidden layers are just described by the number of neurons.; In addition, input and output layer formulas can be preceded by ‘@’ (e.g. “@out”) if one wants to normalize the corresponding value. Also, if the string ends with ‘!’, output neurons are set up for classification, i.e. with a sigmoid (1 neuron) or softmax (more neurons) activation function",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The figure “The neural net output” shows this plot. The neural net output. As it can be seen, this is a quite efficient technique. As mentioned earlier, neural networks are also used for fitting function. For some application with a cylindrical symmetry, a magnetic field simulation gives as output the angular component of the potential vector A, as well as the radial and z components of the B field.; One wants to fit those distributions with a function in order to plug them into the Geant simulation code. Polynomial fits could be tried, but it seems difficult to reach the desired precision over the full range. One could also use a spline interpolation between known points. In all cases, the resulting field would not be C-infinite.; An example of output (for Br) is shown. First the initial function can be seen as the target. Then, the resulting (normalized) neural net output. In order to ease the learning, the “normalize output” was used here.

Be very careful if you take the address of stack objects. As we shall see soon, they are deleted automatically, which could leave you with an illegal pointer.

A destructor is a special C++ function that releases resources for (or destroys) an object of a class. It is the opposite of a constructor that creates the object of a class when it is called. The compiler will provide a destructor that does nothing if none is provided. We will add one to our Quad class so that we can see when it is called. The class names the destructor but with a prefix ~ which is the C++ one’s complement i.e. bit wise complement, and hence has destruction overtones!

It does not do much except print out that it has been called (still a useful debug technique despite today’s powerful debuggers!).; Now run root, load the Quad class and create a heap object:; root[] .L Quad.cxx; root[] Quad *my_objptr = new Quad(1.,2.,-3.);; To delete the object:; root[] delete my_objptr;; root[] my_objptr = 0;; You should see the print out from its destructor. Setting the pointer to zero afterwards is not strictly necessary (and Cling does it automatically), but the object is no more accessible, and any attempt to use the pointer again will, as has already been stated, cause grief. So much for heap objects, but how are stack objects deleted? In C++, a stack object is deleted as soon as control leaves the innermost compound statement that encloses it. Therefore, it is singularly futile to do something like:; root[] { Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.); }; Cling does not follow this rule; if you type in the above line, you will not see the destructor message.

To do this, one has to build a new TColor:; TColor(Int_t color,Float_t r,Float_t g,Float_t b,const char* name); One has to give the color number and the three Red, Green, Blue values, each being defined from 0 (min) to 1(max). An optional name may be given. When built, this color is automatically added to the existing list of colors. If the color number already exists, one has to extract it from the list and redefine the RGB values. This may be done for example with:; root[] color=(TColor*)(gROOT->GetListOfColors()->At(index_color)); root[] color->SetRGB(r,g,b); Where r, g and b go from 0 to 1 and index_color is the color number you wish to change.; The user interface for changing the fill color and style looks like shown in this picture. It takes place in the editor frame anytime the selected object inherits the class TAttFill.; 9.6.4.1 Color Palette (for Histograms); Defining one color at a time may be tedious.

If the maximum cell content is >ncolors, all cell contents are scaled to ncolors. The current color palette does not have a class or global object of its own. It is defined in the current style as an array of color numbers. The current palette can be changed with:; TStyle::SetPalette(Int_t ncolors,Int_t*color_indexes).; By default, or if ncolors <= 0, a default palette (see above) of 50 colors is defined. The colors defined in this palette are good for coloring pads, labels, and other graphic objects. If ncolors > 0 and colors = 0, the default palette is used with a maximum of ncolors. If ncolors == 1 && colors == 0, then a pretty palette with a spectrum Violet->Red is created. It is recommended to use this pretty palette when drawing lego(s), surfaces or contours. For example, to set the current palette to the “pretty” one, do:; root[] gStyle->SetPalette(1); A more complete example is shown below. It illustrates the definition of a custom palette. You can adapt it to suit your needs. In case you use it for contour coloring, with the current color/contour algorithm, always define two more colors than the number of contours.; void palette() {; // Example of creating new colors (purples); const Int_t colNum = 10; // and defining of a new palette; Int_t palette[colNum];; for (Int_t i=0; i<colNum; i++) {; // get the color and if it does not exist create it; if (! gROOT->GetColor(230+i) ){; TColor *color =; new TColor(230+i,1-(i/((colNum)*1.0)),0.3,0.5,"""");; } else {; TColor *color = gROOT->GetColor(230+i);; color->SetRGB(1-(i/((colNum)*1.0)),0.3,0.5);; }; palette[i] = 230+i;; }; gStyle->SetPalette(colNum,palette);; TF2 *f2 = new TF2(""f2"",""exp(-(x^2)-(y^2))"",-3,3,-3,3);; // two contours less than the number of colors in palette; f2->SetContour(colNum-2);; f2->Draw(""cont"");; }; Since ROOT 6.26, you can also define a palette based on an ASCII text file, using TColor::CreateColorTableFromFile(""filename.txt"") or gStyle->SetPalette(""filename.txt"").

CMY and CMYK models are subtractive color models unlike RGB which is an additive. They are mainly used for printing purposes. CMY means Cyan Magenta Yellow to convert RGB to CMY it is enough to do: C=1-R, M=1-G and Y=1-B. CMYK has one more component K (black). The conversion from RGB to CMYK is:; Double_t Black = TMath::Min(TMath::Min(1-Red,1-Green),1-Blue);; Double_t Cyan = (1-Red-Black)/(1-Black);; Double_t Magenta = (1-Green-Black)/(1-Black);; Double_t Yellow = (1-Blue-Black)/(1-Black);; CMYK add the black component which allows to have a better quality for black printing. TPostScript (and TPDF) support the CMYK model. To change the color model use:; gStyle->SetColorModelPS(c);. c = 0 means TPostScript will use RGB color model (default); c = 1 means TPostScript will use CMYK color model. 9.11 The PDF Interface; Like PostScript, PDF is a vector graphics output format allowing a very high graphics output quality.

They allow our simple x3d viewer, and considerably more sophisticated OpenGL one to both work with both geometry libraries (g3d and geom) efficiently.; In addition to external viewers, created in separate windows, this architecture is also used by internal TPad drawing when it requires 3D projections.

A TFolder is a collection of objects visible and expandable in the ROOT object browser. Folders have a name and a title and are identified in the folder hierarchy by an “UNIX-like” naming convention. The base of all folders is //root. It is visible at the top of the left panel in the browser. The browser shows several folders under //root.; New folders can be added and removed to/from a folder.; 10.2 Why Use Folders?; One reason to use folders is to reduce class dependencies and improve modularity. Each set of data has a producer class and one or many consumer classes. When using folders, the producer class places a pointer to the data into a folder, and the consumer class retrieves a reference to the folder.; The consumer can access the objects in a folder by specifying the path name of the folder.; Here is an example of a folder’s path name:; //root/Event/Hits/TCP; One does not have to specify the full path name. If the partial path name is unique, it will find it; otherwise it will return the first occurrence of the path.; The first diagram shows a system without folders. The objects have pointers to each other to access each other’s data. Pointers are an efficient way to share data between classes. However, a direct pointer creates a direct coupling between classes.

This design can become a very tangled web of dependencies in a system with a large number of classes. In the second diagram, a reference to the data is in the folder and the consumers refer to the folder rather than each other to access the data. The naming and search service provided by the ROOT folders hierarchy provides an alternative. It loosely couples the classes and greatly enhances I/O operations. In this way, folders separate the data from the algorithms and greatly improve the modularity of an application by minimizing the class dependencies. In addition, the folder hierarchy creates a picture of the data organization. This is useful when discussing data design issues or when learning the data organization. The example below illustrates this point.; 10.3 How to Use Folders; Using folders means to build a hierarchy of folders, posting the reference to the data in the folder by t",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Once written to disk the memory consumed by the buffer part is released. The key part of the TKey is kept. A diagram of a streamed TH1F in the buffer. The key consumes about 60 bytes, whereas the buffer, since it contains the object data, can be very large.; 11.3.9 Ignore Object Streamers; Your class can ignore the TObject Streamerwith the MyClass->Class::IgnoreObjectStreamer() method. When the class kIgnoreTObjectStreamerbit is set (by calling the IgnoreTObjectStreamermethod), the automatically generated Streamerwill not call TObject::Streamer, and the TObject part of the class is not streamed to the file. This is useful in case you do not use the TObject fBits and fUniqueIDdata members. You gain space on the file, and you do not loose functionality if you do not use the fBits and fUniqueID.See “The Role of TObject” on the use of fBits and fUniqueID.; 11.3.10 Streaming a TClonesArray; When writing a TClonesArray it bypasses by default the Streamerof the member class and uses a more efficient internal mechanism to write the members to the file. You can override the default and specify that the member class Streameris used by setting the TClonesArray::BypassStreamer bit to false:; TClonesArray *fTracks;; fTracks->BypassStreamer(kFALSE); // use the member Streamer; When the kBypassStreamer bit is set, the automatically generated Streamercan call directly the method TClass::WriteBuffer. Bypassing the Streamer improves the performance when writing/reading the objects in the TClonesArray. However, the drawback is when a TClonesArray is written with split=0 bypassing the Streamer, the StreamerInfoof the class in the array being optimized, one cannot later use the TClonesArray with split > 0. For example, there is a problem with the following scenario: a class Foo has a TClonesArray of Bar objects the Foo object is written with split=0 to Tree T1. In this case the StreamerInfo for the class Bar is created in optimized mode in such a way t",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The efficiency is due to having a single pointer fPID for all TRefs in the array. It has a dynamic compact table of fUniqueIDs. We recommend that you use a TRefArray rather then a collection of TRefs.; Example:. Suppose a TObjArray *mytracks containing a list of Track objects.; Suppose a TRefArray *pions containing pointers to the pion tracks in mytracks. This list is created with statements like: pions->Add(track);; Suppose a TRefArray *muons containing pointers to the muon tracks in mytracks. The 3 arrays mytracks,pions and muons may be written separately.; 11.5 Schema Evolution; Schema evolution is a problem faced by long-lived data. When a schema changes, existing persistent data can become inaccessible unless the system provides a mechanism to access data created with previous versions of the schema.

In case you want to store large quantities of same-class objects, ROOT has designed the TTree and TNtuple classes specifically for that purpose. The TTree class is optimized to reduce disk space and enhance access speed. A TNtuple is a TTree that is limited to only hold floating-point numbers; a TTree on the other hand can hold all kind of data, such as objects or arrays in addition to all the simple types.; When using a TTree, we fill its branch buffers with leaf data and the buffers are written to disk when it is full. Branches, buffers, and leafs, are explained a little later in this chapter, but for now, it is important to realize that each object is not written individually, but rather collected and written a bunch at a time.; This is where the TTree takes advantage of compression and will produce a much smaller file than if the objects were written individually. Since the unit to be compressed is a buffer, and the TTree contains many same-class objects, the header of the objects can be compressed.; The TTree reduces the header of each object, but it still contains the class name.

Using compression, the class name of each same-class object has a good chance of being compressed, since the compression algorithm recognizes the bit pattern representing the class name. Using a TTree and compression the header is reduced to about 4 bytes compared to the original 60 bytes. However, if compression is turned off, you will not see these large savings.; The TTree is also used to optimize the data access. A tree uses a hierarchy of branches, and each branch can be read independently from any other branch.

Enabling this optional table, allow TTree::Draw to automatically load the branches needed to dereference a TRef (or TRefArray) object.; 12.7.3 Autosave; Autosave gives the option to save all branch buffers every n byte. We recommend using Autosave for large acquisitions. If the acquisition fails to complete, you can recover the file and all the contents since the last Autosave. To set the number of bytes between Autosave you can use the TTree::SetAutosave() method. You can also call TTree::Autosave in the acquisition loop every nentry.; 12.7.4 Trees with Circular Buffers; When a TTree is memory resident, you set it up so that it retains retain only the last few entries.

To build an index with only majorname, specify minorname=""0"" (default).; Note that once the index is built, it can be saved with the TTree object with:; tree.Write(); //if the file has been open in ""update"" mode; The most convenient place to create the index is at the end of the filling process just before saving the tree header. If a previous index was computed, it is redefined by this new call.; Note that this function can also be applied to a TChain. The return value is the number of entries in the Index (< 0 indicates failure).; 12.8 Branches; The organization of branches allows the designer to optimize the data for the anticipated use. The class for a branch is called TBranch. If two variables are independent, and the designer knows the variables will not be used together, they should be placed on separate branches. If, however, the variables are related, such as the coordinates of a point, it is most efficient to create one branch with both coordinates on it. A variable on a TBranch is called a leaf (yes - TLeaf). Another point to keep in mind when designing trees is that branches of the same TTree can be written to separate files. To add a TBranch to a TTree we call the method TTree::Branch(). Note that we DO NOT use the TBranch constructor.; The TTree::Branch method has several signatures. The branch type differs by what is stored in it. A branch can hold an entire object, a list of simple variables, contents of a folder, contents of a TList, or an array of objects. Let’s see some examples. To follow along you will need the shared library libEvent.so. First, check if it is in $ROOTSYS/test. If it is, copy it to your own area. If it is not there, you have to build it by typing make in $ROOTSYS/test.; 12.9 Adding a Branch to Hold a List of Variables; As in the very first example (cernstaff.root.root) the data we want to save is a list of simple variables, such as inte",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

This leaf list has three integers called ntrack, nseg, and nvtex.; ""ntrack/I:nseg:nvtex""; There is one more rule: when no type is given for the very first leaf, it becomes a float (F). This leaf list has three floats called temp, mass, and px.; ""temp:mass:px""; The symbols used for the type are:. C: a character string terminated by the 0 character; B: an 8 bit signed integer; b: an 8 bit unsigned integer; S: a 16 bit signed integer; s: a 16 bit unsigned integer; I: a 32 bit signed integer; i: a 32 bit unsigned integer; L: a 64 bit signed integer; l: a 64 bit unsigned integer; G: a long signed integer, stored as 64 bit; g: a long unsigned integer, stored as 64 bit; F: a 32 bit floating point; D: a 64 bit floating point; O: [the letter ‘o’, not a zero] a boolean (Bool_t). The type is used for a byte count to decide how much space to allocate. The variable written is simply the block of bytes starting at the starting address given in the second parameter. It may or may not match the leaf list depending on whether or not the programmer is being careful when choosing the leaf address, name, and type.; By default, a variable will be copied with the number of bytes specified in the type descriptor symbol. However, if the type consists of two characters, the number specifies the number of bytes to be used when copying the variable to the output buffer. The line below describes ntrack to be written as a 16-bit integer (rather than a 32-bit integer).; ""ntrack/I2""; With this Branch method, you can also add a leaf that holds an entire array of variables. To add an array of floats use the f[n] notation when describing the leaf.; Float_t f[10];; tree->Branch(""fBranch"",f,""f[10]/F"");; You can also add an array of variable length:; {; TFile *f = new TFile(""peter.root"",""recreate"");; Int_t nPhot;; Float_",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The tree viewer. 12.14.3 Reading the Tree; The tree1r function shows how to read the tree and access each entry and each leaf. We first define the variables to hold the read values.; Float_t px, py, pz;; Then we tell the tree to populate these variables when reading an entry. We do this with the method TTree::SetBranchAddress. The first parameter is the branch name, and the second is the address of the variable where the branch data is to be placed. In this example, the branch name is px. This name was given when the tree was written (see tree1w). The second parameter is the address of the variable px.; t1->SetBranchAddress(""px"",&px);; 12.14.3.1 GetEntry; Once the branches have been given the address, a specific entry can be read into the variables with the method TTree::GetEntry(n). It reads all the branches for entry (n) and populates the given address accordingly. By default, GetEntry() reuses the space allocated by the previous object for each branch. You can force the previous object to be automatically deleted if you call mybranch.SetAutoDelete(kTRUE) (default is kFALSE).; Consider the example in $ROOTSYS/test/Event.h. The top-level branch in the tree T is declared with:; Event *event = 0;; // event must be null or point to a valid object;; // it must be initialized; T.SetBranchAddress(""event"",&event);; When reading the Tree, one can choose one of these 3 options:; Option 1:; for (Int_t i = 0; i<nentries; i++) {; T.GetEntry(i);; //the object event has been filled at this point; }; This is the default and recommended way to create an object of the class Event.It will be pointed by event.; At the following entries, event will be overwritten by the new data. All internal members that are TObject* are automatically deleted. It is important that these members be in a valid state when GetEntry is called. Pointers must be correctly initialized.

The TTree::Draw method is a powerful yet simple way to look and draw the trees contents. It enables you to plot a variable (a leaf) with just one line of code. However, the Draw method falls short once you want to look at each entry and design more sophisticated acceptance criteria for your analysis. For these cases, you can use TTree::MakeClass. It creates a class that loops over the trees entries one by one. You can then expand it to do the logic of your analysis.; The TTree::MakeSelector is the recommended method for ROOT data analysis. It is especially important for large data set in a parallel processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several processors and you can specify which entries to send to each processor. With MakeClass the user has control over the event loop, with MakeSelectorthe tree is in control of the event loop.; 12.20 Simple Analysis Using TTree::Draw; We will use the tree in cernstaff.root that was made by the macro in $ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/staff.C.; First, open the file and lists it",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

To show a set of points in Parallel Coordinates, a set of parallel lines is drawn, typically vertical and equally spaced. A point in n-dimensional space is represented as a polyline with vertices on the parallel axes. The position of the vertex on the i-th axis corresponds to the i-th coordinate of the point. The three following figures show some very simple examples:. The Parallel Coordinates representation of the six dimensional point (-5,3,4,2,0,1). The line y = -3x+20 and a circle in Parallel Coordinates. The Parallel Coordinates technique is good at: spotting irregular events, seeing the data trend, finding correlations and clusters. Its main weakness is the cluttering of the output. Because each “point” in the multidimensional space is represented as a line, the output is very quickly opaque and therefore it is difficult to see the data clusters. Most of the work done about Parallel Coordinates is to find techniques to reduce the output’s cluttering. The Parallel Coordinates plots in ROOT have been implemented as a new plotting option “PARA” in the TTree::Draw()method. To demonstrate how the Parallel Coordinates works in ROOT we will use the tree produced by the following “pseudo C++” code:; void parallel_example() {; TNtuple *nt = new TNtuple(""nt"",""Demo ntuple"",""x:y:z:u:v:w:a:b:c"");; for (Int_t i=0; i<3000; i++) {; nt->Fill( rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd );; nt->Fill( s1x, s1y, s1z, s2x, s2y, s2z, rnd, rnd, rnd );; nt->Fill( rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, s3y, rnd );; nt->Fill( s2x-1, s2y-1, s2z, s1x+.5, s1y+.5, s1z+.5, rnd, rnd, rnd );; nt->Fill( rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd );; nt->Fill( s1x+1, s1y+1, s1z+1, s3x-2, s3y-2, s3z-2, rnd, rnd, rnd );; nt->Fill( rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, s3x, rnd, s3z );; nt->Fill( rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd, rnd );; }; The data set generated has:. 9 variables: x, y, z, u, v, w, a, b, c.; 3000*8 = 24",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

To improve the readability of the Parallel Coordinates output and to explore interactively the data set, many techniques are available. We have implemented a few in ROOT. First of all, in order to show better where the clusters on the various axes are, a 1D histogram is associated to each axis. These histograms (one per axis) are filled according to the number of lines passing through the bins. The histogram’s axis can be represented with colors or as bar charts. These histograms can be represented which colors (get from a palette according to the bin contents) or as bar charts. Both representations can be cumulated on the same plot. This technique allows seeing clearly where the clusters are on an individual axis but it does not give any hints about the correlations between the axes.; Avery simple technique allows to make the clusters appearing: Instead of painting solid lines we paint dotted lines. The cluttering of each individual line is reduced and the clusters show clearly as we can see on the next figure. The spacing between the dots is a parameter which can be adjusted in order to get the best results. Using dotted lines is a very simple method to reduce the cluttering. Interactivity is a very important aspect of the Parallel Coordinates plots. To really explore the data set it is essential to act directly with the events and the axes. For instance, changing the axes order may show clusters which were not visible in a different order. On the next figure the axes order has been changed interactively. We can see that many more clusters appear and all the “random spheres” we put in the data set are now clearly visible. Having moved the variables u,v,w after the variables x,y,z the correlation between these two sets of variables is clear also. Axis order is very important to show clusters.

Within a selection, ranges along the same axis are combined with logical OR, and ranges on different axes with logical AND. A selection is displayed on top of the complete data set using its own color. Only the events fulfilling the selection criteria (ranges) are displayed. Ranges are defined interactively using cursors, like on the first axis on the figure. Several selections can be defined at the same time, each selection having its own color. Selections are set of ranges which can be defined interactively. Several selections can been defined. Each cluster is now clearly visible and the zone with crossing clusters is now understandable whereas, without any selection or with only a single one, it was not easy to understand. Several selections can be defined each of them having its own color. Interactive selections on Parallel Coordinates are a powerful tool because they can be defined graphically on many variables (graphical cuts in ROOT can be defined on two variables only) which allow a very accurate events filtering. Selections allow making precise events choices: a single outlying event is clearly visible when the lines are displayed as “solid” therefore it is easy to make cuts in order to eliminate one single event from a selection. Such selection (to filter one single event) on a scatter plot would be much more difficult. Selections allow to easily filter one single event. Once a selection has been defined, it is possible to use it to generate a TEntryList which is applied on the tree and used at drawing time. In our example the selection we defined allows to select exactly the two correlated “random spheres”. Output of nt->Draw(“x:y:z”) and nt->Draw(“u:v:w”) after applying the selection.

It creates two files similar to TTree::MakeClass.; In the resulting files is a class that is a descendent of TSelector and implements the following methods:. TSelector::Begin() - this method is called every time a loop over the tree starts. This is a convenient place to create your histograms.; TSelector::Notify() - it is called at the first entry of a new tree in a chain.; TSelector::Process() - it is called to process an event. It is the user’s responsibility to read the corresponding entry in memory (may be just a partial read). Once the entry is in memory one can apply a selection and if the event is selected histograms can be filled. Processing stops when this function returns kFALSE. It combines the methods TSelector::ProcessCut() and TSelector::ProcessFill() in one, avoiding the necessity to maintain the state in the class to communicate between these two functions. It reduces the information that needs to be shared between them and promotes a more granular data access by reading branches as they are needed.; TSelector::Terminate() - it is called at the end of a loop on a TTree. This is a convenient place to draw and fit your histograms.; TSelector::Version() - this function provides backward compatibility for old versions and support for the future upgrades.; The TSelector, unlike the resulting class from MakeClass, separates the processing into a ProcessCut() and ProcessFill(), so we can limit reading of branches to the ones we need.; When a selector is used with a TChain in methods Process(), ProcessFill(), ProcessCut(), you must use the pointer to the current TTree to call the method GetEntry(entry). The parameter entry is always the local entry number in the current tree.

Next figure shows the CPU time for these four operations as a function of the matrix size:. A*B The execution time is measured for the sum of A * Bsym, Bsym* A and A * B. Notice the matrix_size3 dependence of execution time. CLHEP results are hampered by a poor implementation of symmetric matrix multiplications. For instance, for general matrices of size 100x100, the time is 0.015 sec. while A * Bsym takes 0.028 sec and Bsym* A takes 0.059 sec. Both GSL and ROOT v4.0 can be setup to use the hardware-optimized multiplication routines of the BLAS libraries. It was tested on a G4 PowerPC. The improvement becomes clearly visible around sizes of (50x50) were the execution speed improvement of the Altivec processor becomes more significant than the overhead of filling its pipe. \(A^{-1}\) Here, the time is measured for an in-place matrix inversion. Except for ROOT v3.10, the algorithms are all based on an LUfactorization followed by forward/back-substitution. ROOT v3.10 is using the slower Gaussian elimination method. The numerical accuracy of the CLHEP routine is poor:. up to 6x6 the numerical imprecise Cramer multiplication is hard-coded. For instance, calculating U=H*H-1, where H is a (5x5) Hilbert matrix, results in off-diagonal elements of \(10^{-7}\) instead of the \(10^{-13}\) using an LUaccording to Crout.; scaling protection is non-existent and limits are hard-coded, as a consequence inversion of a Hilbert matrix for sizes>(12x12) fails.

See “The kCanDelete Bit” and “The kMustCleanup Bit”. They can be set by any object and should not be reused. Make sure not to overlap them in any given hierarchy. The bit 13 (kInvalidObject) is set when an object could not be read from a ROOT file. It will check this bit and will skip to the next object on the file.; The TObject constructor initializes the fBits to zero depending if the object is created on the stack or allocated on the heap. When the object is created on the stack, the kCanDelete bit is set to false to protect from deleting objects on the stack. The high 8 bits are reserved for the system usage; the low 24 bits are user settable. fUniqueID is a data member used to give a unique identification number to an object. It is initialized to zero by the TObject constructor. ROOT does not use this data member. The two data members (fBits and fUniqueID) are streamed out when writing an object to disk. If you do not use them, you can save some space and time by specifying:; MyClass::Class()->IgnoreTObjectStreamer();; This sets a bit in the TClass object. If the file is compressed, the savings are minimal since most values are zero; however, it saves some space when the file is not compressed.

A default constructor is a constructor with zero parameters or with one or more parameters all with default values. An I/O constructor is a constructor with exactly one parameter which type is a pointer to one of the type marked as an ‘io constructor type’. We will come back to this context in a few paragraphs. This default or I/O constructor is called whenever an object is being read from a ROOT database. Be sure that you do not allocate any space for embedded pointer objects in this constructor. This space will be lost (memory leak) while reading in the object. For example:; class T49Event : public TObject {; private:; Int_t fId;; TCollection *fTracks;; ...; public:; // Error space for TList pointer will be lost; T49Event() { fId = 0; fTrack = new TList; }; // Correct default initialization of pointer; T49Event() { fId = 0; fTrack = 0; }; ...; };; The memory will be lost because during reading of the object the pointer will be set to the object it was pointing to at the time the object was written. Create the fTrack list when you need it, e.g. when you start filling the list or in a not-default constructor.; ...; if (!fTrack) fTrack = new TList;; ...; The constructor actually called by the ROOT I/O can be customized by using the rootcling pragma:; #pragma link C++ ioctortype UserClass;; For example, with this pragma and a class named MyClass, the ROOT I/O will call the first of the following 3 constructors which exists and is publ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Objects can be directly accessed via an index. The array expands automatically when objects are added. At creation time one specifies the default array size (default = 16) and lower bound (default = 0). Resizing involves a re-allocation and a copy of the old array to the new. This can be costly if done too often. If possible, set initial size close to expected final size. Index validity is always checked (if you are 100% sure and maximum performance is needed you can use UnCheckedAt() instead of At() or operator[]). If the stored objects are sort able the array can be sorted using Sort(). Once sorted, efficient searching is possible via the BinarySearch() method.

In addition, a TVector2 is a basic implementation of a vector in two dimensions and is not part of the CLHEP translation.; 17.2 TVector3. TVector3 is a general three-vector class, which can be used for description of different vectors in 3D. Components of three vectors:. \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) = basic components; \(\theta\) = azimuth angle; \(\phi\) = polar angle; magnitude = \(mag\) = \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\); transverse component = \(perp\) = \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). Using the TVector3 class, you should remember that it contains only common features of three vectors and lacks methods specific for some particular vector values. For example, it has no translated function because translation has no meaning for vectors.; 17.2.1 Declaration",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

In fact, there are just two of them: the material they are made from and their geometrical shape. These have to be created before creating the volume itself, so we will describe the bits and pieces needed for making the geometry before moving to an architectural point of view.; As far as materials are concerned, they represent the physical properties of the solid from which a volume is made. Materials are just a support for the data that has to be provided to the tracking engine that uses this geometry package.

This is more or less the case for detector geometries of complex experiments, where a ‘flat’ CSG model description cannot scale with the current CPU performances. This is the reason why models like GEANT [1] introduced an additional dimension (depth) in order to reduce the complexity of the problem. This concept is also preserved by the ROOT modeller and introduces a pure geometrical constraint between objects (volumes in our case) - containment. This means in fact that any positioned volume has to be contained by another. Now what means contained and positioned?. We will say that a volume contains a point if this is inside the shape associated to the volume. For instance, a volume having a box shape will contain all points P=(X,Y,Z) verifying the conditions: Abs(Pi)dXi. The points on the shape boundaries are considered as inside the volume. The volume contains a daughter if it contains all the points contained by the daughter.; The definition of containment works of course only with points defined in the local coordinate system of the considered volume. Positioning a volume inside another have to introduce a geometrical transformation between the two. If M defines this transformation, any point in the daughter ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

We will want now to place symmetrically 1000 chambers on a pad, following a pattern of 20 rows and 50 columns. One way to do this will be to replicate our chamber by positioning it 1000 times in different positions of the pad. Unfortunately, this is far from being the optimal way of doing what we want. Imagine that we would like to find out which of the 1000 chambers is containing a (x,y,z) point defined in the pad reference. You will never have to do that, since the modeller will take care of it for you, but let’s guess what it has to do. The most simple algorithm will just loop over all daughters, convert the point from mother to local reference and check if the current chamber contains the point or not. This might be efficient for pads with few chambers, but definitely not for 1000. Fortunately the modeller is smarter than that and creates for each volume some optimization structures called voxels to minimize the penalty having too many daughters, but if you have 100 pads like this in your geometry you will anyway lose a lot in your tracking performance. The way out when volumes can be arranged according to simple patterns is the usage of divisions. We will describe them in detail later on. Let’s think now at a different situation: instead of 1000 chambers of the same type, we may have several types of chambers. Let’s say all chambers are cylindrical and have a wire inside, but their dimensions are different. However, we would like all to be represented by a single volume family, since they have the same properties.; 18.4.2.8 Volume Families; A volume family is represented by the class TGeoVolumeMulti.

At least one vertex of a positioned volume mesh is contained (having a safety bigger than the accepted maximum value) by other positioned volume inside the same container. The check is performed also by inverting the candidates. The code is highly optimized to avoid checking candidates that are far away in space by performing a fast check on their bounding boxes. Once the checking tool is fired-up inside a volume or at top level, the list of overlaps (visible as Illegal overlaps inside a TBrowser) held by the manager class will be filled with TGeoOverlap objects containing a full description of the detected overlaps. The list is sorted in the decreasing order of the overlapping distance, extrusions coming first. An overlap object name represents the full description of the overlap, containing both candidate node names and a letter (x-extrusion, o-overlap) representing the type. Double-clicking an overlap item in a TBrowser produces a picture of the overlap containing only the two overlapping nodes (one in blue and one in green) and having the critical vertices represented by red points. The picture can be rotated/zoomed or drawn in X3d as any other view. Calling gGeoManager->PrintOverlaps() prints the list of overlaps.; 18.6.2 Graphical Checking Methods. Safety computation checking.

A library separated from the main one provides all functionality being linked with the underlying ROOT visualization system. This library is dynamically loaded by the plug-in manager only when drawing features are requested. The geometrical structures that can be visualized are volumes and volume hierarchies.; The main component of the visualization system is volume primitive painting in a ROOT pad. Starting from this one, several specific options or subsystems are available, like: X3D viewing using hidden line and surface removal algorithms, OpenGL viewing* or ray tracing.; The method TGeoManager::GetGeomPainter()loads the painting library in memory.; This is generally not needed since it is called automatically by TGeoVolume::Draw() as well as by few other methods setting visualization attributes.; 18.7.1 Drawing Volumes and Hierarchies of Volumes; The first thing one would like to do after building some geometry is to v",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The top node corresponds to the level 0 in the stored array, while the last node will correspond to level n. For each level, the node, volume and global matrix can be retrieved using corresponding getters:; TGeoHMatrix *GetMatrix(Int_t level=-1) const; TGeoNode *GetNode(Int_t level=-1) const; TGeoShape *GetShape(Int_t level=-1) const; TGeoVolume *GetVolume(Int_t level=-1) const; By default the object at level n is retrieved (the align-able object).; Once created, a physical node can be misaligned, meaning that its positioning matrix or even the shape.:; void Align(TGeoMatrix* newmat=0, TGeoShape* newshape=0,; Bool_t check=kFALSE); The convention used is that newmat represents the new local matrix of the last node in the branch with respect to its mother volume. The Align() method will actually duplicate the corresponding branch within the logical hierarchy, creating new volumes and nodes. This is mandatory in order to avoid problems due to replicated volumes and can create exhaustive memory consumption if used abusively.; Once aligned, a physical node is ready to be tracked. The operation can be done only after the geometry was closed.; Important NOTE: Calling the Align() method for a physical node changes the node pointers for the stored node branch in the active geometry, Due to this the other defined physical nodes containing elements of this path will be invalid. Example:; TGeoPhysicalNode *pn1 =; gGeoManager->MakePhysicalNode(""/A_1/B_1/C_2"");; TGeoPhysicalNode *pn2 =; gGeoManager->MakePhysicalNode(""/A_1/B_1/C_3"");; ...; pn1->Align(...);; The call to pn1->Align() will invalidate the pointer to the node B_1 in pn2 object.. The way out is to either call pn1->Align() before the creation of pn2, either to use a global method that will correct all existing physical nodes:; void RefreshPhysicalNodes(Bool_t lock = kTRUE); The method above will optionally lock the possibility of doing any further misalignment.; 18.9 Geometry I/O; Once geom",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Therefore, the first step is to convert the global current point and direction in the local reference frame of the current volume and to compute the distance to exit its shape from inside. The returned value is again compared to the maximum allowed step (the proposed one) and in case the distance is safe no other action is performed and the proposed step is approved. In case the boundary is closer, the computed distance is taken as maximum allowed step. For optimization purposed, for particles starting very close to the current volume boundary (less than 0.01 microns) and exiting the algorithm stops here.; After computing the distance to exit the current node, the distance to the daughter of the current volume which is crossed next is computed by TGeoManager::FindNextDaughterBoundary(). This computes the distance to all daughter candidates that can be possibly crossed by using volume voxelization. The algorithm is efficient in average only in case the number of daughters is greater than 4. For fewer nodes, a simple loop is performed and the minimum distance (from a point outside each shape) is taken and compared to the maximum allowed step. The step value is again updated if step<stepmax .; A special case is when the current node is declared as possibly overlapping with something else. If this is the case, the distance is computed for all possibly overlapping candidates, taking into account the overlapping priorities (see also: "" Overlapping volumes "").; The global matrix describing the next crossed physical node is systematically computed in case the value of the proposed step is negative. In this case, one can subsequently call TGeoManager::ComputeNormalFast() to get the normal vector to the crossed surface, after propagating the current point with the TGeoManager::GetStep() value. This propagation can be done like:; Double_t *current_point = gGeoManager->GetCurrentPoint();; Double_t *current_dir = gGeoManager->GetCurrent",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

After the fit, you can retrieve the fit parameters from the TF1 instance. For example:; from ROOT import TF1, TH1F, TCanvas. class Linear:; def __call__( self, x, par ):; return par[0] + x[0]*par[1]. # create a linear function for fitting; f = TF1('pyf3',Linear(),-1.,1.,2). # create and fill a histogram; h = TH1F('h','test',100,-1.,1.); f2 = TF1('cf2','6.+x*4.5',-1.,1.); h.FillRandom('cf2',10000). # fit the histo with the python 'linear' function; h.Fit(f). # print results; par = f.GetParameters(); print('fit results: const =', par[0], ',pitch =', par[1]); 19.1.9 Working with Trees; Next to making histograms, working with trees is probably the most common part of any analysis. The TTree implementation uses pointers and dedicated buffers to reduce the memory usage and to speed up access. Consequently, mapping TTree functionality to Python is not straightforward, and most of the following features are implemented in ROOT release 4.01/04 and later only, whereas you will need 5.02 if you require all of them.; 19.1.9.1 Accessing an Existing Tree; Let us assume that you have a file containing TTrees, TChains, or TNtuples and want to read the contents for use in your analysis code. This is commonly the case when you work with the result of the reconstruction software of your experiment (e.g. the combined ntuple in ATLAS). The following example code outlines the main steps (you can run it on the result of the tree1.C macro):; from ROOT import TFile. # open the file; myfile = TFile('tree1.root'). # retrieve the ntuple of interest; mychain = myfile.Get('t1'); entries = mychain.GetEntriesFast(). for jentry in xrange(entries):; # get the next tree in the chain and verify; ientry = mychain.LoadTree(jentry); if ientry < 0:; b",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

It is a very useful example to study when designing a GUI. Some examples of the output of guitest are shown next. To run it type guitest at the system prompt in the $ROOTSYS/test directory. We have included an entire chapter on this subject where we explore guitest in detail and use it to explain how to build our own ROOT application with a GUI. See “Writing a Graphical User Interface”. Native GUI widgets. 21 Example Analysis; This chapter is an example of a typical physics analysis. Large data files are chained together and analyzed using the TSelector class.; 21.1 Explanation; This script uses four large data sets from the H1 collaboration at DESY Hamburg. One can access these data sets (277 Mbytes) from the ROOT web site at: ftp://root.cern.ch/root/h1analysis/; The physics plots generated by this example cannot be produced using smaller data sets.; There are several ways to analyze data stored in a ROOT Tree. Using TTree::Draw:; This is very convenient and efficient for small tasks. A TTree::Draw call produces one histogram at the time. The histogram is automatically generated. The selection expression may be specified in the command line.; Using the TTreeViewer:; This is a graphical interface to TTree::Draw with the same functionality.; Using the code generated by TTree::MakeClass:; In this case, the user creates an instance of the analysis class. They have the control over the event loop and can generate an unlimited number of histograms.; Using the code generated by TTree::MakeSelector: Like for the code generated by TTree::MakeClass, the user can do complex analysis. However, they cannot control the event loop. The event loop is controlled by TTree::Process called by the user. This solution is illustrated by the code below. The advantage of this method is that it can be run in a parallel environment using PROOF (the Parallel Root Facility).

No other threads can perform actions or access objects/collections while it is being executed.

Each process has a private address space. Processes begin with a single thread.; A thread is a sequence of instructions being executed in a program. A thread has a program counter and a private stack to keep track of local variables and return addresses. A multithreaded process is associated with one or more threads. Threads execute independently. All threads in a given process share the private address space of that process.; Concurrency exists when at least two threads are in progress at the same time. A system with only a single processor can support concurrency by switching execution contexts among multiple threads.; Parallelism arises when at least two threads are executing simultaneously.

There are two general ways for the user to interact with an application: the keyboard and the mouse. The Graphical User Interface is as a bridge between the user and the program - it provides methods to detect the user actions and instruments that do something as a reaction of these actions. The user communicates with an application through the window system. The window system reports interaction events to the application. The application in turn forwards them to the currently active window. The objects/widgets receive the events and react to them according to the application functionality. The signals/slot communication mechanism is an advanced object communication concept",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

There are classes for all objects, and they fall into hierarchies. In addition, the ROOT has fully cross-platform GUI classes and provides all standard components for an application environment with common ‘look and feel’. The object-oriented, event-driven programming model supports the modern signals/slots communication mechanism. It handles user interface actions and allows total independence of interacting objects and classes. This mechanism uses the ROOT dictionary information and the Cling the C++ Interpreter to connect signals to slots methods.; Therefore, all necessary elements for an object-oriented editor design are in place. The editor complexity can be reduced by splitting it into discrete units of so-called object editors. Any object editor provides an object specific GUI. The main purpose of the ROOT graphics editor is the organization of the object editors’ appearance and the task sequence between them.; 25.9.1 Object Editors; Every object editor follows a simple naming convention: to have as a name the object class name concatenated with ‘Editor’ (e.g. for TGraph objects the object editor is TGraphEditor). Thanks to the signals/slots communication mechanism and to the method DistancetoPrimitive() that computes a ‘‘distance’’ to an object from the mouse position, it was possible to implement a signal method of the canvas that says which is the selected object and to which pad it belongs. Having this information the graphics editor loads the corresponding object editor and the user interface is ready for use. This way after a click on ‘axis’—the axis editor is active; a click on a ‘pad’ activates the pad editor, etc.; The algorithm in use is simple and",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html
https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html:1223123,Energy Efficiency,reduce,reduced,1223123,"vates the pad editor, etc.; The algorithm in use is simple and is based on the object-oriented relationship and communication. When the user activates the editor, according to the selected object <obj> in the canvas it looks for a class name <obj>Editor. For that reason, the correct naming is very important. If a class with this name is found, the editor verifies that this class derives from the base editor class TGedFrame. If all checks are satisfied, the editor makes an instance of the object editor. Then, it scans all object base classes searching the corresponding object editors. When it finds one, it makes an instance of the base class editor too.; Once the object editor is in place, it sets the user interface elements according to the object’s status. After that, it is ready to interact with the object following the user actions.; The graphics editor gives an intuitive way to edit objects in a canvas with immediate feedback. Complexity of some object editors is reduced by hiding GUI elements and revealing them only on users’ requests.; An object in the canvas is selected by clicking on it with the left mouse button. Its name is displayed on the top of the editor frame in red color. If the editor frame needs more space than the canvas window, a vertical scroll bar appears for easy navigation.

Use the script quoted above to generate the skeleton function and create/fill the relevant histogram yourself.; 3 Histograms; This chapter covers the functionality of the histogram classes. We begin with an overview of the histogram classes, after which we provide instructions and examples on the histogram features.; We have put this chapter ahead of the graphics chapter so that you can begin working with histograms as soon as possible. Some of the examples have graphics commands that may look unfamiliar to you. These are covered in the chapter “Input/Output”.; 3.1 The Histogram Classes. ROOT supports histograms up to three dimensions. Separate concrete classes are provided for one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional classes. The histogram classes are split into further categories, depending on the set of possible bin values:. TH1C, TH2C and TH3C contain one char (one byte) per bin (maximum bin content = 255); TH1S, TH2S and TH3S contain one short (two bytes) per bin (maximum bin content = 65 535).; TH1I, TH2I and TH3I contain one integer (four bytes) per bin (maximum bin content = 2 147 483 647).; TH1L, TH2L and TH3L contain one long64 (eight bytes) per bin (maximum bin content = 9 223 372 036 854 775 807).; TH1F, TH2F and TH3F contain one float (four bytes) per bin (maximum precision = 7 digits).; TH1D, TH2D and TH3D contain one double (eight bytes) per bin (maximum precision = 14 digits). ROOT also supports profile histograms, which constitute an elegant replacement of two-dimensional histograms in many cases. The inter-relation of two measured quantities X and Y can always be visualized with a two-dimensional histogram or scatter-plot. Profile histograms, on the other hand, are used to display the mean value of Y and its RMS for each bin in X. If Y is a",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html
https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html:79094,Integrability,integrat,integrated,79094," bin contents do not exceed the maximum positive capacity (127 or 65 535). Histograms of all types may have positive or/and negative bin contents.; 3.5 Random Numbers and Histograms; TH1::FillRandom() can be used to randomly fill a histogram using the contents of an existing TF1 function or another TH1 histogram (for all dimensions). For example, the following two statements create and fill a histogram 10 000 times with a default Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and sigma 1 :; root[] TH1F h1(""h1"",""Histo from a Gaussian"",100,-3,3);; root[] h1.FillRandom(""gaus"",10000);; TH1::GetRandom() can be used to get a random number distributed according the contents of a histogram. To fill a histogram following the distribution in an existing histogram you can use the second signature of TH1::FillRandom(). Next code snipped assumes that h is an existing histogram (TH1 ).; root[] TH1F h2(""h2"",""Histo from existing histo"",100,-3,3);; root[] h2.FillRandom(&h1, 1000);; The distribution contained in the histogram h1 ( TH1 ) is integrated over the channel contents. It is normalized to one. The second parameter (1000) indicates how many random numbers are generated.; Getting 1 random number implies:. Generating a random number between 0 and 1 (say r1 ); Find the bin in the normalized integral for r1; Fill histogram channel. You can see below an example of the TH1::GetRandom() method which can be used to get a random number distributed according the contents of a histogram.; void getrandomh() {; TH1F *source = new TH1F(""source"",""source hist"",100,-3,3);; source->FillRandom(""gaus"",1000);; TH1F *final = new TH1F(""final"",""final hist"",100,-3,3);. // continued... for (Int_t i=0;i<10000;i++) {; final->Fill(source->GetRandom());; }; TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas(""c1"",""c1"",800,1000);; c1->Divide(1,2);; c1->cd(1);; source->Draw();; c1->cd(2);; final->Draw();; c1->cd();; }; 3.6 Adding, Dividing, and Multiplying; Many types of operations are supported on histograms or between histograms:.

See “Draw Options” for the list of options.; 3.8.1 Setting the Style; Histograms use the current style gStyle, which is the global object of class TStyle. To change the current style for histograms, the TStyle class provides a multitude of methods ranging from setting the fill color to the axis tick marks. Here are a few examples:; void SetHistFillColor(Color_t color = 1); void SetHistFillStyle(Style_t styl = 0); void SetHistLineColor(Color_t color = 1); void SetHistLineStyle(Style_t styl = 0); void SetHistLineWidth(Width_t width = 1); When you change the current style and would like to propagate the change to a previously created histogram you can call TH1::UseCurrentStyle(). You will need to call UseCurrentStyle() on each histogram. When reading many histograms from a file and you wish to update them to the current style, you can use gROOT::ForceStyle and all histograms read after this call will be updated to use the current style. See “Graphics and the Graphical User Interface”. When a histogram is automatically created as a result of a TTree::Draw , the style of the histogram is inherited from the tree attributes and the current style is ignored. The tree attributes are the ones set in the current TStyle at the time the tree was created. You can change the existing tree to use the current style, by calling TTree::UseCurrentStyle() .; 3.8.2 Draw Options; The following draw options are supported on all histogram classes:. “AXIS”: Draw only the axis.; “HIST”: When a histogram has errors, it is visualized by default with error bars. To visualize it without errors use HIST together with the required option (e.g. “HIST SAME C”).; “SAME”: Superimpose on previous picture in the same pad.; “CYL”: Use cylindrical coordinates.; “POL”: Use polar coordinates.; “SPH”: Use spherical coordinates.; “PSR”: Use pseudo-rapidity/phi coordinates.; “LEGO”: Draw a lego plot with hidden line removal.; “LEGO1”: Draw a lego plot with hidden surface removal.; “L",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Use TPad::SetTicks(tx,ty) to set these options. See also the methods of TAxis that set specific axis attributes. If multiple color-filled histograms are drawn on the same pad, the fill area may hide the axis tick marks. One can force the axis redrawing over all the histograms by calling:; gPad->RedrawAxis();; 3.8.8 Giving Titles to the X, Y and Z Axis; Because the axis title is an attribute of the axis, you have to get the axis first and then call TAxis::SetTitle.; h->GetXaxis()->SetTitle(""X axis title"");; h->GetYaxis()->SetTitle(""Y axis title"");; h->GetZaxis()->SetTitle(""Z axis title"");; The histogram title and the axis titles can be any TLatex string. The titles are part of the persistent histogram. For example if you wanted to write E with a subscript (T) you could use this:; h->GetXaxis()->SetTitle(""E_{T}"");; For a complete explanation of the Latex mathematical expressions, see “Graphics and the Graphical User Interface”. It is also possible to specify the histogram title and the axis titles at creation time. These titles can be given in the “title” parameter. They must be separated by “;”:; TH1F* h=new TH1F(""h"",""Histogram title;X Axis;Y Axis;Z Axis"",; 100,0,1);; Any title can be omitted:; TH1F* h=new TH1F(""h"",""Histogram title;;Y Axis"",100,0,1);; TH1F* h=new TH1F(""h"","";;Y Axis"",100,0,1);; The method SetTitle has the same syntax:; h->SetTitle(""Histogram title;An other X title Axis"");; 3.9 Making a Copy of an Histogram; Like for any other ROOT object derived from TObject , the Clone method can be used. This makes an identical copy of the original histogram including all associated errors and functions:; TH1F *hnew = (TH1F*)h->Clone(); // renaming is recommended,; hnew->SetName(""hnew""); // because otherwise you will have; // two histograms with the same; // name; 3.10 Normalizing Histograms; Y",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

A TH2Poly histogram example. 3.17 Profile Histograms; Profile histograms are in many cases an elegant replacement of two-dimensional histograms. The relationship of two quantities X and Y can be visualized by a two-dimensional histogram or a scatter-plot; its representation is not particularly satisfactory, except for sparse data. If Y is an unknown [but single-valued] function of X, it can be displayed by a profile histogram with much better precision than by a scatter-plot. Profile histograms display the mean value of Y and its RMS for each bin in X. The following shows the contents [capital letters] and the values shown in the graphics [small letters] of the elements for bin j. When you fill a profile histogram with TProfile.Fill(x,y) :. H[j] will contain for each bin j the sum of the y values for this bin; L[j] contains the number of entries in the bin j; e[j] or s[j] will be the resulting error depending on the selected option. See “Build Options”. E[j] = sum Y**2; L[j] = number of entries in bin J; H[j] = sum Y; h[j] = H[j] / L[j]; s[j] = sqrt[E[j] / L[j] - h[j]**2]; e[j] = s[j] / sqrt[L[j]]; In the special case where s[j] is zero, when there is only one entry per bin, e[j] is computed from the average of the s[j] for all bins. This approximation is used to keep the bin during a fit operation. The TProfile constructor takes up to eight arguments. The first five parameters are similar to TH1D constructor.; TProfile(const char *name,const char *title,Int_t nbinsx,; Double_t xlow, Double_t xup, Double_t ylow, Double_t yup,; Option_t *option); All values of y are accepted at filling time.

It is in many cases an elegant replacement of a three-dimensional histogram. The relationship of three measured quantities X, Y and Z can be visualized by a three-dimensional histogram or scatter-plot; its representation is not particularly satisfactory, except for sparse data. If Z is an unknown (but single-valued) function of (X,Y), it can be displayed with a TProfile2D with better precision than by a scatter-plot. A TProfile2D displays the mean value of Z and its RMS for each cell in X, Y. The following shows the cumulated contents (capital letters) and the values displayed (small letters) of the elements for cell i,j.; When you fill a profile histogram with TProfile2D.Fill(x,y,z):. E[i,j] contains for each bin i,j the sum of the z values for this bin; L[i,j] contains the number of entries in the bin j; e[j] or s[j] will be the resulting error depending on the selected option. See “Build Options”. E[i,j] = sum z; L[i,j] = sum l; h[i,j] = H[i,j ] / L[i,j]; s[i,j] = sqrt[E[i,j] / L[i,j]- h[i,j]**2]; e[i,j] = s[i,j] / sqrt[L[i,j]]; In the special case where s[i,j] is zero, when there is only one entry per cell, e[i,j] is computed from the average of the s[i,j] for all cells. This approximation is used to keep the cell during a fit operation.

For creating un-binned data sets, a ROOT::Fit::UnBinData object, one has two possibilities: 1. Copy the data inside ROOT::Fit::UnBinData. One can create an empty UnBinData object, iterate on the data and add the data point one by one, or directly create the UnBinData object from a data iterator. In this case an input ROOT::Fit::DataRange object is passed in order to copy the data according to the given range. 2. Use ROOT::Fit::UnBinData as a wrapper to an external data storage. In this case the UnBinData object is created from an iterator or pointers to the data and the data are not copied inside. In this case the data cannot be selected according to a specified range. All the data points will be included in the fit.; The ROOT::Fit::UnBinData class supports also weighted data.

In the ROOT implementation, the function FCN is defined via the Minuit SetFCN member function when an histogram fitting is invoked. The value of FCN will in general depend on one or more variable parameters.; 5.9.2 The Transformation of Limited Parameters; For variable parameters with limits, Minuit uses the following transformation:; Pint = arcsin(2((Pext-a)/(b-a))-1); Pext = a+((b-a)/(2))(sinPint+1); so that the internal value Pint can take on any value, while the external value Pext can take on values only between the lower limit a and the ext upper limit b. Since the transformation is necessarily non-linear, it would transform a nice linear problem into a nasty non-linear one, which is the reason why limits should be avoided if not necessary. In addition, the transformation does require some computer time, so it slows down the computation a little bit, and more importantly, it introduces additional numerical inaccuracy into the problem in addition to what is introduced in the numerical calculation of the FCN value. The effects of non-linearity and numerical round off both become more important as the external value gets closer to one of the limits",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Users should however realize that the transformation is only a linear approximation, and that it cannot give a meaningful result if one or more parameters is very close to a limit, where \(\frac{\partial Pext}{\partial Pint} \neq 0\). Therefore, it is recommended that:. Limits on variable parameters should be used only when needed in order to prevent the parameter from taking on unphysical values; When a satisfactory minimum has been found using limits, the limits should then be removed if possible, in order to perform or re-perform the error analysis without limits. 5.9.3 How to Get the Right Answer from Minuit; Minuit offers the user a choice of several minimization algorithms. The MIGRAD algorithm is in general the best minimized for nearly all functions. It is a variable-metric method with inexact line search, a stable metric updating scheme, and checks for positive-definiteness. Its main weakness is that it depends heavily on knowledge of the first derivatives, and fails miserably if they are very inaccurate.; If parameter limits are needed, in spite of the side effects, then the user should be aware of the following techniques to alleviate problems caused by limits:; 5.9.3.1 Getting the Right Minimum with Limits; If MIGRAD converges normally to a point where no parameter is near one of its limits, then the existence of limits has probably not prevented Minuit from finding the right minimum. On the other hand, if one or more parameters is near its limit at the minimum, this may be because the true minimum is indeed at a limit, or it may be because the minimized has become ‘’blocked’’ at a limit. This may normally happen only if the parameter is so close to a limit (internal value at an odd multiple of \(\pm \frac{\pi}{2}\) that Minuit prints a warning to this effect when it prints the parameter values. The minimized can become blocked at a limit, because at a limit the derivative seen by the minimized \(\frac{\partial F}{\pa",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

For example, at initialization, these estimates are just the starting step sizes as specified by the user. After a HESSE step, the errors are usually quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. Minuit, when it prints out error values, also gives some indication of how reliable it thinks they are. For example, those marked CURRENT GUESS ERROR are only working values not to be believed, and APPROXIMATE ERROR means that they have been calculated but there is reason to believe that they may not be accurate.; If no mitigating adjective is given, then at least Minuit believes the errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that Minuit has been fooled. Some visible signs that Minuit may have been fooled:. Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis; Failure to find new minimum; Value of EDM too big (estimated Distance to Minimum); Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others; Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99). This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one which has been badly parameterized so that individual errors are not very meaningful because they are so highly correlated; Parameter at limit. This condition, signaled by a Minuit warning message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors unreliable. See the discussion above ‘Getting the right parameter errors with limits’. The best way to be absolutely sure of the errors is to use ‘’independent’’ calculations and compare them, or compare the calculated errors with a picture of the function.

The error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user must remove the under determinedness by reformulating the parameterization. Minuit cannot do this itself.; 5.9.4.3 Numerical Inaccuracies; It is possible that the apparent lack of positive-definiteness is due to excessive round off errors in numerical calculations (in the user function), or not enough precision.

If this is the case, then Minuit (or any other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely. The error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user must remove the under determinedness by reformulating the parameterization. Minuit cannot do this itself.; 5.9.4.3 Numerical Inaccuracies; It is possible that the apparent lack of positive-definiteness is due to excessive round off errors in numerical calculations (in the user function), or not enough precision. This is unlikely in general, but becomes more likely if the number of free parameters is very large, or if the parameters are badly scaled (not all of the same order of magnitude), and correlations are large. In any case, whether the non-positive-definiteness is real or only numerical is largely irrelevant, since in both cases the error matrix will be unreliable and the minimum suspicious.; 5.9.4.4 An Ill-posed Problem; For questions of parameter dependence, see the discussion above on positive-definiteness. Possible other mathematical problems are the following:. Excessive numerical round off - be especially careful of exponential and factorial functions which get big very quickly and lose accuracy.; Starting too far from the solution - the function may have unphysical local minima, especially at infinity in some variables. 5.10 Minuit2 Package; Minuit2 is a new object-oriented implementation, written in C++, of the popular MINUIT minimization package.

This chapter introduces you to some useful insights into C++, to allow you to use some of the most advanced features in ROOT. It is in no case a full course in C++.; 6.1 Classes, Methods and Constructors; C++ extends C with the notion of a class. If you’re used to structures in C, a class is a struct that is a group of related variables, which is extended with functions and routines specific to this structure (class). What is the interest? Consider a struct that is defined this way:; struct Line {; float x1;; float y1;; float x2;; float y2;; }; This structure represents a line to be drawn in a graphical window. (x1,y1) are the coordinates of the first point, (x2,y2) the coordinates of the second point. In the standard C, if you want to draw effectively such a line, you first have to define a structure and initialize the points (you can try this):; Line firstline;; firstline.x1 = 0.2;; firstline.y1 = 0.2;; firstline.x2 = 0.8;; firstline.y2 = 0.9;; This defines a line going from the point (0.2,0.2) to the point (0.8,0.9). To draw this line, you will have to write a function, say LineDraw(Line l) and call it with your object as argument:; LineDraw(firstline);; In C++, we would not do that. We would instead define a class like this:; class TLine {; Double_t x1;; Double_t y1;; Double_t x2;; Double_t y2;; TLine(int x1,",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Suppose we have an object l of type TLine and an object a of type TArrow. When you want to draw the line, you do:; l.Draw();; Draw() from TLine is called. If you do:; a.Draw();; Draw() from TArrow is called and the arrow a is drawn.; 6.2.2 Data Encapsulation; We have seen previously the keyword “public”. This keyword means that every name declared public is seen by the outside world. This is opposed to “private” that means only the class where the name was declared private could see this name. For example, suppose we declare in TArrow the variable ArrowHeadSize private.; private:; int ArrowHeadSize;; Then, only the methods (i.e. member functions) of TArrow will be able to access this variable. Nobody else will see it. Even the classes that we could derive from TArrow will not see it. On the other hand, if we declare the method Draw() as public, everybody will be able to see it and use it. You see that the character public or private does not depend of the type of argument. It can be a data member, a member function, or even a class. For example, in the case of TArrow, the base class TLine is declared as public:; class TArrow : public TLine { ...; This means that all methods of TArrow will be able to access all methods of TLine, but this will be also true for anybody in the outside world. Of course, this is true if TLine accepts the outside world to see its methods/data members. If something is declared private in TLine, nobody will see it, not even TArrow members, even if TLine is declared as a public base class.; What if TLine is declared “private” instead of “public” ? Well, it will behave as any other name declared private in TArrow: only the data members and methods of TArrow will be able to access TLine, its methods and data members, nobody else. This may seem a little bit confusing and readers should read a good C++ book if they want more details. Especially since, besides public and private, a member can",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The heap object will live until the delete operator is applied to it.; There is no FORTRAN parallel to a heap object; variables either come or go as control passes in and out of a function or subroutine, or, like a COMMON block variables, live for the lifetime of the program. However, most people in HEP who use FORTRAN will have experience of a memory manager and the act of creating a bank is a good equivalent of a heap object. For those who know systems like ZEBRA, it will come as a relief to learn that objects do not move, C++ does not garbage collect, so there is never a danger that a pointer to an object becomes invalid for that reason. However, having created an object, it is the user’s responsibility to ensure that it is deleted when no longer needed, or to pass that responsibility onto to some other object. Failing to do that will result in a memory leak, one of the most common and most hard-to-find C++ bugs.; To send a message to an object via a pointer to it, you need to use the “->” operator e.g.:; root[] my_objptr->Solve();; Although we chose to call our pointer my_objptr, to emphasize that it is a pointer, heap objects are so common in an object-oriented program that pointer names rarely reflect the fact - you have to be careful that you know if you are dealing with an object or its pointer! Fortunately, the compiler won’t tolerate an attempt to do something like:; root[] my_objptr.Solve();; As we have seen, heap objects have to be accessed via pointers, whereas stack objects can be accessed directly. They can also be accessed via pointers:; root[] Quad stack_quad(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *stack_ptr = &stack_quad;; root[] stack_ptr->Solve();; Here we have a Quad pointer that has been initialized with the address of a stack object.

You do not have to write a Makefile remembering the correct compiler options, and you do not have to exit ROOT.; 7.4.1 Usage; Before you can compile your interpreted script you need to add include statements for the classes used in the script. Once you did that, you can build and load a shared library containing your script. To load it use the command .L and append the file name with a +.; root[] .L MyScript.C+; The + option generates the shared library and names it by taking the name of the file “filename” but replacing the dot before the extension by an underscore and by adding the shared library extension for the current platform. For example on most platforms, hsimple.cxx will generate hsimple_cxx.so.; The + command rebuild the library only if the script or any of the files it includes are newer than the library. When checking the timestamp, ACLiC generates a dependency file which name is the same as the library name, just replacing the ‘so’ extension by the extension ‘d’. For example on most platforms, hsimple.cxx will generate hsimple_cxx.d.; To ensure that the shared library is rebuilt you can use the ++ syntax:; root[] .L MyScript.C++; To build, load, and execute the function with the same name as the file you can use the .x command. This is the same as executing a named script; you can also provide parameters. The only difference is you need to append a + or a ++.; root[] .x MyScript.C+(4000); Creating shared library /home/./MyScript_C.so; You can select whether the script in compiled with debug symbol or with optimization by appending the letter ‘g’ or ‘O’ after the ‘+’ or ‘++’.

See SetMakeSharedLib() for more information on those variables.

Plots and histograms are discussed in a chapter of their own.; 9.1 Drawing Objects; In ROOT, most objects derive from a base class TObject. This class has a virtual method Draw() so all objects are supposed to be able to be “drawn”. The basic whiteboard on which an object is drawn is called a canvas (defined by the class TCanvas). If several canvases are defined, there is only one active at a time. One draws an object in the active canvas by using the statement:; object.Draw(); This instructs the object “object” to draw itself. If no canvas is opened, a default one (named “c1”) is instantiated and is drawn.; root[] TLine a(0.1,0.1,0.6,0.6); root[] a.Draw(); <TCanvas::MakeDefCanvas>: created default TCanvas with name c1; The first statement defines a line and the second one draws it.

If you click on an axis, ROOT will ask the interpreter what are the methods of the TAxis and which ones are set for being displayed in a context menu.; Now, how does the interpreter know this? Remember, when you build a class that you want to use in the ROOT environment, you use rootcling that builds the so-called stub functions and the dictionary. These functions and the dictionary contain the knowledge of the used classes. To do this, rootcling parses all the header files. ROOT has defined some special syntax to inform Cling of certain things, this is done in the comments so that the code still compiles with a C++ compiler.; For example, you have a class with a Draw() method, which will display itself. You would like a context menu to appear when on clicks on the image of an object of this class. The recipe is the following:. The class has to contain the ClassDef/ClassImp macros; For each method you want to appear in the context menu, put a comment after the declaration containing *MENU* or *TOGGLE* depending on the behavior you expect. One usually uses Set methods (setters). The *TOGGLE* comment is used to toggle a boolean data field. In that case, it is safe to call the data field fMyBool where MyBool is the name of the setter SetMyBool. Replace MyBool with your own boolean variable.; You can specify arguments and the data members in which to store the arguments. For example:; class MyClass : public TObject {; private:; int fV1; // first variable; double fV2; // second variable; public:; int GetV1() {return fV1;}; double GetV2() {return fV2;}; void SetV1(int x1) { fV1 = x1;} // *MENU*; void SetV2(double d2) { fV2 = d2;} // *MENU*; void SetBoth(int x1, double d2) {fV1 = x1; fV2 = d2;}.

A pad (class TPad) is a graphical container in the sense it contains other graphical objects like histograms and arrows. It may contain other pads (sub-pads) as well. A Pad is a linked list of primitives of any type (graphs, histograms, shapes, tracks, etc.). It is a kind of display list. The pad display list. Drawing an object is nothing more than adding its pointer to this list. Look for example at the code of TH1::Draw(). It is merely ten lines of code. The last statement is AppendPad(). This statement calls method of TObject that just adds the pointer of the object, here a histogram, to the list of objects attached to the current pad. Since this is a TObject’s method, every object may be “drawn”, which means attached to a pad.; When is the painting done then ? The answer is: when needed. Every object that derives from TObject has a Paint() method. It may be empty, but for graphical objects, this routine contains all the instructions to paint effectively it in the active pad. Since a Pad has the list of objects it owns, it will call successively the Paint() method of each object, thus re-painting the whole pad on the screen. If the object is a sub-pad, its Paint() method will call the Paint() method of the objects attached, recursively calling Paint() for all the objects. Pad painting. In some cases a pad need to be painted during a macro execution. To force the pad painting gPad->Update() (see next section) should be performed.; The list of primitives stored in the pad is also used to pick objects and to interact with them.; 9.3.1 The Global Pad: gPad; When an object is drawn, it is always in the so-called active pad. For every day use, it is comfortable to be able to access the active pad, whatever it is. For that purpose, there is a global pointer, called gPad. It is always pointing to the active pad.

The attributes of the outline line and of the fill area are described in “Graphical Objects Attributes”; 9.4.4 Markers; A marker is a point with a fancy shape! The possible markers are shown in the next figure. Markers. The marker constructor is:; TMarker(Double_t x,Double_t y,Int_t marker); The parameters x and y are the marker coordinates and marker is the marker type, shown in the previous figure. Suppose the pointer ma is a valid marker. The marker size is set via ma->SetMarkerSize(size), where size is the desired size. Note, that the marker types 1, 6 and 7 (the dots) cannot be scaled. They are always drawn with the same number of pixels. SetMarkerSize does not apply on them. To have a “scalable dot” a circle shape should be used instead, for example, the marker type 20. The default marker type is 1, if SetMarkerStyle is not specified. It is the most common one to draw scatter plots. Different marker sizes. Different marker sizes. The user interface for changing the marker color, style and size looks like shown in this picture. It takes place in the editor frame anytime the selected object inherits the class TAttMarker.; Non-symmetric symbols should be used carefully in plotting. The next two graphs show how the misleading a careless use of symbols can be. The two plots represent the same data sets but because of a bad symbol choice, the two on the top appear further apart from the next example. The use of non-symmetric markers. A TPolyMaker is defined by an array on N points in a 2D space. At each point x[i], y[i] a marker is drawn. The list of marker types is shown in the previous paragraph. The marker attributes are managed by the class TAttMarker and are described in “Graphical Objects Attributes”. The TPolyMarker constructor is:; TPolyMarker(Int_t n,Double_t *x,Double_t *y,Option_t *option); Where x and y are arrays of coordinates for the n points that form the poly-marker.; 9.4.5 Curly and Wavy Lines for Feynman Diagrams; This is a peculiarity of particl",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The font IDs must be between 1 and 14. The precision can be:. Precision = 0 fast hardware fonts (steps in the size); Precision = 1 scalable and rotate-able hardware fonts (see below); Precision = 2 scalable and rotate-able hardware fonts. When precision 0 is used, only the original non-scaled system fonts are used. The fonts have a minimum (4) and maximum (37) size in pixels. These fonts are fast and are of good quality. Their size varies with large steps and they cannot be rotated. Precision 1 and 2 fonts have a different behavior depending if True Type Fonts (TTF) are used or not. If TTF are used, you always get very good quality scalable and rotate-able fonts. However, TTF are slow. Precision 1 and 2 fonts have a different behavior for PostScript in case of TLatex objects:. With precision 1, the PostScript text uses the old convention (see TPostScript) for some special characters to draw sub and superscripts or Greek text.; With precision 2, the “PostScript” special characters are drawn as such.

The color numbers specified in the basic palette, and the picture above, can be viewed by selecting the menu entry Colors in the View canvas menu. The user may define other colors. To do this, one has to build a new TColor:; TColor(Int_t color,Float_t r,Float_t g,Float_t b,const char* name); One has to give the color number and the three Red, Green, Blue values, each being defined from 0 (min) to 1(max). An optional name may be given. When built, this color is automatically added to the existing list of colors. If the color number already exists, one has to extract it from the list and redefine the RGB values. This may be done for example with:; root[] color=(TColor*)(gROOT->GetListOfColors()->At(index_color)); root[] color->SetRGB(r,g,b); Where r, g and b go from 0 to 1 and index_color is the color number you wish to change.; The user interface for changing the fill color and style looks like shown in this picture.

For example, TH1::Draw(""col"") draws a 2-D histogram with cells represented by a box filled with a color CI function of the cell content. If the cell content is N, the color CI used will be the color number in colors[N]. If the maximum cell content is >ncolors, all cell contents are scaled to ncolors. The current color palette does not have a class or global object of its own. It is defined in the current style as an array of color numbers. The current palette can be changed with:; TStyle::SetPalette(Int_t ncolors,Int_t*color_indexes).; By default, or if ncolors <= 0, a default palette (see above) of 50 colors is defined.

CMY and CMYK models are subtractive color models unlike RGB which is an additive. They are mainly used for printing purposes. CMY means Cyan Magenta Yellow to convert RGB to CMY it is enough to do: C=1-R, M=1-G and Y=1-B. CMYK has one more component K (black). The conversion from RGB to CMYK is:; Double_t Black = TMath::Min(TMath::Min(1-Red,1-Green),1-Blue);; Double_t Cyan = (1-Red-Black)/(1-Black);; Double_t Magenta = (1-Green-Black)/(1-Black);; Double_t Yellow = (1-Blue-Black)/(1-Black);; CMYK add the black component which allows to have a better quality for black printing. TPostScript (and TPDF) support the CMYK model. To change the color model use:; gStyle->SetColorModelPS(c);. c = 0 means TPostScript will use RGB color model (default); c = 1 means TPostScript will use CMYK color model. 9.11 The PDF Interface; Like PostScript, PDF is a vector graphics output format allowing a very high graphics output quality. The functionalities provided by this class are very similar to those provided by TPostScript.; Compare to PostScript output, the PDF files are usually smaller because some parts of them can be compressed.; PDF also allows to define table of contents.

Many users will be able to take advantage of hardware acceleration of the underlying OpenGL commands by their computer’s video card, resulting is considerable performance gains - up to interactive manipulation of 1000’s of complex shapes in real-time.; The GL Viewer is supported on all official ROOT platforms (assuming you have suitable <OpenGL®> libraries), and is the main 3D viewer, which development effort is concentrated upon. As OpenGL® is a trademark we refer to our viewer built on this technology as the ‘GL Viewer’. The code for it can be found under $ROOTSYS/gl. The GL 3D Viewer. You can manipulate the viewer via the GUI or via the base TGLViewer object behind the interface. These are detailed below - see also $ROOTSYS/tutorials/gl/glViewerExercise.C.; 9.13.2.1 Projections Modes (Cameras); The GL Viewer supports two basic types of camera, which affect how the 3D world is projected onto the 2D render area:. Perspective: Objects are drawn with characteristic ‘foreshortening’ effect, where distant objects appear smaller than near ones. This is useful for obtaining a ‘real world’ views. The degree of foreshortening is affected by the current camera field of view (focal length of its ‘lens’) - see “Adjusting Cameras”.; Orthographic: Distance from camera does not affect object size. These projections are useful for measurement or checking alignments, as the sizes and angles between objects are preserved. You can select the active camera from the viewer’s Camera menu on the top menu bar. There are three perspective camera choices:.

Orthographic projections are generally constrained to look down one of the global axes of the world, with the other two axes lying horizontal/vertical on the viewer window. Therefore, XOY has the X-axis horizontal, the Y-axis vertical. You can always confirm the orientation and constraints of the camera in the world by enabling axis drawing in the “Guides” tab - see sections “Guides” and “Clipping” below.

Others always require a tessellation description based on TBuffer3D’s kRaw / kRawSizes points/lines/segments sections.; Some need the 3D object positions in the master (world) frame, others can cope with local frames and a translation matrix to place the object.; Some require bounding boxes for objects - others do not. Similarly some viewer clients are only capable of providing positions in master frame, cannot provide bounding boxes etc. Additionally we do not want to incur the cost of expensive tessellation operations if the viewer does not require them.

If repeated addition of the same fID is found, the shape is cached already - and the costly tessellation does not need to be sent again. The viewer can also perform internal GL specific caching (display lists) with considerable performance gains in these cases. For this to work correctly the logical object in must be described in TBuffer3D in the local reference frame, complete with the local/master translation. In some cases you will not have a real object you can reasonably set TBuffer3D::fID to, or the object is recycled or temporary. To suppress internal caching in the GL Viewer in these cases, set TBuffer3D::fID to 0 (null).; The viewer indicates it can support local frame objects through the TVirtualViewer3D interface method: PreferLocalFrame().

To decompose the parent classes, the Streamercalls the Streamerof the parent classes. It moves up the inheritance tree until it reaches an ancestor without a parent. To serialize the object data members it calls their Streamer. They in turn move up their own inheritance tree and so forth. The simple data members are written to the buffer directly. Eventually the buffer contains all simple data members of all the classes that make up this particular object. Data members that are references (as MyClass &fObj;) are never saved, it is always the responsibility of the object’s constructor to set them properly.; 11.3.1 Automatically Generated Streamers; A Streamerusually calls other Streamers: the Streamerof its parents and data members. This architecture depends on all classes having Streamers, because eventually they will be called. To ensure that a class has a Streamer, rootcling automatically creates one in the ClassDef macro that is defined in $ROOTSYS/include/Rtypes.h.

This only makes sense for object data members. For example:; EventHeader fEvtHdr; //|| do not split the header; 11.3.7 Streamers with Special Additions; Most of the time you can let rootcling generate a Streamer for you. However if you want to write your own Streameryou can do so. For some classes, it may be necessary to execute some code before or after the read or write block in the automatic Streamer. For example after the execution of the read block, one can initialize some non persistent members. There are two reasons why you would need to write your own Streamer: 1) if you have a non-persistent data member that you want to initialize to a value depending on the read data members; 2) if you want or need to handle the schema evolution on your own. Note that an alternative for those cases is to consider write a schema evolution rule.; First, you need to tell rootcling not to build a Streamerfor you. The input to the rootcling command (in the makefile) is a list of classes in a LinkDef.h file. For example, the list of classes for Event is listed in $ROOTSYS/test/EventLinkDef.h. The “-” at the end of the class name tells rootcling not to generate a Streamer. In the example, you can see the Event class is the only one for which rootcling is instructed not to generate a Streamer.; #ifdef __ROOTCLING__. #pragma link off all globals;; #pragma link off all classes;; #pragma link off all functions;; #pragma link C++ class EventHeader+;; #pragma link C++ class Event-;; #pragma link C++ class HistogramManager+;; #pragma link C++ class Track+;. #endif; #pragma link C++ class EventHeader+;; The “+” sign tells rootcl",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

The optimized Bar StreamerInfo is going to be used to read the TClonesArray in T1. The result will be Bar objects with data member values not in the right sequence. The solution to this problem is to call BypassStreamer(kFALSE) for the TClonesArray. In this case, the normal Bar::Streamer function will be called. The Bar::Streamer function works OK independently if the Bar StreamerInfohad been generated in optimized mode or not.; 11.4 Pointers and References in Persistency; An object pointer as a data member presents a challenge to the streaming software. If the object pointed to is saved every time, it could create circular dependencies and consume a large amount of disk space. The network of references must be preserved on disk and recreated upon reading the file.; If you use independent I/O operations for pointers and their referenced objects you can use the TRef class. Later in this section is an example that compares disk space, memory usage, and I/O times of C++ pointers and TRefs. In general, a TRef is faster than C++ but the advantage of a C++ pointer is that it is already C++.; 11.4.1 Streaming C++ Pointers; When ROOT encounters a pointer data member it calls the Streamer of the object and labels it with a unique object identifier. The object identifier is unique for one I/O operation. If there is another pointer to the object in the same I/O operation, the first object is referenced i.e. it is not saved again.

When reading an object from a file, the system uses the StreamerInfo list to decode an object into the current version. The StreamerInfo is made up of TStreamerElements . Each describes one persistent data member of the class. By default, all data members of a class are persistent. To exclude a data member (i.e. make it not persistent), add a “!” after the comment marks. For example the pointer *fPainter of a TH1 is not persistent:; TVirtualHistPainter* fPainter //!pointer to histogram painter; 11.5.2 The TStreamerElement Class; A TStreamerElement describes a data member of a simple type, object, array, pointer, or container. The offset in the TStreamerElement is the starting address of the data for that data member.; BASE TNamed offset= 0 type=67 The basis for a named object; BASE TAttLine offset= 28 type= 0 Line attributes; In this example, the TNamed data starts at byte 0, and TAttLine starts at byte 28. The offset is machine and compiler dependent and is computed when the StreamerInfo is analyzed. The types are defined in the file TStreamerInfo.h and listed here:; enum EReadWrite {; kBase=0, kChar=1,kShort=2,kInt=3,kLong=4,; kFloat=5, kCounter=6,kCharStar=7, kDouble=8,kUChar=11,; kUShort=12, kUInt=13,kULong=14,kBits=15,kOffsetL=20,; kOffsetP=40, kObject=61,kAny=62,kObjectp=63,kObjectP=64,; kTString=65, kTObject=66,kTNamed=67,kSkip=100,kSkipL=120,; kSkipP=140, kConv=200, kConvL=220,kConvP=240,kStreamer=500,; kStreamLoop=501, kMissing=99999; };; The method TClass::GetStreamerInfo analyzes the StreamerInfo the same way it would be analyzed by referring to the class. While analyzing the StreamerInfo, it computes the offsets. The type field is the type of the TStreamerElement. It is specific to the StreamerInfo definition.; 11.5.3 Example: TH1 StreamerInfo; In the StreamerInfo of the TH1 class we see the four base classes: TNamed, TAttLine, TAttFill, andTAttMarker.

The reason can be that this class has no data members worth saving or all real info is in the base classes. The version number is written to the file in the Streamer by the call TBuffer::WriteVersion. You, as the designer of the class, do not need to do any manual modification in the Streamer. ROOT schema evolution mechanism is automatic and handled by the StreamerInfo.; 11.5.6 Manual Data Model Evolution Capabilities; The automatic data model schema evolution implemented in ROOT makes it possible to read back the serialized data object in the situation when the definition of the classes those objects represent changed slightly (some of the data members were removed or some new ones added). It is also possible to manually specify the rules for more sophisticated data transformations done while reading to load the serialized objects into data structures that changed quite significantly.; ROOT provides two interface enabling users to specify the conversion rules. The first way is to define a rule in the dictionary file and the second way is to insert it to the TClass object using the C++ API.; There are two types of conversion rules. The first of them, the normal rules, are the ones that should be used in the most of the cases. They provide a buffered input data and an address of the in-memory target object and allow user to specify the conversion function mapping the data being read to the output format. The second type of the rules, the raw rules, also provide the pointer to the target object but the input is a raw TBuffer object containing the input data member declared as an input to the rule. This type of a rule is provided mainly to handle the file format changes that couldn’t have been handled otherwise and in general should not be used unless there is no other option.; 11.5.6.1 The dictionaries; The most convenient place to specify the conversion rules is a dictionary.

The time to uncompress an object is small compared to the compression time and is independent of the selected compression level. Note that the compression level may be changed at any time, but the new compression level will only apply to newly written objects. Consequently, a ROOT file may contain objects with different compression levels. This table shows four runs of the demo script that creates 15 histograms with different compression parameters. To make the numbers more significant, the macro was modified to create 1000 histograms. We have included two more examples to show the impact of compression on Trees in the next chapter.; 11.6.1 Using the General Open Function of TFile; To make life simple we provide a general function to open any type of file (except shared memory files of class TMapFile). This functionality is provided by the static TFile::Open() function:; TFile *TFile::Open(const Text_t *name,Option_t *option="""",; const Text_t *title="""",Int_t compress,Int_t netopt); Depending on the name argument, the function returns a TFile or one of its derivations, for example a TNetXNGFile or a TDavixFile object. In case a URL specifies a local file, a TFile object will be returned (and of course no login information is needed). The arguments of the Open() function are the same as the ones for the TFile constructor.; Using ReOpen() method it is possible to reopen a file with a different access mode, like from READ to UPDATE or from NEW, CREATE, RECREATE, UPDATE to READ. Thus the mode argument can be either “READ” or “UPDATE”.

Each example has a named script in the $ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree directory. They are called tree1.C to tree4.C. The examples are:. tree1.C: a tree with several simple (integers and floating point) variables.; tree2.C: a tree built from a C structure (struct). This example uses the Geant3 C wrapper as an example of a FORTRAN common block ported to C with a C structure.; tree3.C: in this example, we will show how to extend a tree with a branch from another tree with the Friends feature. These trees have branches with variable length arrays. Each entry has a variable number of tracks, and each track has several variables.; tree4.C: a tree with a class (Event). The class Event is defined in $ROOTSYS/test. In this example we first encounter the impact of splitting a branch. Each script contains the main function, with the same name as the file (i.e. tree1), the function to write - tree1w, and the function to read - tree1r. If the script is not run in batch mode, it displays the tree in the browser and tree viewer. To study the example scripts, you can either execute the main script, or load the script and execute a specific function.

They use the human ability to spot un-symmetry. Example of spider plot. Variables are represented on individual axes displayed along a circle. For each variable the minimum value sits on the circle’s center, and the maximum on the circle’s radius. Spider plots are not suitable for an accurate graph reading since, by their nature, it can be difficult to read out very detailed values, but they give quickly a global view of an event in order to compare it with the others. In ROOT the spider plot facility is accessed from the tree viewer GUI. The variables to be visualized are selected in the tree viewer and can be scanned using the spider plot button. The tree viewer Graphical User Interface and the Spider Plot Editor. The spider plot graphics editor provides two tabs to interact with the spider plots’ output: the tab “Style” defining the spider layout and the tab “Browse” to navigate in the tree.; 12.20.8.2 Parallel Coordinates Plots. The Parallel Coordinates Plots are a common way of studying and visualizing multiple variables data sets. They were proposed by in A.Inselberg in 1981 as a new way to represent multi-dimensional information. In traditional Cartesian coordinates, axes are mutually perpendicular. In Parallel coordinates, all axes are parallel which allows representing data in much more than three dimensions. To show a set of points in Parallel Coordinates, a set of parallel lines is drawn, typically vertical and equally spaced. A point in n-dimensional space is represented as a polyline with vertices on the parallel axes. The position of the vertex on the i-th axis corresponds to the i-th coordinate of the point.

Output of nt->Draw(“x:y:z”) and nt->Draw(“u:v:w”) after applying the selection. Another technique has been implemented in order to show clusters when the picture is cluttered. A weight is assigned to each event. The weight value is computed as: \[; weight = \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i; \]; Where:. bi is the content of bin crossed by the event on the i-th axis.; n is the number of axis. The events having the bigger weights are those belonging to clusters. It is possible to paint only the events having a weight above a given value and the clusters appear. The next example “weight cut” applied on the right plot is 50. Only the events with a weight greater than 50 are displayed. Applying a “weight cut” makes the clusters visible. In case only a few events are displayed, drawing them as smooth curves instead of straight lines helps to differentiate them. Zoom on a Parallel Coordinates plot detail: curves differentiate better events. Interactivity and therefore the Graphical User Interface are very important to manipulate the Parallel Coordinates plots. The ROOT framework allows to easily implement the direct interactions on the graphical area and the graphical editor facility provides dedicated GUI. Parallel Coordinates graphical editors. Transparency is very useful with parallel coordinates plots. It allows to show clearly the clusters. . Parallel Coordinates with transparency. 12.20.8.3 Box (Candle) Plots; ; A Box Plot (also known as a “box-and whisker” plot or “candle stick” plot) is a convenient way to describe graphically a data distribution (D) with only the five numbers.

The minimum value of the distribution D (Min).; The lower quartile (Q1): 25% of the data points in D are less than Q1.; The median (M): 50% of the data points in D are less than M.; The upper quartile (Q3): 75% of the data points in D are less than Q3.; The maximum value of the distribution D (Max).

This allows you to project two Trees with different attributes into the same picture. You can call the method TTree::UseCurrentStyle to change the histogram to use the current style gStyle. See ""Graphics and the Graphical User Interface.; The binning of the newly created histogram can be specified in two ways. You can set a default in the .rootrc and/or you can add the binning information in the TTree::Draw command.; To set number of bins default for the 1-D, 2-D, 3-D histograms can be specified in the .rootrc file via the environment variables, e.g.:; # default binnings Hist.Binning.1D.x: 100.

In non-split mode, the full event must be read in memory. The times reported in the table correspond to complete I/O operations necessary to deal with machine independent binary files. On Linux, this also includes byte-swapping operations. The ROOT file allows for direct access to any event in the file and direct access to any part of an event when split=1.; Note also that the uncompressed file generated with split=0 is 48.7 Mbytes and only 47.17 Mbytes for the option split=1. The difference in size is due to the object identification mechanism overhead when the event is written to a single buffer. This overhead does not exist in split mode because the branch buffers are optimized for homogeneous data types. You can run the test programs on your architecture. The program Event will report the write performance. You can measure the read performance by executing the scripts eventa and eventb. The performance depends not only of the processor type, but also of the disk devices (local, NFS, AFS, etc.).; 12.24 Chains. A TChain object is a list of ROOT files containing the same tree. As an example, assume we have three files called file1.root, file2.root, file3.root. Each file contains one tree called “T”. We can create a chain with the following statements:; TChain chain(""T""); // name of the tree is the argument; chain.Add(""file1.root"");; chain.Add(""file2.root"");; chain.Add(""file3.root"");; The name of the TChain will be the same as the name of the tree; in this case it will be ""T"". Note that twoobjects can have the same name as long as they are not histograms in the same directory, because there, the histogram names are used to build a hash table. The class TChain is derived from the class TTree. For example, to generate a histogram corresponding to the attribute “x” in tree “T” by processing sequentially the three files of this chain, we can use the TChain::Draw method.; chain.Draw(""x"");; When using a TChain, the branch address",MatchSource.WIKI,root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

When a chain is deleted, its friend elements are also deleted. The number of entries in the friend must be equal or greater to the number of entries of the original chain. If the friend has fewer entries a warning is given and the resulting histogram will have missing entries. For additional information see TTree::AddFriends(). A full example of a tree and friends is in Example #3 ($ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/tree3.C) in the Trees section above.; 13 Math Libraries in ROOT; The aim of Math libraries in ROOT is to provide and to support a coherent set of mathematical and statistical functions. The latest developments have been concentrated in providing first versions of the MathCore and MathMore libraries, included in ROOT v5.08. Other recent developments include the new version of MINUIT, which has been re-designed and re-implemented in the C++ language. It is integrated in ROOT. In addition, an optimized package for describing small matrices and vector with fixed sizes and their operation has been developed (SMatrix). The structure is shown in the following picture. Math libraries and packages. 13.1 MathCore Library; MathCore provides a collection of functions and C++ classes for numerical computing.

PDF, CDF and quantiles in the case of the normal distribution. 13.6 Numerical Algorithms; ROOT provides C++ classes implementing numerical algorithms to solve a wide set of problem, like:. Evaluation of function derivatives.; Evaluation of integrals.; Finding the roots of a function; Finding the minimum/maximum of a function. In order to use these algorithm the user needs to provide a function. ROOT provides a common way of specifying them via some interfaces; 13.7 ROOT::Math Function interfaces; To get a consistency in the mathematical methods within ROOT, there exists a set of interfaces to define the basic behaviour of a mathematical function. In order to use the classes presented in this chapter, the mathematical functions defined by the user must inherit from any of the classes seen in the figure:. ROOT::Math Function interface structure. 13.7.1 One-dimensional Function Interfaces; These interfaces are used for numerical algorithms operating only on one-dimensional functions and cannot be applied to multi-dimensional functions. For this case the users needs to define a function object which evaluates in one dimension, and the object will have to derivate from the following:. ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDim: This class is the most basic function. Provides a method to evaluate the function given a value (simple double) by implementing double operator() (const double ). The user class defined only needs to reimplement the pure abstract method double DoEval(double x), that will do the work of evaluating the function at point x. Example on how to create a class that represents a mathematical function. The user only has to override two methods from IBaseFunctionOneDim:; #include ""Math/IFunction.h"". class MyFunction: public ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDim; {; double DoEval(double x) const; {; return x*x;; }.
