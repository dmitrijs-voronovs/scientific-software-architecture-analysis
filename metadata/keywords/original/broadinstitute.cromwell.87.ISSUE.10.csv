https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5790:1108,Availability,failure,failure,1108,"Cromwell has a system for adjusting boot disk sizes that is intended to account for large Docker images that would otherwise overflow the boot disk at its default size. However it seems this system is often not preventing boot disks from overflowing: we have received a number of reports recently of users having to explicitly set runtime attributes for boot disk size because this automatic system did not sufficiently increase the boot disk size. Furthermore a review of the ""compression factor"" used for this boot disk size adjustment system revealed that the default compression factor appears to be much larger than actual compression factors seen in Docker images commonly used in Cromwell (cloud-sdk, gatk, etc). i.e. the current model of boot disk size adjustment does not appear to line up well with actual observed boot disk size behavior. This PR changes the way boot disk size adjustment is done to use a more realistic compression factor (3.0 vs 6.0), and instead *adds* the estimated uncompressed Docker image sizes to the default boot disk size. This should yield consistently larger and less failure prone boot disk sizes with scaling behavior that should hopefully better align with real world Docker images.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5790

The shared filesystem section talks about the localization strategies for inputs, which is certainly an issue, but the outputs are not mentioned. Let's say I have several nodes in a cluster and a single shared volume between them, either physical or software one (like Lustre). I am using Slurm backend and any node can end up running any task based on internal Slurm scheduling. Ideally I would want each task to copy the inputs from the shared volume to a local folder, create outputs, and then copy outputs to the shared volume. I know one can output final outputs anywhere, but how can one control what happens to intermediate files? The problem would arise if the subsequent tasks in the workflow are done on different nodes, but is enforcing (one node)/(one wf execution) even possible? Even if it is it beats the point of scheduling resources by availability. The solution I can see is running Cromwell FROM the shared volume, but then everything would happen there and tiny inputs and outputs would choke the job and possibly cause wear on hardware. Unless I can set a temp directory while the outputs are written?. I am asking because I am not experienced and would like to know if there are solutions I am missing before I end up doing development on my own. ; Thanks!",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5802

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5802:1027,Energy Efficiency,schedul,scheduling,1027,"I am reading your tutorial on [HPC](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/HPC/#:~:text=FileSystems-,Shared%20FileSystem,providers.) and I have a question that could be very uneducated. The shared filesystem section talks about the localization strategies for inputs, which is certainly an issue, but the outputs are not mentioned. Let's say I have several nodes in a cluster and a single shared volume between them, either physical or software one (like Lustre). I am using Slurm backend and any node can end up running any task based on internal Slurm scheduling. Ideally I would want each task to copy the inputs from the shared volume to a local folder, create outputs, and then copy outputs to the shared volume. I know one can output final outputs anywhere, but how can one control what happens to intermediate files? The problem would arise if the subsequent tasks in the workflow are done on different nodes, but is enforcing (one node)/(one wf execution) even possible?

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5815:593,Usability,simpl,simple,593,"Tested with Cromwell 52, 53. `memory-retry` does not work as expected. First of all it's activated only when `continueOnReturnCode` is set as `true` or list of some return codes.; I think this is intended as described in the documentation but why?. This is very weird. In most cases, return code of OOM is just 137.; Why don't we have something like `memoryRetryReturnCode`. I think it's too dangerous too set `continueOnReturnCode` as `true`.; Cromwell will pass any failure in all tasks.; So I set it as `[0, 137]` to catch `SIGKILL` due to OOM.; I also tried with `true` though. Here is my simple OOM tester WDL. I tested it with PAPIv2 beta based on Life Sciences API. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow mem_retry {; call fail_oom; }. task fail_oom {; command {; set -e; # This one-liner triggers OOM and hence 137 (SIGKILL); # https://askubuntu.com/a/823798; tail /dev/zero # <====== This WDL works fine without this line; }; runtime {; cpu: 1; memory: ""2 GB""; docker: ""ubuntu:latest""; continueOnReturnCode: [0, 137]; }; }; ```. Google backend (PAPI2 beta) in `backend.conf`, ; ```; config {; memory-retry {; error-keys = [""OutOfMemoryError"", ""Killed""]; multiplier = 1.5; }; }; ```. STDERR of task:; ```; $ gsutil cat gs://encode-pipeline-test-runs/caper_out_10/mem_retry/87492280-9828-4afa-b53e-bec675103c42/call-fail_oom/stderr; /cromwell_root/script: line 28: 17 Killed tail /dev/zero; ```.
