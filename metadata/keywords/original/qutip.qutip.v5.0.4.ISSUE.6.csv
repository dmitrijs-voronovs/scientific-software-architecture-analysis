Added functions `run_mixed` to the MCSolver and NonMarkovianMCSolver classes. Instead of an initial pure state, these functions take either a density matrix or a list of `(psi_i, p_i)` where `psi_i` are pure initial states and `p_i` are the weights for the average over the initial states. In the latter case, the `ntraj` parameter can be a list specifying the number of trajectories to be used for each initial state. The trajectories automatically obtain correction weights if the fraction of trajectories starting in `psi_i` does not match `p_i`. The functions `mcsolve` and `nm_mcsolve` take either a pure state or a density matrix as the initial state, and call either `run` or `run_mixed` of the solver, respectively. The stochastic solvers also inherit the `run_mixed` functions, but I don't know if there is any use case for that. The most complicated issue here was the combination of a mixed initial state with ""improved sampling"". In this case, run_mixed first runs the no-jump trajectories for all initial states (potentially using `parallel_map` etc) and then runs all other trajectories (using `parallel_map` again, this means that there are two progress bars...). **Todo**; - [X] Please add tests to cover your changes if applicable.; - [x] If the behavior of the code has changed or new feature has been added, please also update the documentation in the `doc` folder, and the [notebook](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-tutorials).

After spending some time, I believe the main key difference between both versions comes from permutation done in the `_permute_rcm`, where indices are permuted with the indices obtained from the `reverse_cuthill_mckee` function, and this prevents us from getting the preconditioner efficiently. In `v5.0`, for permuting, we use `_data.permute.indices` for the Liouvillian matrix `L`. This gives us different results from what we used in `v4.7`, i.e.,`sp_permute` with the same permuting indices. . As per my understanding, `_data.permute.indices` performs somewhat the following - ; ``` py; A = L.copy(); A.indices = perm.take(A.indices); A = A.tocsc(A); A.indices = perm.take(A.indices); ```; where, we previously, the following was being done; ``` py; L[perm[:,None], perm]; ```; with `perm` are obtained from `reverse_cuthill_mckee`. . I am not sure which behavior is the correct one, but the performance degradation is quite a lot (more than 10x) and prevents reaching sufficient enough tolerance. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import numpy as np; from qutip import (about, destroy, qeye, steadystate, tensor). # Paramaeters; # -----------; Nc, Nm = 4, 30; E, kappa = 0.1, 0.3; gamma, delta = 3e-4, -0.43. # Operators; # ----------; a = tensor(destroy(Nc), qeye(Nm)); b = tensor(qeye(Nc), destroy(Nm)). # Hamiltonian; # ------------; H = -delta * (a.dag() * a) + (b.dag() * b) + 2.4 * kappa * (b.dag() + b) * (a.dag() * a) + E * (a.dag() + a). # Collapse operators; # -------------------; cc = np.sqrt(kappa) * a; cm = np.sqrt(2 * gamma) * b; cp = np.sqrt(gamma) * b.dag(); c_ops = [cc, cm, cp]. precond_options = {'permc_spec': 'NATURAL', 'diag_pivot_thresh': 0.1, 'fill_factor': 100, 'options': {'ILU_MILU': 'smilu_2'}}; solver_options = {""use_precond"": False, ""atol"": 1e-10, **precond_options}. rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops, method=""direct"", solver=""gmres"", use_rcm=True, **solver_options); ```. ### C",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2443

I've noticed there's a significant slowdown in executing the same codes for obtaining `steadystate` solutions in `v4.7` vs `v5.0` with iterative scipy solvers, especially while using `use_rcm=True`. After spending some time, I believe the main key difference between both versions comes from permutation done in the `_permute_rcm`, where indices are permuted with the indices obtained from the `reverse_cuthill_mckee` function, and this prevents us from getting the preconditioner efficiently. In `v5.0`, for permuting, we use `_data.permute.indices` for the Liouvillian matrix `L`. This gives us different results from what we used in `v4.7`, i.e.,`sp_permute` with the same permuting indices. . As per my understanding, `_data.permute.indices` performs somewhat the following - ; ``` py; A = L.copy(); A.indices = perm.take(A.indices); A = A.tocsc(A); A.indices = perm.take(A.indices); ```; where, we previously, the following was being done; ``` py; L[perm[:,None], perm]; ```; with `perm` are obtained from `reverse_cuthill_mckee`. .

The marginal / trace would stay in the trajectory, but not merging those with weight feel simpler to me. @pmenczel ; This PR larger than I expected, do you want me to break it into smaller ones for review or are you fine like this.; What do you think about splitting the no-jump / abs traj from the normal ones?; What about having the weights in the `add` instead of the trajectories?",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2455

Perhaps since ""jupyterlab"" was introduced. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import qutip as qt; import numpy as np; qt.mcsolve(qt.sigmax(), state=qt.basis(2, 0), tlist=np.linspace(0, 5, 100), c_ops=[qt.sigmam()], ntraj=100, options={'progress_bar': 'html'}); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; [[ empty progress bar ]]; Javascript Error: $ is not defined; Javascript Error: $ is not defined; Javascript Error: $ is not defined; Javascript Error: $ is not defined; ...; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. There should be no error and the progress bar should display the progress. ### Your Environment. ```shell; ""About Jupyter Notebook"" shows version 7.2.1.

TypeError: Qobj.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'inpt'; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. If I hover on `qt.Qobj` in VS Code, the signature actually shows `inpt` and not `arg`. It seems like there is some inconsistency in the name of this keyword? No error is expected. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python; ================================; Copyright (c) QuTiP team 2011 and later.; Current admin team: Alexander Pitchford, Nathan Shammah, Shahnawaz Ahmed, Neill Lambert, Eric Giguère, Boxi Li, Jake Lishman, Simon Cross and Asier Galicia.; Board members: Daniel Burgarth, Robert Johansson, Anton F.

It seems like there is some inconsistency in the name of this keyword?

In my opinion the use of `qset.openmp_thresh` in `qobjevo.py`. if all(qset.openmp_thresh < nz for nz in nnz):; omp = 0. is wrong. Like this, if all the `nz` in `nnz` are larger than the threshold, the OpenMP will be disabled, ; which is not compatible with the documentation. Shouldn't it be rather a `>` ?; With this code, I have to set `openmp_thresh` in `~/.qutip/qutiprc` larger than the smallest `nz` in `nnz`; to enable OpenMP. And then it works like a charm ;-). ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. _No response_. ### Code Output. _No response_. ### Expected Behaviour.

Some the the `??solve` functions inconsistent signature:; Almost all of them start with `H, state0, tlist`, the collapse if used, expectation, `args` and finally options. But ; - For `brmesolve`, `c_ops` comes after `e_ops`.; - For HEOM: the bath is between the Hamiltonian and the initial state.; - Stochastic solver have `e_ops` `options` and `args` as keyword only.; - `ntraj` is positional for `mcsolve`, but keyword only for stochastic solver.; - Solver specific parameters are between `e_ops` and `args` for floquet, between `args` and `options` for bloch redfield and after `sc_ops` in stochastic. ### Proposed Solution. Make `e_ops`, `args`, `options` and `ntraj` keyword only from 5.3, with a warning message from 5.1. This would make is all signatures, except HEOM, match. For HEOM, the `bath` and `max_depth` should be swapped for the `state` and `tlist`. ### Alternate Solutions. _No response_. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2489

So I want to use the displacement operator to displace the annihilation operator by 1, so I tried to define my displacement operator, and unitary transform the annihilation operator. I want to compare the result with that of directly adding 1 to the annihilation operator by looking at their trace distance, which is supposed to be 0. However, the result is 5... I don't know where it goes run, and just wonder if anyone knows what's going on?. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import *. dim = 10. # Create and destroy operators; a = destroy(dim); D = (a.dag() - a).expm(). # Displaced annihilation operator; a_displaced = D.dag() * a * D. # Check trace distance between the displaced operator and (a + 1); trace_distance = tracedist(a_displaced, a + 1). print(f""The trace distance is {trace_distance}""); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; The trace distance is 5.00000005039634; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. The trace distance should be 0. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.7.2; Numpy Version: 1.24.2; Scipy Version: 1.10.1; Cython Version: None; Matplotlib Version: 3.7.1; Python Version: 3.11.9; Number of CPUs: 8; BLAS Info: OPENBLAS; OPENMP Installed: False; INTEL MKL Ext: False; Platform Info: Windows (AMD64); ```. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2495

I am re-submitting it with a shorter title. If there is a duplicate, please disregard the first one. Thanks!. I have python scripts running qutip a couple of years ago. I never touched my qutip installation. Today I tried to run it again and got an error. It happened with the simple line ""_from qutip import *_"" (See error output in the output field below). So what changed? This happens even when I simply run the script from the command line, or run this command in the web-based Jupyter environment.

I took a qutip script created 3 years ago (named ""Ikonen First Shot New Unitary Trans States 2 level Full H Gated Test 2 - Copy.ipynb"") and ran it now (exact copied named ""Test.ipynb"") and got different results.; There is a caveat, whether relevant or not. When I ran the duplicated script (Test.ipynb) this time, I got errors keeping me from importing qutip. I submitted a ticket yesterday (#2500), which was kindly addressed, recommending that I uninstall cvxpy to remove conflict. I did that and was able to import qutip.; I then ran the duplicate script, but got a different result from 3 years ago. If you compare the output at block 23, you'll see it deviates significantly from the corresponding block in the old script. I have changed nothing in hte duplicated script, other than uninstalling cvxpy to make it run.; I then reinstalled cvxpy with upgrade and then qutip again. This time I can still import qutip, but with a warning. I ran the script with no problem, but still got the same deviated behavior from 3 years ago. [codes.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16367713/codes.zip). The 3-year-old script is included only to show the previous results. It is not meant to be run.

I cannot recall the state of installation I had from 3 years ago. I believe I did it through conda. I just realized that I cannot include qutip scripts with this report.

This run is no longer counted in `ntraj`. ; This clear confusion when merging results with `improved_sampling`: ; ```; res1 = mcsolver.run(psi0, ..., ntraj=100); res2 = mcsolver.run(psi0, ..., ntraj=10); result = res1 + res2; ```; In this case, since the no jump trajectory is the same in both case, there is only 109 different trajectories. So if we merge keeping all random trajectories with the same weight, we get a `99:9` ratio instead of the `100:10` that we would naturally expect. To keep the intuitive ratio, we need to add relative weight between trajectories of each run. By not counting the no-jumb trajectory in the provided `ntraj`, then expected ratio comes naturally. It also help with reproducing result using seeds. To reproduce `result` from it's seeds, we would need to remove `seeds[100]` and run 109 trajectories. Keeping the no-jump appart, it does not use a seed and `result.seeds` can be used as is to reproduce the simulation. I created `MultitrajResult.add_deterministic` for no jump trajectories. It does not take the seed, but take the absolute weight. And added the weight to the `add` method. By having the weight be part of the multi trajectory object instead of each trajectories, merging `MultitrajResult` is simpler since they can reuse the same single trajectory result.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2502

I updated some old code from v4.7 to v5 this week and found some examples of brmesolve which were substantially slower... going from 30 seconds to 15+ minutes. Fiddling around a little I narrowed it down to at least one issue (though there may be others). This is particularly tricky because I also have examples which are substantially faster in v5. The one issue I found was that bloch_redfield_tensor() always returns a dense bloch-redfield tensor, even if you set br_type to sparse. It does return a sparse one if fock_basis=false, which points at the issue being; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/0b4260e821cf4d095df6fa02ea5a71bc0655516c/qutip/core/_brtensor.pyx#L281; so this call to from_eigbasis() in _brtools always returning a dense object; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/0b4260e821cf4d095df6fa02ea5a71bc0655516c/qutip/core/_brtools.pyx#L290. if i manually convert the tensor back to sparse again, and use it, it speeds up these hard cases by a factor of 5 or 6. Not sure if it resolves my original 30seconds -> 15 minutes problem completely, will check a bit more. In some sense this relates to the old issue of how broadly default_dtype should be applied, but here it seems more specific in that one requests a sparse tensor and gets a dense one. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; R = bloch_redfield_tensor(H, [[Q, Lor]], fock_basis=True, sparse_eigensolver=True, br_dtype='sparse'); print(R.dtype); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; <class 'qutip.core.data.dense.Dense'>; ```. ### Expected Behaviour.

Hi,; I've been trying to find the propagator for a time-dependent hamiltonian (with time-dependent collapse operators as well), and have been getting an error saying that the t_list lengths do not match in Qutip 5.0. I also tried to run it without using the collapse operators, but I get the same issue. The same code runs in Qutip 4.7. My goal is to actually find two-time correlation functions of a time-dependent operator (following this paper:https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.023717). What I did do (and what has worked) is decompose the operator into time-independent parts and then use Qutip's correlation_2op_2t. This takes a really long time, since I need to do this for 8 different pairs of operators. I thought of instead finding the propagator and manually finding the correlation using it instead. .

I'm using mcsolve and keeping trajectories. I've got a single type of collapse/jump operator, which moves a single electron of my system from one site to another. ; ```; for jump_rate in [0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]:; result = mcsolve(H, initial_state, tlist, [np.sqrt(jump_rate)*jump_op], number_operators, ntraj = ntraject,; options={""keep_runs_results"": True, ""store_states"": True, ""improved_sampling"": True}); ```; I'm increasing the jump_rate, and looking at when the jumps occur using result.collapse (which keeps track of which trajectory contributed a jump). I'm using ntraject = 10 or 100. I've tried with and without improved sampling. . When I use a jump rate less than 2, the number of jumps I see in each trajectory goes up with the jump rate. However for a jump rate of 4 or higher, the number of jumps I see in each trajectory goes down with jump rate. (I realize that for the Lindblad equation to be a good approximation, the interaction hamiltonian (and thus jump rate) should be small compared to the system Hamiltonian, but I still want to understand this behavior.). Can anybody explain why a higher jump rate doesn't give more jumps in a trajectory? . Also, I'd like to understand result.photocurrent, which seems to combine the jumps for all trajectories, but also seems to divide by the number of trajectories, and maybe the number of timesteps?. Thanks,; Emily; Here are a couple of plots showing all the jumps in 10 trajectories, for a jump rate of 4 (more jumps) and of 0.5 (fewer jumps) and 32 (fewer jumps); ![Colmcsolve6sites0 5C0 5N0 2ex4JR10NTEvery_other_site_state](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21b08700-3cae-4584-a26e-31821362e285); ![Colmcsolve6sites0 5C0 5N0 2ex0 5JR10NTEvery_other_site_state](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a61c1a5d-823f-4718-baf1-c679f5a25165); ![Colmcsolve6sites0 5C0 5N0 2ex32JR10NTEvery_other_site_state](https://",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2539

The functions `update_psi()` and `update_rho()` of the class `TwoModeQuadratureCorrelation` both have a `Qobj.data[i,j]` type statement as was the norm before qutip5. I encountered this issue when code from my PC would not run on my MacBook. I could fix it by just replacing the `psi.data[i,0]` with a `psi.data_as()[i,0]` (and analogous with `rho.data`) in the distributions.py file as noted in the change log. . ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import qutip as qt; a = qt.tensor(qt.destroy(5), qt.qeye(5)); b = qt.tensor(qt.qeye(5), qt.destroy(5)); z = 0.9; rho=qt.squeezing(a,b,z)*qt.tensor(qt.fock(5,0),qt.fock(5,0)); p=qt.TwoModeQuadratureCorrelation(rho,theta1=0,theta2=0); p.visualize(); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; TypeError Traceback (most recent call last); Cell In[69], line 44; 39 print(""P quadrature correlation:"", p_corr); 41 # Ensure the correct dimensions are used by TwoModeQuadratureCorrelation; 42 # Calculating two-mode quadrature correlation (if this is the function you mean); 43 # This is a placeholder for any specific function you're calling:; ---> 44 corr = qt.TwoModeQuadratureCorrelation(two_mode_squeezed_state); 45 # print(""Two-mode quadrature correlation:"", corr); File ~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-ETHZurich/PythonScripts/Qutip/TMS_Kerr_simulations/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/qutip/distributions.py:283, in TwoModeQuadratureCorrelation.__init__(self, state, theta1, theta2, extent, steps); 280 self.theta1 = theta1; 281 self.theta2 = theta2; --> 283 self.update(state); File ~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-ETHZurich/PythonScripts/Qutip/TMS_Kerr_simulations/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/qutip/distributions.py:291, in TwoModeQuadratureCorrelation.update(self, state); 286 """"""; 287 calculate probability distribution for quadrature measurement; 288 outcomes given a two-mode wavefunction or density matrix; 289 """"""; 290 if isket(state):; --> 291 self.update_psi(",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2546
