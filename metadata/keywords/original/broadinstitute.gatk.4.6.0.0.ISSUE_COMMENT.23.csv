This new tool is already giving much better results than `Mutect2`, but is not quite ready for prime time. I expect it to come out this year, however.

Some more data from the production pipeline, just in case it could help. ; Since the PON is exome-only, we were not sure whether including the PON would improve the performance of our WGS workflow in the ""production pipeline"" with gatk version 4.1.7.0, so we ran experiments:; - calling without germline resource and without PON; - calling with germline resource only, without PON; - calling with both germline resource and PON.

The most relevant changes to Mutect2 between versions 4.1.8.1 and 4.1.9.0 are #6520, #6696, and #6821, which have in common the property that they are bug fixes restoring sensitivity in edge cases. I don't think that any of these are regressions because the job of Mutect2 is to output any candidate variant. Filtering is the responsibility of FilterMutectCalls. Because our panel of normals is generated by running Mutect2, a panel of normals generated before 4.1.9.0 is blind to artifacts that occur in these edge cases. I suspect that re-generating our panels of normals using a more recent release of Mutect2 will solve the problem. I'm going to need to see how long it will take to gather the samples to re-generate our hg38 panel of normals (it might not take long at all) and triage that against the timetable for Mutect3, which does away with the panel of normals entirely.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1203356531

Almost all of these institutions are likely to use clinical WES assays due to cost reasons and will thus have been directly affected by this issue _for the last three years_. Also, almost all of these institutions will never learn of this bug since they likely trusted in the developers to have proper functional regression tests in place. If this is indeed the best the Broad can do as an institution, then I will take your offer of providing a build of Mutect2 4.1.8.1 with the log4j vulnerability patched out - thank you. The one thing that I am asking for in addition (for the sake of the overall oncology bioinformatics community), however, is that you conduct a best effort to notify organizations (universities, hospitals, and biotechs/pharmaceuticals that you know are using Mutect2) and best-practise workflow owners (Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL, CWL etc. that include Mutect2) of the forced downgrade.

My suggestion to use SelectVariants was only a debugging step to check whether GenomicsDB included the expected input data. Also, I misread your original post -- your GVCFs have literally 109 sites? And the interval list/bed file has 109 sites, not 109 regions? I would strongly recommend using a single interval in that case. Having a subfolder for each site will lead to a lot of unnecessary overhead. Lastly, I would recommend upgrading to a newer GATK. 4.1.8.0 is exactly 2 years old it seems...there's been quite a few changes/updates since then. edit: and to resolve why the number of subfolders in the workspace don't match the lines in the bed file -- my guess is that some of the sites in the bed file are abutting each other. The default behavior in these cases is to merge these into a single interval.

So you'll see it's progressing, but ~38 variants/min if I read this right. A few other things to note:. - FWIW, this is using a GATK JAR I built locally using #7962, which has some minor changes to side-step a bug in GenotypeGVCFs. Those changes only touch two annotation classes. - GenomicsDB 1.4.4 mentions memory improvements - any reason to think trying that would make a difference?. - One other thing to mention is that the MMul10 genome has ~2900 contigs. I dont understand precisely why this is a problem for GenomicsDB, but that has come up. Since we're only working on one contig (and usually a fraction of a contig) per job, could I subset my workspace to coax GenomicsDB to think it only has one contig? I believe I could just copy the contig folder and touch up the metadata JSON? I realize this isnt a great solution, but we're completely blocked here in terms of genotyping our data. - If SelectVariants actually worked here, could I run SelectVariants on the GenomicsDB workspace to create a combined gVCF for my ~2m site interval, and then run GenotypeGVCFs against this subset? It's not especially efficient, but if SelectVariants can pass and produce an output that's valid for GenotypeGVCFs that would actually be quite useful.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1209854842

Given we have an existing multi-contig workspace, and aggregating this many samples into a workspace is pretty big task, are there any ways to separate the existing workspace into a bunch of single-contig workspaces?

To your question about whether GenomicsDBImport includes variants that span the specified import interval: it will definitely include variants that start in those intervals, but it won't always store variants that start before the import interval. For deletions, we have some special handling for variants that start before the interval - they should show up represented by the star allele, but I don't think this is the case for insertions starting before the import interval.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1221066848

Again, the thing I'm trying to evaluate is whether it matters how I chunk the genome for GenomicsDBImport->GenotypeGVCFs. Downstream of this, I would pass the workspace to GenotypeGVCFs, with --only-output-calls-starting-in-intervals. The concern is whether we have variants spanning the intervals of two jobs, and whether separating the jobs would impact calls. In this example, GenotypeGVCFs would run over 1:1050-1150. For example, if we had a multi-NT variant that spanned 1148-1052, we'd want that called correctly no matter what intervals were used for the jobs. I tried using running GenomicsDBImport with -L over a small region, or I ran SelectVariants on the gVCF first (which behaves a little differently), and then used that subset gVCF as input to GenomicsDBImport, where GenomicsDBImport is given the entire contig as the interval.

To troubleshoot the GenomicsDBImport high memory issue my script have, I reran the script on chr1 to narrow down the source of the high memory issue. These are running on reblocked gvcfs. . 1. Without --bypass-feature-reader and -consolidate; 2. With --bypass-feature-reader; 3. With --consolidate without --bypass-feature-reader (This ended up on a node with 384gb.) The other ran on 256GB nodes. . Test 2 ran the fastest with the lowest memory requirements (Wall clock 76 hours); Test 1 ran slower and required more memory 40-50% of 256GB (Wall Clock 94 hours); Test 3 ran initially faster with less memory than test 1 but by batch 65 it was using 75% of 384 GB. This job has not finished and appears stuck on importing batch 65. So the consolidate option appears to have a memory leak or using just requiring too much memory. The -consolidate option was the culprit. So rerunning chr1-3 with just the --bypass-feature-reader option (test2) ran fine without lots of memory being used. Below is the time output from chr1.

In general, `--consolidate` will be memory and time intensive. It's not intuitive, but as you already figured out if `--consolidate` is enabled, we do it on the very last batch. If you only have on the order of a few hundred batches total, not having specified consolidate shouldn't affect read performance much.

We've had great success running each GenotypeGVCFs scattered, where each job runs GenomicsDbImport on-the-fly, to make a transient workspace. I havent heard a GATK reply, but I believe that giving each workspace a sufficient amount of downstream padding (we're using 1000bp) should ensure any variant that begins within the job's interval can be called properly. It does add non-trivial additional computation time to each GenotypeGVCFs job, but we were wasting all sorts of computation time pre-aggregating GenomicsDbImport workspaces. . What we're seeing in option 3 is consistent with some kind of problem in GenotypeGVCFs/SelectVariants when trying to read from GenomicsDB workspaces that have large chromosomes with highly consolidated data. In those workspaces, I was seeing single files with size of >30GB (like PL_var.tdb).

In order to produce something more meaningful I hacked the test to output the entire `stdout` and `stderr` as follows:. ```; final StringWriter out = new StringWriter();; final PrintWriter err = new PrintWriter(out);. final int result = com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute(""program"", err, err, err, ""doclet"",docArgList.toArray(new String[] {}));; err.flush(); // probably not needed; String message = out.toString(); // message contains the entire stdout and stderr of the call to execute; Assert.assertEquals(result, 0, message);; ```. The output is about 2000 lines, but a lot of it is clearly innocuous.
