The first paper specifies how should these potentials be integrated into an optimization solver and the second one specifies how these potential should be to correctly damp the desired deformation modes. . In particular, we need to compute the dissipation rate, measures as the `dt * R(x, v)`. We also need to compute the damping forces (dR/dv) and the damping hessians (d2R/dvdx and d2R/dv2). With the current implementation of the ForceFields, we can implement the forces and the hessians, but we can't implement the dissipation rate because we don't have access to dt. . The `MechanicalParams` that is passed into the getPotentialEnergy function is the default instance, and that one doesn't have the dt set. .

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2425:1326,Testability,test,test,1326,"No information is given when the initExternalModule entry point is called.; For 99.999% of the plugins, there is nothing special in it but some (SofaPython3, I am looking at you) is doing a lot of ""failable"" things when it is called.; This PR is a potential solution to this problem, by adding a (optional) entry point to check if the plugin reports by itself that it was loaded successfully. This allows SOFA to not crash if a problem arises in SofaPython3 when calling PythonEnvironment::Init() . It is not really necessary for the ""ci depends on"" as the two PR can compile without needing the other one; but it makes sense to merge them in the same time I think.

For example, `BaseInteractionForceField` supposed only 2 mechanical states. Since it inherits now from `StateAccessor`, it can have links to more than 2 (note that none of the interaction force field I found work with more than 2). Another example: `BaseForceField` did not have any reference to a mechanical state, but all the force fields inherits from `ForceField` which has a link to a mechanical state. Therefore, we couldn't have access to a mechanical state from a `BaseForceField`.

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/2451:892,Integrability,interface,interface,892,"### Problem. **Description**; Exporting a regular grid of hexahedras as an OBJ file does not properly export the normals. As you can see in the attached images ""sofaNormals.png"" and ""blenderNormals.png"", the normals are not oriented the same inside the Sofa scene and on the OBJ exported. This is an issue when you want to compute light effect like refractions or reflections on the exported mesh. ![sofaNormals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74002071/139054949-1c53aeaf-fb60-4a2f-bcd5-d9c4b193e4a1.png). ![blenderNormals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74002071/139054963-feb65403-0a01-42a5-9acf-b44508bd454b.png). **Steps to reproduce**; - Copy the code in the ""Command"" section of this report as a file named ""normalsIssueMinExample.scn""; - Change the filename inside the OBJexporter component to match the sofa workspace directory of your system ; - On the runSofa interface, open the scene ""normalsIssueMinExample.scn""; - You can animate the scene, but it is not mandatory; - As the scene is opened, you can see the regular grid of hexahedras and this grid is automatically exported as the filename you precised in the .scn/.xml file; - Import/open the .obj in ANY mesh editor (Blender, Unity or whatever); - Display the vertex normals : their orientation are wrong. **Expected behavior**; The normals should have had an orientation which is perpendicular to the local surface around each vertex (should be straight perpendicular to a planar surface around the center and around 45 degrees in the borders, since the vertices touch two different faces there). ---------------------------------------------. ### Environment. **Context**. - System: Windows 10; - Version of SOFA: v20.12 branch at commit ee7664e, v20.12.00 binaries; - State: build directory. **Command called (to copy in a .scn/xml file)**. ```txt. <?xml version=""1.0"" ?>. <Node name=""root"" dt=""0.1"" gravity=""0 0 0"">. 	<VisualStyle displayFlags=""showBehavior hideVisual hideCollision"" />. 	<EulerImplicit name",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/2451

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2554:1506,Availability,avail,available,1506,"a `StiffSpringForceField` between 2 objects in C++. Instead a utility function is provided. To maintain the backward compatibility and to facilitate the design of a simulation scene, `StiffSpringForceField` continues to accept two Data attributes ('object1' and 'object2') corresponding to two different objects. However, they don't correspond to any Data or Link in the component. Actually, during its creation, the component will instantiate other components in order to link both objects into one. In the end, the component is able to work on a single mechanical state while keeping the same physical behavior. The component now instantiates:. 1. A new Node; 2. A new mechanical state which will be the fusion of the provided objects, ; 3. A `SubsetMultiMapping` that will make the link between the two provided objects and the new mechanical state; 4. The spring force field. Since `SubsetMultiMapping` was initially in SofaMiscMapping, it has been moved into SofaBaseMechanics. A compatibility layer is available. Other components using `StiffSpringForceField` had to be adapted to create also the extra components. An example is `AttachBodyPerformer` which creates the spring between an object and the mouse (shift + clic).

This PR is the first step toward the conversion of the interaction force fields into simple force fields. This PR concerns the class `SpringForceField` and all its derived classes, including `StiffSpringForceField` which is used extensively to create springs. The changes maintain the backward compatibility with current scenes. However, the signature of some functions changed. That's why it's breaking. It is now impossible to construct a `StiffSpringForceField` between 2 objects in C++. Instead a utility function is provided. To maintain the backward compatibility and to facilitate the design of a simulation scene, `StiffSpringForceField` continues to accept two Data attributes ('object1' and 'object2') corresponding to two different objects. However, they don't correspond to any Data or Link in the component. Actually, during its creation, the component will instantiate other components in order to link both objects into one. In the end, the component is able to work on a single mechanical state while keeping the same physical behavior. The component now instantiates:. 1. A new Node; 2.

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2566:1511,Testability,test,test,1511,"While making out-of-tree builds with SofaGLFW, which entrypoint is a a cmakelists with two add_sofa_something(), cmake is throwing this kind of error while reading the second project:; ```cmake; CMake Error at C:/Work/sofa/install/master_fredroy/lib/cmake/Sofa.DefaultType/Sofa.DefaultTypeConfig.cmake:44 (set_target_properties):; Attempt to promote imported target ""Sofa.DefaultType"" to global scope (by; setting IMPORTED_GLOBAL) which is not built in this directory.; ```; which appears (after some headaches) to be linked with the fact that the Sofa.DefaultTypeConfig is read twice and cmake tries to set a flag (imported global) on something which has already the flag, and more generally to do twice the job of aliasing. So this PR adds a test on the four ""legacy"" SofaFramework targets to only make aliases if it was not done before.; ; And for good measure, update the date for the removal of the aliases to v22.06. ______________________________________________________.

So, instead of writing. ```cpp; template<class T2> struct rebind; {; typedef vector< T2,CPUMemoryManager<T2> > other;; };; ```; I propose to write:; ```cpp; template<class T2>; using rebind_to = vector< T2, CPUMemoryManager<T2> >;; ```. To define `VecTriangleInfo`, we would write:. ```cpp; using VecTriangleInfo = typename VecCoord::template rebind_to<TriangleInfo>;; ```. IMO, it is a bit more readable. But we can do better. I introduced convenience aliases in Rebind.h. With that, I can define `VecTriangleInfo` with:; ```cpp; using VecTriangleInfo = sofa::type::rebind_to<VecCoord, TriangleInfo>;; ```. `sofa::type::rebind_to` works with types having a `rebind_to` typedef (such that the one I introduced in vector_T.h), or on types having one template parameter.

Questions:; ### RequiredPlugin; is needed to be implcitely loaded somewhere if a scene wants to load stuff.; Should it be moved in SofaCore (thus always available) or force load Sofa.Component.Utility somewhere; ### SceneChecker; SceneChecker stuff is in SofaBaseUtils but they are not component tho so it does not make sense to move them into Sofa.Component. Should they move somewhere (in the framework like SimulationCore) ?. ______________________________________________________.
