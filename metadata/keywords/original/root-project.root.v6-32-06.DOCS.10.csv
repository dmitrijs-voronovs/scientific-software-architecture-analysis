Introduction; ============. :doc:`AddressSanitizer`; tags every 8 bytes of the application memory with a 1 byte tag (using *shadow memory*),; uses *redzones* to find buffer-overflows and; *quarantine* to find use-after-free.; The redzones, the quarantine, and, to a less extent, the shadow, are the; sources of AddressSanitizer's memory overhead.; See the `AddressSanitizer paper`_ for details. AArch64 has `Address Tagging`_ (or top-byte-ignore, TBI), a hardware feature that allows; software to use the 8 most significant bits of a 64-bit pointer as; a tag. HWASAN uses `Address Tagging`_; to implement a memory safety tool, similar to :doc:`AddressSanitizer`,; but with smaller memory overhead and slightly different (mostly better); accuracy guarantees. Intel's `Linear Address Masking`_ (LAM) also provides address tagging for; x86_64, though it is not widely available in hardware yet. For x86_64, HWASAN; has a limited implementation using page aliasing instead. Algorithm; =========; * Every heap/stack/global memory object is forcibly aligned by `TG` bytes; (`TG` is e.g. 16 or 64). We call `TG` the **tagging granularity**.; * For every such object a random `TS`-bit tag `T` is chosen (`TS`, or tag size, is e.g. 4 or 8); * The pointer to the object is tagged with `T`.; * The memory for the object is also tagged with `T` (using a `TG=>1` shadow memory); * Every load and store is instrumented to read the memory tag and compare it; with the pointer tag, exception is raised on tag mismatch. For a more detailed discussion of this approach see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09517.pdf. Short granules; --------------. A short granule is a granule of size between 1 and `TG-1` bytes. The size; of a short granule is stored at the location in shadow memory where the; granule's tag is normally stored, while the granule",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst:2971,Availability,error,error,2971,"een 1 and `TG-1` bytes. The size; of a short granule is stored at the location in shadow memory where the; granule's tag is normally stored, while the granule's actual tag is stored; in the last byte of the granule. This means that in order to verify that a; pointer tag matches a memory tag, HWASAN must check for two possibilities:. * the pointer tag is equal to the memory tag in shadow memory, or; * the shadow memory tag is actually a short granule size, the value being loaded; is in bounds of the granule and the pointer tag is equal to the last byte of; the granule. Pointer tags between 1 to `TG-1` are possible and are as likely as any other; tag. This means that these tags in memory have two interpretations: the full; tag interpretation (where the pointer tag is between 1 and `TG-1` and the; last byte of the granule is ordinary data) and the short tag interpretation; (where the pointer tag is stored in the granule). When HWASAN detects an error near a memory tag between 1 and `TG-1`, it; will show both the memory tag and the last byte of the granule. Currently,; it is up to the user to disambiguate the two possibilities. Instrumentation; ===============. Memory Accesses; ---------------; In the majority of cases, memory accesses are prefixed with a call to; an outlined instruction sequence that verifies the tags. The code size; and performance overhead of the call is reduced by using a custom calling; convention that. * preserves most registers, and; * is specialized to the register containing the address, and the type and; size of the memory access. Currently, the following sequence is used:. .. code-block:: none. // int foo(int *a) { return *a; }; // clang -O2 --target=aarch64-linux-android30 -fsanitize=hwaddress -S -o - load.c; [...]; foo:; stp x30, x20, [sp, #-16]!; adrp x20, :got:__hwasan_shadow // load shadow address from GOT into x20; ldr x20, [x20, :got_lo12:__hwasan_shadow]; bl __hwasan_check_x0_2_short_v2 // call outlined tag check; // (arguments: x0 = a",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst

Error reporting; ---------------. Errors are generated by the `HLT` instruction and are handled by a signal handler. Attribute; ---------. HWASAN uses its own LLVM IR Attribute `sanitize_hwaddress` and a matching; C function attribute. An alternative would be to re-use ASAN's attribute; `sanitize_address`. The reasons to use a separate attribute are:. * Users may need to disable ASAN but not HWASAN, or vise versa,; because the tools have different trade-offs and compatibility issues.; * LLVM (ideally) does not use flags to decide which pass is being used,; ASAN or HWASAN are being applied, based on the function attributes. This does mean that users of HWASAN may need to add the new attribute; to the code that already uses the old attribute. Comparison with AddressSanitizer; ================================. HWASAN:; * Is less portable than :doc:`AddressSanitizer`; as it relies on hardware `Address Tagging`_ (AArch64).; Address Tagging can be emulated with compiler instrumentation,; but it will require the instrumentation to remove the tags before; any load or store, which is infeasible in any realistic environment; that contains non-instrumented code.; * May have compatibility problems if the target code uses higher; pointer bits for other purposes.; * May require changes in the OS kernels (e.g. Linux seems to dislike; tagged pointers passed from address space:; https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm64/tagged-pointers.txt).; * **Does not require redzones to detect buffer overflows**,; but the buffer overflow detection is probabilistic, with roughly; `1/(2**TS)` chance of missing a bug (6.25% or 0.39% with 4 and 8-bit TS; respectively).; * **Does not require quarantine to detect heap-use-after-free,; or stack-use-after-return**.; The detection is similarly probabilistic. The memory overhead of HWASAN is expected to be much smaller; than t",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst

AArch64 has `Address Tagging`_ (or top-byte-ignore, TBI), a hardware feature that allows; software to use the 8 most significant bits of a 64-bit pointer as; a tag. HWASAN uses `Address Tagging`_; to implement a memory safety tool, similar to :doc:`AddressSanitizer`,; but with smaller memory overhead and slightly different (mostly better); accuracy guarantees. Intel's `Linear Address Masking`_ (LAM) also provides address tagging for; x86_64, though it is not widely available in hardware yet. For x86_64, HWASAN; has a limited implementation using page aliasing instead. Algorithm; =========; * Every heap/stack/global memory object is forcibly aligned by `TG` bytes; (`TG` is e.g. 16 or 64). We call `TG` the **tagging granularity**.; * For every such object a random `TS`-bit tag `T` is chosen (`TS`, or tag size, is e.g. 4 or 8); * The pointer to the object is tagged with `T`.; * The memory for the object is also tagged with `T` (using a `TG=>1` shadow memory); * Every load and store is instrumented to read the memory tag and compare it; with the pointer tag, exception is raised on tag mismatch. For a more detailed discussion of this approach see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09517.pdf. Short granules; --------------. A short granule is a granule of size between 1 and `TG-1` bytes. The size; of a short granule is stored at the location in shadow memory where the; granule's tag is normally stored, while the granule's actual tag is stored; in the last byte of the granule. This means that in order to verify that a; pointer tag matches a memory tag, HWASAN must check for two possibilities:. * the pointer tag is equal to the memory tag in shadow memory, or; * the shadow memory tag is actually a short granule size, the value being loaded; is in bounds of the granule and the pointer tag is equal to the last byte of; the granule.

The first; defined global in a translation unit has a pseudorandom tag associated; with it, based on the hash of the file path. Subsequent global tags are; incremental from the previously-assigned tag. * The global's tag is added to its symbol address in the object file's symbol; table. This causes the global's address to be tagged when its address is; taken. * When the address of a global is taken directly (i.e. not via the GOT), a special; instruction sequence needs to be used to add the tag to the address,; because the tag would otherwise take the address outside of the small code; model (4GB on AArch64). No changes are required when the address is taken; via the GOT because the address stored in the GOT will contain the tag. * An associated ``hwasan_globals`` section is emitted for each tagged global,; which indicates the address of the global, its size and its tag. These; sections are concatenated by the linker into a single ``hwasan_globals``; section that is enumerated by the runtime (via an ELF note) when a binary; is loaded and the memory is tagged accordingly.

Attribute; ---------. HWASAN uses its own LLVM IR Attribute `sanitize_hwaddress` and a matching; C function attribute. An alternative would be to re-use ASAN's attribute; `sanitize_address`. The reasons to use a separate attribute are:. * Users may need to disable ASAN but not HWASAN, or vise versa,; because the tools have different trade-offs and compatibility issues.; * LLVM (ideally) does not use flags to decide which pass is being used,; ASAN or HWASAN are being applied, based on the function attributes.

On x86_64, HWASAN utilizes page aliasing to place tags in userspace address; bits. Currently only heap tagging is supported. The page aliases rely on; shared memory, which will cause heap memory to be shared between processes if; the application calls ``fork()``. Therefore x86_64 is really only safe for; applications that do not fork. HWASAN does not currently support 32-bit architectures since they do not; support `Address Tagging`_ and the address space is too constrained to easily; implement page aliasing.

This page is a design document for; **hardware-assisted AddressSanitizer** (or **HWASAN**); a tool similar to :doc:`AddressSanitizer`,; but based on partial hardware assistance. Introduction; ============. :doc:`AddressSanitizer`; tags every 8 bytes of the application memory with a 1 byte tag (using *shadow memory*),; uses *redzones* to find buffer-overflows and; *quarantine* to find use-after-free.; The redzones, the quarantine, and, to a less extent, the shadow, are the; sources of AddressSanitizer's memory overhead.; See the `AddressSanitizer paper`_ for details. AArch64 has `Address Tagging`_ (or top-byte-ignore, TBI), a hardware feature that allows; software to use the 8 most significant bits of a 64-bit pointer as; a tag. HWASAN uses `Address Tagging`_; to implement a memory safety tool, similar to :doc:`AddressSanitizer`,; but with smaller memory overhead and slightly different (mostly better); accuracy guarantees. Intel's `Linear Address Masking`_ (LAM) also provides address tagging for; x86_64, though it is not widely available in hardware yet. For x86_64, HWASAN; has a limited implementation using page aliasing instead. Algorithm; =========; * Every heap/stack/global memory object is forcibly aligned by `TG` bytes; (`TG` is e.g. 16 or 64). We call `TG` the **tagging granularity**.; * For every such object a random `TS`-bit tag `T` is chosen (`TS`, or tag size, is e.g. 4 or 8); * The pointer to the object is tagged with `T`.; * The memory for the object is also tagged with `T` (using a `TG=>1` shadow memory); * Every load and store is instrumented to read the memory tag and compare it; with the pointer tag, exception is raised on tag mismatch. For a more detailed discussion of this approach see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09517.pdf. Short granules; --------------. A short granule is a granule of s",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst

The size; of a short granule is stored at the location in shadow memory where the; granule's tag is normally stored, while the granule's actual tag is stored; in the last byte of the granule. This means that in order to verify that a; pointer tag matches a memory tag, HWASAN must check for two possibilities:. * the pointer tag is equal to the memory tag in shadow memory, or; * the shadow memory tag is actually a short granule size, the value being loaded; is in bounds of the granule and the pointer tag is equal to the last byte of; the granule. Pointer tags between 1 to `TG-1` are possible and are as likely as any other; tag. This means that these tags in memory have two interpretations: the full; tag interpretation (where the pointer tag is between 1 and `TG-1` and the; last byte of the granule is ordinary data) and the short tag interpretation; (where the pointer tag is stored in the granule). When HWASAN detects an error near a memory tag between 1 and `TG-1`, it; will show both the memory tag and the last byte of the granule. Currently,; it is up to the user to disambiguate the two possibilities. Instrumentation; ===============. Memory Accesses; ---------------; In the majority of cases, memory accesses are prefixed with a call to; an outlined instruction sequence that verifies the tags. The code size; and performance overhead of the call is reduced by using a custom calling; convention that. * preserves most registers, and; * is specialized to the register containing the address, and the type and; size of the memory access. Currently, the following sequence is used:. .. code-block:: none. // int foo(int *a) { return *a; }; // clang -O2 --target=aarch64-linux-android30 -fsanitize=hwaddress -S -o - load.c; [...]; foo:; stp x30, x20, [sp, #-16]!; adrp x20, :got:__hwasan_shadow // load shadow address from GOT into x20; ldr x20, [x20, :got_lo12:__hwasan_shadow]; bl __hwasan_check_x0_2_short_v2 // call outlined tag check; // (arguments: x0 = a",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.rst

Intel GPU Support; =================. Clang provides partial HIP support on Intel GPUs using the CHIP-Star project `<https://github.com/CHIP-SPV/chipStar>`_.; CHIP-Star implements the HIP runtime over oneAPI Level Zero or OpenCL runtime. The Clang driver uses the HIPSPV; toolchain to compile HIP device code into LLVM IR, which is subsequently translated to SPIR-V via the SPIR-V; backend or the out-of-tree LLVM-SPIRV translator. The SPIR-V is then bundled and embedded into the host executables. .. note::; While Clang does not directly provide HIP support for NVIDIA GPUs and CPUs, these platforms are supported via other means:. - NVIDIA GPUs: HIP support is offered through the HIP project `<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP>`_, which provides a header-only library for translating HIP runtime APIs into CUDA runtime APIs. The code is subsequently compiled using NVIDIA's `nvcc`. - CPUs: HIP support is available through the HIP-CPU runtime library `<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP-CPU>`_. This header-only library enables CPUs to execute unmodified HIP code. Example Usage; =============. To compile a HIP program, use the following command:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ -c --offload-arch=gfx906 -xhip sample.cpp -o sample.o. The ``-xhip`` option indicates that the source is a HIP program. If the file has a ``.hip`` extension,; Clang will automatically recognize it as a HIP program:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ -c --offload-arch=gfx906 sample.hip -o sample.o. To link a HIP program, use this command:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ --hip-link --offload-arch=gfx906 sample.o -o sample. In the above command, the ``--hip-link`` flag instructs Clang to link the HIP runtime library. However,; the use of this flag is unnecessary if a HIP input file is already present in your program. For convenience, Clang also supports compiling and linking in a single step:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ --offlo",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HIPSupport.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HIPSupport.rst

In the above commands, ``gfx906`` is the GPU architecture that the code is being compiled for. The supported GPU; architectures can be found in the `AMDGPU Processor Table <https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#processors>`_.; Alternatively, you can use the ``amdgpu-arch`` tool that comes with Clang to list the GPU architecture on your system:. .. code-block:: shell. amdgpu-arch.

HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) `<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP>`_ is; a C++ Runtime API and Kernel Language. It enables developers to create portable applications for; offloading computation to different hardware platforms from a single source code. AMD GPU Support; ===============. Clang provides HIP support on AMD GPUs via the ROCm platform `<https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/#>`_.; The ROCm runtime forms the base for HIP host APIs, while HIP device APIs are realized through HIP header; files and the ROCm device library. The Clang driver uses the HIPAMD toolchain to compile HIP device code; to AMDGPU ISA via the AMDGPU backend. The compiled code is then bundled and embedded in the host executables. Intel GPU Support; =================. Clang provides partial HIP support on Intel GPUs using the CHIP-Star project `<https://github.com/CHIP-SPV/chipStar>`_.; CHIP-Star implements the HIP runtime over oneAPI Level Zero or OpenCL runtime. The Clang driver uses the HIPSPV; toolchain to compile HIP device code into LLVM IR, which is subsequently translated to SPIR-V via the SPIR-V; backend or the out-of-tree LLVM-SPIRV translator. The SPIR-V is then bundled and embedded into the host executables. .. note::; While Clang does not directly provide HIP support for NVIDIA GPUs and CPUs, these platforms are supported via other means:. - NVIDIA GPUs: HIP support is offered through the HIP project `<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP>`_, which provides a header-only library for translating HIP runtime APIs into CUDA runtime APIs. The code is subsequently compiled using NVIDIA's `nvcc`. - CPUs: HIP support is available through the HIP-CPU runtime library `<https://",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HIPSupport.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HIPSupport.rst

In the above command, the ``--hip-link`` flag instructs Clang to link the HIP runtime library. However,; the use of this flag is unnecessary if a HIP input file is already present in your program. For convenience, Clang also supports compiling and linking in a single step:. .. code-block:: shell. clang++ --offload-arch=gfx906 -xhip sample.cpp -o sample. In the above commands, ``gfx906`` is the GPU architecture that the code is being compiled for. The supported GPU; architectures can be found in the `AMDGPU Processor Table <https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#processors>`_.; Alternatively, you can use the ``amdgpu-arch`` tool that comes with Clang to list the GPU architecture on your system:. .. code-block:: shell. amdgpu-arch.

Virtual Function Support; ========================. In Clang with HIP, support for calling virtual functions of an object in device or host code is contingent on where the object is constructed. - **Constructed in Device Code**: Virtual functions of an object can be called in device code on a specific offloading device if the object is constructed in device code on an offloading device with the same architecture.; - **Constructed in Host Code**: Virtual functions of an object can be called in host code if the object is constructed in host code. In other scenarios, calling virtual functions is not allowed. Explanation; -----------. An object constructed on the device side contains a pointer to the virtual function table on the device side, which is not accessible in host code, and vice versa. Thus, trying to invoke virtual functions from a context different from where the object was constructed will be disallowed because the appropriate virtual table cannot be accessed. The virtual function tables for offloading devices with different architecures are different, therefore trying to invoke virtual functions from an offloading device with a different architecture than where the object is constructed is also disallowed.

Clang Tooling provides infrastructure to write tools that need syntactic; and semantic information about a program. This term also relates to a set; of specific tools using this infrastructure (e.g. ``clang-check``). This; document provides information on how to set up and use Clang Tooling for; the LLVM source code. Introduction; ============. Clang Tooling needs a compilation database to figure out specific build; options for each file. Currently it can create a compilation database; from the ``compile_commands.json`` file, generated by CMake. When; invoking clang tools, you can either specify a path to a build directory; using a command line parameter ``-p`` or let Clang Tooling find this; file in your source tree. In either case you need to configure your; build using CMake to use clang tools. Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake and Make; ========================================. If you intend to use make to build LLVM, you should have CMake 2.8.6 or; later installed (can be found `here <https://cmake.org>`_). First, you need to generate Makefiles for LLVM with CMake. You need to; make a build directory and run CMake from it:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir your/build/directory; $ cd your/build/directory; $ cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/llvm/sources. If you want to use clang instead of GCC, you can add; ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++``.; You can also use ``ccmake``, which provides a curses interface to configure; CMake variables. As a result, the new ``compile_commands.json`` file should appear in the; current directory. You should link it to the LLVM source tree so that; Clang Tooling is able to use it:. .. code-block:: console. $ ln -s $PWD/compile_commands.json path/to/llvm/source/. Now you are ready to build and test LLVM using make:. .. code-block:: console. $ make check-all. Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake on Windows; ==========================================.

Now you are ready to build and test LLVM using make:. .. code-block:: console. $ make check-all. Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake on Windows; ==========================================. For Windows developers, the Visual Studio project generators in CMake do; not support `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html>`_.; However, the Ninja generator does support this variable and can be used; on Windows to generate a suitable ``compile_commands.json`` that invokes; the MSVC compiler. First, you will need to install `Ninja`_. Once installed, the Ninja; executable will need to be in your search path for CMake to locate it. Next, assuming you already have Visual Studio installed on your machine, you; need to have the appropriate environment variables configured so that CMake; will locate the MSVC compiler for the Ninja generator. The `documentation; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#path_and_environment>`_; describes the necessary environment variable settings, but the simplest thing; is to use a `developer command-prompt window; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts>`_; or call a `developer command file; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#developer_command_file_locations>`_; to set the environment variables appropriately.

Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake and Make; ========================================. If you intend to use make to build LLVM, you should have CMake 2.8.6 or; later installed (can be found `here <https://cmake.org>`_). First, you need to generate Makefiles for LLVM with CMake. You need to; make a build directory and run CMake from it:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir your/build/directory; $ cd your/build/directory; $ cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/llvm/sources. If you want to use clang instead of GCC, you can add; ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++``.; You can also use ``ccmake``, which provides a curses interface to configure; CMake variables. As a result, the new ``compile_commands.json`` file should appear in the; current directory. You should link it to the LLVM source tree so that; Clang Tooling is able to use it:. .. code-block:: console. $ ln -s $PWD/compile_commands.json path/to/llvm/source/. Now you are ready to build and test LLVM using make:. .. code-block:: console. $ make check-all. Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake on Windows; ==========================================. For Windows developers, the Visual Studio project generators in CMake do; not support `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html>`_.; However, the Ninja generator does support this variable and can be used; on Windows to generate a suitable ``compile_commands.json`` that invokes; the MSVC compiler. First, you will need to install `Ninja`_. Once installed, the Ninja; executable will need to be in your search path for CMake to locate it. Next, assuming you already have Visual Studio installed on your machine, you; need to have the appropriate environment variables configured so that CMake; will locate the MSVC compiler for the Ninja generator.

Using Ninja Build System; =======================================. Optionally you can use the `Ninja`_ build system instead of make. It is; aimed at making your builds faster. Currently this step will require; building Ninja from sources. To take advantage of using Clang Tools along with Ninja build you need; at least CMake 2.8.9. Clone the Ninja git repository and build Ninja from sources:. .. code-block:: console. $ git clone git://github.com/martine/ninja.git; $ cd ninja/; $ ./bootstrap.py. This will result in a single binary ``ninja`` in the current directory.; It doesn't require installation and can just be copied to any location; inside ``$PATH``, say ``/usr/local/bin/``:. .. code-block:: console. $ sudo cp ninja /usr/local/bin/; $ sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/ninja. After doing all of this, you'll need to generate Ninja build files for; LLVM with CMake. You need to make a build directory and run CMake from; it:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir your/build/directory; $ cd your/build/directory; $ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/llvm/sources. If you want to use clang instead of GCC, you can add; ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++``.; You can also use ``ccmake``, which provides a curses interface to configure; CMake variables in an interactive manner. As a result, the new ``compile_commands.json`` file should appear in the; current directory. You should link it to the LLVM source tree so that; Clang Tooling is able to use it:. .. code-block:: console. $ ln -s $PWD/compile_commands.json path/to/llvm/source/. Now you are ready to build and test LLVM using Ninja:. .. code-block:: console. $ ninja check-all.

For Windows developers, the Visual Studio project generators in CMake do; not support `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html>`_.; However, the Ninja generator does support this variable and can be used; on Windows to generate a suitable ``compile_commands.json`` that invokes; the MSVC compiler.

The `documentation; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#path_and_environment>`_; describes the necessary environment variable settings, but the simplest thing; is to use a `developer command-prompt window; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts>`_; or call a `developer command file; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#developer_command_file_locations>`_; to set the environment variables appropriately. Now you can run CMake with the Ninja generator to export a compilation; database:. .. code-block:: console. C:\> mkdir build-ninja; C:\> cd build-ninja; C:\build-ninja> cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/llvm/sources. It is best to keep your Visual Studio IDE build folder separate from the; Ninja build folder. This prevents the two build systems from negatively; interacting with each other.

This library certainly needs a better name. The ""basic"" library contains a; number of low-level utilities for tracking and manipulating source buffers,; locations within the source buffers, diagnostics, tokens, target abstraction,; and information about the subset of the language being compiled for. Part of this infrastructure is specific to C (such as the ``TargetInfo``; class), other parts could be reused for other non-C-based languages; (``SourceLocation``, ``SourceManager``, ``Diagnostics``, ``FileManager``).; When and if there is future demand we can figure out if it makes sense to; introduce a new library, move the general classes somewhere else, or introduce; some other solution. We describe the roles of these classes in order of their dependencies. The Diagnostics Subsystem; -------------------------. The Clang Diagnostics subsystem is an important part of how the compiler; communicates with the human. Diagnostics are the warnings and errors produced; when the code is incorrect or dubious. In Clang, each diagnostic produced has; (at the minimum) a unique ID, an English translation associated with it, a; :ref:`SourceLocation <SourceLocation>` to ""put the caret"", and a severity; (e.g., ``WARNING`` or ``ERROR``). They can also optionally include a number of; arguments to the diagnostic (which fill in ""%0""'s in the string) as well as a; number of source ranges that related to the diagnostic. In this section, we'll be giving examples produced by the Clang command line; driver, but diagnostics can be :ref:`rendered in many different ways; <DiagnosticConsumer>` depending on how the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is; implemented.

The; substituted text must itself be a valid format string before substitution. .. _internals-producing-diag:. Producing the Diagnostic; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Now that you've created the diagnostic in the ``Diagnostic*Kinds.td`` file, you; need to write the code that detects the condition in question and emits the new; diagnostic. Various components of Clang (e.g., the preprocessor, ``Sema``,; etc.) provide a helper function named ""``Diag``"". It creates a diagnostic and; accepts the arguments, ranges, and other information that goes along with it. For example, the binary expression error comes from code like this:. .. code-block:: c++. if (various things that are bad); Diag(Loc, diag::err_typecheck_invalid_operands); << lex->getType() << rex->getType(); << lex->getSourceRange() << rex->getSourceRange();. This shows that use of the ``Diag`` method: it takes a location (a; :ref:`SourceLocation <SourceLocation>` object) and a diagnostic enum value; (which matches the name from ``Diagnostic*Kinds.td``). If the diagnostic takes; arguments, they are specified with the ``<<`` operator: the first argument; becomes ``%0``, the second becomes ``%1``, etc. The diagnostic interface; allows you to specify arguments of many different types, including ``int`` and; ``unsigned`` for integer arguments, ``const char*`` and ``std::string`` for; string arguments, ``DeclarationName`` and ``const IdentifierInfo *`` for names,; ``QualType`` for types, etc. ``SourceRange``\ s are also specified with the; ``<<`` operator, but do not have a specific ordering requirement.

As you can see, adding and producing a diagnostic is pretty straightforward.; The hard part is deciding exactly what you need to say to help the user,; picking a suitable wording, and providing the information needed to format it; correctly. The good news is that the call site that issues a diagnostic should; be completely independent of how the diagnostic is formatted and in what; language it is rendered. Fix-It Hints; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. In some cases, the front end emits diagnostics when it is clear that some small; change to the source code would fix the problem. For example, a missing; semicolon at the end of a statement or a use of deprecated syntax that is; easily rewritten into a more modern form. Clang tries very hard to emit the; diagnostic and recover gracefully in these and other cases. However, for these cases where the fix is obvious, the diagnostic can be; annotated with a hint (referred to as a ""fix-it hint"") that describes how to; change the code referenced by the diagnostic to fix the problem. For example,; it might add the missing semicolon at the end of the statement or rewrite the; use of a deprecated construct into something more palatable. Here is one such; example from the C++ front end, where we warn about the right-shift operator; changing meaning from C++98 to C++11:. .. code-block:: text. test.cpp:3:7: warning: use of right-shift operator ('>>') in template argument; will require parentheses in C++11; A<100 >> 2> *a;; ^; ( ).

For; example, the normal Clang ``DiagnosticConsumer`` (named; ``TextDiagnosticPrinter``) turns the arguments into strings (according to the; various formatting rules), prints out the file/line/column information and the; string, then prints out the line of code, the source ranges, and the caret.; However, this behavior isn't required. Another implementation of the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is the; ``TextDiagnosticBuffer`` class, which is used when Clang is in ``-verify``; mode. Instead of formatting and printing out the diagnostics, this; implementation just captures and remembers the diagnostics as they fly by.; Then ``-verify`` compares the list of produced diagnostics to the list of; expected ones. If they disagree, it prints out its own output. Full; documentation for the ``-verify`` mode can be found at; :ref:`verifying-diagnostics`. There are many other possible implementations of this interface, and this is; why we prefer diagnostics to pass down rich structured information in; arguments. For example, an HTML output might want declaration names be; linkified to where they come from in the source. Another example is that a GUI; might let you click on typedefs to expand them. This application would want to; pass significantly more information about types through to the GUI than a; simple flat string. The interface allows this to happen. .. _internals-diag-translation:.

The last step is implementing the ``-cc1`` command line argument; parsing/generation that initializes/serializes the option class (in our case; ``CodeGenOptions``) stored within ``CompilerInvocation``.

The ``Lexer`` class; -------------------. The ``Lexer`` class provides the mechanics of lexing tokens out of a source; buffer and deciding what they mean. The ``Lexer`` is complicated by the fact; that it operates on raw buffers that have not had spelling eliminated (this is; a necessity to get decent performance), but this is countered with careful; coding as well as standard performance techniques (for example, the comment; handling code is vectorized on X86 and PowerPC hosts). The lexer has a couple of interesting modal features:. * The lexer can operate in ""raw"" mode. This mode has several features that; make it possible to quickly lex the file (e.g., it stops identifier lookup,; doesn't specially handle preprocessor tokens, handles EOF differently, etc).; This mode is used for lexing within an ""``#if 0``"" block, for example.; * The lexer can capture and return comments as tokens. This is required to; support the ``-C`` preprocessor mode, which passes comments through, and is; used by the diagnostic checker to identifier expect-error annotations.; * The lexer can be in ``ParsingFilename`` mode, which happens when; preprocessing after reading a ``#include`` directive. This mode changes the; parsing of ""``<``"" to return an ""angled string"" instead of a bunch of tokens; for each thing within the filename.; * When parsing a preprocessor directive (after ""``#``"") the; ``ParsingPreprocessorDirective`` mode is entered. This changes the parser to; return EOD at a newline.; * The ``Lexer`` uses a ``LangOptions`` object to know whether trigraphs are; enabled, whether C++ or ObjC keywords are recognized, etc. In addition to these modes, the lexer keeps track of a couple of other features; that are local to a lexed buffer, which change as the buffer is lexed:. * The ``Lexer`` uses ``BufferPtr`` to keep track of the current character being; lexed.; * The ``Lexer`` uses ``IsAtStartOfLine`` to keep track of whether the next; lexed token will start with its ""st",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

For example, consider this code:. .. code-block:: c++. void func() {; typedef int foo;; foo X, *Y;; typedef foo *bar;; bar Z;; *X; // error; **Y; // error; **Z; // error; }.

While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"".

In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"".

Given a ``DeclarationName`` ``N``, ``N.getNameKind()`` will produce a value; that describes what kind of name ``N`` stores. There are 10 options (all of; the names are inside the ``DeclarationName`` class). ``Identifier``. The name is a simple identifier. Use ``N.getAsIdentifierInfo()`` to retrieve; the corresponding ``IdentifierInfo*`` pointing to the actual identifier. ``ObjCZeroArgSelector``, ``ObjCOneArgSelector``, ``ObjCMultiArgSelector``. The name is an Objective-C selector, which can be retrieved as a ``Selector``; instance via ``N.getObjCSelector()``. The three possible name kinds for; Objective-C reflect an optimization within the ``DeclarationName`` class:; both zero- and one-argument selectors are stored as a masked; ``IdentifierInfo`` pointer, and therefore require very little space, since; zero- and one-argument selectors are far more common than multi-argument; selectors (which use a different structure). ``CXXConstructorName``. The name is a C++ constructor name. Use ``N.getCXXNameType()`` to retrieve; the :ref:`type <QualType>` that this constructor is meant to construct.

They require; only a single pointer's worth of storage in the common cases (identifiers,; zero- and one-argument Objective-C selectors) and use dense, uniqued storage; for the other kinds of names. Two ``DeclarationName``\ s can be compared for; equality (``==``, ``!=``) using a simple bitwise comparison, can be ordered; with ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, and ``>=`` (which provide a lexicographical ordering; for normal identifiers but an unspecified ordering for other kinds of names),; and can be placed into LLVM ``DenseMap``\ s and ``DenseSet``\ s. ``DeclarationName`` instances can be created in different ways depending on; what kind of name the instance will store. Normal identifiers; (``IdentifierInfo`` pointers) and Objective-C selectors (``Selector``) can be; implicitly converted to ``DeclarationNames``.

If the ""from"" node is not a definition then we add; that to the redeclaration chain of the found node. This behaviour is essential; when we merge ASTs from different translation units which include the same; header file(s). For example, we want to have only one definition for the class; template ``std::vector``, even if we included ``<vector>`` in several; translation units. To find a structurally equivalent node we can use the regular C/C++ lookup; functions: ``DeclContext::noload_lookup()`` and; ``DeclContext::localUncachedLookup()``. These functions do respect the C/C++; name hiding rules, thus you cannot find certain declarations in a given; declaration context. For instance, unnamed declarations (anonymous structs),; non-first ``friend`` declarations and template specializations are hidden. This; is a problem, because if we use the regular C/C++ lookup then we create; redundant AST nodes during the merge! Also, having two instances of the same; node could result in false :ref:`structural in-equivalencies <structural-eq>`; of other nodes which depend on the duplicated node. Because of these reasons,; we created a lookup class which has the sole purpose to register all; declarations, so later they can be looked up by subsequent import requests.; This is the ``ASTImporterLookupTable`` class. This lookup table should be; shared amongst the different ``ASTImporter`` instances if they happen to import; to the very same ""to"" context. This is why we can use the importer specific; lookup only via the ``ASTImporterSharedState`` class. ExternalASTSource; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ``ExternalASTSource`` is an abstract interface associated with the; ``ASTContext`` class.

For example, in the; case of an if-statement, the terminator refers to the ``IfStmt`` object in the; AST that represented the given branch. To illustrate, consider the following code example:. .. code-block:: c++. int foo(int x) {; x = x + 1;; if (x > 2); x++;; else {; x += 2;; x *= 2;; }. return x;; }. After invoking the parser+semantic analyzer on this code fragment, the AST of; the body of ``foo`` is referenced by a single ``Stmt*``. We can then construct; an instance of ``CFG`` representing the control-flow graph of this function; body by single call to a static class method:. .. code-block:: c++. Stmt *FooBody = ...; std::unique_ptr<CFG> FooCFG = CFG::buildCFG(FooBody);. Along with providing an interface to iterate over its ``CFGBlocks``, the; ``CFG`` class also provides methods that are useful for debugging and; visualizing CFGs. For example, the method ``CFG::dump()`` dumps a; pretty-printed version of the CFG to standard error. This is especially useful; when one is using a debugger such as gdb. For example, here is the output of; ``FooCFG->dump()``:. .. code-block:: text. [ B5 (ENTRY) ]; Predecessors (0):; Successors (1): B4.

First, in general, we prefer the AST to retain the source; code as close to how the user wrote it as possible. This means that if they; wrote ""``5+4``"", we want to keep the addition and two constants in the AST, we; don't want to fold to ""``9``"". This means that constant folding in various; ways turns into a tree walk that needs to handle the various cases. However, there are places in both C and C++ that require constants to be; folded. For example, the C standard defines what an ""integer constant; expression"" (i-c-e) is with very precise and specific requirements. The; language then requires i-c-e's in a lot of places (for example, the size of a; bitfield, the value for a case statement, etc). For these, we have to be able; to constant fold the constants, to do semantic checks (e.g., verify bitfield; size is non-negative and that case statements aren't duplicated). We aim for; Clang to be very pedantic about this, diagnosing cases when the code does not; use an i-c-e where one is required, but accepting the code unless running with; ``-pedantic-errors``. Things get a little bit more tricky when it comes to compatibility with; real-world source code. Specifically, GCC has historically accepted a huge; superset of expressions as i-c-e's, and a lot of real world code depends on; this unfortunate accident of history (including, e.g., the glibc system; headers). GCC accepts anything its ""fold"" optimizer is capable of reducing to; an integer constant, which means that the definition of what it accepts changes; as its optimizer does. One example is that GCC accepts things like ""``case; X-X:``"" even when ``X`` is a variable, because it can fold this to 0. Another issue are how constants interact with the extensions we support, such; as ``__builtin_constant_p``, ``__builtin_inf``, ``__extension__`` and many; others. C99 obviously does not specify the semantics of any of these; extensions, and the definition of i-c-e does not include them.

Expressions and statements are one of the most fundamental constructs within a; compiler, because they interact with many different parts of the AST, semantic; analysis, and IR generation. Therefore, adding a new expression or statement; kind into Clang requires some care. The following list details the various; places in Clang where an expression or statement needs to be introduced, along; with patterns to follow to ensure that the new expression or statement works; well across all of the C languages. We focus on expressions, but statements; are similar. #. Introduce parsing actions into the parser. Recursive-descent parsing is; mostly self-explanatory, but there are a few things that are worth keeping; in mind:. * Keep as much source location information as possible! You'll want it later; to produce great diagnostics and support Clang's various features that map; between source code and the AST.; * Write tests for all of the ""bad"" parsing cases, to make sure your recovery; is good. If you have matched delimiters (e.g., parentheses, square; brackets, etc.), use ``Parser::BalancedDelimiterTracker`` to give nice; diagnostics when things go wrong. #. Introduce semantic analysis actions into ``Sema``. Semantic analysis should; always involve two functions: an ``ActOnXXX`` function that will be called; directly from the parser, and a ``BuildXXX`` function that performs the; actual semantic analysis and will (eventually!) build the AST node. It's; fairly common for the ``ActOnCXX`` function to do very little (often just; some minor translation from the parser's representation to ``Sema``'s; representation of the same thing), but the separation is still important:; C++ template instantiation, for example, should always call the ``BuildXXX``; variant.

This mode matches the emitted diagnostic when the; text appears as a substring at any position of the emitted message. To enable matching against desired strings that contain `}}` or `{{`, the; string-mode parser accepts opening delimiters of more than two curly braces,; like `{{{`. It then looks for a closing delimiter of equal ""width"" (i.e `}}}`).; For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // expected-note {{{evaluates to '{{2, 3, 4}} == {0, 3, 4}'}}}. The intent is to allow the delimeter to be wider than the longest `{` or `}`; brace sequence in the content, so that if your expected text contains `{{{`; (three braces) it may be delimited with `{{{{` (four braces), and so on.

The difference is that the former are ignored by; default, and the later warn by default. The ``WARNING`` severity is used for; constructs that are valid in the currently selected source language but that; are dubious in some way. The ``REMARK`` severity provides generic information; about the compilation that is not necessarily related to any dubious code. The; ``NOTE`` level is used to staple more information onto previous diagnostics. These *severities* are mapped into a smaller set (the ``Diagnostic::Level``; enum, {``Ignored``, ``Note``, ``Remark``, ``Warning``, ``Error``, ``Fatal``}) of; output; *levels* by the diagnostics subsystem based on various configuration options.; Clang internally supports a fully fine grained mapping mechanism that allows; you to map almost any diagnostic to the output level that you want. The only; diagnostics that cannot be mapped are ``NOTE``\ s, which always follow the; severity of the previously emitted diagnostic and ``ERROR``\ s, which can only; be mapped to ``Fatal`` (it is not possible to turn an error into a warning, for; example). Diagnostic mappings are used in many ways. For example, if the user specifies; ``-pedantic``, ``EXTENSION`` maps to ``Warning``, if they specify; ``-pedantic-errors``, it turns into ``Error``. This is used to implement; options like ``-Wunused_macros``, ``-Wundef`` etc. Mapping to ``Fatal`` should only be used for diagnostics that are considered so; severe that error recovery won't be able to recover sensibly from them (thus; spewing a ton of bogus errors).

As mentioned above, annotation tokens are not returned by the preprocessor,; they are formed on demand by the parser. This means that the parser has to be; aware of cases where an annotation could occur and form it where appropriate.; This is somewhat similar to how the parser handles Translation Phase 6 of C99:; String Concatenation (see C99 5.1.1.2). In the case of string concatenation,; the preprocessor just returns distinct ``tok::string_literal`` and; ``tok::wide_string_literal`` tokens and the parser eats a sequence of them; wherever the grammar indicates that a string literal can occur. In order to do this, whenever the parser expects a ``tok::identifier`` or; ``tok::coloncolon``, it should call the ``TryAnnotateTypeOrScopeToken`` or; ``TryAnnotateCXXScopeToken`` methods to form the annotation token.

The only; diagnostics that cannot be mapped are ``NOTE``\ s, which always follow the; severity of the previously emitted diagnostic and ``ERROR``\ s, which can only; be mapped to ``Fatal`` (it is not possible to turn an error into a warning, for; example). Diagnostic mappings are used in many ways. For example, if the user specifies; ``-pedantic``, ``EXTENSION`` maps to ``Warning``, if they specify; ``-pedantic-errors``, it turns into ``Error``. This is used to implement; options like ``-Wunused_macros``, ``-Wundef`` etc. Mapping to ``Fatal`` should only be used for diagnostics that are considered so; severe that error recovery won't be able to recover sensibly from them (thus; spewing a ton of bogus errors). One example of this class of error are failure; to ``#include`` a file. The Format String; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The format string for the diagnostic is very simple, but it has some power. It; takes the form of a string in English with markers that indicate where and how; arguments to the diagnostic are inserted and formatted. For example, here are; some simple format strings:. .. code-block:: c++. ""binary integer literals are an extension""; ""format string contains '\\0' within the string body""; ""more '%%' conversions than data arguments""; ""invalid operands to binary expression (%0 and %1)""; ""overloaded '%0' must be a %select{unary|binary|unary or binary}2 operator""; "" (has %1 parameter%s1)"". These examples show some important points of format strings. You can use any; plain ASCII character in the diagnostic string except ""``%``"" without a; problem, but these are C strings, so you have to use and be aware of all the C; escape sequences (as in the second example).

Each translation completely; replaces the format string for the diagnostic. .. _SourceLocation:; .. _SourceManager:. The ``SourceLocation`` and ``SourceManager`` classes; ----------------------------------------------------. Strangely enough, the ``SourceLocation`` class represents a location within the; source code of the program. Important design points include:. #. ``sizeof(SourceLocation)`` must be extremely small, as these are embedded; into many AST nodes and are passed around often. Currently it is 32 bits.; #. ``SourceLocation`` must be a simple value object that can be efficiently; copied.; #. We should be able to represent a source location for any byte of any input; file. This includes in the middle of tokens, in whitespace, in trigraphs,; etc.; #. A ``SourceLocation`` must encode the current ``#include`` stack that was; active when the location was processed. For example, if the location; corresponds to a token, it should contain the set of ``#include``\ s active; when the token was lexed. This allows us to print the ``#include`` stack; for a diagnostic.; #. ``SourceLocation`` must be able to describe macro expansions, capturing both; the ultimate instantiation point and the source of the original character; data. In practice, the ``SourceLocation`` works together with the ``SourceManager``; class to encode two pieces of information about a location: its spelling; location and its expansion location.

The last step is implementing the ``-cc1`` command line argument; parsing/generation that initializes/serializes the option class (in our case; ``CodeGenOptions``) stored within ``CompilerInvocation``. This can be done; automatically by using the marshalling annotations on the option definition:. .. code-block:: diff. // Options.td. def fpass_plugin_EQ : Joined<[""-""], ""fpass-plugin="">,; Group<f_Group>, Flags<[CC1Option]>,; HelpText<""Load pass plugin from a dynamic shared object file."">,; + MarshallingInfoStringVector<CodeGenOpts<""PassPlugins"">>;. Inner workings of the system are introduced in the :ref:`marshalling; infrastructure <OptionMarshalling>` section and the available annotations are; listed :ref:`here <OptionMarshallingAnnotations>`. In case the marshalling infrastructure does not support the desired semantics,; consider simplifying it to fit the existing model. This makes the command line; more uniform and reduces the amount of custom, manually written code. Remember; that the ``-cc1`` command line interface is intended only for Clang developers,; meaning it does not need to mirror the driver interface, maintain backward; compatibility or be compatible with GCC. If the option semantics cannot be encoded via marshalling annotations, you can; resort to parsing/serializing the command line arguments manually:. .. code-block:: diff. // CompilerInvocation.cpp. static bool ParseCodeGenArgs(CodeGenOptions &Opts, ArgList &Args /*...*/) {; // ... + Opts.PassPlugins = Args.getAllArgValues(OPT_fpass_plugin_EQ);; }. static void GenerateCodeGenArgs(const CodeGenOptions &Opts,; SmallVectorImpl<const char *> &Args,; CompilerInvocation::StringAllocator SA /*...*/) {; // ... + for (const std::string &PassPlugin : Opts.PassPlugins); + GenerateArg(Args, OPT_fpass_plugin_EQ, PassPlugin, SA);; }.

The main; interface to this library for outside clients is the large ``Preprocessor``; class. It contains the various pieces of state that are required to coherently; read tokens out of a translation unit. The core interface to the ``Preprocessor`` object (once it is set up) is the; ``Preprocessor::Lex`` method, which returns the next :ref:`Token <Token>` from; the preprocessor stream. There are two types of token providers that the; preprocessor is capable of reading from: a buffer lexer (provided by the; :ref:`Lexer <Lexer>` class) and a buffered token stream (provided by the; :ref:`TokenLexer <TokenLexer>` class). .. _Token:. The Token class; ---------------. The ``Token`` class is used to represent a single lexed token. Tokens are; intended to be used by the lexer/preprocess and parser libraries, but are not; intended to live beyond them (for example, they should not live in the ASTs). Tokens most often live on the stack (or some other location that is efficient; to access) as the parser is running, but occasionally do get buffered up. For; example, macro definitions are stored as a series of tokens, and the C++; front-end periodically needs to buffer tokens up for tentative parsing and; various pieces of look-ahead. As such, the size of a ``Token`` matters. On a; 32-bit system, ``sizeof(Token)`` is currently 16 bytes. Tokens occur in two forms: :ref:`annotation tokens <AnnotationToken>` and; normal tokens. Normal tokens are those returned by the lexer, annotation; tokens represent semantic information and are produced by the parser, replacing; normal tokens in the token stream. Normal tokens contain the following; information:. * **A SourceLocation** --- This indicates the location of the start of the; token. * **A length** --- This stores the length of the token as stored in the; ``SourceBuffer``. For tokens that include them, this length includes; trigraphs and escaped newlines which are ignored by later phases of the; compiler.

While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"". Doing this; requires properly keeping typedef information (for example, the type of ``X``; is ""``foo``"", not ""``int``""), and requires properly propagating it through the; various operators (for example, the type of ``*Y`` is ""``foo``"", not; ""``int``""). In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"". Representing types like this is great for diagnostics, because the; user-specified type is always immediately available. There are two problems; with this: first, various semantic checks need to make judgements about the; *actual structure* of a type, ignoring typedefs. Second, we need an efficient; way to query whether two types are structurally identical to each other,; ignoring typedefs. The solution to both of these problems is the idea of; canonical types. .. _CanonicalType:. Canonical Types; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every instance of the ``Type`` class contains a canonical type pointer. For; simple types with no typedefs involved (e.g., ""``int``"", ""``int*``"",; ""``int**``""), the type just points to itself. For types that have a typedef; somewhere in their structure (e.g., ""``foo``"", ""``foo*``"", ""``foo**``"",; ""``bar``""), the canonical type pointer points to their structurally equivalent; type without any typedefs (e.g., ""``int``"", ""``int*``"", ""``int**``"", and; ""``int*``"" respectively). This design provides a constant time operation (dereferencing the canonical type; pointer) that gives us access to the structure of types. For example, we can; trivially tell that ""``bar``"" and ""``foo*``"" are the same type by dereferencing; their canonical type pointers and doing a pointer comparison (they both point; to the single """,MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

In order to determine the; type, we need to get the instance of ``PointerType`` that best captures the; typedef information in the program. If the type of the expression is literally; a ``PointerType``, we can return that, otherwise we have to dig through the; typedefs to find the pointer type. For example, if the subexpression had type; ""``foo*``"", we could return that type as the result. If the subexpression had; type ""``bar``"", we want to return ""``foo*``"" (note that we do *not* want; ""``int*``""). In order to provide all of this, ``Type`` has a; ``getAsPointerType()`` method that checks whether the type is structurally a; ``PointerType`` and, if so, returns the best one.

The ``QualType`` class is designed as a trivial value class that is small,; passed by-value and is efficient to query.

By storing the type qualifiers as bits in the conceptual pair, it is extremely; efficient to get the set of qualifiers on a ``QualType`` (just return the field; of the pair), add a type qualifier (which is a trivial constant-time operation; that sets a bit), and remove one or more type qualifiers (just return a; ``QualType`` with the bitfield set to empty). Further, because the bits are stored outside of the type itself, we do not need; to create duplicates of types with different sets of qualifiers (i.e. there is; only a single heap allocated ""``int``"" type: ""``const int``"" and ""``volatile; const int``"" both point to the same heap a",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

Some; start with ``err_``, ``warn_``, ``ext_`` to encode the severity into the name.; Since the enum is referenced in the C++ code that produces the diagnostic, it; is somewhat useful for it to be reasonably short. The severity of the diagnostic comes from the set {``NOTE``, ``REMARK``,; ``WARNING``,; ``EXTENSION``, ``EXTWARN``, ``ERROR``}. The ``ERROR`` severity is used for; diagnostics indicating the program is never acceptable under any circumstances.; When an error is emitted, the AST for the input code may not be fully built.; The ``EXTENSION`` and ``EXTWARN`` severities are used for extensions to the; language that Clang accepts.

Arguments to the diagnostic are numbered according to how they are specified by; the C++ code that :ref:`produces them <internals-producing-diag>`, and are; referenced by ``%0`` .. ``%9``. If you have more than 10 arguments to your; diagnostic, you are doing something wrong :). Unlike ``printf``, there is no; requirement that arguments to the diagnostic end up in the output in the same; order as they are specified, you could have a format string with ""``%1 %0``""; that swaps them, for example. The text in between the percent and digit are; formatting instructions. If there are no instructions, the argument is just; turned into a string and substituted in. Here are some ""best practices"" for writing the English format string:. * Keep the string short. It should ideally fit in the 80 column limit of the; ``DiagnosticKinds.td`` file. This avoids the diagnostic wrapping when; printed, and forces you to think about the important point you are conveying; with the diagnostic.; * Take advantage of location information. The user will be able to see the; line and location of the caret, so you don't need to tell them that the; problem is with the 4th argument to the function: just point to it.; * Do not capitalize the diagnostic string, and do not end it with a period.; * If you need to quote something in the diagnostic string, use single quotes. Diagnostics should never take random English strings as arguments: you; shouldn't use ""``you have a problem with %0``"" and pass in things like ""``your; argument``"" or ""``your return value``"" as arguments. Doing this prevents; :ref:`translating <internals-diag-translation>` the Clang diagnostics to other; languages (because they'll get random English words in their otherwise; localized diagnostic). The exceptions to this are C/C++ language keywords; (e.g., ``auto``, ``const``, ``mutable``, etc) and C/C++ operators (``/=``).; Note that things like ""po",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

Various components of Clang (e.g., the preprocessor, ``Sema``,; etc.) provide a helper function named ""``Diag``"". It creates a diagnostic and; accepts the arguments, ranges, and other information that goes along with it. For example, the binary expression error comes from code like this:. .. code-block:: c++. if (various things that are bad); Diag(Loc, diag::err_typecheck_invalid_operands); << lex->getType() << rex->getType(); << lex->getSourceRange() << rex->getSourceRange();. This shows that use of the ``Diag`` method: it takes a location (a; :ref:`SourceLocation <SourceLocation>` object) and a diagnostic enum value; (which matches the name from ``Diagnostic*Kinds.td``). If the diagnostic takes; arguments, they are specified with the ``<<`` operator: the first argument; becomes ``%0``, the second becomes ``%1``, etc. The diagnostic interface; allows you to specify arguments of many different types, including ``int`` and; ``unsigned`` for integer arguments, ``const char*`` and ``std::string`` for; string arguments, ``DeclarationName`` and ``const IdentifierInfo *`` for names,; ``QualType`` for types, etc. ``SourceRange``\ s are also specified with the; ``<<`` operator, but do not have a specific ordering requirement. As you can see, adding and producing a diagnostic is pretty straightforward.; The hard part is deciding exactly what you need to say to help the user,; picking a suitable wording, and providing the information needed to format it; correctly. The good news is that the call site that issues a diagnostic should; be completely independent of how the diagnostic is formatted and in what; language it is rendered. Fix-It Hints; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. In some cases, the front end emits diagnostics when it is clear that some small; change to the source code would fix the problem.

Option Marshalling Infrastructure; ---------------------------------. The option marshalling infrastructure automates the parsing of the Clang; ``-cc1`` frontend command line arguments into ``CompilerInvocation`` and their; generation from ``CompilerInvocation``. The system replaces lots of repetitive; C++ code with simple, declarative tablegen annotations and it's being used for; the majority of the ``-cc1`` command line interface. This section provides an; overview of the system. **Note:** The marshalling infrastructure is not intended for driver-only; options. Only options of the ``-cc1`` frontend need to be marshalled to/from; ``CompilerInvocation`` instance. To read and modify contents of ``CompilerInvocation``, the marshalling system; uses key paths, which are declared in two steps. First, a tablegen definition; for the ``CompilerInvocation`` member is created by inheriting from; ``KeyPathAndMacro``:. .. code-block:: text. // Options.td. class LangOpts<string field> : KeyPathAndMacro<""LangOpts->"", field, ""LANG_""> {}; // CompilerInvocation member ^^^^^^^^^^; // OPTION_WITH_MARSHALLING prefix ^^^^^.

Since this is uncommon,; many pieces of code can fast-path on tokens that did not need cleaning. One interesting (and somewhat unusual) aspect of normal tokens is that they; don't contain any semantic information about the lexed value. For example, if; the token was a pp-number token, we do not represent the value of the number; that was lexed (this is left for later pieces of code to decide).; Additionally, the lexer library has no notion of typedef names vs variable; names: both are returned as identifiers, and the parser is left to decide; whether a specific identifier is a typedef or a variable (tracking this; requires scope information among other things). The parser can do this; translation by replacing tokens returned by the preprocessor with ""Annotation; Tokens"". .. _AnnotationToken:. Annotation Tokens; -----------------. Annotation tokens are tokens that are synthesized by the parser and injected; into the preprocessor's token stream (replacing existing tokens) to record; semantic information found by the parser. For example, if ""``foo``"" is found; to be a typedef, the ""``foo``"" ``tok::identifier`` token is replaced with an; ``tok::annot_typename``. This is useful for a couple of reasons: 1) this makes; it easy to handle qualified type names (e.g., ""``foo::bar::baz<42>::t``"") in; C++ as a single ""token"" in the parser. 2) if the parser backtracks, the; reparse does not need to redo semantic analysis to determine whether a token; sequence is a variable, type, template, etc. Annotation tokens are created by the parser and reinjected into the parser's; token stream (when backtracking is enabled). Because they can only exist in; tokens that the preprocessor-proper is done with, it doesn't need to keep; around flags like ""start of line"" that the preprocessor uses to do its job.; Additionally, an annotation token may ""cover"" a sequence of preprocessor tokens; (e.g., ""``a::b::c``"" is five preprocessor tok",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

The later use is used by; ``_Pragma`` and will most likely be used to handle unbounded look-ahead for the; C++ parser. .. _MultipleIncludeOpt:. The ``MultipleIncludeOpt`` class; --------------------------------. The ``MultipleIncludeOpt`` class implements a really simple little state; machine that is used to detect the standard ""``#ifndef XX`` / ``#define XX``""; idiom that people typically use to prevent multiple inclusion of headers. If a; buffer uses this idiom and is subsequently ``#include``'d, the preprocessor can; simply check to see whether the guarding condition is defined or not. If so,; the preprocessor can completely ignore the include of the header. .. _Parser:. The Parser Library; ==================. This library contains a recursive-descent parser that polls tokens from the; preprocessor and notifies a client of the parsing progress. Historically, the parser used to talk to an abstract ``Action`` interface that; had virtual methods for parse events, for example ``ActOnBinOp()``. When Clang; grew C++ support, the parser stopped supporting general ``Action`` clients --; it now always talks to the :ref:`Sema library <Sema>`.

These cases tend to be fragile; mutable AST state should be avoided where; possible. As a consequence of this design principle, we typically do not provide setters; for AST state. (Some are provided for short-term modifications intended to be; used immediately after an AST node is created and before it's ""published"" as; part of the complete AST, or where language semantics require after-the-fact; updates.). Faithfulness; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The AST intends to provide a representation of the program that is faithful to; the original source. We intend for it to be possible to write refactoring tools; using only information stored in, or easily reconstructible from, the Clang AST.; This means that the AST representation should either not desugar source-level; constructs to simpler forms, or -- where made necessary by language semantics; or a clear engineering tradeoff -- should desugar minimally and wrap the result; in a construct representing the original source form. For example, ``CXXForRangeStmt`` directly represents the syntactic form of a; range-based for statement, but also holds a semantic representation of the; range declaration and iterator declarations. It does not contain a; fully-desugared ``ForStmt``, however. Some AST nodes (for example, ``ParenExpr``) represent only syntax, and others; (for example, ``ImplicitCastExpr``) represent only semantics, but most nodes; will represent a combination of syntax and associated semantics. Inheritance; is typically used when representing different (but related) syntaxes for nodes; with the same or similar semantics. .. _Type:.

The name is a C++ using directive. Using directives are not really; NamedDecls, in that they all have the same name, but they are; implemented as such in order to store them in DeclContext; effectively. ``DeclarationName``\ s are cheap to create, copy, and compare. They require; only a single pointer's worth of storage in the common cases (identifiers,; zero- and one-argument Objective-C selectors) and use dense, uniqued storage; for the other kinds of names. Two ``DeclarationName``\ s can be compared for; equality (``==``, ``!=``) using a simple bitwise comparison, can be ordered; with ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, and ``>=`` (which provide a lexicographical ordering; for normal identifiers but an unspecified ordering for other kinds of names),; and can be placed into LLVM ``DenseMap``\ s and ``DenseSet``\ s. ``DeclarationName`` instances can be created in different ways depending on; what kind of name the instance will store. Normal identifiers; (``IdentifierInfo`` pointers) and Objective-C selectors (``Selector``) can be; implicitly converted to ``DeclarationNames``.

Declaration contexts in; Clang are represented by the ``DeclContext`` class, from which the various; declaration-context AST nodes (``TranslationUnitDecl``, ``NamespaceDecl``,; ``RecordDecl``, ``FunctionDecl``, etc.) will derive. The ``DeclContext`` class; provides several facilities common to each declaration context:. Source-centric vs. Semantics-centric View of Declarations. ``DeclContext`` provides two views of the declarations stored within a; declaration context. The source-centric view accurately represents the; program source code as written, including multiple declarations of entities; where present (see the section :ref:`Redeclarations and Overloads; <Redeclarations>`), while the semantics-centric view represents the program; semantics. The two views are kept synchronized by semantic analysis while; the ASTs are being constructed. Storage of declarations within that context. Every declaration context can contain some number of declarations. For; example, a C++ class (represented by ``RecordDecl``) contains various member; functions, fields, nested types, and so on. All of these declarations will; be stored within the ``DeclContext``, and one can iterate over the; declarations via [``DeclContext::decls_begin()``,; ``DeclContext::decls_end()``). This mechanism provides the source-centric; view of declarations in the context. Lookup of declarations within that context. The ``DeclContext`` structure provides efficient name lookup for names within; that declaration context. For example, if ``N`` is a namespace we can look; for the name ``N::f`` using ``DeclContext::lookup``.

Corresponding; members in each definition of such multiply-defined classes are identified; either by redeclaration chains (if the members are ``Redeclarable``); or by simply a pointer to the canonical declaration (if the declarations; are not ``Redeclarable`` -- in that case, a ``Mergeable`` base class is used; instead). Error Handling; --------------. Clang produces an AST even when the code contains errors. Clang won't generate; and optimize code for it, but it's used as parsing continues to detect further; errors in the input. Clang-based tools also depend on such ASTs, and IDEs in; particular benefit from a high-quality AST for broken code. In presence of errors, clang uses a few error-recovery strategies to present the; broken code in the AST:. - correcting errors: in cases where clang is confident about the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics. Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery. Prior to Recovery AST, a mismatched-argument function call; expression was dropped though a CallExpr was created for semantic analysis. With these strategies, clang surfaces better diagnostics, and provides AST; consumers",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

One example of a cycle is the connection between a; ``ClassTemplateDecl`` and its ""templated"" ``CXXRecordDecl``.

In C, two types are structurally equivalent if they are *compatible types*. For; a formal definition of *compatible types*, please refer to 6.2.7/1 in the C11; standard. However, there is no definition for *compatible types* in the C++; standard.

Typically instances of ``CFG`` are; constructed for function bodies (usually an instance of ``CompoundStmt``), but; can also be instantiated to represent the control-flow of any class that; subclasses ``Stmt``, which includes simple expressions. Control-flow graphs; are especially useful for performing `flow- or path-sensitive; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_flow_analysis#Sensitivities>`_ program; analyses on a given function. Basic Blocks; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. Concretely, an instance of ``CFG`` is a collection of basic blocks. Each basic; block is an instance of ``CFGBlock``, which simply contains an ordered sequence; of ``Stmt*`` (each referring to statements in the AST). The ordering of; statements within a block indicates unconditional flow of control from one; statement to the next. :ref:`Conditional control-flow; <ConditionalControlFlow>` is represented using edges between basic blocks. The; statements within a given ``CFGBlock`` can be traversed using the; ``CFGBlock::*iterator`` interface. A ``CFG`` object owns the instances of ``CFGBlock`` within the control-flow; graph it represents. Each ``CFGBlock`` within a CFG is also uniquely numbered; (accessible via ``CFGBlock::getBlockID()``). Currently the number is based on; the ordering the blocks were created, but no assumptions should be made on how; ``CFGBlocks`` are numbered other than their numbers are unique and that they; are numbered from 0..N-1 (where N is the number of basic blocks in the CFG). Entry and Exit Blocks; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Each instance of ``CFG`` contains two special blocks: an *entry* block; (accessible via ``CFG::getEntry()``), which has no incoming edges, and an; *exit* block (accessible via ``CFG::getExit()``), which has no outgoing edges.; Neither block contains any statements, and they serve the role of providing a; clear entrance and exit for a body of code such as a function body.

A terminator is; simply the statement that caused the control-flow, and is used to identify the; nature of the conditional control-flow between blocks. For example, in the; case of an if-statement, the terminator refers to the ``IfStmt`` object in the; AST that represented the given branch. To illustrate, consider the following code example:. .. code-block:: c++. int foo(int x) {; x = x + 1;; if (x > 2); x++;; else {; x += 2;; x *= 2;; }. return x;; }. After invoking the parser+semantic analyzer on this code fragment, the AST of; the body of ``foo`` is referenced by a single ``Stmt*``. We can then construct; an instance of ``CFG`` representing the control-flow graph of this function; body by single call to a static class method:. .. code-block:: c++. Stmt *FooBody = ...; std::unique_ptr<CFG> FooCFG = CFG::buildCFG(FooBody);. Along with providing an interface to iterate over its ``CFGBlocks``, the; ``CFG`` class also provides methods that are useful for debugging and; visualizing CFGs. For example, the method ``CFG::dump()`` dumps a; pretty-printed version of the CFG to standard error. This is especially useful; when one is using a debugger such as gdb. For example, here is the output of; ``FooCFG->dump()``:. .. code-block:: text. [ B5 (ENTRY) ]; Predecessors (0):; Successors (1): B4.

However, there are places in both C and C++ that require constants to be; folded. For example, the C standard defines what an ""integer constant; expression"" (i-c-e) is with very precise and specific requirements. The; language then requires i-c-e's in a lot of places (for example, the size of a; bitfield, the value for a case statement, etc). For these, we have to be able; to constant fold the constants, to do semantic checks (e.g., verify bitfield; size is non-negative and that case statements aren't duplicated). We aim for; Clang to be very pedantic about this, diagnosing cases when the code does not; use an i-c-e where one is required, but accepting the code unless running with; ``-pedantic-errors``. Things get a little bit more tricky when it comes to compatibility with; real-world source code. Specifically, GCC has historically accepted a huge; superset of expressions as i-c-e's, and a lot of real world code depends on; this unfortunate accident of history (including, e.g., the glibc system; headers). GCC accepts anything its ""fold"" optimizer is capable of reducing to; an integer constant, which means that the definition of what it accepts changes; as its optimizer does. One example is that GCC accepts things like ""``case; X-X:``"" even when ``X`` is a variable, because it can fold this to 0. Another issue are how constants interact with the extensions we support, such; as ``__builtin_constant_p``, ``__builtin_inf``, ``__extension__`` and many; others. C99 obviously does not specify the semantics of any of these; extensions, and the definition of i-c-e does not include them. However, these; extensions are often used in real code, and we have to have a way to reason; about them. Finally, this is not just a problem for semantic analysis.

Parsing of the attribute is determined by the various syntactic forms attributes; can take, such as GNU, C++11, and Microsoft style attributes, as well as other; information provided by the table definition of the attribute. Ultimately, the; parsed representation of an attribute object is a ``ParsedAttr`` object.; These parsed attributes chain together as a list of parsed attributes attached; to a declarator or declaration specifier. The parsing of attributes is handled; automatically by Clang, except for attributes spelled as so-called “custom”; keywords. When implementing a custom keyword attribute, the parsing of the; keyword and creation of the ``ParsedAttr`` object must be done manually. Eventually, ``Sema::ProcessDeclAttributeList()`` is called with a ``Decl`` and; a ``ParsedAttr``, at which point the parsed attribute can be transformed; into a semantic attribute. The process by which a parsed attribute is converted; into a semantic attribute depends on the attribute definition and semantic; requirements of the attribute. The end result, however, is that the semantic; attribute object is attached to the ``Decl`` object, and can be obtained by a; call to ``Decl::getAttr<T>()``.

The line number may be absolute (as above), or relative to the current line by; prefixing the number with either ``+`` or ``-``.

There is little sanity with the naming of the unique ID's right now. Some; start with ``err_``, ``warn_``, ``ext_`` to encode the severity into the name.; Since the enum is referenced in the C++ code that produces the diagnostic, it; is somewhat useful for it to be reasonably short. The severity of the diagnostic comes from the set {``NOTE``, ``REMARK``,; ``WARNING``,; ``EXTENSION``, ``EXTWARN``, ``ERROR``}.

Diagnostics should never take random English strings as arguments: you; shouldn't use ""``you have a problem with %0``"" and pass in things like ""``your; argument``"" or ""``your return value``"" as arguments. Doing this prevents; :ref:`translating <internals-diag-translation>` the Clang diagnostics to other; languages (because they'll get random English words in their otherwise; localized diagnostic). The exceptions to this are C/C++ language keywords; (e.g., ``auto``, ``const``, ``mutable``, etc) and C/C++ operators (``/=``).; Note that things like ""pointer"" and ""reference"" are not keywords. On the other; hand, you *can* include anything that comes from the user's source code,; including variable names, types, labels, etc. The ""``select``"" format can be; used to achieve this sort of thing in a localizable way, see below. Formatting a Diagnostic Argument; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Arguments to diagnostics are fully typed internally, and come from a couple; different classes: integers, types, names, and random strings. Depending on; the class of the argument, it can be optionally formatted in different ways.; This gives the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` information about what the argument means; without requiring it to use a specific presentation (consider this MVC for; Clang :). It is really easy to add format specifiers to the Clang diagnostics system, but; they should be discussed before they are added. If you are creating a lot of; repetitive diagnostics and/or have an idea for a useful formatter, please bring; it up on the cfe-dev mailing list.

The good news is that the call site that issues a diagnostic should; be completely independent of how the diagnostic is formatted and in what; language it is rendered. Fix-It Hints; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. In some cases, the front end emits diagnostics when it is clear that some small; change to the source code would fix the problem. For example, a missing; semicolon at the end of a statement or a use of deprecated syntax that is; easily rewritten into a more modern form. Clang tries very hard to emit the; diagnostic and recover gracefully in these and other cases. However, for these cases where the fix is obvious, the diagnostic can be; annotated with a hint (referred to as a ""fix-it hint"") that describes how to; change the code referenced by the diagnostic to fix the problem. For example,; it might add the missing semicolon at the end of the statement or rewrite the; use of a deprecated construct into something more palatable. Here is one such; example from the C++ front end, where we warn about the right-shift operator; changing meaning from C++98 to C++11:. .. code-block:: text. test.cpp:3:7: warning: use of right-shift operator ('>>') in template argument; will require parentheses in C++11; A<100 >> 2> *a;; ^; ( ). Here, the fix-it hint is suggesting that parentheses be added, and showing; exactly where those parentheses would be inserted into the source code. The; fix-it hints themselves describe what changes to make to the source code in an; abstract manner, which the text diagnostic printer renders as a line of; ""insertions"" below the caret line. :ref:`Other diagnostic clients; <DiagnosticConsumer>` might choose to render the code differently (e.g., as; markup inline) or even give the user the ability to automatically fix the; problem.

These cases tend to be fragile; mutable AST state should be avoided where; possible. As a consequence of this design principle, we typically do not provide setters; for AST state. (Some are provided for short-term modifications intended to be; used immediately after an AST node is created and before it's ""published"" as; part of the complete AST, or where language semantics require after-the-fact; updates.). Faithfulness; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The AST intends to provide a representation of the program that is faithful to; the original source. We intend for it to be possible to write refactoring tools; using only information stored in, or easily reconstructible from, the Clang AST.; This means that the AST representation should either not desugar source-level; constructs to simpler forms, or -- where made necessary by language semantics; or a clear engineering tradeoff -- should desugar minimally and wrap the result; in a construct representing the original source form. For example, ``CXXForRangeStmt`` directly represents the syntactic form of a; range-based for statement, but also holds a semantic representation of the; range declaration and iterator declarations. It does not contain a; fully-desugared ``ForStmt``, however. Some AST nodes (for example, ``ParenExpr``) represent only syntax, and others; (for example, ``ImplicitCastExpr``) represent only semantics, but most nodes; will represent a combination of syntax and associated semantics. Inheritance; is typically used when representing different (but related) syntaxes for nodes; with the same or similar semantics. .. _Type:.

If the type of the expression is literally; a ``PointerType``, we can return that, otherwise we have to dig through the; typedefs to find the pointer type. For example, if the subexpression had type; ""``foo*``"", we could return that type as the result. If the subexpression had; type ""``bar``"", we want to return ""``foo*``"" (note that we do *not* want; ""``int*``""). In order to provide all of this, ``Type`` has a; ``getAsPointerType()`` method that checks whether the type is structurally a; ``PointerType`` and, if so, returns the best one. If not, it returns a null; pointer. This structure is somewhat mystical, but after meditating on it, it will make; sense to you :). .. _QualType:. The ``QualType`` class; ----------------------. The ``QualType`` class is designed as a trivial value class that is small,; passed by-value and is efficient to query. The idea of ``QualType`` is that it; stores the type qualifiers (``const``, ``volatile``, ``restrict``, plus some; extended qualifiers required by language extensions) separately from the types; themselves. ``QualType`` is conceptually a pair of ""``Type*``"" and the bits; for these type qualifiers. By storing the type qualifiers as bits in the conceptual pair, it is extremely; efficient to get the set of qualifiers on a ``QualType`` (just return the field; of the pair), add a type qualifier (which is a trivial constant-time operation; that sets a bit), and remove one or more type qualifiers (just return a; ``QualType`` with the bitfield set to empty). Further, because the bits are stored outside of the type itself, we do not need; to create duplicates of types with different sets of qualifiers (i.e. there is; only a single heap allocated ""``int``"" type: ""``const int``"" and ""``volatile; const int``"" both point to the same heap allocated ""``int``"" type).

The ``DeclarationName`` class represents the name of a declaration in Clang.; Declarations in the C family of languages can take several different forms.; Most declarations are named by simple identifiers, e.g., ""``f``"" and ""``x``"" in; the function declaration ``f(int x)``. In C++, declaration names can also name; class constructors (""``Class``"" in ``struct Class { Class(); }``), class; destructors (""``~Class``""), overloaded operator names (""``operator+``""), and; conversion functions (""``operator void const *``"").

The line number in an external file may be; substituted with ``*`` meaning that any line number will match (useful where; the included file is, for example, a system header where the actual line number; may change and is not critical). As an alternative to specifying a fixed line number, the location of a; diagnostic can instead be indicated by a marker of the form ``#<marker>``.; Markers are specified by including them in a comment, and then referenced by; appending the marker to the diagnostic with ``@#<marker>``, as with:. .. code-block:: c++. #warning some text // #1; // ... other code ...; // expected-warning@#1 {{some text}}. The name of a marker used in a directive must be unique within the compilation. The simple syntax above allows each specification to match exactly one; diagnostic.

For; the rare cases where character-level source ranges information is needed we use; the ``CharSourceRange`` class. The Driver Library; ==================. The clang Driver and library are documented :doc:`here <DriverInternals>`. Precompiled Headers; ===================. Clang supports precompiled headers (:doc:`PCH <PCHInternals>`), which uses a; serialized representation of Clang's internal data structures, encoded with the; `LLVM bitstream format <https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html>`_. The Frontend Library; ====================. The Frontend library contains functionality useful for building tools on top of; the Clang libraries, for example several methods for outputting diagnostics. Compiler Invocation; -------------------. One of the classes provided by the Frontend library is ``CompilerInvocation``,; which holds information that describe current invocation of the Clang ``-cc1``; frontend. The information typically comes from the command line constructed by; the Clang driver or from clients performing custom initialization. The data; structure is split into logical units used by different parts of the compiler,; for example ``PreprocessorOptions``, ``LanguageOptions`` or ``CodeGenOptions``. Command Line Interface; ----------------------. The command line interface of the Clang ``-cc1`` frontend is defined alongside; the driver options in ``clang/Driver/Options.td``. The information making up an; option definition includes its prefix and name (for example ``-std=``), form and; position of the option value, help text, aliases and more. Each option may; belong to a certain group and can be marked with zero or more flags. Options; accepted by the ``-cc1`` frontend are marked with the ``CC1Option`` flag. Command Line Parsing; --------------------. Option definitions are processed by the ``-gen-opt-parser-defs`` tablegen; backend during early stages of the build. Options are then used for querying an; instance ``llvm::opt::ArgList``, a wrapper",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

Command Line Generation; -----------------------. Any valid ``CompilerInvocation`` created from a ``-cc1`` command line can be; also serialized back into semantically equivalent command line in a; deterministic manner. This enables features such as implicitly discovered,; explicitly built modules. ..; TODO: Create and link corresponding section in Modules.rst. Adding new Command Line Option; ------------------------------. When adding a new command line option, the first place of interest is the header; file declaring the corresponding options class (e.g. ``CodeGenOptions.h`` for; command line option that affects the code generation). Create new member; variable for the option value:. .. code-block:: diff. class CodeGenOptions : public CodeGenOptionsBase {. + /// List of dynamic shared object files to be loaded as pass plugins.; + std::vector<std::string> PassPlugins;. }. Next, declare the command line interface of the option in the tablegen file; ``clang/include/clang/Driver/Options.td``. This is done by instantiating the; ``Option`` class (defined in ``llvm/include/llvm/Option/OptParser.td``). The; instance is typically created through one of the helper classes that encode the; acceptable ways to specify the option value on the command line:. * ``Flag`` - the option does not accept any value,; * ``Joined`` - the value must immediately follow the option name within the same; argument,; * ``Separate`` - the value must follow the option name in the next command line; argument,; * ``JoinedOrSeparate`` - the value can be specified either as ``Joined`` or; ``Separate``,; * ``CommaJoined`` - the values are comma-separated and must immediately follow; the option name within the same argument (see ``Wl,`` for an example).

In order to do this, whenever the parser expects a ``tok::identifier`` or; ``tok::coloncolon``, it should call the ``TryAnnotateTypeOrScopeToken`` or; ``TryAnnotateCXXScopeToken`` methods to form the annotation token. These; methods will maximally form the specified annotation tokens and replace the; current token with them, if applicable.

(Note that because ``f`` can be redeclared at block scope, or in a friend; declaration, etc. it is possible that the declaration of ``f`` found by name; lookup will not be the most recent one.). In the semantics-centric view, overloading of functions is represented; explicitly. For example, given two declarations of a function ""``g``"" that are; overloaded, e.g.,. .. code-block:: c++. void g();; void g(int);. the ``DeclContext::lookup`` operation will return a; ``DeclContext::lookup_result`` that contains a range of iterators over; declarations of ""``g``"".

Lexical and Semantic Contexts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Each declaration has two potentially different declaration contexts: a; *lexical* context, which corresponds to the source-centric view of the; declaration context, and a *semantic* context, which corresponds to the; semantics-centric view. The lexical context is accessible via; ``Decl::getLexicalDeclContext`` while the semantic context is accessible via; ``Decl::getDeclContext``, both of which return ``DeclContext`` pointers. For; most declarations, the two contexts are identical. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. class X {; public:; void f(int x);; };. Here, the semantic and lexical contexts of ``X::f`` are the ``DeclContext``; associated with the class ``X`` (itself stored as a ``RecordDecl`` AST node).; However, we can now define ``X::f`` out-of-line:. .. code-block:: c++. void X::f(int x = 17) { /* ... */ }.

Because the same entity can be defined multiple times in different modules,; it is also possible for there to be multiple definitions of (for instance); a ``CXXRecordDecl``, all of which describe a definition of the same class.; In such a case, only one of those ""definitions"" is considered by Clang to be; the definition of the class, and the others are treated as non-defining; declarations that happen to also contain member declarations. Corresponding; members in each definition of such multiply-defined classes are identified; either by redeclaration chains (if the members are ``Redeclarable``); or by simply a pointer to the canonical declaration (if the declarations; are not ``Redeclarable`` -- in that case, a ``Mergeable`` base class is used; instead). Error Handling; --------------. Clang produces an AST even when the code contains errors. Clang won't generate; and optimize code for it, but it's used as parsing continues to detect further; errors in the input. Clang-based tools also depend on such ASTs, and IDEs in; particular benefit from a high-quality AST for broken code. In presence of errors, clang uses a few error-recovery strategies to present the; broken code in the AST:. - correcting errors: in cases where clang is confident about the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics. Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery. Prior to Recovery AST, a mismatched-argument function call; expression was dropped though a CallExpr ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

However, jamming the data we; have into CallExpr forces us to weaken its invariants, e.g. arg count may be; wrong. This would introduce a huge burden on consumers of the AST to handle such; ""impossible"" cases. So when we're representing (rather than correcting) errors,; we use a distinct recovery node type with extremely weak invariants instead. ``RecoveryExpr`` is the only recovery node so far. In practice, broken decls; need more detailed semantics preserved (the current ``Invalid`` flag works; fairly well), and completely broken statements with interesting internal; structure are rare (so dropping the statements is OK). Types and dependence; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``RecoveryExpr`` is an ``Expr``, so it must have a type. In many cases the true; type can't really be known until the code is corrected (e.g. a call to a; function that doesn't exist). And it means that we can't properly perform type; checks on some containing constructs, such as ``return 42 + unknownFunction()``. To model this, we generalize the concept of dependence from C++ templates to; mean dependence on a template parameter or how an error is repaired. The; ``RecoveryExpr`` ``unknownFunction()`` has the totally unknown type; ``DependentTy``, and this suppresses type-based analysis in the same way it; would inside a template. In cases where we are confident about the concrete type (e.g. the return type; for a broken non-overloaded function call), the ``RecoveryExpr`` will have this; type. This allows more code to be typechecked, and produces a better AST and; more diagnostics. For example:. .. code-block:: C++. unknownFunction().size() // .size() is a CXXDependentScopeMemberExpr; std::string(42).size() // .size() is a resolved MemberExpr. Whether or not the ``RecoveryExpr`` has a dependent type, it is always; considered value-dependent, because its value isn't well-defined until the error; is resolved.

As a best; practice, before creating the node in the ""to"" context, avoid importing of; other nodes which are not needed for the constructor of node ``A``. Error Handling; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

However, in case of dependency cycles, this is not enough,; because we strive to mark the erroneous nodes so clients can act upon. In those; cases, we have to keep track of the errors for those nodes which are; intermediate nodes of a cycle. An **import path** is the list of the AST nodes which we visit during an Import; call. If node ``A`` depends on node ``B`` then the path contains an ``A->B``; edge. From the call stack of the import functions, we can read the very same; path.

The ``CFG`` class is designed to represent a source-level control-flow graph; for a single statement (``Stmt*``). Typically instances of ``CFG`` are; constructed for function bodies (usually an instance of ``CompoundStmt``), but; can also be instantiated to represent the control-flow of any class that; subclasses ``Stmt``, which includes simple expressions. Control-flow graphs; are especially useful for performing `flow- or path-sensitive; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_flow_analysis#Sensitivities>`_ program; analyses on a given function. Basic Blocks; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. Concretely, an instance of ``CFG`` is a collection of basic blocks. Each basic; block is an instance of ``CFGBlock``, which simply contains an ordered sequence; of ``Stmt*`` (each referring to statements in the AST). The ordering of; statements within a block indicates unconditional flow of control from one; statement to the next. :ref:`Conditional control-flow; <ConditionalControlFlow>` is represented using edges between basic blocks. The; statements within a given ``CFGBlock`` can be traversed using the; ``CFGBlock::*iterator`` interface. A ``CFG`` object owns the instances of ``CFGBlock`` within the control-flow; graph it represents.

Thus; pointers to subclasses of ``Expr`` can appear in the list of statements in a; block, and not just subclasses of ``Stmt`` that refer to proper C statements. The terminator of block B4 is a pointer to the ``IfStmt`` object in the AST.; The pretty-printer outputs ``if [B4.2]`` because the condition expression of; the if-statement has an actual place in the basic block, and thus the; terminator is essentially *referring* to the expression that is the second; statement of block B4 (i.e., B4.2). In this manner, conditions for; control-flow (which also includes conditions for loops and switch statements); are hoisted into the actual basic block. .. Implicit Control-Flow; .. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. .. A key design principle of the ``CFG`` class was to not require any; .. transformations to the AST in order to represent control-flow. Thus the; .. ``CFG`` does not perform any ""lowering"" of the statements in an AST: loops; .. are not transformed into guarded gotos, short-circuit operations are not; .. converted to a set of if-statements, and so on. Constant Folding in the Clang AST; ---------------------------------. There are several places where constants and constant folding matter a lot to; the Clang front-end. First, in general, we prefer the AST to retain the source; code as close to how the user wrote it as possible. This means that if they; wrote ""``5+4``"", we want to keep the addition and two constants in the AST, we; don't want to fold to ""``9``"". This means that constant folding in various; ways turns into a tree walk that needs to handle the various cases. However, there are places in both C and C++ that require constants to be; folded. For example, the C standard defines what an ""integer constant; expression"" (i-c-e) is with very precise and specific requirements. The; language then requires i-c-e's in a lot of places (for example, the size of a; bitfiel",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

The; language then requires i-c-e's in a lot of places (for example, the size of a; bitfield, the value for a case statement, etc). For these, we have to be able; to constant fold the constants, to do semantic checks (e.g., verify bitfield; size is non-negative and that case statements aren't duplicated). We aim for; Clang to be very pedantic about this, diagnosing cases when the code does not; use an i-c-e where one is required, but accepting the code unless running with; ``-pedantic-errors``. Things get a little bit more tricky when it comes to compatibility with; real-world source code. Specifically, GCC has historically accepted a huge; superset of expressions as i-c-e's, and a lot of real world code depends on; this unfortunate accident of history (including, e.g., the glibc system; headers). GCC accepts anything its ""fold"" optimizer is capable of reducing to; an integer constant, which means that the definition of what it accepts changes; as its optimizer does. One example is that GCC accepts things like ""``case; X-X:``"" even when ``X`` is a variable, because it can fold this to 0. Another issue are how constants interact with the extensions we support, such; as ``__builtin_constant_p``, ``__builtin_inf``, ``__extension__`` and many; others.

We focus on expressions, but statements; are similar. #. Introduce parsing actions into the parser. Recursive-descent parsing is; mostly self-explanatory, but there are a few things that are worth keeping; in mind:. * Keep as much source location information as possible! You'll want it later; to produce great diagnostics and support Clang's various features that map; between source code and the AST.; * Write tests for all of the ""bad"" parsing cases, to make sure your recovery; is good. If you have matched delimiters (e.g., parentheses, square; brackets, etc.), use ``Parser::BalancedDelimiterTracker`` to give nice; diagnostics when things go wrong. #. Introduce semantic analysis actions into ``Sema``. Semantic analysis should; always involve two functions: an ``ActOnXXX`` function that will be called; directly from the parser, and a ``BuildXXX`` function that performs the; actual semantic analysis and will (eventually!) build the AST node. It's; fairly common for the ``ActOnCXX`` function to do very little (often just; some minor translation from the parser's representation to ``Sema``'s; representation of the same thing), but the separation is still important:; C++ template instantiation, for example, should always call the ``BuildXXX``; variant. Several notes on semantic analysis before we get into construction; of the AST:. * Your expression probably involves some types and some subexpressions.; Make sure to fully check that those types, and the types of those; subexpressions, meet your expectations. Add implicit conversions where; necessary to make sure that all of the types line up exactly the way you; want them.

Write extensive tests to check that you're getting good; diagnostics for mistakes and that you can use various forms of; subexpressions with your expression.; * When type-checking a type or subexpression, make sure to first check; whether the type is ""dependent"" (``Type::isDependentType()``) or whether a; subexpression is type-dependent (``Expr::isTypeDependent()``). If any of; these return ``true``, then you're inside a template and you can't do much; type-checking now. That's normal, and your AST node (when you get there); will have to deal with this case. At this point, you can write tests that; use your expression within templates, but don't try to instantiate the; templates.; * For each subexpression, be sure to call ``Sema::CheckPlaceholderExpr()``; to deal with ""weird"" expressions that don't behave well as subexpressions.; Then, determine whether you need to perform lvalue-to-rvalue conversions; (``Sema::DefaultLvalueConversions``) or the usual unary conversions; (``Sema::UsualUnaryConversions``), for places where the subexpression is; producing a value you intend to use.; * Your ``BuildXXX`` function will probably just return ``ExprError()`` at; this point, since you don't have an AST. That's perfectly fine, and; shouldn't impact your testing. #. Introduce an AST node for your new expression. This starts with declaring; the node in ``include/Basic/StmtNodes.td`` and creating a new class for your; expression in the appropriate ``include/AST/Expr*.h`` header. It's best to; look at the class for a similar expression to get ideas, and there are some; specific things to watch for:. * If you need to allocate memory, use the ``ASTContext`` allocator to; allocate memory. Never use raw ``malloc`` or ``new``, and never hold any; resources in an AST node, because the destructor of an AST node is never; called.; * Make sure that ``getSourceRange()`` covers the exact source range of your; expression.

On occasion, this requires some careful factoring of code to; avoid duplication.; * ``CodeGenFunction`` contains functions ``ConvertType`` and; ``ConvertTypeForMem`` that convert Clang's types (``clang::Type*`` or; ``clang::QualType``) to LLVM types. Use the former for values, and the; latter for memory locations: test with the C++ ""``bool``"" type to check; this. If you find that you are having to use LLVM bitcasts to make the; subexpressions of your expression have the type that your expression; expects, STOP! Go fix semantic analysis and the AST so that you don't; need these bitcasts.; * The ``CodeGenFunction`` class has a number of helper functions to make; certain operations easy, such as generating code to produce an lvalue or; an rvalue, or to initialize a memory location with a given value. Prefer; to use these functions rather than directly writing loads and stores,; because these functions take care of some of the tricky details for you; (e.g., for exceptions).; * If your expression requires some special behavior in the event of an; exception, look at the ``push*Cleanup`` functions in ``CodeGenFunction``; to introduce a cleanup. You shouldn't have to deal with; exception-handling directly.; * Testing is extremely important in IR generation. Use ``clang -cc1; -emit-llvm`` and `FileCheck; <https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html>`_ to verify that you're; generating the right IR. #. Teach template instantiation how to cope with your AST node, which requires; some fairly simple code:. * Make sure that your expression's constructor properly computes the flags; for type dependence (i.e., the type your expression produces can change; from one instantiation to the next), value dependence (i.e., the constant; value your expression produces can change from one instantiation to the; next), instantiation dependence (i.e., a template parameter occu",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

Often, computing these flags; just means combining the results from the various types and; subexpressions.; * Add ``TransformXXX`` and ``RebuildXXX`` functions to the ``TreeTransform``; class template in ``Sema``. ``TransformXXX`` should (recursively); transform all of the subexpressions and types within your expression,; using ``getDerived().TransformYYY``. If all of the subexpressions and; types transform without error, it will then call the ``RebuildXXX``; function, which will in turn call ``getSema().BuildXXX`` to perform; semantic analysis and build your expression.; * To test template instantiation, take those tests you wrote to make sure; that you were type checking with type-dependent expressions and dependent; types (from step #2) and instantiate those templates with various types,; some of which type-check and some that don't, and test the error messages; in each case. #. There are some ""extras"" that make other features work better. It's worth; handling these extras to give your expression complete integration into; Clang:. * Add code completion support for your expression in; ``SemaCodeComplete.cpp``.; * If your expression has types in it, or has any ""interesting"" features; other than subexpressions, extend libclang's ``CursorVisitor`` to provide; proper visitation for your expression, enabling various IDE features such; as syntax highlighting, cross-referencing, and so on.

Arguments to the diagnostic are numbered according to how they are specified by; the C++ code that :ref:`produces them <internals-producing-diag>`, and are; referenced by ``%0`` .. ``%9``.

Diagnostics should never take random English strings as arguments: you; shouldn't use ""``you have a problem with %0``"" and pass in things like ""``your; argument``"" or ""``your return value``"" as arguments. Doing this prevents; :ref:`translating <internals-diag-translation>` the Clang diagnostics to other; languages (because they'll get random English words in their otherwise; localized diagnostic).

For example, the binary expression error comes from code like this:. .. code-block:: c++. if (various things that are bad); Diag(Loc, diag::err_typecheck_invalid_operands); << lex->getType() << rex->getType(); << lex->getSourceRange() << rex->getSourceRange();. This shows that use of the ``Diag`` method: it takes a location (a; :ref:`SourceLocation <SourceLocation>` object) and a diagnostic enum value; (which matches the name from ``Diagnostic*Kinds.td``). If the diagnostic takes; arguments, they are specified with the ``<<`` operator: the first argument; becomes ``%0``, the second becomes ``%1``, etc. The diagnostic interface; allows you to specify arguments of many different types, including ``int`` and; ``unsign",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

As you can see, adding and producing a diagnostic is pretty straightforward.; The hard part is deciding exactly what you need to say to help the user,; picking a suitable wording, and providing the information needed to format it; correctly. The good news is that the call site that issues a diagnostic should; be completely independent of how the diagnostic is formatted and in what; language it is rendered. Fix-It Hints; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. In some cases, the front end emits diagnostics when it is clear that some small; change to the source code would fix the problem. For example, a missing; semicolon at the end of a statement or a use of deprecated syntax that is; easily rewritten into a more modern form. Clang tries very hard to emit the; diagnostic and recover gracefully in these and other cases. However, for these cases where the fix is obvious, the diagnostic can be; annotated with a hint (referred to as a ""fix-it hint"") that describes how to; change the code referenced by the diagnostic to fix the problem. For example,; it might add the missing semicolon at the end of the statement or rewrite the; use of a deprecated construct into something more palatable. Here is one such; example from the C++ front end, where we warn about the right-shift operator; changing meaning from C++98 to C++11:. .. code-block:: text. test.cpp:3:7: warning: use of right-shift operator ('>>') in template argument; will require parentheses in C++11; A<100 >> 2> *a;; ^; ( ).

The; fix-it hints themselves describe what changes to make to the source code in an; abstract manner, which the text diagnostic printer renders as a line of; ""insertions"" below the caret line. :ref:`Other diagnostic clients; <DiagnosticConsumer>` might choose to render the code differently (e.g., as; markup inline) or even give the user the ability to automatically fix the; problem. Fix-it hints on errors and warnings need to obey these rules:. * Since they are automatically applied if ``-Xclang -fixit`` is passed to the; driver, they should only be used when it's very likely they match the user's; intent.; * Clang must recover from errors as if the fix-it had been applied.; * Fix-it hints on a warning must not change the meaning of the code.; However, a hint may clarify the meaning as intentional, for example by adding; parentheses when the precedence of operators isn't obvious. If a fix-it can't obey these rules, put the fix-it on a note. Fix-its on notes; are not applied automatically. All fix-it hints are described by the ``FixItHint`` class, instances of which; should be attached to the diagnostic using the ``<<`` operator in the same way; that highlighted source ranges and arguments are passed to the diagnostic.; Fix-it hints can be created with one of three constructors:. * ``FixItHint::CreateInsertion(Loc, Code)``.

If so,; the preprocessor can completely ignore the include of the header. .. _Parser:. The Parser Library; ==================. This library contains a recursive-descent parser that polls tokens from the; preprocessor and notifies a client of the parsing progress. Historically, the parser used to talk to an abstract ``Action`` interface that; had virtual methods for parse events, for example ``ActOnBinOp()``. When Clang; grew C++ support, the parser stopped supporting general ``Action`` clients --; it now always talks to the :ref:`Sema library <Sema>`.

And please read through the; high-level `description of the import algorithm; <LibASTImporter.html#algorithm-of-the-import>`_, this is essential for; understanding further implementation details of the importer. .. _templated:. Abstract Syntax Graph; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Despite the name, the Clang AST is not a tree. It is a directed graph with; cycles. One example of a cycle is the connection between a; ``ClassTemplateDecl`` and its ""templated"" ``CXXRecordDecl``. The *templated*; ``CXXRecordDecl`` represents all the fields and methods inside the class; template, while the ``ClassTemplateDecl`` holds the information which is; related to being a template, i.e. template arguments, etc. We can get the; *",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

Consequently, calling a declaration's ``::Create()`` function directly; would lead to errors, please don't do that!. Even with the use of ``GetImportedOrCreateDecl()`` there is still a; probability of having an infinite import recursion if things are imported from; each other in wrong way. Imagine that during the import of ``A``, the import of; ``B`` is requested before we could create the node for ``A`` (the constructor; needs a reference to ``B``). And the same could be true for the import of ``B``; (``A`` is requested to be imported before we could create the node for ``B``).; In case of the :ref:`templated-described swing <templated>` we take; extra attention to break the cyclical dependency: we import and set the; described template only after the ``CXXRecordDecl`` is created. As a best; practice, before creating the node in the ""to"" context, avoid importing of; other nodes which are not needed for the constructor of node ``A``. Error Handling; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every import function returns with either an ``llvm::Error`` or an; ``llvm::Expected<T>`` object. This enforces to check the return value of the; import functions. If there was an error during one import then we return with; that error. (Exception: when we import the members of a class, we collect the; individual errors with each member and we concatenate them in one Error; object.) We cache these errors in cases of declarations. During the next import; call if there is an existing error we just return with that. So, clients of the; library receive an Error object, which they must check. During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we recognize an error. In this case, we signal back; the error to the caller, but the ""to"" context remains polluted with those nodes; which had been created. Ideally, those nodes should n",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

If the ""from"" node is not a definition then we add; that to the redeclaration chain of the found node. This behaviour is essential; when we merge ASTs from different translation units which include the same; header file(s). For example, we want to have only one definition for the class; template ``std::vector``, even if we included ``<vector>`` in several; translation units. To find a structurally equivalent node we can use the regular C/C++ lookup; functions: ``DeclContext::noload_lookup()`` and; ``DeclContext::localUncachedLookup()``. These functions do respect the C/C++; name hiding rules, thus you cannot find certain declarations in a given; declaration context. For instance, unnamed declarations (anonymous structs),; non-first ``friend`` declarations and template specializations are hidden. This; is a problem, because if we use the regular C/C++ lookup then we create; redundant AST nodes during the merge! Also, having two instances of the same; node could result in false :ref:`structural in-equivalencies <structural-eq>`; of other nodes which depend on the duplicated node. Because of these reasons,; we created a lookup class which has the sole purpose to register all; declarations, so later they can be looked up by subsequent import requests.; This is the ``ASTImporterLookupTable`` class. This lookup table should be; shared amongst the different ``ASTImporter`` instances if they happen to import; to the very same ""to"" context. This is why we can use the importer specific; lookup only via the ``ASTImporterSharedState`` class. ExternalASTSource; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ``ExternalASTSource`` is an abstract interface associated with the; ``ASTContext`` class. It provides the ability to read the declarations stored; within a declaration context either for iteration or for name lookup. A; declaration context with an external AST source may load its declarations; on-demand. This means that the list of declarations (repr",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

If the parsed form of the attribute is more complex, or differs from the; semantic form, the ``HasCustomParsing`` bit can be set to ``1`` for the class,; and the parsing code in `Parser::ParseGNUAttributeArgs(); <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/lib/Parse/ParseDecl.cpp>`_; can be updated for the special case. Note that this only applies to arguments; with a GNU spelling -- attributes with a __declspec spelling currently ignore; this flag and are handled by ``Parser::ParseMicrosoftDeclSpec``. Note that setting this member to 1 will opt out of common attribute semantic; handling, requiring extra implementation efforts to ensure the attribute; appertains to the appropriate subject, etc. If the attribute should not be propagated from a template declaration to an; instantiation of the template, set the ``Clone`` member to 0. By default, all; attributes will be cloned to template instantiations. Attributes that do not require an AST node should set the ``ASTNode`` field to; ``0`` to avoid polluting the AST. Note that anything inheriting from; ``TypeAttr`` or ``IgnoredAttr`` automatically do not generate an AST node. All; other attributes generate an AST node by default. The AST node is the semantic; representation of the attribute. The ``LangOpts`` field specifies a list of language options required by the; attribute. For instance, all of the CUDA-specific attributes specify ``[CUDA]``; for the ``LangOpts`` field, and when the CUDA language option is not enabled, an; ""attribute ignored"" warning diagnostic is emitted. Since language options are; not table generated nodes, new language options must be created manually and; should specify the spelling used by ``LangOptions`` class. Custom accessors can be generated for an attribute based on the spelling list; for that attribute. For instance, if an attribute has two different spellings:; 'Foo' and 'Bar', accessors can be created:; ``[Accessor<""isFoo"", [GNU<""Foo"">]>, Accessor<""isBar"", ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

Expressions and statements are one of the most fundamental constructs within a; compiler, because they interact with many different parts of the AST, semantic; analysis, and IR generation. Therefore, adding a new expression or statement; kind into Clang requires some care. The following list details the various; places in Clang where an expression or statement needs to be introduced, along; with patterns to follow to ensure that the new expression or statement works; well across all of the C languages. We focus on expressions, but statements; are similar. #. Introduce parsing actions into the parser. Recursive-descent parsing is; mostly self-explanatory, but there are a few things that are worth keeping; in mind:. * Keep as much source location information as possible! You'll want it later; to produce great diagnostics and support Clang's various features that map; between source code and the AST.; * Write tests for all of the ""bad"" parsing cases, to make sure your recovery; is good. If you have matched delimiters (e.g., parentheses, square; brackets, etc.), use ``Parser::BalancedDelimiterTracker`` to give nice; diagnostics when things go wrong. #. Introduce semantic analysis actions into ``Sema``. Semantic analysis should; always involve two functions: an ``ActOnXXX`` function that will be called; directly from the parser, and a ``BuildXXX`` function that performs the; actual semantic analysis and will (eventually!) build the AST node. It's; fairly common for the ``ActOnCXX`` function to do very little (often just; some minor translation from the parser's representation to ``Sema``'s; representation of the same thing), but the separation is still important:; C++ template instantiation, for example, should always call the ``BuildXXX``; variant.

For example, all implicit conversions should; show up explicitly in the AST.; * Write tests that use your expression as a subexpression of other,; well-known expressions.

This step is the first; (and only) that requires knowledge of LLVM IR. There are several things to; keep in mind:. * Code generation is separated into scalar/aggregate/complex and; lvalue/rvalue paths, depending on what kind of result your expression; produces.

If you find that you are having to use LLVM bitcasts to make the; subexpressions of your expression have the type that your expression; expects, STOP! Go fix semantic analysis and the AST so that you don't; need these bitcasts.; * The ``CodeGenFunction`` class has a number of helper functions to make; certain operations easy, such as generating code to produce an lvalue or; an rvalue, or to initialize a memory location with a given value.

This is meant for people interested in hacking on; Clang, not for end-users. The description below is categorized by libraries,; and does not describe any of the clients of the libraries. LLVM Support Library; ====================. The LLVM ``libSupport`` library provides many underlying libraries and; `data-structures <https://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html>`_, including; command line option processing, various containers and a system abstraction; layer, which is used for file system access. The Clang ""Basic"" Library; =========================. This library certainly needs a better name. The ""basic"" library contains a; number of low-level utilities for tracking and manipulating source buffers,; locations within the source buffers, diagnostics, tokens, target abstraction,; and information about the subset of the language being compiled for. Part of this infrastructure is specific to C (such as the ``TargetInfo``; class), other parts could be reused for other non-C-based languages; (``SourceLocation``, ``SourceManager``, ``Diagnostics``, ``FileManager``).; When and if there is future demand we can figure out if it makes sense to; introduce a new library, move the general classes somewhere else, or introduce; some other solution. We describe the roles of these classes in order of their dependencies. The Diagnostics Subsystem; -------------------------. The Clang Diagnostics subsystem is an important part of how the compiler; communicates with the human. Diagnostics are the warnings and errors produced; when the code is incorrect or dubious.

New options are recognized by the ``clang`` driver mode if ``Visibility`` is; not specified or contains ``ClangOption``. Options intended for ``clang -cc1``; must be explicitly marked with the ``CC1Option`` flag. Flags that specify; ``CC1Option`` but not ``ClangOption`` will only be accessible via ``-cc1``.; This is similar for other driver modes, such as ``clang-cl`` or ``flang``.

The main; interface to this library for outside clients is the large ``Preprocessor``; class. It contains the various pieces of state that are required to coherently; read tokens out of a translation unit. The core interface to the ``Preprocessor`` object (once it is set up) is the; ``Preprocessor::Lex`` method, which returns the next :ref:`Token <Token>` from; the preprocessor stream. There are two types of token providers that the; preprocessor is capable of reading from: a buffer lexer (provided by the; :ref:`Lexer <Lexer>` class) and a buffered token stream (provided by the; :ref:`TokenLexer <TokenLexer>` class). .. _Token:. The Token class; ---------------. The ``Token`` class is used to represent a single lexed token. Tokens are; intended to be used by the lexer/preprocess and parser libraries, but are not; intended to live beyond them (for example, they should not live in the ASTs). Tokens most often live on the stack (or some other location that is efficient; to access) as the parser is running, but occasionally do get buffered up. For; example, macro definitions are stored as a series of tokens, and the C++; front-end periodically needs to buffer tokens up for tentative parsing and; various pieces of look-ahead. As such, the size of a ``Token`` matters. On a; 32-bit system, ``sizeof(Token)`` is currently 16 bytes. Tokens occur in two forms: :ref:`annotation tokens <AnnotationToken>` and; normal tokens. Normal tokens are those returned by the lexer, annotation; tokens represent semantic information and are produced by the parser, replacing; normal tokens in the token stream. Normal tokens contain the following; information:. * **A SourceLocation** --- This indicates the location of the start of the; token. * **A length** --- This stores the length of the token as stored in the; ``SourceBuffer``. For tokens that include them, this length includes; trigraphs and escaped newlines which are ignored by later phases of the; compiler.

Normal tokens are those returned by the lexer, annotation; tokens represent semantic information and are produced by the parser, replacing; normal tokens in the token stream. Normal tokens contain the following; information:. * **A SourceLocation** --- This indicates the location of the start of the; token. * **A length** --- This stores the length of the token as stored in the; ``SourceBuffer``. For tokens that include them, this length includes; trigraphs and escaped newlines which are ignored by later phases of the; compiler. By pointing into the original source buffer, it is always possible; to get the original spelling of a token completely accurately. * **IdentifierInfo** --- If a token takes the form of an identifier, and if; identifier lookup was enabled when the token was lexed (e.g., the lexer was; not reading in ""raw"" mode) this contains a pointer to the unique hash value; for the identifier. Because the lookup happens before keyword; identification, this field is set even for language keywords like ""``for``"". * **TokenKind** --- This indicates the kind of token as classified by the; lexer. This includes things like ``tok::starequal`` (for the ""``*=``""; operator), ``tok::ampamp`` for the ""``&&``"" token, and keyword values (e.g.,; ``tok::kw_for``) for identifiers that correspond to keywords. Note that; some tokens can be spelled multiple ways. For example, C++ supports; ""operator keywords"", where things like ""``and``"" are treated exactly like the; ""``&&``"" operator. In these cases, the kind value is set to ``tok::ampamp``,; which is good for the parser, which doesn't have to consider both forms. For; something that cares about which form is used (e.g., the preprocessor; ""stringize"" operator) the spelling indicates the original form. * **Flags** --- There are currently four flags tracked by the; lexer/preprocessor syste",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

Since this is uncommon,; many pieces of code can fast-path on tokens that did not need cleaning. One interesting (and somewhat unusual) aspect of normal tokens is that they; don't contain any semantic information about the lexed value. For example, if; the token was a pp-number token, we do not represent the value of the number; that was lexed (this is left for later pieces of code to decide).; Additionally, the lexer library has no notion of typedef names vs variable; names: both are returned as identifiers, and the parser is left to decide; whether a specific identifier is a typedef or a variable (tracking this; requires scope information among other things). The parser can do this; translation by replacing tokens returned by the preprocessor with ""Annotation; Tokens"". .. _AnnotationToken:. Annotation Tokens; -----------------. Annotation tokens are tokens that are synthesized by the parser and injected; into the preprocessor's token stream (replacing existing tokens) to record; semantic information found by the parser. For example, if ""``foo``"" is found; to be a typedef, the ""``foo``"" ``tok::identifier`` token is replaced with an; ``tok::annot_typename``. This is useful for a couple of reasons: 1) this makes; it easy to handle qualified type names (e.g., ""``foo::bar::baz<42>::t``"") in; C++ as a single ""token"" in the parser. 2) if the parser backtracks, the; reparse does not need to redo semantic analysis to determine whether a token; sequence is a variable, type, template, etc. Annotation tokens are created by the parser and reinjected into the parser's; token stream (when backtracking is enabled). Because they can only exist in; tokens that the preprocessor-proper is done with, it doesn't need to keep; around flags like ""start of line"" that the preprocessor uses to do its job.; Additionally, an annotation token may ""cover"" a sequence of preprocessor tokens; (e.g., ""``a::b::c``"" is five preprocessor tok",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

The ``MultipleIncludeOpt`` class implements a really simple little state; machine that is used to detect the standard ""``#ifndef XX`` / ``#define XX``""; idiom that people typically use to prevent multiple inclusion of headers. If a; buffer uses this idiom and is subsequently ``#include``'d, the preprocessor can; simply check to see whether the guarding condition is defined or not. If so,; the preprocessor can completely ignore the include of the header. .. _Parser:. The Parser Library; ==================. This library contains a recursive-descent parser that polls tokens from the; preprocessor and notifies a client of the parsing progress. Historically, the parser used to talk to an abstract ``Action`` interface that; had virtual methods for parse events, for example ``ActOnBinOp()``. When Clang; grew C++ support, the parser stopped supporting general ``Action`` clients --; it now always talks to the :ref:`Sema library <Sema>`. However, the Parser; still accesses AST objects only through opaque types like ``ExprResult`` and; ``StmtResult``. Only :ref:`Sema <Sema>` looks at the AST node contents of these; wrappers. .. _AST:. The AST Library; ===============. .. _ASTPhilosophy:. Design philosophy; -----------------. Immutability; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. Clang AST nodes (types, declarations, statements, expressions, and so on) are; generally designed to be immutable once created. This provides a number of key; benefits:. * Canonicalization of the ""meaning"" of nodes is possible as soon as the nodes; are created, and is not invalidated by later addition of more information.; For example, we :ref:`canonicalize types <CanonicalType>`, and use a; canonicalized representation of expressions when determining whether two; function template declarations involving dependent expressions declare the; same entity.; * AST nodes can be reused when they have the same meaning. For example, we; reuse ``Type`` nodes when representing the same type (but maintain separate; ``TypeLoc``\s for each in",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

For example, ``CXXForRangeStmt`` directly represents the syntactic form of a; range-based for statement, but also holds a semantic representation of the; range declaration and iterator declarations. It does not contain a; fully-desugared ``ForStmt``, however. Some AST nodes (for example, ``ParenExpr``) represent only syntax, and others; (for example, ``ImplicitCastExpr``) represent only semantics, but most nodes; will represent a combination of syntax and associated semantics. Inheritance; is typically used when representing different (but related) syntaxes for nodes; with the same or similar semantics. .. _Type:. The ``Type`` class and its subclasses; -------------------------------------. The ``Type`` class (and its subclasses) are an important part of the AST.; Types are accessed through the ``ASTContext`` class, which implicitly creates; and uniques them as they are needed. Types have a couple of non-obvious; features: 1) they do not capture type qualifiers like ``const`` or ``volatile``; (see :ref:`QualType <QualType>`), and 2) they implicitly capture typedef; information. Once created, types are immutable (unlike decls). Typedefs in C make semantic analysis a bit more complex than it would be without; them. The issue is that we want to capture typedef information and represent it; in the AST perfectly, but the semantics of operations need to ""see through""; typedefs. For example, consider this code:. .. code-block:: c++. void func() {; typedef int foo;; foo X, *Y;; typedef foo *bar;; bar Z;; *X; // error; **Y; // error; **Z; // error; }. The code above is illegal, and thus we expect there to be diagnostics emitted; on the annotated lines. In this example, we expect to get:. .. code-block:: text. test.c:6:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); *X; // error; ^~; test.c:7:1:",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst
https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:64208,Security,access,access,64208,"e; user-specified type is always immediately available. There are two problems; with this: first, various semantic checks need to make judgements about the; *actual structure* of a type, ignoring typedefs. Second, we need an efficient; way to query whether two types are structurally identical to each other,; ignoring typedefs. The solution to both of these problems is the idea of; canonical types. .. _CanonicalType:. Canonical Types; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every instance of the ``Type`` class contains a canonical type pointer. For; simple types with no typedefs involved (e.g., ""``int``"", ""``int*``"",; ""``int**``""), the type just points to itself. For types that have a typedef; somewhere in their structure (e.g., ""``foo``"", ""``foo*``"", ""``foo**``"",; ""``bar``""), the canonical type pointer points to their structurally equivalent; type without any typedefs (e.g., ""``int``"", ""``int*``"", ""``int**``"", and; ""``int*``"" respectively). This design provides a constant time operation (dereferencing the canonical type; pointer) that gives us access to the structure of types. For example, we can; trivially tell that ""``bar``"" and ""``foo*``"" are the same type by dereferencing; their canonical type pointers and doing a pointer comparison (they both point; to the single ""``int*``"" type). Canonical types and typedef types bring up some complexities that must be; carefully managed. Specifically, the ``isa``/``cast``/``dyn_cast`` operators; generally shouldn't be used in code that is inspecting the AST. For example,; when type checking the indirection operator (unary ""``*``"" on a pointer), the; type checker must verify that the operand has a pointer type.

Specifically, the ``isa``/``cast``/``dyn_cast`` operators; generally shouldn't be used in code that is inspecting the AST. For example,; when type checking the indirection operator (unary ""``*``"" on a pointer), the; type checker must verify that the operand has a pointer type. It would not be; correct to check that with ""``isa<PointerType>(SubExpr->getType())``"", because; this predicate would fail if the subexpression had a typedef type. The solution to this problem are a set of helper methods on ``Type``, used to; check their properties. In this case, it would be correct to use; ""``SubExpr->getType()->isPointerType()``"" to do the check. This predicate will; return true if the *canonical type is a pointer*, which is true any time the; type is structurally a pointer type. The only hard part here is remembering; not to use the ``isa``/``cast``/``dyn_cast`` operations. The second problem we face is how to get access to the pointer type once we; know it exists. To continue the example, the result type of the indirection; operator is the pointee type of the subexpression. In order to determine the; type, we need to get the instance of ``PointerType`` that best captures the; typedef information in the program. If the type of the expression is literally; a ``PointerType``, we can return that, otherwise we have to dig through the; typedefs to find the pointer type. For example, if the subexpression had type; ""``foo*``"", we could return that type as the result. If the subexpression had; type ""``bar``"", we want to return ""``foo*``"" (note that we do *not* want; ""``int*``""). In order to provide all of this, ``Type`` has a; ``getAsPointerType()`` method that checks whether the type is structurally a; ``PointerType`` and, if so, returns the best one. If not, it returns a null; pointer. This structure is somewhat mystical, but after meditating on it, it will make; sense to you :). .. _QualType:.

Feature Test Macros; ===================; Clang implements several ways to test whether a feature is supported or not.; Some of these feature tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a particular relevant target?. If the answer to any of these is ""yes"", the feature test macro should either; not be defined or there should be very strong rationale for why the issues; should not prevent defining it. Note, it is acceptable to define the feature; test macro on a per-target basis if needed. When in doubt, being conservative is better than being aggressive. If we don't; claim support for the feature but it does useful things, users can still use it; and provide us with useful feedback on what is missing.

An expression can be empty, in which case it is always true. See the example; at the top. Otherwise, it is a series of one or more numeric conditions,; separated by "","". If any condition matches, the expression matches. Each; numeric condition can take one of three forms. * number: A simple decimal number matches if the argument is the same as the; number.

Fix-It Hints; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. In some cases, the front end emits diagnostics when it is clear that some small; change to the source code would fix the problem. For example, a missing; semicolon at the end of a statement or a use of deprecated syntax that is; easily rewritten into a more modern form. Clang tries very hard to emit the; diagnostic and recover gracefully in these and other cases. However, for these cases where the fix is obvious, the diagnostic can be; annotated with a hint (referred to as a ""fix-it hint"") that describes how to; change the code referenced by the diagnostic to fix the problem. For example,; it might add the missing semicolon at the end of the statement or rewrite the; use of a deprecated construct into something more palatable. Here is one such; example from the C++ front end, where we warn about the right-shift operator; changing meaning from C++98 to C++11:. .. code-block:: text. test.cpp:3:7: warning: use of right-shift operator ('>>') in template argument; will require parentheses in C++11; A<100 >> 2> *a;; ^; ( ). Here, the fix-it hint is suggesting that parentheses be added, and showing; exactly where those parentheses would be inserted into the source code. The; fix-it hints themselves describe what changes to make to the source code in an; abstract manner, which the text diagnostic printer renders as a line of; ""insertions"" below the caret line. :ref:`Other diagnostic clients; <DiagnosticConsumer>` might choose to render the code differently (e.g., as; markup inline) or even give the user the ability to automatically fix the; problem. Fix-it hints on errors and warnings need to obey these rules:. * Since they are automatically applied if ``-Xclang -fixit`` is passed to the; driver, they should only be used when it's very likely they match the user's; intent.; * Clang must recover from errors as if the fix-it had been applied.; * Fix-it hints on a warning mu",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

Clang supports precompiled headers (:doc:`PCH <PCHInternals>`), which uses a; serialized representation of Clang's internal data structures, encoded with the; `LLVM bitstream format <https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html>`_. The Frontend Library; ====================. The Frontend library contains functionality useful for building tools on top of; the Clang libraries, for example several methods for outputting diagnostics. Compiler Invocation; -------------------. One of the classes provided by the Frontend library is ``CompilerInvocation``,; which holds information that describe current invocation of the Clang ``-cc1``; frontend. The information typically comes from the command line constructed by; the Clang driver or from clients performing custom initialization. The data; structure is split into logical units used by different parts of the compiler,; for example ``PreprocessorOptions``, ``LanguageOptions`` or ``CodeGenOptions``. Command Line Interface; ----------------------. The command line interface of the Clang ``-cc1`` frontend is defined alongside; the driver options in ``clang/Driver/Options.td``. The information making up an; option definition includes its prefix and name (for example ``-std=``), form and; position of the option value, help text, aliases and more. Each option may; belong to a certain group and can be marked with zero or more flags. Options; accepted by the ``-cc1`` frontend are marked with the ``CC1Option`` flag. Command Line Parsing; --------------------. Option definitions are processed by the ``-gen-opt-parser-defs`` tablegen; backend during early stages of the build. Options are then used for querying an; instance ``llvm::opt::ArgList``, a wrapper around the command line arguments.; This is done in the Clang driver to construct individual jobs based on the; driver arguments and also in the ``Compi",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

This definition of ""``f``"" has different lexical and semantic contexts. The; lexical context corresponds to the declaration context in which the actual; declaration occurred in the source code, e.g., the translation unit containing; ``X``. Thus, this declaration of ``X::f`` can be found by traversing the; declarations provided by [``decls_begin()``, ``decls_end()``) in the; translation unit. The semantic context of ``X::f`` corresponds to the class ``X``, since this; member function is (semantically) a member of ``X``. Lookup of the name ``f``; into the ``DeclContext`` associated with ``X`` will then return the definition; of ``X::f`` (including information about the default argument). Transparent Declaration Contexts; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In C and C++, there are several contexts in which names that are logically; declared inside another declaration will actually ""leak"" out into the enclosing; scope from the perspective of name lookup. The most obvious instance of this; behavior is in enumeration types, e.g.,. .. code-block:: c++. enum Color {; Red,; Green,; Blue; };. Here, ``Color`` is an enumeration, which is a declaration context that contains; the enumerators ``Red``, ``Green``, and ``Blue``. Thus, traversing the list of; declarations contained in the enumeration ``Color`` will yield ``Red``,; ``Green``, and ``Blue``. However, outside of the scope of ``Color`` one can; name the enumerator ``Red`` without qualifying the name, e.g.,. .. code-block:: c++. Color c = Red;. There are other entities in C++ that provide similar behavior. For example,; linkage specifications that use curly braces:. .. code-block:: c++. extern ""C"" {; void f(int);; void g(int);; }; // f and g are visible here.

The argument consists of a series of expression/form pairs,; separated by "":"", where the first form whose expression evaluates to true is; the result of the modifier. An expression can be empty, in which case it is always true. See the example; at the top. Otherwise, it is a series of one or more numeric conditions,; separated by "","". If any condition matches, the expression matches. Each; numeric condition can take one of three forms. * number: A simple decimal number matches if the argument is the same as the; number. Example: ``""%plural{1:mouse|:mice}0""``; * range: A range in square brackets matches if the argument is within the; range. Then range is inclusive on both ends. Example:; ``""%plural{0:none|1:one|[2,5]:some|:many}0""``; * modulo: A modulo operator is followed by a number, and equals sign and; either a number or a range.

As you can see, adding and producing a diagnostic is pretty straightforward.; The hard part is deciding exactly what you need to say to help the user,; picking a suitable wording, and providing the information needed to format it; correctly. The good news is that the call site that issues a diagnostic should; be completely independent of how the diagnostic is formatted and in what; language it is rendered. Fix-It Hints; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. In some cases, the front end emits diagnostics when it is clear that some small; change to the source code would fix the problem. For example, a missing; semicolon at the end of a statement or a use of deprecated syntax that is; easily rewritten into a more modern form. Clang tries very hard to emit the; diagnostic and recover gracefully in these and other cases. However, for these cases where the fix is obvious, the diagnostic can be; annotated with a hint (referred to as a ""fix-it hint"") that describes how to; change the code referenced by the diagnostic to fix the problem. For example,; it might add the missing semicolon at the end of the statement or rewrite the; use of a deprecated construct into something more palatable. Here is one such; example from the C++ front end, where we warn about the right-shift operator; changing meaning from C++98 to C++11:. .. code-block:: text. test.cpp:3:7: warning: use of right-shift operator ('>>') in template argument; will require parentheses in C++11; A<100 >> 2> *a;; ^; ( ).

Another implementation of the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is the; ``TextDiagnosticBuffer`` class, which is used when Clang is in ``-verify``; mode. Instead of formatting and printing out the diagnostics, this; implementation just captures and remembers the diagnostics as they fly by.; Then ``-verify`` compares the list of produced diagnostics to the list of; expected ones. If they disagree, it prints out its own output. Full; documentation for the ``-verify`` mode can be found at; :ref:`verifying-diagnostics`. There are many other possible implementations of this interface, and this is; why we prefer diagnostics to pass down rich structured information in; arguments.

The last step is implementing the ``-cc1`` command line argument; parsing/generation that initializes/serializes the option class (in our case; ``CodeGenOptions``) stored within ``CompilerInvocation``.

Option Marshalling Infrastructure; ---------------------------------. The option marshalling infrastructure automates the parsing of the Clang; ``-cc1`` frontend command line arguments into ``CompilerInvocation`` and their; generation from ``CompilerInvocation``. The system replaces lots of repetitive; C++ code with simple, declarative tablegen annotations and it's being used for; the majority of the ``-cc1`` command line interface. This section provides an; overview of the system. **Note:** The marshalling infrastructure is not intended for driver-only; options. Only options of the ``-cc1`` frontend need to be marshalled to/from; ``CompilerInvocation`` instance. To read and modify contents of ``CompilerInvocation``, the marshalling system; uses key paths, which are declared in two steps. First, a tablegen definition; for the ``CompilerInvocation`` member is created by inheriting from; ``KeyPathAndMacro``:. .. code-block:: text. // Options.td. class LangOpts<string field> : KeyPathAndMacro<""LangOpts->"", field, ""LANG_""> {}; // CompilerInvocation member ^^^^^^^^^^; // OPTION_WITH_MARSHALLING prefix ^^^^^.

It's also possible; to use ``BoolFOption`` that implies the ``""f""`` prefix and ``Group<f_Group>``.; The ``PosFlag`` and ``NegFlag`` classes hold the associated boolean value,; arrays of elements passed to the ``Flag`` and ``Visibility`` classes and the; help text. The optional ``BothFlags`` class holds arrays of ``Flag`` and; ``Visibility`` elements that are common for both the positive and negative flag; and their common help text suffix. **String**.

Clang AST nodes (types, declarations, statements, expressions, and so on) are; generally designed to be immutable once created. This provides a number of key; benefits:. * Canonicalization of the ""meaning"" of nodes is possible as soon as the nodes; are created, and is not invalidated by later addition of more information.; For example, we :ref:`canonicalize types <CanonicalType>`, and use a; canonicalized representation of expressions when determining whether two; function template declarations involving dependent expressions declare the; same entity.; * AST nodes can be reused when they have the same meaning. For example, we; reuse ``Type`` nodes when representing the same type (but maintain separate; ``TypeLoc``\s for each instance where a type is written), and we reuse; non-dependent ``Stmt`` and ``Expr`` nodes across instantiations of a; template.; * Serialization and deserialization of the AST to/from AST files is simpler:; we do not need to track modifications made to AST nodes imported from AST; files and serialize separate ""update records"". There are unfortunately exceptions to this general approach, such as:. * The first declaration of a redeclarable entity maintains a pointer to the; most recent declaration of that entity, which naturally needs to change as; more declarations are parsed.; * Name lookup tables in declaration contexts change after the namespace; declaration is formed.; * We attempt to maintain only a single declaration for an instantiation of a; template, rather than having distinct declarations for an instantiation of; the declaration versus the definition, so template instantiation often; updates parts of existing declarations.; * Some parts of declarations are required to be instantiated separately (this; includes default arguments and exception specifications), and such; instantiations update the existing declaration.

Faithfulness; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The AST intends to provide a representation of the program that is faithful to; the original source. We intend for it to be possible to write refactoring tools; using only information stored in, or easily reconstructible from, the Clang AST.; This means that the AST representation should either not desugar source-level; constructs to simpler forms, or -- where made necessary by language semantics; or a clear engineering tradeoff -- should desugar minimally and wrap the result; in a construct representing the original source form. For example, ``CXXForRangeStmt`` directly represents the syntactic form of a; range-based for statement, but also holds a semantic representation of the; range declaration and iterator declarations. It does not contain a; fully-desugared ``ForStmt``, however. Some AST nodes (for example, ``ParenExpr``) represent only syntax, and others; (for example, ``ImplicitCastExpr``) represent only semantics, but most nodes; will represent a combination of syntax and associated semantics. Inheritance; is typically used when representing different (but related) syntaxes for nodes; with the same or similar semantics. .. _Type:.

We intend for it to be possible to write refactoring tools; using only information stored in, or easily reconstructible from, the Clang AST.; This means that the AST representation should either not desugar source-level; constructs to simpler forms, or -- where made necessary by language semantics; or a clear engineering tradeoff -- should desugar minimally and wrap the result; in a construct representing the original source form. For example, ``CXXForRangeStmt`` directly represents the syntactic form of a; range-based for statement, but also holds a semantic representation of the; range declaration and iterator declarations. It does not contain a; fully-desugared ``ForStmt``, however. Some AST nodes (for example, ``ParenExpr``) represent only syntax, and others; (for example, ``ImplicitCastExpr``) represent only semantics, but most nodes; will represent a combination of syntax and associated semantics. Inheritance; is typically used when representing different (but related) syntaxes for nodes; with the same or similar semantics. .. _Type:. The ``Type`` class and its subclasses; -------------------------------------. The ``Type`` class (and its subclasses) are an important part of the AST.; Types are accessed through the ``ASTContext`` class, which implicitly creates",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"". Representing types like this is great for diagnostics, because the; user-specified type is always immediately available. There are two problems; with this: first, various semantic checks need to make judgements about the; *actual structure* of a type, ignoring typedefs. Second, we need an efficient; way to query whether two types are structurally identical to each other,; ignoring typedefs. The solution to both of these problems is the idea of; canonical types. .. _CanonicalType:. Canonical Types; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every instance of the ``Type`` class contains a canonical type pointer. For; simple types with no typedefs involved (e.g., ""``int``"", ""``int*``"",; ""``int**``""), the type just points to itself. For types that have a typedef; somewhere in their structure (e.g., ""``foo``"", ""``foo*``"", ""``foo**``"",; ""``bar``""), the canonical type pointer points to their structurally equivalent; type without any typedefs (e.g., ""``int``"", ""``int*``"", ""``int**``"", and; ""``int*``"" respectively). This design provides a constant time operation (dereferencing the canonical type; pointer) that gives us access to the structure of types. For example, we can; trivially tell that ""``bar``"" and ""``foo*``"" are the same type by dereferencing; their canonical type pointers and doing a pointer comparison (they both point; to the single ""``int*``"" type). Canonical types and typedef types bring up some complexities that must be; carefully managed. Specifically, the ``isa``/``cast``/``dyn_cast`` operators; generally shouldn't be used in code that is inspecting the AST. For example,; when type checking the indirection ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst

This; reduces the heap size used to represent bits and also means we do not have to; consider qualifiers when uniquing types (:ref:`Type <Type>` does not even; contain qualifiers). In practice, the two most common type qualifiers (``const`` and ``restrict``); are stored in the low bits of the pointer to the ``Type`` object, together with; a flag indicating whether extended qualifiers are present (which must be; heap-allocated). This means that ``QualType`` is exactly the same size as a; pointer. .. _DeclarationName:. Declaration names; -----------------. The ``DeclarationName`` class represents the name of a declaration in Clang.; Declarations in the C family of languages can take several different forms.; Most declarations are named by simple identifiers, e.g., ""``f``"" and ""``x``"" in; the function declaration ``f(int x)``. In C++, declaration names can also name; class constructors (""``Class``"" in ``struct Class { Class(); }``), class; destructors (""``~Class``""), overloaded operator names (""``operator+``""), and; conversion functions (""``operator void const *``""). In Objective-C,; declaration names can refer to the names of Objective-C methods, which involve; the method name and the parameters, collectively called a *selector*, e.g.,; ""``setWidth:height:``"". Since all of these kinds of entities --- variables,; functions, Objective-C methods, C++ constructors, destructors, and operators; --- are represented as subclasses of Clang's common ``NamedDecl`` class,; ``DeclarationName`` is designed to efficiently represent any kind of name.

The name is a C++ constructor name. Use ``N.getCXXNameType()`` to retrieve; the :ref:`type <QualType>` that this constructor is meant to construct.

Use; ``N.getCXXLiteralIdentifier()`` to retrieve the corresponding; ``IdentifierInfo*`` pointing to the identifier. ``CXXUsingDirective``. The name is a C++ using directive. Using directives are not really; NamedDecls, in that they all have the same name, but they are; implemented as such in order to store them in DeclContext; effectively. ``DeclarationName``\ s are cheap to create, copy, and compare. They require; only a single pointer's worth of storage in the common cases (identifiers,; zero- and one-argument Objective-C selectors) and use dense, uniqued storage; for the other kinds of names. Two ``DeclarationName``\ s can be compared for; equality (``==``, ``!=``) using a simple bitwise comparison, can be ordered; with ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, and ``>=`` (which provide a lexicographical ordering; for normal identifiers but an unspecified ordering for other kinds of names),; and can be placed into LLVM ``DenseMap``\ s and ``DenseSet``\ s. ``DeclarationName`` instances can be created in different ways depending on; what kind of name the instance will store. Normal identifiers; (``IdentifierInfo`` pointers) and Objective-C selectors (``Selector``) can be; implicitly converted to ``DeclarationNames``. Names for C++ constructors,; destructors, conversion functions, and overloaded operators can be retrieved; from the ``DeclarationNameTable``, an instance of which is available as; ``ASTContext::DeclarationNames``. The member functions; ``getCXXConstructorName``, ``getCXXDestructorName``,; ``getCXXConversionFunctionName``, and ``getCXXOperatorName``, respectively,; return ``DeclarationName`` instances for the four kinds of C++ special function; names. .. _DeclContext:.

Note that these functions are used; internally within the lookup and insertion methods of the ``DeclContext``, so; the vast majority of clients can ignore them. Because the same entity can be defined multiple times in different modules,; it is also possible for there to be multiple definitions of (for instance); a ``CXXRecordDecl``, all of which describe a definition of the same class.; In such a case, only one of those ""definitions"" is considered by Clang to be; the definition of the class, and the others are treated as non-defining; declarations that happen to also contain member declarations. Corresponding; members in each definition of such multiply-defined classes are identified; either by redeclaration chains (if the members are ``Redeclarable``); or by simply a pointer to the canonical declaration (if the declarations; are not ``Redeclarable`` -- in that case, a ``Mergeable`` base class is used; instead). Error Handling; --------------. Clang produces an AST even when the code contains errors. Clang won't generate; and optimize code for it, but it's used as parsing continues to detect further; errors in the input. Clang-based tools also depend on such ASTs, and IDEs in; particular benefit from a high-quality AST for broken code. In presence of errors, clang uses a few error-recovery strategies to present the; broken code in the AST:. - correcting errors: in cases where clang is confident about the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics.

When we compare two classes or enums and one of them is incomplete or has; unloaded external lexical declarations then we cannot descend to compare their; contained declarations. So in these cases they are considered equal if they; have the same names. This is the way how we compare forward declarations with; definitions. .. TODO Should we elaborate the actual implementation of the graph traversal,; .. which is a very weird BFS traversal?. Redeclaration Chains; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The early version of the ``ASTImporter``'s merge mechanism squashed the; declarations, i.e. it aimed to have only one declaration instead of maintaining; a whole redeclaration chain. This early approach simply skipped importing a; function prototype, but it imported a definition. To demonstrate the problem; with this approach let's consider an empty ""to"" context and the following; ``virtual`` function declarations of ``f`` in the ""from"" context:. .. code-block:: c++. struct B { virtual void f(); };; void B::f() {} // <-- let's import this definition. If we imported the definition with the ""squashing"" approach then we would; end-up having one declaration which is indeed a definition, but ``isVirtual()``; returns ``false`` for it. The reason is that the definition is indeed not; virtual, it is the property of the prototype!. Consequently, we must either set the virtual flag for the definition (but then; we create a malformed AST which the parser would never create), or we import; the whole redeclaration chain of the function. The most recent version of the; ``ASTImporter`` uses the latter mechanism.

This may result in long; redeclaration chains in certain cases, e.g. if we import from several; translation units which include the same header with the prototype. .. Squashing prototypes. To mitigate the problem of long redeclaration chains of free functions, we; could compare prototypes to see if they have the same properties and if yes; then we could merge these prototypes. The implementation of squashing of; prototypes for free functions is future work. .. Exception: Cannot have more than 1 prototype in-class. Chaining functions this way ensures that we do copy all information from the; source AST. Nonetheless, there is a problem with member functions: While we can; have many prototypes for free functions, we must have only one prototype for a; member function. .. code-block:: c++. void f(); // OK; void f(); // OK. struct X {; void f(); // OK; void f(); // ERROR; };; void X::f() {} // OK.

For each block, the pretty-printed output displays for each block the number of; *predecessor* blocks (blocks that have outgoing control-flow to the given; block) and *successor* blocks (blocks that have control-flow that have incoming; control-flow from the given block). We can also clearly see the special entry; and exit blocks at the beginning and end of the pretty-printed output. For the; entry block (block B5), the number of predecessor blocks is 0, while for the; exit block (block B0) the number of successor blocks is 0. The most interesting block here is B4, whose outgoing control-flow represents; the branching caused by the sole if-statement in ``foo``. Of particular; interest is the second statement in the block, ``(x > 2)``, and the terminator,; printed as ``if [B4.2]``. The second statement represents the evaluation of; the condition of the if-statement, which occurs before the actual branching of; control-flow. Within the ``CFGBlock`` for B4, the ``Stmt*`` for the second; statement refers to the actual expression in the AST for ``(x > 2)``. Thus; pointers to subclasses of ``Expr`` can appear in the list of statements in a; block, and not just subclasses of ``Stmt`` that refer to proper C statements.

However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a particular relevant target?. If the answer to any of these is ""yes"", the feature test macro should either; not be defined or there should be very strong rationale for why the issues; should not prevent defining it. Note, it is acceptable to define the feature; test macro on a per-target basis if needed. When in doubt, being conservative is better than being aggressive. If we don't; claim support for the feature but it does useful things, users can still use it; and provide us with useful feedback on what is missing. But if we claim support; for a feature that has significant bugs, we've eliminated most of the utility; of having a feature testing macro at all because users are then forced to test; what compiler version is in use to get a more accurate answer. The status reported by the feature test macro should always be reflected in the; language support page for the corresponding feature (`C++; <https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html>`_, `C; <https://clang.llvm.org/c_status.html>`_) if applicable.

This document describes a format for specifying how to replay single; compilations independently of the build system. Background; ==========. Tools based on the C++ Abstract Syntax Tree need full information how to; parse a translation unit. Usually this information is implicitly; available in the build system, but running tools as part of the build; system is not necessarily the best solution:. - Build systems are inherently change driven, so running multiple tools; over the same code base without changing the code does not fit into; the architecture of many build systems.; - Figuring out whether things have changed is often an IO bound; process; this makes it hard to build low latency end user tools based; on the build system.; - Build systems are inherently sequential in the build graph, for; example due to generated source code. While tools that run; independently of the build still need the generated source code to; exist, running tools multiple times over unchanging source does not; require serialization of the runs according to the build dependency; graph. Supported Systems; =================. Clang has the ability to generate compilation database fragments via; ``-MJ argument <clang -MJ\<arg>>``. You can concatenate those; fragments together between ``[`` and ``]`` to create a compilation database. Currently `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_ (since 2.8.5) supports generation; of compilation databases for Unix Makefile builds (Ninja builds in the; works) with the option ``CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS``. For projects on Linux, there is an alternative to intercept compiler; calls with a tool called `Bear <https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear>`_. `Bazel <https://bazel.build>`_ can export a compilation database via; `this extractor extension; <https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor>`_.; Bazel is otherwise",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.rst

Enumerations with a fixed underlying type; -----------------------------------------. Clang provides support for C++11 enumerations with a fixed underlying type; within Objective-C. For example, one can write an enumeration type as:. .. code-block:: c++. typedef enum : unsigned char { Red, Green, Blue } Color;. This specifies that the underlying type, which is used to store the enumeration; value, is ``unsigned char``. Use ``__has_feature(objc_fixed_enum)`` to determine whether support for fixed; underlying types is available in Objective-C. Interoperability with C++11 lambdas; -----------------------------------. Clang provides interoperability between C++11 lambdas and blocks-based APIs, by; permitting a lambda to be implicitly converted to a block pointer with the; corresponding signature. For example, consider an API such as ``NSArray``'s; array-sorting method:. .. code-block:: objc. - (NSArray *)sortedArrayUsingComparator:(NSComparator)cmptr;. ``NSComparator`` is simply a typedef for the block pointer ``NSComparisonResult; (^)(id, id)``, and parameters of this type are generally provided with block; literals as arguments. However, one can also use a C++11 lambda so long as it; provides the same signature (in this case, accepting two parameters of type; ``id`` and returning an ``NSComparisonResult``):. .. code-block:: objc. NSArray *array = @[@""string 1"", @""string 21"", @""string 12"", @""String 11"",; @""String 02""];; const NSStringCompareOptions comparisonOptio",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

The conversion itself is expressed by a; conversion operator in that closure type that produces a block pointer with the; same signature as the lambda itself, e.g.,. .. code-block:: objc. operator NSComparisonResult (^)(id, id)() const;. This conversion function returns a new block that simply forwards the two; parameters to the lambda object (which it captures by copy), then returns the; result. The returned block is first copied (with ``Block_copy``) and then; autoreleased. As an optimization, if a lambda expression is immediately; converted to a block pointer (as in the first example, above), then the block; is not copied and autoreleased: rather, it is given the same lifetime as a; block literal written at that point in the program, which avoids the overhead; of copying a block to the heap in the common case.

The directive; provides options for vectorization, interleaving, predication, unrolling and; distribution. Loop hints can be specified before any loop and will be ignored if; the optimization is not safe to apply. There are loop hints that control transformations (e.g. vectorization, loop; unrolling) and there are loop hints that set transformation options (e.g.; ``vectorize_width``, ``unroll_count``). Pragmas setting transformation options; imply the transformation is enabled, as if it was enabled via the corresponding; transformation pragma (e.g. ``vectorize(enable)``). If the transformation is; disabled (e.g. ``vectorize(disable)``), that takes precedence over; transformations option pragmas implying that transformation. Vectorization, Interleaving, and Predication; --------------------------------------------. A vectorized loop performs multiple iterations of the original loop; in parallel using vector instructions. The instruction set of the target; processor determines which vector instructions are available and their vector; widths. This restricts the types of loops that can be vectorized. The vectorizer; automatically determines if the loop is safe and profitable to vectorize. A; vector instruction cost model is used to select the vector width. Interleaving multiple loop iterations allows modern processors to further; improve instruction-level parallelism (ILP) using advanced hardware features,; such as multiple execution units and out-of-order execution. The vectorizer uses; a cost model that depends on the register pressure and generated code size to; select the interleaving count. Vectorization is enabled by ``vectorize(enable)`` and interleaving is enabled; by ``interleave(enable)``. This is useful when compiling with ``-Os`` to; manually enable vectorization or interleaving. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable); #pragma clang loop interleave(enable); for(...) {; ...; }.

In both variants; of the pragma the vectorizer may decide to fall back on fixed width; vectorization if the target does not support scalable vectors. The interleave count is specified by ``interleave_count(_value_)``, where; _value_ is a positive integer. This is useful for specifying the optimal; width/count of the set of target architectures supported by your application. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize_width(2); #pragma clang loop interleave_count(2); for(...) {; ...; }. Specifying a width/count of 1 disables the optimization, and is equivalent to; ``vectorize(disable)`` or ``interleave(disable)``. Vector predication is enabled by ``vectorize_predicate(enable)``, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable); #pragma clang loop vectorize_predicate(enable); for(...) {; ...; }. This predicates (masks) all instructions in the loop, which allows the scalar; remainder loop (the tail) to be folded into the main vectorized loop. This; might be more efficient when vector predication is efficiently supported by the; target platform. Loop Unrolling; --------------. Unrolling a loop reduces the loop control overhead and exposes more; opportunities for ILP. Loops can be fully or partially unrolled. Full unrolling; eliminates the loop and replaces it with an enumerated sequence of loop; iterations. Full unrolling is only possible if the loop trip count is known at; compile time. Partial unrolling replicates the loop body within the loop and; reduces the trip count. If ``unroll(enable)`` is specified the unroller will attempt to fully unroll the; loop if the trip count is known at compile time. If the fully unrolled code size; is greater than an internal limit the loop will be partially unrolled up to this; limit. If the trip count is not known at compile time the loop will be partially; unrolled with a heuristically chosen unroll factor. .. c",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

The ``__bf16`` type is a non-standard extension, but it generally follows; the rules for arithmetic interchange floating types from ISO/IEC TS; 18661-3:2015. In previous versions of Clang, it was a storage-only type; that forbade arithmetic operations. It will be supported on more targets; as they define ABIs for it. The ``__fp16`` type was originally an ARM extension and is specified; by the `ARM C Language Extensions <https://github.com/ARM-software/acle/releases>`_.; Clang uses the ``binary16`` format from IEEE 754-2008 for ``__fp16``,; not the ARM alternative format. Operators that expect arithmetic operands; immediately promote ``__fp16`` operands to ``float``. It is recommended that portable code use ``_Float16`` instead of ``__fp16``,; as it has been defined by the C standards committee and has behavior that is; more familiar to most programmers. Because ``__fp16`` operands are always immediately promoted to ``float``, the; common real type of ``__fp16`` and ``_Float16`` for the purposes of the usual; arithmetic conversions is ``float``. A literal can be given ``_Float16`` type using the suffix ``f16``. For example,; ``3.14f16``. Because default argument promotion only applies to the standard floating-point; types, ``_Float16`` values are not promoted to ``double`` when passed as variadic; or untyped arguments.

It is possible to use the newest SDK but still build a program that can run on; older versions of macOS and iOS by passing ``-mmacosx-version-min=`` /; ``-miphoneos-version-min=``. Before LLVM 5.0, when calling a function that exists only in the OS that's; newer than the target OS (as determined by the minimum deployment version),; programmers had to carefully check if the function exists at runtime, using; null checks for weakly-linked C functions, ``+class`` for Objective-C classes,; and ``-respondsToSelector:`` or ``+instancesRespondToSelector:`` for; Objective-C methods.

There are two atomic builtins with min/max in-memory comparison and swap.; The syntax and semantics are similar to GCC-compatible __atomic_* builtins. * ``__atomic_fetch_min``; * ``__atomic_fetch_max``. The builtins work with signed and unsigned integers and require to specify memory ordering.; The return value is the original value that was stored in memory before comparison. Example:. .. code-block:: c. unsigned int val = __atomic_fetch_min(unsigned int *pi, unsigned int ui, __ATOMIC_RELAXED);. The third argument is one of the memory ordering specifiers ``__ATOMIC_RELAXED``,; ``__ATOMIC_CONSUME``, ``__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE``, ``__ATOMIC_RELEASE``,; ``__ATOMIC_ACQ_REL``, or ``__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST`` following C++11 memory model semantics. In terms of acquire-release ordering barriers these two operations are always; considered as operations with *load-store* semantics, even when the original value; is not actually modified after comparison. .. _langext-__c11_atomic:. __c11_atomic builtins; ---------------------.

Also, loads and stores may be implicit in code written between the ``ldrex`` and; ``strex``. Clang will not necessarily mitigate the effects of these either, so; care should be exercised. For these reasons the higher level atomic primitives should be preferred where; possible. Non-temporal load/store builtins; --------------------------------. Clang provides overloaded builtins allowing generation of non-temporal memory; accesses. .. code-block:: c. T __builtin_nontemporal_load(T *addr);; void __builtin_nontemporal_store(T value, T *addr);. The types ``T`` currently supported are:. * Integer types.; * Floating-point types.; * Vector types.

ARM/AArch64 Language Extensions; -------------------------------. Memory Barrier Intrinsics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Clang implements the ``__dmb``, ``__dsb`` and ``__isb`` intrinsics as defined; in the `Arm C Language Extensions; <https://github.com/ARM-software/acle/releases>`_.; Note that these intrinsics are implemented as motion barriers that block; reordering of memory accesses and side effect instructions. Other instructions; like simple arithmetic may be reordered around the intrinsic. If you expect to; have no reordering at all, use inline assembly instead. X86/X86-64 Language Extensions; ------------------------------. The X86 backend has these language extensions:. Memory references to specified segments; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Annotating a pointer with address space #256 causes it to be code generated; relative to the X86 GS segment register, address space #257 causes it to be; relative to the X86 FS segment, and address space #258 causes it to be; relative to the X86 SS segment. Note that this is a very very low-level; feature that should only be used if you know what you're doing (for example in; an OS kernel).

For example:. .. code-block:: c++. vector float foo(vector int a) {; vector int b;; b = vec_add(a, a) + a;; return (vector float)b;; }. NEON vector types are created using ``neon_vector_type`` and; ``neon_polyvector_type`` attributes. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. typedef __attribute__((neon_vector_type(8))) int8_t int8x8_t;; typedef __attribute__((neon_polyvector_type(16))) poly8_t poly8x16_t;. int8x8_t foo(int8x8_t a) {; int8x8_t v;; v = a;; return v;; }. GCC vector types are created using the ``vector_size(N)`` attribute. The; argument ``N`` specifies the number of bytes that will be allocated for an; object of this type. The size has to be multiple of the size of the vector; element type. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // OK: This declares a vector type with four 'int' elements; typedef int int4 __attribute__((vector_size(4 * sizeof(int))));. // ERROR: '11' is not a multiple of sizeof(int); typedef int int_impossible __attribute__((vector_size(11)));. int4 foo(int4 a) {; int4 v;; v = a;; return v;; }. Boolean Vectors; ---------------. Clang also supports the ext_vector_type attribute with boolean element types in; C and C++. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // legal for Clang, error for GCC:; typedef bool bool4 __attribute__((ext_vector_type(4)));; // Objects of bool4 type hold 8 bits, sizeof(bool4) == 1. bool4 foo(bool4 a) {; bool4 v;; v = a;; return v;; }.

Boolean vectors are a Clang extension of the ext vector type. Boolean vectors; are intended, though not guaranteed, to map to vector mask registers. The size; parameter of a boolean vector type is the number of bits in the vector. The; boolean vector is dense and each bit in the boolean vector is one vector; element. The semantics of boolean vectors borrows from C bit-fields with the following; differences:. * Distinct boolean vectors are always distinct memory objects (there is no; packing).; * Only the operators `?:`, `!`, `~`, `|`, `&`, `^` and comparison are allowed on; boolean vectors.; * Casting a scalar bool value to a boolean vector type means broadcasting the; scalar value onto all lanes (same as general ext_vector_type).; * It is not possible to access or swizzle elements of a boolean vector; (different than general ext_vector_type). The size and alignment are both the number of bits rounded up to the next power; of two, but the alignment is at most the maximum vector alignment of the; target. Vector Literals; ---------------. Vector literals can be used to create vectors from a set of scalars, or; vectors. Either parentheses or braces form can be used. In the parentheses; form the number of literal values specified must be one, i.e. referring to a; scalar value, or must match the size of the vector type being created. If a; single scalar literal value is specified, the scalar literal value will be; replicated to all the components of the vector type. In the brackets form any; number of literals can be specified. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. typedef int v4si __attribute__((__vector_size__(16)));; typedef float float4 __attribute__((ext_vector_type(4)));; typedef float float2 __attribute__((ext_vector_type(2)));. v4si vsi = (v4si){1, 2, 3, 4};; float4 vf = (float4)(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f);; vector int vi1 = (vector int)(1); // vi1 will be (1, 1, 1, 1).; vector int vi2 = (vector int){1}; //",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

The types ``T`` currently supported are:. * Integer types with width at most 64 bits (or 128 bits on AArch64).; * Floating-point types; * Pointer types. Note that the compiler does not guarantee it will not insert stores which clear; the exclusive monitor in between an ``ldrex`` type operation and its paired; ``strex``. In practice this is only usually a risk when the extra store is on; the same cache line as the variable being modified and Clang will only insert; stack stores on its own, so it is best not to use these operations on variables; with automatic storage duration. Also, loads and stores may be implicit in code written between the ``ldrex`` and; ``strex``. Clang will not necessarily mitigate the effects of these either, so; care should be exercised. For these reasons the higher level atomic primitives should be preferred where; possible. Non-temporal load/store builtins; --------------------------------.

Loop Distribution; -----------------. Loop Distribution allows splitting a loop into multiple loops. This is; beneficial for example when the entire loop cannot be vectorized but some of the; resulting loops can. If ``distribute(enable))`` is specified and the loop has memory dependencies; that inhibit vectorization, the compiler will attempt to isolate the offending; operations into a new loop. This optimization is not enabled by default, only; loops marked with the pragma are considered. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop distribute(enable); for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {; S1: A[i + 1] = A[i] + B[i];; S2: C[i] = D[i] * E[i];; }. This loop will be split into two loops between statements S1 and S2. The; second loop containing S2 will be vectorized. Loop Distribution is currently not enabled by default in the optimizer because; it can hurt performance in some cases. For example, instruction-level; parallelism could be reduced by sequentializing the execution of the; statements S1 and S2 above. If Loop Distribution is turned on globally with; ``-mllvm -enable-loop-distribution``, specifying ``distribute(disable)`` can; be used the disable it on a per-loop basis. Additional Information; ----------------------. For convenience multiple loop hints can be specified on a single line. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize_width(4) interleave_count(8); for(...) {; ...; }. If an optimization cannot be applied any hints that apply to it will be ignored.; For example, the hint ``vectorize_width(4)`` is ignored if the loop is not; proven safe to vectorize.

Weak references; ---------------. Clang supports ARC-style weak and unsafe references in Objective-C even; outside of ARC mode.

Unsafe references are enabled; unconditionally. ARC-style weak and unsafe references cannot be used; when Objective-C garbage collection is enabled. Except as noted below, the language rules for the ``__weak`` and; ``__unsafe_unretained`` qualifiers (and the ``weak`` and; ``unsafe_unretained`` property attributes) are just as laid out; in the :doc:`ARC specification <AutomaticReferenceCounting>`.; In particular, note that some classes do not support forming weak; references to their instances, and note that special care must be; taken when storing weak references in memory where initialization; and deinitialization are outside the responsibility of the compiler; (such as in ``malloc``-ed memory). Loading from a ``__weak`` variable always implicitly retains the; loaded value. In non-ARC modes, this retain is normally balanced; by an implicit autorelease. This autorelease can be suppressed; by performing the load in the receiver position of a ``-retain``; message send (e.g. ``[weakReference retain]``); note that this performs; only a single retain (the retain done when primitively loading from; the weak reference). For the most part, ``__unsafe_unretained`` in non-ARC modes is just the; default behavior of variables and therefore is not needed. However,; it does have an effect on the semantics of block captures: normally,; copying a block which captures an Objective-C object or block pointer; causes the captured pointer to be retained or copied, respectively,; but that behavior is suppressed when the captured variable is qualified; with ``__unsafe_unretained``. Note that the ``__weak`` qualifier formerly meant the GC qualifier in; all non-ARC modes and was silently ignored outside of GC modes.

Enumerations with a fixed underlying type; -----------------------------------------. Clang provides support for C++11 enumerations with a fixed underlying type; within Objective-C. For example, one can write an enumeration type as:. .. code-block:: c++. typedef enum : unsigned char { Red, Green, Blue } Color;. This specifies that the underlying type, which is used to store the enumeration; value, is ``unsigned char``. Use ``__has_feature(objc_fixed_enum)`` to determine whether support for fixed; underlying types is available in Objective-C. Interoperability with C++11 lambdas; -----------------------------------. Clang provides interoperability between C++11 lambdas and blocks-based APIs, by; permitting a lambda to be implicitly converted to a block pointer with the; corresponding signature. For example, consider an API such as ``NSArray``'s; array-sorting method:. .. code-block:: objc. - (NSArray *)sortedArrayUsingComparator:(NSComparator)cmptr;. ``NSComparator`` is simply a typedef for the block pointer ``NSComparisonResult; (^)(id, id)``, and parameters of this type are generally provided with block; literals as arguments. However, one can also use a C++11 lambda so long as it; provides the same signature (in this case, accepting two parameters of type; ``id`` and returning an ``NSComparisonResult``):. .. code-block:: objc. NSArray *array = @[@""string 1"", @""string 21"", @""string 12"", @""String 11"",; @""String 02""];; const NSStringCompareOptions comparisonOptions; = NSCaseInsensitiveSearch | NSNumericSearch |; NSWidthInsensitiveSearch | NSForcedOrderingSearch;; NSLocale *currentLocale = [NSLocale currentLocale];; NSArray *sorted; = [array sortedArrayUsingComparator:[=](id s1, id s2) ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

Please note that Clang does not and will not support all of the GCC builtins; for vector operations. Instead of using builtins, you should use the functions; defined in target-specific header files like ``<xmmintrin.h>``, which define; portable wrappers for these.

Interleaving multiple loop iterations allows modern processors to further; improve instruction-level parallelism (ILP) using advanced hardware features,; such as multiple execution units and out-of-order execution. The vectorizer uses; a cost model that depends on the register pressure and generated code size to; select the interleaving count. Vectorization is enabled by ``vectorize(enable)`` and interleaving is enabled; by ``interleave(enable)``. This is useful when compiling with ``-Os`` to; manually enable vectorization or interleaving. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable); #pragma clang loop interleave(enable); for(...) {; ...; }. The vector width is specified by; ``vectorize_width(_value_[, fixed|scalable])``, where _value_ is a positive; integer and the type of vectorization can be specified with an optional; second parameter. The default for the second parameter is 'fixed' and; refers to fixed width vectorization, whereas 'scalable' indicates the; compiler should use scalable vectors instead. Another use of vectorize_width; is ``vectorize_width(fixed|scalable)`` where the user can hint at the type; of vectorization to use without specifying the exact width. In both variants; of the pragma the vectorizer may decide to fall back on fi",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

The unroll count can be specified explicitly with ``unroll_count(_value_)`` where; _value_ is a positive integer. If this value is greater than the trip count the; loop will be fully unrolled. Otherwise the loop is partially unrolled subject; to the same code size limit as with ``unroll(enable)``. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop unroll_count(8); for(...) {; ...; }. Unrolling of a loop can be prevented by specifying ``unroll(disable)``. Loop unroll parameters can be controlled by options; `-mllvm -unroll-count=n` and `-mllvm -pragma-unroll-threshold=n`. Loop Distribution; -----------------. Loop Distribution allows splitting a loop into multiple loops. This is; beneficial for example when the entire loop cannot be vectorized but some of the; resulting loops can. If ``distribute(enable))`` is specified and the loop has memory dependencies; that inhibit vectorization, the compiler will attempt to isolate the offending; operations into a new loop. This optimization is not enabled by default, only; loops marked with the pragma are considered. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop distribute(enable); for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {; S1: A[i + 1] = A[i] + B[i];; S2: C[i] = D[i] * E[i];; }. This loop will be split into two loops between statements S1 and S2. The; second loop containing S2 will be vectorized. Loop Distribution is currently not enabled by default in the optimizer because; it can hurt performance in some cases. For example, instruction-level; parallelism could be reduced by sequentializing the execution of the; statements S1 and S2 above. If Loop Distribution is turned on globally with; ``-mllvm -enable-loop-distribution``, specifying ``distribute(disable)`` can; be used the disable it on a per-loop basis.

You can test if; your version of clang supports namespaces on ``#pragma clang attribute`` with; ``__has_extension(pragma_clang_attribute_namespaces)``. Subject Match Rules; -------------------. The set of declarations that receive a single attribute from the attribute stack; depends on the subject match rules that were specified in the pragma. Subject; match rules are specified after the attribute. The compiler expects an; identifier that corresponds to the subject set specifier. The ``apply_to``; specifier is currently the only supported subject set specifier. It allows you; to specify match rules that form a subset of the attribute's allowed subject; set, i.e. the compiler doesn't require all of the attribute's subjects. For; example, an attribute like ``[[nodiscard]]`` whose subject set includes; ``enum``, ``record`` and ``hasType(functionType)``, requires the presence of at; least one of these rules after ``apply_to``:. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang attribute push([[nodiscard]], apply_to = enum). enum Enum1 { A1, B1 }; // The enum will receive [[nodiscard]]. struct Record1 { }; // The struct will *not* receive [[nodiscard]]. #pragma clang attribute pop. #pragma clang attribute push([[nodiscard]], apply_to = any(record, enum)). enum Enum2 { ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

The ``_Float16`` type is an interchange floating type specified in; ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015 (""Floating-point extensions for C""). It will; be supported on more targets as they define ABIs for it. The ``__bf16`` type is a non-standard extension, but it generally follows; the rules for arithmetic interchange floating types from ISO/IEC TS; 18661-3:2015. In previous versions of Clang, it was a storage-only type; that forbade arithmetic operations. It will be supported on more targets; as they define ABIs for it. The ``__fp16`` type was originally an ARM extension and is specified; by the `ARM C Language Extensions <https://github.com/ARM-software/acle/releases>`_.; Clang uses the ``binary16`` format from IEEE 754-2008 for ``__fp16``,; not the ARM alternative format. Operators that expect arithmetic operands; immediately promote ``__fp16`` operands to ``float``. It is recommended that portable code use ``_Float16`` instead of ``__fp16``,; as it has been defined by the C standards committee and has behavior that is; more familiar to most programmers. Because ``__fp16`` operands are always immediately promoted to ``float``, the; common real type of ``__fp16`` and ``_Float16`` for the purposes of the usual; arithmetic conversions is ``float``. A literal can be given ``_Float16`` type using the suffix ``f16``. For example,; ``3.14f16``. Because default argument promotion only applies to the standard floating-point; types, ``_Float16`` values are not promoted to ``double`` when passed as variadic; or untyped arguments. As a consequence, some caution must be taken when using; certain library facilities with ``_Float16``; for example, there is no ``printf`` format; specifier for ``_Float16``, and (unlike ``float``) it will not be implicitly promoted to; ``double`` when passed to ``printf``, so the programmer must explicitly cast it to; ``double`` before using it with an ``%f`` or similar specifier.

This construct is useful because there is no way to separately initialize the; real and imaginary parts of a complex variable in standard C, given that clang; does not support ``_Imaginary``.

This builtin is usable in an integer constant expression which returns a value; of type ``size_t``. The value returned is the offset in bytes to the subobject; designated by the member-designator from the beginning of an object of type; ``type-name``. Clang extends the required standard functionality in the; following way:. * In C language modes, the first argument may be the definition of a new type.; Any type declared this way is scoped to the nearest scope containing the call; to the builtin.

In case of *read write* access, ``1`` is to be used. ``locality``; indicates the expected persistence of data in cache, from ``0`` which means that; data can be discarded from cache after its next use to ``3`` which means that; data is going to be reused a lot once in cache. ``1`` and ``2`` provide; intermediate behavior between these two extremes. Query for this feature with ``__has_builtin(__builtin_prefetch)``. ``__sync_swap``; ---------------. ``__sync_swap`` is used to atomically swap integers or pointers in memory. **Syntax**:. .. code-block:: c++. type __sync_swap(type *ptr, type value, ...). **Example of Use**:. .. code-block:: c++. int old_value = __sync_swap(&value, new_value);. **Description**:. The ``__sync_swap()`` builtin extends the existing ``__sync_*()`` family of; atomic intrinsics to allow code to atomically swap the current value with the; new value. More importantly, it helps developers write more efficient and; correct code by avoiding expensive loops around; ``__sync_bool_compare_and_swap()`` or relying on the platform specific; implementation details of ``__sync_lock_test_and_set()``. The; ``__sync_swap()`` builtin is a full barrier. ``__builtin_addressof``; -----------------------. ``__builtin_addressof`` performs the functionality of the built-in ``&``; operator, ignoring any ``operator&`` overload. This is useful in constant; expressions in C++11, where there is no other way to take the address of an; object that overloads ``operator&``.

These builtins can be used for all integer types as well as (non-function); pointer types. For pointer types, these builtins operate in terms of the integer; address of the pointer and return a new pointer of the same type (including; qualifiers such as ``const``) with an adjusted address.; When aligning pointers up or down, the resulting value must be within the same; underlying allocation or one past the end (see C17 6.5.6p8, C++ [expr.add]).; This means that arbitrary integer values stored in pointer-type variables must; not be passed to these builtins. For those use cases, the builtins can still be; used, but the operation must be performed on the pointer cast to ``uintptr_t``.

However,; it does have an effect on the semantics of block captures: normally,; copying a block which captures an Objective-C object or block pointer; causes the captured pointer to be retained or copied, respectively,; but that behavior is suppressed when the captured variable is qualified; with ``__unsafe_unretained``. Note that the ``__weak`` qualifier formerly meant the GC qualifier in; all non-ARC modes and was silently ignored outside of GC modes. It now; means the ARC-style qualifier in all non-GC modes and is no longer; allowed if not enabled by either ``-fobjc-arc`` or ``-fobjc-weak``.; It is expected that ``-fobjc-weak`` will eventually be enabled by default; in all non-GC Objective-C modes. .. _objc-fixed-enum:.

This code relies on an implicit conversion from the type of the lambda; expression (an unnamed, local class type called the *closure type*) to the; corresponding block pointer type. The conversion itself is expressed by a; conversion operator in that closure type that produces a block pointer with the; same signature as the lambda itself, e.g.,. .. code-block:: objc. operator NSComparisonResult (^)(id, id)() const;. This conversion function returns a new block that simply forwards the two; parameters to the lambda object (which it captures by copy), then returns the; result. The returned block is first copied (with ``Block_copy``) and then; autoreleased. As an optimization, if a lambda expression is immediately; converted to a block pointer (as in the first example, above), then the block; is not copied and autoreleased: rather, it is given the same lifetime as a; block literal written at that point in the program, which avoids the overhead; of copying a block to the heap in the common case. The conversion from a lambda to a block pointer is only available in; Objective-C++, and not in C++ with blocks, due to its use of Objective-C memory; management (autorelease). Object Literals and Subscripting; --------------------------------. Clang provides support for :doc:`Object Literals and Subscripting; <ObjectiveCLiterals>` in Objective-C, which simplifies common Objective-C; programming patterns, makes programs more concise, and improves the safety of; container creation. There are several feature macros associated with object; literals and subscripting: ``__has_feature(objc_array_literals)`` tests the; availability of array literals; ``__has_feature(objc_dictionary_literals)``; tests the availability of dictionary literals;; ``__has_feature(objc_subscripting)`` tests the availability of object; subscriptin",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

It can be used if:. - the kernel source does not contain call expressions to (member-) function; pointers, or virtual functions. For example this extension can be used in; metaprogramming algorithms to be able to specify/detect types generically. - the generated kernel binary does not contain indirect calls because they; are eliminated using compiler optimizations e.g. devirtualization. - the selected target supports the function pointer like functionality e.g.; most CPU targets. **Example of Use**:. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_function_pointers : enable; void foo(); {; void (*fp)(); // compiled - no diagnostic generated; }. #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_function_pointers : disable; void bar(); {; void (*fp)(); // error - pointers to function are not allowed; }. ``__cl_clang_variadic_functions``; ---------------------------------.

The following four are intended to be used by the; standard library to implement the ``std::coroutine_handle`` type. **Syntax**:. .. code-block:: c. void __builtin_coro_resume(void *addr);; void __builtin_coro_destroy(void *addr);; bool __builtin_coro_done(void *addr);; void *__builtin_coro_promise(void *addr, int alignment, bool from_promise). **Example of use**:. .. code-block:: c++. template <> struct coroutine_handle<void> {; void resume() const { __builtin_coro_resume(ptr); }; void destroy() const { __builtin_coro_destroy(ptr); }; bool done() const { return __builtin_coro_done(ptr); }; // ...; protected:; void *ptr;; };. template <typename Promise> struct coroutine_ha",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

When the invocation point of ``__builtin_FUNCTION`` is not a function scope the; empty string is returned. The builtin ``__builtin_source_location`` returns a pointer to constant static; data of type ``std::source_location::__impl``. This type must have already been; defined, and must contain exactly four fields: ``const char *_M_file_name``,; ``const char *_M_function_name``, ``<any-integral-type> _M_line``, and; ``<any-integral-type> _M_column``. The fields will be populated in the same; manner as the above four builtins, except that ``_M_function_name`` is populated; with ``__PRETTY_FUNCTION__`` rather than ``__FUNCTION__``. Alignment builtins; ------------------; Clang provides builtins to support checking and adjusting alignment of; pointers and integers.; These builtins can be used to avoid relying on implementation-defined behavior; of arithmetic on integers derived from pointers.; Additionally, these builtins retain type information and, unlike bitwise; arithmetic, they can perform semantic checking on the alignment value. **Syntax**:. .. code-block:: c. Type __builtin_align_up(Type value, size_t alignment);; Type __builtin_align_down(Type value, size_t alignment);; bool __builtin_is_aligned(Type value, size_t alignment);. **Example of use**:. .. code-block:: c++. char* global_alloc_buffer;; void* my_aligned_allocator(size_t alloc_size, size_t alignment) {; char* result = __builtin_align_up(global_alloc_buffer, alignment);; // result now contains the value of global_alloc_buffer rounded up to the; // next multiple of alignment.; global_alloc_buffer = result + alloc_size;; return result;; }. void* get_start_of_page(void* ptr) {; return __builtin_align_down(ptr, PAGE_SIZE);; }. void example(char* buffer) {; if (__builtin_is_aligned(buffer, 64)) {; do_fast_aligned_copy(buffer);; } else {; do_unaligned_copy(buffer);; }; }. // In addition to pointers, the builtins can also be used on integer types; // and are evaluatable inside constant",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

These builtins can be used for all integer types as well as (non-function); pointer types. For pointer types, these builtins operate in terms of the integer; address of the pointer and return a new pointer of the same type (including; qualifiers such as ``const``) with an adjusted address.; When aligning pointers up or down, the resulting value must be within the same; underlying allocation or one past the end (see C17 6.5.6p8, C++ [expr.add]).; This means that arbitrary integer values stored in pointer-type variables must; not be passed to these builtins. For those use cases, the builtins can still be; used, but the operation must be performed on the pointer cast to ``uintptr_t``. If Clang can determine that the alignment is not a power of two at compile time,; it will result in a compilation failure. If the alignment argument is not a; power of two at run time, the behavior of these builtins is undefined. Non-standard C++11 Attributes; =============================. Clang's non-standard C++11 attributes live in the ``clang`` attribute; namespace. Clang supports GCC's ``gnu`` attribute namespace. All GCC attributes which; are accepted with the ``__attribute__((foo))`` syntax are also accepted as; ``[[gnu::foo]]``. This only extends to attributes which are specified by GCC; (see the list of `GCC function attributes; <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html>`_, `GCC variable; attributes <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html>`_, and; `GCC type attributes; <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Type-Attributes.html>`_).

PowerPC Language Extensions; ---------------------------. Set the Floating Point Rounding Mode; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; PowerPC64/PowerPC64le supports the builtin function ``__builtin_setrnd`` to set; the floating point rounding mode. This function will use the least significant; two bits of integer argument to set the floating point rounding mode. .. code-block:: c++. double __builtin_setrnd(int mode);. The effective values for mode are:. - 0 - round to nearest; - 1 - round to zero; - 2 - round to +infinity; - 3 - round to -infinity. Note that the mode argument will modulo 4, so if the integer argument is greater; than 3, it will only use the least significant two bits of the mode.; Namely, ``__builtin_setrnd(102))`` is equal to ``__builtin_setrnd(2)``. PowerPC cache builtins; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The PowerPC architecture specifies instructions implementing cache operations.; Clang provides builtins that give direct programmer access to these cache; instructions. Currently the following builtins are implemented in clang:. ``__builtin_dcbf`` copies the contents of a modified block from the data cache; to main memory and flushes the copy from the data cache. **Syntax**:. .. code-block:: c. void __dcbf(const void* addr); /* Data Cache Block Flush */. **Example of Use**:. .. code-block:: c. int a = 1;; __builtin_dcbf (&a);.

The types ``T`` currently supported are:. * Integer types with width at most 64 bits (or 128 bits on AArch64).; * Floating-point types; * Pointer types. Note that the compiler does not guarantee it will not insert stores which clear; the exclusive monitor in between an ``ldrex`` type operation and its paired; ``strex``. In practice this is only usually a risk when the extra store is on; the same cache line as the variable being modified and Clang will only insert; stack stores on its own, so it is best not to use these operations on variables; with automatic storage duration. Also, loads and stores may be implicit in code written between the ``ldrex`` and; ``strex``. Clang will not necessarily mitigate the effects of these either, so; care should be exercised. For these reasons the higher level atomic primitives should be preferred where; possible. Non-temporal load/store builtins; --------------------------------. Clang provides overloaded builtins allowing generation of non-temporal memory; accesses. .. code-block:: c. T __builtin_nontemporal_load(T *addr);; void __builtin_nontemporal_store(T value, T *addr);. The types ``T`` currently supported are:. * Integer types.; * Floating-point types.; * Vector types.

Extensions for loop hint optimizations; ======================================. The ``#pragma clang loop`` directive is used to specify hints for optimizing the; subsequent for, while, do-while, or c++11 range-based for loop. The directive; provides options for vectorization, interleaving, predication, unrolling and; distribution. Loop hints can be specified before any loop and will be ignored if; the optimization is not safe to apply. There are loop hints that control transformations (e.g. vectorization, loop; unrolling) and there are loop hints that set transformation options (e.g.; ``vectorize_width``, ``unroll_count``). Pragmas setting transformation options; imply the transformation is enabled, as if it was enabled via the corresponding; transformation pragma (e.g. ``vectorize(enable)``).

The vectorizer; automatically determines if the loop is safe and profitable to vectorize. A; vector instruction cost model is used to select the vector width. Interleaving multiple loop iterations allows modern processors to further; improve instruction-level parallelism (ILP) using advanced hardware features,; such as multiple execution units and out-of-order execution. The vectorizer uses; a cost model that depends on the register pressure and generated code size to; select the interleaving count. Vectorization is enabled by ``vectorize(enable)`` and interleaving is enabled; by ``interleave(enable)``.

These builtins read and modify; the floating-point environment, which is not always allowed and may have unexpected; behavior. Please see the section on `Accessing the floating point environment <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#accessing-the-floating-point-environment>`_ for more information. String builtins; ---------------. Clang provides constant expression evaluation support for builtins forms of; the following functions from the C standard library headers; ``<string.h>`` and ``<wchar.h>``:. * ``memchr``; * ``memcmp`` (and its deprecated BSD / POSIX alias ``bcmp``); * ``strchr``; * ``strcmp``; * ``strlen``; * ``strncmp``; * ``wcschr``; * ``wcscmp``; * ``wcslen``; * ``wcsncmp``; * ``wmemchr``; * ``wmemcmp``. In each case, the builtin form has the name of the C library function prefixed; by ``__builtin_``. Example:. .. code-block:: c. void *p = __builtin_memchr(""foobar"", 'b', 5);. In addition to the above, one further builtin is provided:. .. code-block:: c. char *__builtin_char_memchr(const char *haystack, int needle, size_t size);. ``__builtin_char_memchr(a, b, c)`` is identical to; ``(char*)__builtin_memchr(a, b, c)`` except that its use is permitted within; constant expressions in C++11 onwards (where a cast from ``void*`` to ``char",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

In each case, the builtin form has the name of the C library function prefixed; by ``__builtin_``.

Guaranteed inlined copy; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. .. code-block:: c. void __builtin_memcpy_inline(void *dst, const void *src, size_t size);. ``__builtin_memcpy_inline`` has been designed as a building block for efficient; ``memcpy`` implementations. It is identical to ``__builtin_memcpy`` but also; guarantees not to call any external functions. See LLVM IR `llvm.memcpy.inline; <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#llvm-memcpy-inline-intrinsic>`_ intrinsic; for more information.

These are designed to be a generic alternative to the; ``__opencl_atomic_*`` builtin functions for targets that support atomic memory; scopes. Atomic memory scopes are designed to assist optimizations for systems with; several levels of memory hierarchy like GPUs. The following memory scopes are; currently supported:. * ``__MEMORY_SCOPE_SYSTEM``; * ``__MEMORY_SCOPE_DEVICE``; * ``__MEMORY_SCOPE_WRKGRP``; * ``__MEMORY_SCOPE_WVFRNT``; * ``__MEMORY_SCOPE_SINGLE``. This controls whether or not the atomic operation is ordered with respect to the; whole system, the current device, an OpenCL workgroup, wavefront, or just a; single thread. If these are used on a target that does not support atomic; scopes, then they will behave exactly as the standard GNU atomic builtins.

Clang provides overloaded builtins allowing generation of non-temporal memory; accesses. .. code-block:: c. T __builtin_nontemporal_load(T *addr);; void __builtin_nontemporal_store(T value, T *addr);. The types ``T`` currently supported are:. * Integer types.; * Floating-point types.; * Vector types.

Compatibility across Clang/LLVM releases is not; guaranteed. Clang provides experimental builtins to support C++ Coroutines as defined by; https://wg21.link/P0057. The following four are intended to be used by the; standard library to implement the ``std::coroutine_handle`` type. **Syntax**:. .. code-block:: c. void __builtin_coro_resume(void *addr);; void __builtin_coro_destroy(void *addr);; bool __builtin_coro_done(void *addr);; void *__builtin_coro_promise(void *addr, int alignment, bool from_promise). **Example of use**:. .. code-bl",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

As with the GCC; implementation, these attributes must appertain to the *declarator-id* in a; declaration, which means they must go either at the start of the declaration or; immediately after the name being declared. For example, this applies the GNU ``unused`` attribute to ``a`` and ``f``, and; also applies the GNU ``noreturn`` attribute to ``f``. .. code-block:: c++. [[gnu::unused]] int a, f [[gnu::noreturn]] ();. Target-Specific Extensions; ==========================. Clang supports some language features conditionally on some targets. ARM/AArch64 Language Extensions; -------------------------------. Memory Barrier Intrinsics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Clang implements the ``__dmb``, ``__dsb`` and ``__isb`` intrinsics as defined; in the `Arm C Language Extensions; <https://github.com/ARM-software/acle/releases>`_.; Note that these intrinsics are implemented as motion barriers that block; reordering of memory accesses and side effect instructions. Other instructions; like simple arithmetic may be reordered around the intrinsic. If you expect to; have no reordering at all, use inline assembly instead. X86/X86-64 Language Extensions; ------------------------------. The X86 backend has these language extensions:. Memory references to specified segments; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Annotating a pointer with address space #256 causes it to be code generated; relative to the X86 GS segment register, address space #257 causes it to be; relative to the X86 FS segment, and address space #258 causes it to be; relative to the X86 SS segment. Note that this is a very very low-level; feature that should only be used if you know what you're doing (for example in; an OS kernel). Here is an example:. .. code-block:: c++. #define GS_RELATIVE __attribute__((address_space(256))); int foo(int GS_RELATIVE *P) {; return *P;; }. Which compiles to (on X86-32):. .. code-blo",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

PowerPC Language Extensions; ---------------------------. Set the Floating Point Rounding Mode; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; PowerPC64/PowerPC64le supports the builtin function ``__builtin_setrnd`` to set; the floating point rounding mode. This function will use the least significant; two bits of integer argument to set the floating point rounding mode. .. code-block:: c++. double __builtin_setrnd(int mode);. The effective values for mode are:. - 0 - round to nearest; - 1 - round to zero; - 2 - round to +infinity; - 3 - round to -infinity. Note that the mode argument will modulo 4, so if the integer argument is greater; than 3, it will only use the least significant two bits of the mode.; Namely, ``__builtin_setrnd(102))`` is equal to ``__builtin_setrnd(2)``. PowerPC cache builtins; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The PowerPC architecture specifies instructions implementing cache operations.; Clang provides builtins that give direct programmer access to these cache; instructions. Currently the following builtins are implemented in clang:. ``__builtin_dcbf`` copies the contents of a modified block from the data cache; to main memory and flushes the copy from the data cache. **Syntax**:. .. code-block:: c. void __dcbf(const void* addr); /* Data Cache Block Flush */. **Example of Use**:. .. code-block:: c. int a = 1;; __builtin_dcbf (&a);. Extensions for Static Analysis; ==============================. Clang supports additional attributes that are useful for documenting program; invariants and rules for static analysis tools, such as the `Clang Static; Analyzer <https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/>`_. These attributes are documented; in the analyzer's `list of source-level annotations; <https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/annotations.html>`_. Extensions for Dynamic Analysis; ===============================. Use ``__has_feature(address_sanitizer)`` to check if the code is being built; with :doc:`AddressSanitizer`.

This is useful for specifying the optimal; width/count of the set of target architectures supported by your application. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize_width(2); #pragma clang loop interleave_count(2); for(...) {; ...; }. Specifying a width/count of 1 disables the optimization, and is equivalent to; ``vectorize(disable)`` or ``interleave(disable)``. Vector predication is enabled by ``vectorize_predicate(enable)``, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable); #pragma clang loop vectorize_predicate(enable); for(...) {; ...; }. This predicates (masks) all instructions in the loop, which allows the scalar; remainder loop (the tail) to be folded into the main vectorized loop. This; might be more efficient when vector predication is efficiently supported by the; target platform. Loop Unrolling; --------------. Unrolling a loop reduces the loop control overhead and exposes more; opportunities for ILP. Loops can be fully or partially unrolled. Full unrolling; eliminates the loop and replaces it with an enumerated sequence of loop; iterations. Full unrolling is only possible if the loop trip count is known at; compile time. Partial unrolling replicates the loop body within the loop and; reduces the trip count. If ``unroll(enable)`` is specified the unroller will attempt to fully unroll the; loop if the trip count is known at compile time. If the fully unrolled code size; is greater than an internal limit the loop will be partially unrolled up to this; limit. If the trip count is not known at compile time the loop will be partially; unrolled with a heuristically chosen unroll factor. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop unroll(enable); for(...) {; ...; }. If ``unroll(full)`` is specified the unroller will attempt to fully unroll the; loop if the trip count is known at compile time identically to; ``unroll(enable)``.

Weak references; ---------------. Clang supports ARC-style weak and unsafe references in Objective-C even; outside of ARC mode. Weak references must be explicitly enabled with; the ``-fobjc-weak`` option; use ``__has_feature((objc_arc_weak))``; to test whether they are enabled. Unsafe references are enabled; unconditionally. ARC-style weak and unsafe references cannot be used; when Objective-C garbage collection is enabled. Except as noted below, the language rules for the ``__weak`` and; ``__unsafe_unretained`` qualifiers (and the ``weak`` and; ``unsafe_unretained`` property attributes) are just as laid out; in the :doc:`ARC specification <AutomaticReferenceCounting>`.; In particular, note that some classes do not support forming weak; references to their instances, and note that special care must be; taken when storing weak references in memory where initialization; and deinitialization are outside the responsibility of the compiler; (such as in ``malloc``-ed memory).

With the exception; of ``__builtin_COLUMN``, ``__builtin_FILE_NAME`` and ``__builtin_FUNCSIG``,; these builtins are also implemented by GCC. **Syntax**:. .. code-block:: c. const char *__builtin_FILE();; const char *__builtin_FILE_NAME(); // Clang only; const char *__builtin_FUNCTION();; const char *__builtin_FUNCSIG(); // Microsoft; unsigned __builtin_LINE();; unsigned __builtin_COLUMN(); // Clang only; const std::source_location::__impl *__builtin_source_location();. **Example of use**:. .. code-block:: c++. void my_assert(bool pred, int line = __builtin_LINE(), // Captures line of caller; const char* file = __builtin_FILE(),; const char* function = __builtin_FUNCTION()) {; if (pred) return;; printf(""%s:%d assertion failed in function %s\n"", file, line, function);; std::abort();; }. struct MyAggregateType {; int x;; int line = __builtin_LINE(); // captures line where aggregate initialization occurs; };; static_assert(MyAggregateType{42}.line == __LINE__);. struct MyClassType {; int line = __builtin_LINE(); // captures line of the constructor used during initialization; constexpr MyClassType(int) { assert(line == __LINE__); }; };. **Description**:.

These builtins are; constant expressions. When the builtins appear as part of a default function argument the invocation; point is the location of the caller. When the builtins appear as part of a; default member initializer, the invocation point is the location of the; constructor or aggregate initialization used to create the object.

You can test if; your version of clang supports namespaces on ``#pragma clang attribute`` with; ``__has_extension(pragma_clang_attribute_namespaces)``. Subject Match Rules; -------------------. The set of declarations that receive a single attribute from the attribute stack; depends on the subject match rules that were specified in the pragma. Subject; match rules are specified after the attribute. The compiler expects an; identifier that corresponds to the subject set specifier. The ``apply_to``; specifier is currently the only supported subject set specifier. It allows you; to specify match rules that form a subset of the attribute's allowed subject; set, i.e. the compiler doesn't require all of the attribute's subjects. For; example, an attribute like ``[[nodiscard]]`` whose subject set includes; ``enum``, ``record`` and ``hasType(functionType)``, requires the presence of at; least one of these rules after ``apply_to``:. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang attribute push([[nodiscard]], apply_to = enum). enum Enum1 { A1, B1 }; // The enum will receive [[nodi",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

Deprecating Macros; ==================. Clang supports the pragma ``#pragma clang deprecated``, which can be used to; provide deprecation warnings for macro uses. For example:. .. code-block:: c. #define MIN(x, y) x < y ? x : y; #pragma clang deprecated(MIN, ""use std::min instead""). int min(int a, int b) {; return MIN(a, b); // warning: MIN is deprecated: use std::min instead; }. ``#pragma clang deprecated`` should be preferred for this purpose over; ``#pragma GCC warning`` because the warning can be controlled with; ``-Wdeprecated``. Restricted Expansion Macros; ===========================. Clang supports the pragma ``#pragma clang restrict_expansion``, which can be; used restrict macro expansion in headers. This can be valuable when providing; headers with ABI stability requirements. Any expansion of the annotated macro; processed by the preprocessor after the ``#pragma`` annotation will log a; warning. Redefining the macro or undefining the macro will not be diagnosed, nor; will expansion of the macro within the main source file. For example:. .. code-block:: c. #define TARGET_ARM 1; #pragma clang restrict_expansion(TARGET_ARM, ""<reason>""). /// Foo.h; struct Foo {; #if TARGET_ARM // warning: TARGET_ARM is marked unsafe in headers: <reason>; uint32_t X;; #else; uint64_t X;; #endif; };. /// main.c; #include ""foo.h""; #if TARGET_ARM // No warning in main source file; X_TYPE uint32_t; #else; X_TYPE uint64_t; #endif. This warning is controlled by ``-Wpedantic-macros``. Final Macros; ============. Clang supports the pragma ``#pragma clang final``, which can be used to; mark macros as final, meaning they cannot be undef'd or re-defined.

Clang provides support for C++11 enumerations with a fixed underlying type; within Objective-C. For example, one can write an enumeration type as:. .. code-block:: c++. typedef enum : unsigned char { Red, Green, Blue } Color;. This specifies that the underlying type, which is used to store the enumeration; value, is ``unsigned char``. Use ``__has_feature(objc_fixed_enum)`` to determine whether support for fixed; underlying types is available in Objective-C. Interoperability with C++11 lambdas; -----------------------------------. Clang provides interoperability between C++11 lambdas and blocks-based APIs, by; permitting a lambda to be implicitly converted to a block pointer with the; corresponding signature. For example, consider an API such as ``NSArray``'s; array-sorting method:. .. code-block:: objc. - (NSArray *)sortedArrayUsingComparator:(NSComparator)cmptr;. ``NSComparator`` is simply a typedef for the block pointer ``NSComparisonResult; (^)(id, id)``, and parameters of this type are generally provided with block; literals as arguments. However, one can also use a C++11 lambda so long as it; provides the same signature (in this case, accepting two parameters of type; ``id`` and returning an ``NSComparisonResult``):. .. code-block:: objc. NSArray *array = @[@""string 1"", @""string 21"", @""string 12"", @""String 11"",; @""String 02""];; const NSStringCompareOptions comparisonOptions; = NSCaseInsensitiveSearch | NSNumericSearch |; NSWidthInsensitiveSearch | NSForcedOrderingSearch;; NSLocale *currentLocale = [NSLocale currentLocale];; NSArray *sorted; = [array sortedArrayUsingComparator:[=](id s1, id s2) -> NSComparisonResult {; NSRange string1Range = NSMakeRange(0, [s1 length]);; return [s1 compare:s2 options:comparisonOptions; range:string1Range locale:currentLocale];; }];; NSLog(@""sorted: %@"", sorted);.

This code relies on an implicit conversion from the type of the lambda; expression (an unnamed, local class type called the *closure type*) to the; corresponding block pointer type. The conversion itself is expressed by a; conversion operator in that closure type that produces a block pointer with the; same signature as the lambda itself, e.g.,. .. code-block:: objc. operator NSComparisonResult (^)(id, id)() const;. This conversion function returns a new block that simply forwards the two; parameters to the lambda object (which it captures by copy), then returns the; result. The returned block is first copied (with ``Block_copy``) and then; autoreleased. As an optimization, if a lambda expression is immediately; converted to a block pointer (as in the first example, above), then the block; is not copied and autoreleased: rather, it is given the same lifetime as a; block literal written at that point in the program, which avoids the overhead; of copying a block to the heap in the common case. The conversion from a lambda to a block pointer is only available in; Objective-C++, and not in C++ with blocks, due to its use of Objective-C memory; management (autorelease).

Query the presence of this new mangling with; ``__has_feature(objc_protocol_qualifier_mangling)``. Initializer lists for complex numbers in C; ==========================================. clang supports an extension which allows the following in C:. .. code-block:: c++. #include <math.h>; #include <complex.h>; complex float x = { 1.0f, INFINITY }; // Init to (1, Inf). This construct is useful because there is no way to separately initialize the; real and imaginary parts of a complex variable in standard C, given that clang; does not support ``_Imaginary``. (Clang also supports the ``__real__`` and; ``__imag__`` extensions from gcc, which help in some cases, but are not usable; in static initializers.). Note that this extension does not allow eliding the braces; the meaning of the; following two lines is different:. .. code-block:: c++. complex float x[] = { { 1.0f, 1.0f } }; // [0] = (1, 1); complex float x[] = { 1.0f, 1.0f }; // [0] = (1, 0), [1] = (1, 0). This extension also works in C++ mode, as far as that goes, but does not apply; to the C++ ``std::complex``. (In C++11, list initialization allows the same; syntax to be used with ``std::complex`` with the same meaning.). For GCC compatibility, ``__builtin_complex(re, im)`` can also be used to; construct a complex number from the given real and imaginary components. OpenCL Features; ===============.

The ``__builtin_dump_struct`` function is used to print the fields of a simple; structure and their values for debugging purposes. The first argument of the; builtin should be a pointer to a complete record type to dump. The second argument ``f``; should be some callable expression, and can be a function object or an overload; set. The builtin calls ``f``, passing any further arguments ``args...``; followed by a ``printf``-compatible format string and the corresponding; arguments. ``f`` may be called more than once, and ``f`` and ``args`` will be; evaluated once per call. In C++, ``f`` may be a template or overload set and; resolve to different functions for each call. In the format string, a suitable format specifier will be used for builtin; types that Clang knows how to format. This includes standard builtin types, as; well as aggregate structures, ``void*`` (printed with ``%p``), and ``const; char*`` (printed with ``%s``).

A builtin function for the target-specific ``va_start`` function-like macro.; The ``parameter-name`` argument is the name of the parameter preceding the; ellipsis (``...``) in the function signature.

If these are used on a target that does not support atomic; scopes, then they will behave exactly as the standard GNU atomic builtins. Low-level ARM exclusive memory builtins; ---------------------------------------. Clang provides overloaded builtins giving direct access to the three key ARM; instructions for implementing atomic operations. .. code-block:: c. T __builtin_arm_ldrex(const volatile T *addr);; T __builtin_arm_ldaex(const volatile T *addr);; int __builtin_arm_strex(T val, volatile T *addr);; int __builtin_arm_stlex(T val, volatile T *addr);; void __builtin_arm_clrex(void);. The types ``T`` currently supported are:. * Integer types with width at most 64 bits (or 128 bits on AArch64).; * Floating-point types; * Pointer types. Note that the compiler does not guarantee it will not insert stores which clear; the exclusive monitor in between an ``ldrex`` type operation and its paired; ``strex``. In practice this is only usually a risk when the extra store is on; the same cache line as the variable being modified and Clang will only insert; stack stores on its own, so it is best not to use these operations on variables; with automatic storage duration. Also, loads and stores may be implicit in code written between the ``ldrex`` and; ``strex``. Clang will not necessarily mitigate the effects of these either, so; care should be exercised. For these reasons the higher level atomic primitives should be preferred where; possible. Non-temporal load/store builtins; --------------------------------. Clang provides overloaded builtins allowing generation of non-temporal memory; accesses. .. code-block:: c. T __builtin_nontemporal_load(T *addr);; void __builtin_nontemporal_store(T value, T *addr);. The types ``T`` currently supported are:. * Integer types.; * Floating-point types.; * Vector types.

C++ Coroutines support builtins; --------------------------------. .. warning::; This is a work in progress. Compatibility across Clang/LLVM releases is not; guaranteed. Clang provides experimental builtins to support C++ Coroutines as defined by; https://wg21.link/P0057. The following four are intended to be used by the; standard library to implement the ``std::coroutine_handle`` type. **Syntax**:. .. code-block:: c. void __builtin_coro_resume(void *addr);; void __builtin_coro_destroy(void *addr);; bool __builtin_coro_done(void *addr);; void *__builtin_coro_promise(void *addr, int alignment, bool from_promise). **Example of use**:. .. code-block:: c++. template <> struct coroutine_handle<void> {; void resume() const { __builtin_coro_resume(ptr); }; void destroy() const { __builtin_coro_destroy(ptr); }; bool done() const { return __builtin_coro_done(ptr); }; // ...; protected:; void *ptr;; };. template <typename Promise> struct coroutine_handle : coroutine_handle<> {; // ...; Promise &promise() const {; return *reinterpret_cast<Promise *>(; __builtin_coro_promise(ptr, alignof(Promise), /*from-promise=*/false));; }; static coroutine_handle from_promise(Promise &promise) {; coroutine_handle p;; p.ptr = __builtin_coro_promise(&promise, alignof(Promise),; /*from-promise=*/true);; return p;; }; };.

[[gnu::unused]] int a, f [[gnu::noreturn]] ();. Target-Specific Extensions; ==========================. Clang supports some language features conditionally on some targets. ARM/AArch64 Language Extensions; -------------------------------. Memory Barrier Intrinsics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Clang implements the ``__dmb``, ``__dsb`` and ``__isb`` intrinsics as defined; in the `Arm C Language Extensions; <https://github.com/ARM-software/acle/releases>`_.; Note that these intrinsics are implemented as motion barriers that block; reordering of memory accesses and side effect instructions. Other instructions; like simple arithmetic may be reordered around the intrinsic. If you expect to; have no reordering at all, use inline assembly instead. X86/X86-64 Language Extensions; ------------------------------. The X86 backend has these language extensions:. Memory references to specified segments; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Annotating a pointer with address space #256 causes it to be code generated; relative to the X86 GS segment register, address space #257 causes it to be; relative to the X86 FS segment, and address space #258 causes it to be; relative to the X86 SS segment. Note that this is a very very low-level; feature that should only be used if you know what you're doing (for example in; an OS kernel). Here is an example:. .. code-block:: c++. #define GS_RELATIVE __attribute__((address_space(256))); int foo(int GS_RELATIVE *P) {; return *P;; }.

Loop Distribution is currently not enabled by default in the optimizer because; it can hurt performance in some cases. For example, instruction-level; parallelism could be reduced by sequentializing the execution of the; statements S1 and S2 above. If Loop Distribution is turned on globally with; ``-mllvm -enable-loop-distribution``, specifying ``distribute(disable)`` can; be used the disable it on a per-loop basis. Additional Information; ----------------------. For convenience multiple loop hints can be specified on a single line. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize_width(4) interleave_count(8); for(...) {; ...; }. If an optimization cannot be applied any hints that apply to it will be ignored.; For example, the hint ``vectorize_width(4)`` is ignored if the loop is not; proven safe to vectorize.

Extensions to specify floating-point flags; ====================================================. The ``#pragma clang fp`` pragma allows floating-point options to be specified; for a section of the source code. This pragma can only appear at file scope or; at the start of a compound statement (excluding comments). When using within a; compound statement, the pragma is active within the scope of the compound; statement. Currently, the following settings can be controlled with this pragma:. ``#pragma clang fp reassociate`` allows control over the reassociation; of floating point expressions. When enabled, this pragma allows the expression; ``x + (y + z)`` to be reassociated as ``(x + y) + z``.; Reassociation can also occur across multiple statements.; This pragma can be used to disable reassociation when it is otherwise; enabled for the translation unit with the ``-fassociative-math`` flag.; The pragma can take two values: ``on`` and ``off``. .. code-block:: c++. float f",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst

Using the ``-ast-merge`` Clang front-end action; -----------------------------------------------. The ``-ast-merge <pch-file>`` command-line switch can be used to merge from the given serialized AST file.; This file represents the source context.; When this switch is present then each top-level AST node of the source context is being merged into the destination context.; If the merge was successful then ``ASTConsumer::HandleTopLevelDecl`` is called for the Decl.; This results that we can execute the original front-end action on the extended AST.

The ``ASTImporter`` class is part of Clang's core library, the AST library.; It imports nodes of an ``ASTContext`` into another ``ASTContext``. In this document, we assume basic knowledge about the Clang AST. See the :doc:`Introduction; to the Clang AST <IntroductionToTheClangAST>` if you want to learn more; about how the AST is structured.; Knowledge about :doc:`matching the Clang AST <LibASTMatchers>` and the `reference for the matchers <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchersReference.html>`_ are also useful. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ------------. ``ASTContext`` holds long-lived AST nodes (such as types and decls) that can be referred to throughout the semantic analysis of a file.; In some cases it is preferable to work with more than one ``ASTContext``.; For example, we'd like to parse multiple different files inside the same Clang tool.; It may be convenient if we could view the set of the resulting ASTs as if they were one AST resulting from the parsing of each file together.; ``ASTImporter`` provides the way to copy types or declarations from one ``ASTContext`` to another.; We refer to the context from which we import as the **""from"" context** or *source context*; and the context into which we import as the **""to"" context** or *destination context*. Existing clients of the ``ASTImporter`` library are Cross Translation Unit (CTU) static analysis and the LLDB expression parser.; CTU static analysis imports a definition of a function if its definition is found in another translation unit (TU).; This way the analysis can breach out from the single TU limitation.; LLDB's ``expr`` command parses a user-defined expression, creates an ``ASTContext`` for that and then imports the missing definitions from the AST what we got from the debug information (DWARF, etc).

For now, we will just print a message explaining that we found a loop.; The next section will deal with recursively traversing the AST to; discover all changes needed. As a side note, it's not as trivial to test if two expressions are the same,; though Clang has already done the hard work for us by providing a way to; canonicalize expressions:. .. code-block:: c++. static bool areSameExpr(ASTContext *Context, const Expr *First,; const Expr *Second) {; if (!First || !Second); return false;; llvm::FoldingSetNodeID FirstID, SecondID;; First->Profile(FirstID, *Context, true);; Second->Profile(SecondID, *Context, true);; return FirstID == SecondID;; }. This code relies on the comparison between two; ``llvm::FoldingSetNodeIDs``. As the documentation for; ``Stmt::Profile()`` indicates, the ``Profile()`` member function builds; a description of a node in the AST, based on its properties, along with; those of its children. ``FoldingSetNodeID`` then serves as a hash we can; use to compare expressions.

And we're live. All of the tests should pass. Finally, we want to set Clang as its own compiler. .. code-block:: console. cd ~/clang-llvm/build; ccmake ../llvm-project/llvm. The second command will bring up a GUI for configuring Clang. You need; to set the entry for ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER``. Press ``'t'`` to turn on; advanced mode.

Step 3.5: More Complicated Matchers; ===================================. Our simple matcher is capable of discovering for loops, but we would; still need to filter out many more ourselves. We can do a good portion; of the remaining work with some cleverly chosen matchers, but first we; need to decide exactly which properties we want to allow. How can we characterize for loops over arrays which would be eligible; for translation to range-based syntax? Range based loops over arrays of; size ``N`` that:. - start at index ``0``; - iterate consecutively; - end at index ``N-1``. We already check for (1), so all we need to add is a check to the loop's; condition to ensure that the loop's index variable is compared against; ``N`` and another check to ensure that the increment step just; increments this same variable. The matcher for (2) is straightforward:; require a pre- or post-increment of the same variable declared in the; init portion. Unfortunately, such a matcher is impossible to write. Matchers contain; no logic for comparing two arbitrary AST nodes and determining whether; or not they are equal, so the best we can do is matching more than we; would like to allow, and punting extra comparisons to the callback. In any case, we can start building this sub-matcher. We can require that; the increment step be a unary increment like this:. .. code-block:: c++. hasIncrement(unaryOperator(hasOperatorName(""++""))). Specifying what is incremented introduces another quirk of Clang's AST:; Usages of variables are represented as ``DeclRefExpr``'s (""declaration; reference expressions"") because they are expressions which refer to; variable declarations.
