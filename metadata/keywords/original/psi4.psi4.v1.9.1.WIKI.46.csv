SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions. Publications resulting from the use of the SAPT0 code; should cite the following publications: [Hohenstein:2010:184111] and; [Hohenstein:2011:174107].

Higher-Order SAPT¶; For smaller systems (up to the size of a nucleic acid base pair), more; accurate interaction energies can be obtained through higher-order SAPT; computations. The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies for closed-shell systems; only. Publications resulting from the use of the higher-order SAPT code; should cite the following:; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].; For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106], whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors. Thanks to; natural orbital methods [Parrish:2013:174102], the SAPT code; is able to include CCD dispersion with only a modest additional cost.; Computations employing CCD dispersion should cite [Parrish:2013:174102].; To request CCD dispersion treatment in a SAPT computation, simply append; (ccd) to the name of the method, as in the following examples; energy('sapt2+(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)').

The charge-transfer energy; can be computed with the SAPT module as described by Stone; and Misquitta [Misquitta:2009:201].; Charge-transfer energies can be obtained from the following calls to the; energy function.; energy('sapt0-ct'); energy('sapt2-ct'); energy('sapt2+-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3-ct'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)-ct'). For now, charge transfer computations are not available with open-shell SAPT0.; A SAPT charge-transfer analysis will perform 5 HF computations: the dimer; in the dimer basis, monomer A in the dimer basis, monomer B in the dimer; basis, monomer A in the monomer A basis, and monomer B in the monomer B; basis. Next, it performs two SAPT computations, one in the dimer basis and; one in the monomer basis.

It is also possible to run a closed-shell SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set. Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example; molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation. Note that an error will be thrown if each atom in the; third monomer is not a ghost to prevent confusion with three-body SAPT which is; not currently supported by Psi4.

In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. \[H=F_A+W_A+F_B+W_B+V\]; Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, \(F\), the fluctuation potential of each monomer, \(W\), and the; interaction potential, \(V\). The monomer Fock operators, \(F_A+F_B\), are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of \(V\), \(W_A\), and \(W_B\).; Through first-order in \(V\), electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in \(V\). For; a complete description of SAPT, the reader is referred to the excellent; review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz [Jeziorski:1994:1887].; Several truncations of the closed-shell SAPT expansion are available in the SAPT; module of PSI4. The simplest truncation of SAPT is denoted SAPT0; and defined in Eq. (1).

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions. Publications resulting from the use of the SAPT0 code; should cite the following publications: [Hohenstein:2010:184111] and; [Hohenstein:2011:174107]. If the open-shell SAPT0 code is used,; [Gonthier:2016:134106] should be additionally cited. Basic SAPT0 Keywords¶. SAPT_LEVEL¶. The level of theory for SAPT.

MP2 Natural Orbitals¶; One of the unique features of the SAPT module is its ability to use; MP2 natural orbitals (NOs) to speed up the evaluation of the triples; contribution to dispersion. By transforming to the MP2 NO basis, we can; throw away virtual orbitals that are expected to contribute little to the; dispersion energy. Speedups in excess of \(50 \times\) are possible. In; practice, this approximation is very good and should always be applied.; Publications resulting from the use of MP2 NO-based approximations should; cite the following: [Hohenstein:2010:104107].

In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. \[H=F_A+W_A+F_B+W_B+V\]; Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, \(F\), the fluctuation potential of each monomer, \(W\), and the; interaction potential, \(V\). The monomer Fock operators, \(F_A+F_B\), are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of \(V\), \(W_A\), and \(W_B\).; Through first-order in \(V\), electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in \(V\).

The factorization of the SAPT energy; expressions, as implemented in PSI4, assumes the use of density-fitted; two-electron integrals, therefore, the closed-shell SAPT module cannot be run with; exact integrals. In practice, we have found that the density-fitting; approximation introduces negligible errors into the SAPT energy; (often less than 0.01 kcal/mol for small dimers) and greatly; improves efficiency.; The latest addition to the SAPT code is the SAPT0 method for open-shell; monomers [Gonthier:2016:134106]. This code is available for both exact and density fitted integrals,; except for the dispersion terms which implementation relies on a density fitting; factorization. Both UHF and ROHF REFERENCE can be used, but coupled; induction computations are currently not supported with ROHF. This means that orbital; relaxation is not included for ROHF and the uncoupled induction term is computed instead.; If both monomers are open-shell, their coupling is assumed to be high spin, i.e.; two doublets would interact to form a triplet. The S2 approximation and scaling¶; All exchange terms in SAPT arise from the antisymmetrization; of the wavefunctions of monomers A and B. Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the \(S^{2}\); approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron; pair between monomers.; The \(S^{2}\) approximation is usually pretty good, but may; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate these deviations, Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommend to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; where the recommended exponent is \(\alpha = 1\).

Like higher-order SAPT, SAPT(DFT) requires; sufficient memory to hold \(2ovN_aux\) doubles.; SAPT(DFT) requires a few special treatments to obtain accurate; result. The DFT functionals used in SAPT(DFT) need to be asymptotically; corrected with Gradient Regulated Asymptotic Correction scheme (GRAC),; in order to recover the correct long-range asymptotic behavior; (approaching \(-1/r\) as \(r\) approaches infinity). The program; requires manual input of GRAC shift parameter for each monomer through; keywords SAPT_DFT_GRAC_SHIFT_A and SAPT_DFT_GRAC_SHIFT_B,; which should be equal to the difference of the actual ionization; potential and the corresponding Kohn-Sham HOMO energy.

Higher-Order SAPT¶; For smaller systems (up to the size of a nucleic acid base pair), more; accurate interaction energies can be obtained through higher-order SAPT; computations. The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies for closed-shell systems; only. Publications resulting from the use of the higher-order SAPT code; should cite the following:; [Hohenstein:2010:014101].; For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106], whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors.

A brief note on memory usage: the higher-order SAPT code assumes that; certain quantities can be held in core. This code requires sufficient; memory to hold \(3o^2v^2+v^2N_{aux}\) arrays in core. With this; requirement computations on the adenine-thymine complex can be performed; with an aug-cc-pVTZ basis in less than 64GB of memory.; Higher-order SAPT is treated separately from the highly optimized SAPT0; code, therefore, higher-order SAPT uses a separate set of keywords.; The following keywords are relevant for higher-order SAPT.

A brief note on memory usage: the higher-order SAPT code assumes that; certain quantities can be held in core. This code requires sufficient; memory to hold \(3o^2v^2+v^2N_{aux}\) arrays in core. With this; requirement computations on the adenine-thymine complex can be performed; with an aug-cc-pVTZ basis in less than 64GB of memory.; Higher-order SAPT is treated separately from the highly optimized SAPT0; code, therefore, higher-order SAPT uses a separate set of keywords.; The following keywords are relevant for higher-order SAPT. Basic Keywords for Higher-order SAPT¶. BASIS¶. Primary basis set, describes the monomer molecular orbitals. Type: string; Possible Values: basis string; Default: No Default. DF_BASIS_SAPT¶. Auxiliary basis set for SAPT density fitting computations. Defaults to a RI basis. Type: string; Possible Values: basis string; Default: No Default. FREEZE_CORE¶. Specifies how many core orbitals to freeze in correlated computations. TRUE or 1 will default to freezing the previous noble gas shell on each atom. In case of positive charges on fragments, an additional shell may be unfrozen, to ensure there are valence electrons in each fragment. With FALSE or 0, no electrons are frozen (with the exception of electrons treated by an ECP).

Charge-Transfer in SAPT¶; It is possible to obtain the stabilization energy of a complex due to; charge-transfer effects from a SAPT computation. The charge-transfer energy; can be computed with the SAPT module as described by Stone; and Misquitta [Misquitta:2009:201].; Charge-transfer energies can be obtained from the following calls to the; energy function.; energy('sapt0-ct'); energy('sapt2-ct'); energy('sapt2+-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3-ct'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)-ct').

Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example; molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation. Note that an error will be thrown if each atom in the; third monomer is not a ghost to prevent confusion with three-body SAPT which is; not currently supported by Psi4. Interpreting SAPT Results¶; We will examine the results of a SAPT2+3/aug-cc-pVDZ computation on the; water dimer. This computation can be performed with the following; input:; molecule water_dimer {; 0 1; O -1.551007 -0.114520 0.000000; H -1.934259 0.762503 0.000000; H -0.599677 0.040712 0.000000; --; 0 1; O 1.350625 0.111469 0.000000; H 1.680398 -0.373741 -0.758561; H 1.680398 -0.373741 0.758561; units angstrom; }. set globals {; basis aug-cc-pvdz; guess sad; scf_type df; }. set sapt {; print 1; nat_orbs_t2 true; freeze_core true; }. energy('sapt2+3').

Caution; January 28th 2016, the default for all NAT_ORBS options; was changed to true.

The S2 approximation and scaling¶; All exchange terms in SAPT arise from the antisymmetrization; of the wavefunctions of monomers A and B. Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the \(S^{2}\); approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron; pair between monomers.; The \(S^{2}\) approximation is usually pretty good, but may; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate these deviations, Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]; recommend to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; where the recommended exponent is \(\alpha = 1\). To obtain SAPT energies with this scaling,; simply set the keyword exch_scale_alpha true. Alternatively, another value for \(\alpha\); can be specified by setting EXCH_SCALE_ALPHA to a value. For example,; set exch_scale_alpha 1.0. will set \(\alpha = 1.0\) and scale exchange energies with \(p_{EX}(1.0)\).; Instead of this straightforward scaling, SAPT0 energies benefit from a slightly modified; recipe that involves an empirically adjusted exponent \(\alpha = 3.0\).; To distinguish it from its unscaled counterpart, this energy is denoted sSAPT0 (see [Parker:2014:094106]).

These results are for the water dimer geometry shown above computed with; SAPT0/aug-cc-pVDZ. Monomer-Centered Basis Computations¶; The charge-transfer analysis above is carried out by taking the; difference between SAPT induction as calculated in the dimer-centered; basis (i.e., each monomer sees the basis functions on both monomers); vs. the monomer-centered basis (i.e., each monomer utilizes only its; own basis set). It is also possible to run a closed-shell SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set. Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation.

Initial Guess¶; In each step of the SCF procedure, a new Fock or Kohn–Sham potential is built; according to the previous density, following which the potential is diagonalized; to produce new molecular orbitals, from which a new density is computed. This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. COREDiagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems.

SOLVER_MAXITER: maximum number of iterations; SOLVER_CONVERGENCE: eigenvector convergence threshold; SOLVER_N_ROOT: Solve for N eigenvectors in each irreducible representation; SOLVER_N_GUESS: Use N guess vectors, this needs to be larger than the number of roots so that the lowest ones can be captured reliably. Default within this context: 3; SOLVER_MIN_SUBSPACE: Minimum size of the subspace when collapsing.; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE: Maximum size of the subspace. Default within this context: 12. In case convergence problems are encountered during the Davidson procedure,; it is recommended to first increase SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE, especially if you solve; for a large number of roots.

The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations \(N,N+2,\ldots\), invoking; MOM_START N can often rescue the convergence of the SCF. MOM can; be used in concert with DIIS, though care should be taken to not turn MOM on; until the oscillatory behavior begins. Damping [Off by Default]In some cases, a static mixing of Fock Matrices from adjacent; iterations can quench oscillations. This mixing, known as; “damping” can be activated by setting the; DAMPING_PERCENTAGE keyword to a nonzero percent. Damping is; turned off when the DIIS error is smaller than; DAMPING_CONVERGENCE. Level shifting [Off by default]A commonly used alternative to damping is to use level shifting,; which decreases the mixing of occupied and unoccupied orbitals in; the SCF update by moving the unoccupied orbitals up in energy. It; can be shown that the SCF procedure always converges with a; suitably large level shift; however, the larger the shift is, the; slower the convergence becomes, and the calculation may end up; converging onto a higher lying SCF solution. Because of this, in; practice level shifting is most useful in the initial phase of the; calculation to reduce the orbital error enough for DIIS to work; well. The level shift is controlled by the parameter; LEVEL_SHIFT, and it is turned off when the DIIS error is; smaller than LEVEL_SHIFT_CUTOFF. Reasonable values for; the shift and convergence threshold are 5.0 and 1e-2,; respectively. SOSCF [Off by Default]See Second-order Convergence.

Note that this algorithm; should use the -JKFIT series of auxiliary bases, not the -RI or; -MP2FIT bases. The default guess for auxiliary basis set should work; for most bases, otherwise the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword can; be used to manually specify the auxiliary basis. This algorithm is; preferred unless either absolute accuracy is required; [\(\gtrsim\)CCSD(T)] or a -JKFIT auxiliary basis is unavailable; for the orbital basis/atoms involved. CDA threaded algorithm using approximate ERIs obtained by Cholesky; decomposition of the ERI tensor. The accuracy of the Cholesky; decomposition is controlled by the keyword CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE.; This algorithm is similar to the DF algorithm, but it is not suitable; for gradient computations. The algorithm to obtain the Cholesky; vectors is not designed for computations with thousands of basis; functions. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used.

Pulay’s DIIS procedure is then used to accelerate; SCF convergence, with the DF phase reaching convergence in eight true; iterations. When used together, SAD and DIIS are usually sufficient to converge; the SCF for all but the most difficult systems. Additional convergence; techniques are available for more difficult cases, and are detailed below. At; this point, the code switches on the requested Direct integrals technology, which; requires only four full iterations to reach convergence, starting from the DF; guess. This hybrid DF/Direct procedure can significantly accelerate SCF; computations requiring exact integrals.; After the iterations are completed, a number of one-electron properties are; printed, and some bookkeeping is performed to set up possible correlated; computations.

The first set of iterations are from the DF portion of the computation, the; second set uses the exact (but much slower) Direct algorithm. Within the DF portion; of the computation, the zeroth-iteration uses a non-idempotent density matrix; obtained from the SAD guess, so the energy is unphysically low. However, the; first true iteration is quite close to the final DF energy, highlighting the; efficiency of the SAD guess. Pulay’s DIIS procedure is then used to accelerate; SCF convergence, with the DF phase reaching convergence in eight true; iterations. When used together, SAD and DIIS are usually sufficient to converge; the SCF for all but the most difficult systems. Additional convergence; techniques are available for more difficult cases, and are detailed below. At; this point, the code switches on the requested Direct integrals technology, which; requires only four full iterations to reach convergence, starting from the DF; guess.

Second-order Convergence¶; Second-order convergence takes into account both the gradient and Hessian to; take a full Newton step with respect to the orbital parameters. This results in; quadratic convergence with respect to density for SCF methods. For cases where; normal acceleration methods either fail or take many iterations to converge,; second-order can reduce the total time to solution.; Solving second-order (SO) methods exactly would require an inversion of the; orbital Hessian (an expensive \(\mathbb{N}^6\) operation); however, these; equations are normally solved iteratively where each iteration costs the same; as a normal Fock build (\(\mathbb{N}^4\)). The overall SOSCF operation is; thus broken down into micro- and macroiterations where the microiterations; refer to solving the SOSCF equations and macroiterations are the construction; of a new Fock matrix based on the orbitals from a SOSCF step.; SOSCF requires that all elements of the gradient to be less than one before the; method is valid. To this end, pre-SOSCF SCF iterations use normal; gradient-based extrapolation procedures (e.g., DIIS) until the gradient; conditions are met.

Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; PRINT option. Also printed are the occupied and virtual orbital energies,; which are useful in elucidating the stability and reactivity of the system. Theory¶; The objective of Hartree–Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) \(\{\psi_i\}\),. \[\psi_i(\vec x_1) = C_{\mu i} \phi_{\mu} (\vec x_1).\]; Here, \(\{\phi_{\mu}\}\) are the basis functions, which, in PSI4 are; contracted Cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs). The matrix \(C_{\mu i}\) contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree–Fock. The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. \[\begin{split}| \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |\end{split}\]; This form for the Hartree–Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; \(\mathbb{R}^6\) instead of a more complicated effect in; \(\mathbb{R}^N\).; Considering the electronic Hamiltonian,. \[\hat H = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html

Because of this, SCF is a nonlinear procedure, which; terminates when the generating orbitals are self-consistent with the Fock matrix; they generate.; The formation of the Coulomb matrix \(J\) and the exchange matrix; \(K^{\alpha}\) dominate the computational effort of the SCF procedure. For; very large systems, diagonalization of the Fock matrix can also present a; significant hurdle.

As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504].

The guess and its implementation have; been described in [Lehtola:2019:1593]. The guess is evaluated on a; DFT quadrature grid, so the guess energy depends slightly on the; used DFT quadrature. The current implementation is based on; exchange-only local density calculations that are but nanohartree; away from the complete basis set limit [Lehtola:2020:012516].

In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword “DF”; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; PSI4‘s internal routines.

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used.; This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation.

Convergence Stabilization¶; With regard to convergence stabilization, Pulay’s Direct Inversion of the; Iterative Subspace (DIIS) extrapolation, Gill’s Maximum Overlap Method (MOM),; and damping are all implemented. A summary of each is presented below,. DIIS [On by Default]DIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock Matrix together; with an error criterion based on the orbital gradient to produce an informed; estimate of the next Fock Matrix. DIIS is almost always necessary to converge; the SCF procedure and is therefore turned on by default. In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via options. MOM [Off by Default]MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations. Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is typically visible in the output as a non-converging; SCF which eventually settles down to steady oscillation between two (or more); different total energies. This behavior can be ameliorated by choosing occupied; orbitals by “shape” instead of by orbital eigenvalue, i.e., by choosing the set; of new orbitals which looks most like some previously known “good” set. The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations \(N,N+2,\ldots\), invoking; MOM_START N can often rescue the convergence of",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html

Reasonable values for; the shift and convergence threshold are 5.0 and 1e-2,; respectively. SOSCF [Off by Default]See Second-order Convergence. ERI Algorithms¶; The key difficulty in the SCF procedure is treatment of the four-index ERI; contributions to the Fock Matrix. A number of algorithms are available in; PSI4 for these terms. The algorithm is selected by the SCF_TYPE; keyword, which may be one of the following. PK [Default]An out-of-core, presorted algorithm using exact ERIs. Quite fast for a; zero-error algorithm if enough memory is available. Integrals are; generated only once, and symmetry is utilized to reduce number of; integrals. OUT_OF_COREAn out-of-core, unsorted algorithm using exact ERIs. Overcomes the; memory bottleneck of the current PK algorithm.

If one or more constraints have to be relaxed to reach; a lower-energy solution, there is an external instability. In PSI4, the only external instability; that can be checked at present is the RHF \(\rightarrow\) UHF one.; Currently, two algorithms exist in PSI4 for stability analysis: the original; Direct Inversion and the newly implemented Davidson algorithms. We will first describe; options common to both algorithms. To request a stability analysis at the end of the SCF,; set the keyword STABILITY_ANALYSIS. Value CHECK only computes the electronic; Hessian eigenvalue and checks if an actual SCF minimum has been found, while value FOLLOW; rotates the converged orbitals along the lowest eigenvector, then invokes the SCF; procedure again to lower the energy.

Restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) [Default]Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical. Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF)Appropriate for most open-shell systems and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the \(\hat S^2\) operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to a; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem. Restricted Open-Shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF)Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical). Constrained Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (CUHF)A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used.; This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:04224].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; option",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html

If the smallest; eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical orthogonalization is; forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues below the; cutoff are eliminated.; If the eigendecomposition is detected to be numerically unstable - the; reciprocal condition number of the overlap matrix to be smaller than; the machine epsilon - the partial Cholesky decomposition is undertaken; until S_CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE, which defaults to 1E-8.; Use of symmetric, canonical, and partial Cholesky orthogonalization; can be forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to; SYMMETRIC, CANONICAL, or PARTIALCHOLESKY,; respectively.; Note that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within; each irrep from the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as; Unique Symmetry Orbitals (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization,; this implies that the number of MOs and OSOs per irrep may be slightly; smaller than the number of USOs per irrep.; A contrived example demonstrating OSOs/MOs vs. AOs with symmetry is shown; below:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c2 # Two irreps is easier to comprehend; }. set {; s_tolerance 0.0001 # Set an unreasonably tight; # tolerance to force canonical; basis aug-cc-pv5z # This diffuse basis will have; # small-ish eigenvalues for even H2O",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html

The default guess for auxiliary basis set should work; for most bases, otherwise the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword can; be used to manually specify the auxiliary basis. This algorithm is; preferred unless either absolute accuracy is required; [\(\gtrsim\)CCSD(T)] or a -JKFIT auxiliary basis is unavailable; for the orbital basis/atoms involved. CDA threaded algorithm using approximate ERIs obtained by Cholesky; decomposition of the ERI tensor. The accuracy of the Cholesky; decomposition is controlled by the keyword CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE.; This algorithm is similar to the DF algorithm, but it is not suitable; for gradient computations. The algorithm to obtain the Cholesky; vectors is not designed for computations with thousands of basis; functions. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword “DF”; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; PSI4‘s internal routines. Expert users can manually switch between MEM_DF and; DISK_DF; however, they may find documented exceptions during use as several; post SCF algorithms require a spec",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html

To turn on this option, set INCFOCK to true.; We have added the automatic capability to use the extremely fast DF; code for intermediate convergence of the orbitals, for SCF_TYPE; DIRECT. At the moment, the code defaults to cc-pVDZ-JKFIT as the; auxiliary basis, unless the user specifies DF_BASIS_SCF manually. For; some atoms, cc-pVDZ-JKFIT is not defined, so a very large fitting basis of last; resort will be used.; To avoid this, either set DF_BASIS_SCF to an auxiliary; basis set defined for all atoms in the system, or set DF_SCF_GUESS; to false, which disables this acceleration entirely. Second-order Convergence¶; Second-order convergence takes into account both the gradient and Hessian to; take a full Newton step with respect to the orbital parameters. This results in; quadratic convergence with respect to density for SCF methods. For cases where; normal acceleration methods either fail or take many iterations to converge,; second-order can reduce the total time to solution.; Solving second-order (SO) methods exactly would require an inversion of the; orbital Hessian (an expensive \(\mathbb{N}^6\) operation); however, these; equations are normally solved iteratively where each iteration costs the same; as a normal Fock build (\(\mathbb{N}^4\)). The overall SOSCF operation is; thus broken down into micro- and macroiterations where the microiterations; refer to solving the SOSCF equations and macroiterations are the construction; of a new Fock matrix based on the orbitals from a SO",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf-1.html

The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess, and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS;; the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS. Note; Setting the option STABILITY_ANALYSIS to FOLLOW is only avalible for UHF. When using; RHF and ROHF instabilities can be checked, but not followed. If you want to attempt to find a lower energy solution; you should re-run the calculation with REFERENCE set to UHF. The main algorithm available in PSI4 is the Direct Inversion algorithm. It can only; work with SCF_TYPE PK, and it explicitly builds the full electronic Hessian; matrix before explicitly inverting it. As such, this algorithm is very slow and it should; be avoided whenever possible. Direct Inversion is automatically invoked if the newer algorithm; is not available.; The Davidson algorithm for stability analysis was implemented recently.; Only the lowest eigenvalues of the electronic Hessian are computed, and Hessian-vector; products are computed instead of the full Hessian. This algorithm is thus; much more efficient than the Direct Inversion, but at present, it is only available for UHF \(\rightarrow\) UHF stability; analysis. The capabilities of both algorithms are summarized below:. Stability analysis methods available in PSI4¶. Algorithm; REFERENCE; Stability checked; STABILITY_ANALYSIS; SCF_TYPE.

Default within this context: 3; SOLVER_MIN_SUBSPACE: Minimum size of the subspace when collapsing.; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE: Maximum size of the subspace. Default within this context: 12. In case convergence problems are encountered during the Davidson procedure,; it is recommended to first increase SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE, especially if you solve; for a large number of roots. This will result in a higher computational cost of each iteration, but should; make the solver better behaved. However, note that SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE should never be larger than; the full subspace minus the number of desired roots to avoid adding artificial zero eigenvalues.; This may happen in minimal basis sets, especially with symmetry, but the code automatically adjusts; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE if it is too large.; If the solver seems to converge on the wrong eigenvalue, try increasing SOLVER_N_GUESS.; Otherwise, if the solver is almost converged but reaches the maximum number of iterations, try increasing; SOLVER_MAXITER.

External potentials and QM/MM¶; In addition to the implementation of EFP for accurate QM/MM; computations, PSI4 can perform more rudimentary QM/MM procedures via the; EXTERN keyword. The following snippet, extracted from the; extern1 test case, demonstrates its use for a TIP3P external potential:; Chrgfield = QMMM(); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge(-0.834, 1.649232019048, 0.0, -2.356023604706); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge( 0.417, 0.544757019107, 0.0, -3.799961446760); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge( 0.417, 0.544757019107, 0.0, -0.912085762652); psi4.set_global_option_python('EXTERN', Chrgfield.extern). First a QMMM object is created, then three separate particles are added to this; object before the SCF code is told about its existence on the last line. The; calls to addCharge take the atomic charge, x coordinate, y coordinate, and; z coordinate in that order. The atomic charge is specified in atomic units,; and the coordinates always use the same units as the geometry specification in; the regular QM region. Additional MM molecules may be specified by adding; extra calls to addCharge to describe the full MM region.; To run a computation in a constant dipole field, the PERTURB_H,; PERTURB_WITH and PERTURB_DIPOLE keywords can be used.

Theory¶; The objective of Hartree–Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) \(\{\psi_i\}\),. \[\psi_i(\vec x_1) = C_{\mu i} \phi_{\mu} (\vec x_1).\]; Here, \(\{\phi_{\mu}\}\) are the basis functions, which, in PSI4 are; contracted Cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs).

This will result in a higher computational cost of each iteration, but should; make the solver better behaved. However, note that SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE should never be larger than; the full subspace minus the number of desired roots to avoid adding artificial zero eigenvalues.; This may happen in minimal basis sets, especially with symmetry, but the code automatically adjusts; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE if it is too large.; If the solver seems to converge on the wrong eigenvalue, try increasing SOLVER_N_GUESS.; Otherwise, if the solver is almost converged but reaches the maximum number of iterations, try increasing; SOLVER_MAXITER. Effective core potentials (ECPs)¶; PSI4 supports the use of effective core potentials to describe the; innermost electrons in heavy elements. If a basis set is designed to use an; effective core potential, the ECP definition should be simply placed alongside; the orbital basis set definition, c.f. Inputting effective core potentials (ECPs). All; information related to the definition and number of core electrons will; automatically be detected and no further input is required to use the; ECP-containing basis set. See scf-ecp and dfmp2-ecp; for examples of computations with ECP-containing basis sets. Warning; Analytic derivatives of ECPs are not yet available.

Recommendations¶; The SCF code is quite flexible and powerful.; We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your orbital basis/atom type. Then use; DIRECT.; Don’t mess with the DIIS convergence options unless convergence is a problem.; We have optimized the parameters for efficiency over a wide array of system; types.; Buy a developer a beer!.

The first set of iterations are from the DF portion of the computation, the; second set uses the exact (but much slower) Direct algorithm. Within the DF portion; of the computation, the zeroth-iteration uses a non-idempotent density matrix; obtained from the SAD guess, so the energy is unphysically low.

Initial Guess¶; In each step of the SCF procedure, a new Fock or Kohn–Sham potential is built; according to the previous density, following which the potential is diagonalized; to produce new molecular orbitals, from which a new density is computed. This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified E_CONVERGENCE and D_CONVERGENCE, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the MAXITER option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. COREDiagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion. Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems.

The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations \(N,N+2,\ldots\), invoking; MOM_START N can often rescue the convergence of the SCF. MOM can; be used in concert with DIIS, though care should be taken to not turn MOM on; until the oscillatory behavior begins. Damping [Off by Default]In some cases, a static mixing of Fock Matrices from adjacent; iterations can quench oscillations. This mixing, known as; “damping” can be activated by setting the; DAMPING_PERCENTAGE keyword to a nonzero percent. Damping is; turned off when the DIIS error is smaller than; DAMPING_CONVERGENCE. Level shifting [Off by default]A commonly used alternative to damping is to use level shifting,; which decreases the mixing of occupied and unoccupied orbitals in; the SCF update by moving the unoccupied orbitals up in energy. It; can be shown that the SCF procedure always converges with a; suitably large level shift; however, the larger the shift is, the; slower the convergence becomes, and the calculation may end up; converging onto a higher lying SCF solution. Because of this, in; practice level shifting is most useful in the initial phase of the; calculation to reduce the orbital error enough for DIIS to work; well. The level shift is controlled by the parameter; LEVEL_SHIFT, and it is turned off when the DIIS error is; smaller than LEVEL_SHIFT_CUTOFF. Reasonable values for; the shift and convergence threshold are 5.0 and 1e-2,; respectively. SOSCF [Off by Default]See Second-order Convergence.

Note that this algorithm; should use the -JKFIT series of auxiliary bases, not the -RI or; -MP2FIT bases. The default guess for auxiliary basis set should work; for most bases, otherwise the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword can; be used to manually specify the auxiliary basis. This algorithm is; preferred unless either absolute accuracy is required; [\(\gtrsim\)CCSD(T)] or a -JKFIT auxiliary basis is unavailable; for the orbital basis/atoms involved. CDA threaded algorithm using approximate ERIs obtained by Cholesky; decomposition of the ERI tensor. The accuracy of the Cholesky; decomposition is controlled by the keyword CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE.; This algorithm is similar to the DF algorithm, but it is not suitable; for gradient computations. The algorithm to obtain the Cholesky; vectors is not designed for computations with thousands of basis; functions. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword “DF”; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; PSI4‘s internal routines.

Pulay’s DIIS procedure is then used to accelerate; SCF convergence, with the DF phase reaching convergence in eight true; iterations. When used together, SAD and DIIS are usually sufficient to converge; the SCF for all but the most difficult systems. Additional convergence; techniques are available for more difficult cases, and are detailed below. At; this point, the code switches on the requested Direct integrals technology, which; requires only four full iterations to reach convergence, starting from the DF; guess.

The first set of iterations are from the DF portion of the computation, the; second set uses the exact (but much slower) Direct algorithm. Within the DF portion; of the computation, the zeroth-iteration uses a non-idempotent density matrix; obtained from the SAD guess, so the energy is unphysically low. However, the; first true iteration is quite close to the final DF energy, highlighting the; efficiency of the SAD guess.

Second-order Convergence¶; Second-order convergence takes into account both the gradient and Hessian to; take a full Newton step with respect to the orbital parameters. This results in; quadratic convergence with respect to density for SCF methods. For cases where; normal acceleration methods either fail or take many iterations to converge,; second-order can reduce the total time to solution.; Solving second-order (SO) methods exactly would require an inversion of the; orbital Hessian (an expensive \(\mathbb{N}^6\) operation); however, these; equations are normally solved iteratively where each iteration costs the same; as a normal Fock build (\(\mathbb{N}^4\)). The overall SOSCF operation is; thus broken down into micro- and macroiterations where the microiterations; refer to solving the SOSCF equations and macroiterations are the construction; of a new Fock matrix based on the orbitals from a SOSCF step.; SOSCF requires that all elements of the gradient to be less than one before the; method is valid. To this end, pre-SOSCF SCF iterations use normal; gradient-based extrapolation procedures (e.g., DIIS) until the gradient; conditions are met. Note that while the total number of macroiterations will be; less for SOSCF than gradient-based convergence acceleration, the cost of solving; the microiteratio",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html

External potentials and QM/MM¶; In addition to the implementation of EFP for accurate QM/MM; computations, PSI4 can perform more rudimentary QM/MM procedures via the; EXTERN keyword. The following snippet, extracted from the; extern1 test case, demonstrates its use for a TIP3P external potential:; Chrgfield = QMMM(); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge(-0.834, 1.649232019048, 0.0, -2.356023604706); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge( 0.417, 0.544757019107, 0.0, -3.799961446760); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge( 0.417, 0.544757019107, 0.0, -0.912085762652); psi4.set_global_option_python('EXTERN', Chrgfield.extern). First a QMMM object is created, then three separate particles are added to this; object before the SCF code is told about its existence on the last line. The; calls to addCharge take the atomic charge, x coordinate, y coordinate, and; z coordinate in that order. The atomic charge is specified in atomic units,; and the coordinates always use the same units as the geometry specification in; the regular QM region. Additional MM molecules may be specified by adding; extra calls to addCharge to describe the full MM region.; To run a computation in a constant dipole field, the PERTURB_H,; PERTURB_WITH and PERTURB_DIPOLE keywords can be used. As an; example, to add a dipole field of magnitude 0.05 a.u. in the y direction and; 0.1 a.u. in the z direction, we can use the following keywords:; set perturb_h true; set perturb_with dipole; set perturb_dipole [ 0, 0.05, 0.1 ]. Note that if any specified fields do not fall along a symmetry axis, the; symmetry of the calculation should be reduced accordingly; if in doubt run the; calculation in C1 symmetry.

External potentials and QM/MM¶; In addition to the implementation of EFP for accurate QM/MM; computations, PSI4 can perform more rudimentary QM/MM procedures via the; EXTERN keyword. The following snippet, extracted from the; extern1 test case, demonstrates its use for a TIP3P external potential:; Chrgfield = QMMM(); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge(-0.834, 1.649232019048, 0.0, -2.356023604706); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge( 0.417, 0.544757019107, 0.0, -3.799961446760); Chrgfield.extern.addCharge( 0.417, 0.544757019107, 0.0, -0.912085762652); psi4.set_global_option_python('EXTERN', Chrgfield.extern). First a QMMM object is created, then three separate particles are added to this; object before the SCF code is told about its existence on the last line. The; calls to addCharge take the atomic charge, x coordinate, y coordinate, and; z coordinate in that order. The atomic charge is specified in atomic units,; and the coordinates always use the same units as the geometry specification in; the regular QM region. Additional MM molecules may be specified by adding; extra calls to addCharge to describe the full MM region.; To run a computation in a constant dipole field, the PERTURB_H,; PERTURB_WITH and PERTURB_DIPOLE keywords can be used. As an; example, to add a dipole field of magnitude 0.05 a.u. in the y direction and; 0.1 a.u. in the z direction, we can use the following keywords:; set perturb_h true; set perturb_with dipole; set perturb_dipole [ 0, 0.05, 0.1 ]. Note that if any specified fields do not fall along a symmetry axis, the; symmetry of the calculation should be reduced accordingly; if in doubt run the; calculation in C1 symmetry.

At; this point, the code switches on the requested Direct integrals technology, which; requires only four full iterations to reach convergence, starting from the DF; guess. This hybrid DF/Direct procedure can significantly accelerate SCF; computations requiring exact integrals.; After the iterations are completed, a number of one-electron properties are; printed, and some bookkeeping is performed to set up possible correlated; computations. Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; PRINT option. Also printed are the occupied and virtual orbital energies,; which are useful in elucidating the stability and reactivity of the system. Theory¶; The objective of Hartree–Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) \(\{\psi_i\}\),. \[\psi_i(\vec x_1) = C_{\mu i} \phi_{\mu} (\vec x_1).\]; Here, \(\{\phi_{\mu}\}\) are the basis functions, which, in PSI4 are; contracted Cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs). The matrix \(C_{\mu i}\) contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree–Fock. The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. \[\begin{split}| \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |\end{split}\]; This form for the Hartree–Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; \(\mathbb{R}^6\) instead of a more complicated effect in; \(\mathbb{R}^N\).; Considering the electronic Hamiltonian,. \[\hat H = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html

Because of this, SCF is a nonlinear procedure, which; terminates when the generating orbitals are self-consistent with the Fock matrix; they generate.; The formation of the Coulomb matrix \(J\) and the exchange matrix; \(K^{\alpha}\) dominate the computational effort of the SCF procedure. For; very large systems, diagonalization of the Fock matrix can also present a; significant hurdle.

As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504].

The; screening effects have been calculated at the complete basis set; limit with finite-element calculations, see [Lehtola:2019:25945]; and [Lehtola:2020:012516]. The guess and its implementation have; been described in [Lehtola:2019:1593]. The guess is evaluated on a; DFT quadrature grid, so the guess energy depends slightly on the; used DFT quadrature. The current implementation is based on; exchange-only local density calculations that are but nanohartree; away from the complete basis set limit [Lehtola:2020:012516]. These are all set by the GUESS keyword. Also, an automatic Python; procedure has been developed for converging the SCF in a small basis, and then; casting up to the true basis.

In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword “DF”; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; PSI4‘s internal routines. Expert users can manually switch between MEM_DF and; DISK_DF; however, they may find documented exceptions during use as several; post SCF algorithms require a specific implementation.; For some of these algorithms, Schwarz and/or density sieving can be used to; identify negligible integral contributions in extended systems. To activate; sieving, set the INTS_TOLERANCE keyword to your desired cutoff; (1.0E-12 is recommended for most applications). To choose the type of sieving, set; the SCREENING keyword to your desired option. For Schwarz screening, set it; to SCHWARZ, for CSAM, CSAM, and for density matrix-based screening, DENSITY.

The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used.; This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:04224].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; option",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html

Restarting the SCF¶; Reading orbital data from a previous calculations is done via the restart_file option,; where the actual file is a serialized wfn object (see saving the wfn); By default, the orbital data file of the converged SCF(psi.PID.name.180.npy) is deleted; after PSI4 exits or the clean() function is called.

Convergence Stabilization¶; With regard to convergence stabilization, Pulay’s Direct Inversion of the; Iterative Subspace (DIIS) extrapolation, Gill’s Maximum Overlap Method (MOM),; and damping are all implemented. A summary of each is presented below,. DIIS [On by Default]DIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock Matrix together; with an error criterion based on the orbital gradient to produce an informed; estimate of the next Fock Matrix. DIIS is almost always necessary to converge; the SCF procedure and is therefore turned on by default. In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via options. MOM [Off by Default]MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations. Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is typically visible in the output as a non-converging; SCF which eventually settles down to steady oscillation between two (or more); different total energies. This behavior can be ameliorated by choosing occupied; orbitals by “shape” instead of by orbital eigenvalue, i.e., by choosing the set; of new orbitals which looks most like some previously known “good” set. The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations \(N,N+2,\ldots\), invoking; MOM_START N can often rescue the convergence of",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html

The level shift is controlled by the parameter; LEVEL_SHIFT, and it is turned off when the DIIS error is; smaller than LEVEL_SHIFT_CUTOFF. Reasonable values for; the shift and convergence threshold are 5.0 and 1e-2,; respectively. SOSCF [Off by Default]See Second-order Convergence. ERI Algorithms¶; The key difficulty in the SCF procedure is treatment of the four-index ERI; contributions to the Fock Matrix. A number of algorithms are available in; PSI4 for these terms. The algorithm is selected by the SCF_TYPE; keyword, which may be one of the following. PK [Default]An out-of-core, presorted algorithm using exact ERIs. Quite fast for a; zero-error algorithm if enough memory is available. Integrals are; generated only once, and symmetry is utilized to reduce number of; integrals. OUT_OF_COREAn out-of-core, unsorted algorithm using exact ERIs. Overcomes the; memory bottleneck of the current PK algorithm. Integrals are generated; only once, and symmetry is utilized to reduce number of integrals. DIRECTA threaded, sieved, integral-direct algorithm, with full permutational; symmetry. This algorithm is brand new, but seems to be reasonably fast; up to 1500 basis functions, uses zero disk (if DF pre-iterations are; turned off), and can obtain significant; speedups with negligible error loss if INTS_TOLERANCE; is set to 1.0E-8 or so. DF [Default]A density-fitted algorithm designed for computations with thousands of; basis functions. This algorithm is highly optimized, and is threaded; with a mixture of parallel BLAS and OpenMP. Note that this algorithm; should use the -JKFIT series of auxiliary bases, not the -RI or; -MP2FIT bases.

If one or more constraints have to be relaxed to reach; a lower-energy solution, there is an external instability. In PSI4, the only external instability; that can be checked at present is the RHF \(\rightarrow\) UHF one.; Currently, two algorithms exist in PSI4 for stability analysis: the original; Direct Inversion and the newly implemented Davidson algorithms. We will first describe; options common to both algorithms. To request a stability analysis at the end of the SCF,; set the keyword STABILITY_ANALYSIS. Value CHECK only computes the electronic; Hessian eigenvalue and checks if an actual SCF minimum has been found, while value FOLLOW; rotates the converged orbitals along the lowest eigenvector, then invokes the SCF; procedure again to lower the energy. In case the minimization does not succeed; or ends up on the same unstable solution, you can tune the scale factor for the orbital; rotation through the keyword FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE.; The rotation angle is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\mbox{ } \cdot\) (FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE). The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess, and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS;; the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS.

Restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) [Default]Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical. Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF)Appropriate for most open-shell systems and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the \(\hat S^2\) operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to a; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem. Restricted Open-Shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF)Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical). Constrained Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (CUHF)A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2). Abelian spatial symmetry is fully supported in PSI4 and can be used to; obtain physical interpretation of the molecular orbitals, to assist in difficult; convergence cases, and, in some methods, to obtain",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In PSI4, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization.; Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used.; This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs.; When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102] and [Lehtola:2020:032504]. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:04224].; In PSI4, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; option",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html

If the smallest; eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical orthogonalization is; forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues below the; cutoff are eliminated.; If the eigendecomposition is detected to be numerically unstable - the; reciprocal condition number of the overlap matrix to be smaller than; the machine epsilon - the partial Cholesky decomposition is undertaken; until S_CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE, which defaults to 1E-8.; Use of symmetric, canonical, and partial Cholesky orthogonalization; can be forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to; SYMMETRIC, CANONICAL, or PARTIALCHOLESKY,; respectively.; Note that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within; each irrep from the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as; Unique Symmetry Orbitals (USOs).

The default guess for auxiliary basis set should work; for most bases, otherwise the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword can; be used to manually specify the auxiliary basis. This algorithm is; preferred unless either absolute accuracy is required; [\(\gtrsim\)CCSD(T)] or a -JKFIT auxiliary basis is unavailable; for the orbital basis/atoms involved. CDA threaded algorithm using approximate ERIs obtained by Cholesky; decomposition of the ERI tensor. The accuracy of the Cholesky; decomposition is controlled by the keyword CHOLESKY_TOLERANCE.; This algorithm is similar to the DF algorithm, but it is not suitable; for gradient computations. The algorithm to obtain the Cholesky; vectors is not designed for computations with thousands of basis; functions. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DFA DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used. DISK_DFA DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword “DF”; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; PSI4‘s internal routines. Expert users can manually switch between MEM_DF and; DISK_DF; however, they may find documented exceptions during use as several; post SCF algorithms require a spec",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html

To turn on this option, set INCFOCK to true.; We have added the automatic capability to use the extremely fast DF; code for intermediate convergence of the orbitals, for SCF_TYPE; DIRECT. At the moment, the code defaults to cc-pVDZ-JKFIT as the; auxiliary basis, unless the user specifies DF_BASIS_SCF manually. For; some atoms, cc-pVDZ-JKFIT is not defined, so a very large fitting basis of last; resort will be used.; To avoid this, either set DF_BASIS_SCF to an auxiliary; basis set defined for all atoms in the system, or set DF_SCF_GUESS; to false, which disables this acceleration entirely. Second-order Convergence¶; Second-order convergence takes into account both the gradient and Hessian to; take a full Newton step with respect to the orbital parameters. This results in; quadratic convergence with respect to density for SCF methods. For cases where; normal acceleration methods either fail or take many iterations to converge,; second-order can reduce the total time to solution.; Solving second-order (SO) methods exactly would require an inversion of the; orbital Hessian (an expensive \(\mathbb{N}^6\) operation); however, these; equations are normally solved iteratively where each iteration costs the same; as a normal Fock build (\(\mathbb{N}^4\)). The overall SOSCF operation is; thus broken down into micro- and macroiterations where the microiterations; refer to solving the SOSCF equations and macroiterations are the construction; of a new Fock matrix based on the orbitals from a SO",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html

The default value of; 0.5 usually provides a good guess, and modification is only recommended in difficult cases.; The default behavior for the stability code is to stop after trying to reoptimize the orbitals once; if the instability still exists. For more attempts, set MAX_ATTEMPTS;; the default value of 1 is recommended. In case the SCF ends up in the same minimum, modification; of FOLLOW_STEP_SCALE is recommended over increasing MAX_ATTEMPTS. Note; Setting the option STABILITY_ANALYSIS to FOLLOW is only avalible for UHF. When using; RHF and ROHF instabilities can be checked, but not followed. If you want to attempt to find a lower energy solution; you should re-run the calculation with REFERENCE set to UHF. The main algorithm available in PSI4 is the Direct Inversion algorithm. It can only; work with SCF_TYPE PK, and it explicitly builds the full electronic Hessian; matrix before explicitly inverting it. As such, this algorithm is very slow and it should; be avoided whenever possible. Direct Inversion is automatically invoked if the newer algorithm; is not available.; The Davidson algorithm for stability analysis was implemented recently.; Only the lowest eigenvalues of the electronic Hessian are computed, and Hessian-vector; products are computed instead of the full Hessian. This algorithm is thus; much more efficient than the Direct Inversion, but at present, it is only available for UHF \(\rightarrow\) UHF stability; analysis. The capabilities of both algorithms are summarized below:. Stability analysis methods available in PSI4¶. Algorithm; REFERENCE; Stability checked; STABILITY_ANALYSIS; SCF_TYPE.

In case convergence problems are encountered during the Davidson procedure,; it is recommended to first increase SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE, especially if you solve; for a large number of roots. This will result in a higher computational cost of each iteration, but should; make the solver better behaved. However, note that SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE should never be larger than; the full subspace minus the number of desired roots to avoid adding artificial zero eigenvalues.; This may happen in minimal basis sets, especially with symmetry, but the code automatically adjusts; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE if it is too large.; If the solver seems to converge on the wrong eigenvalue, try increasing SOLVER_N_GUESS.; Otherwise, if the solver is almost converged but reaches the maximum number of iterations, try increasing; SOLVER_MAXITER.

Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; PRINT option. Also printed are the occupied and virtual orbital energies,; which are useful in elucidating the stability and reactivity of the system. Theory¶; The objective of Hartree–Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) \(\{\psi_i\}\),. \[\psi_i(\vec x_1) = C_{\mu i} \phi_{\mu} (\vec x_1).\]; Here, \(\{\phi_{\mu}\}\) are the basis functions, which, in PSI4 are; contracted Cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs). The matrix \(C_{\mu i}\) contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree–Fock. The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. \[\begin{split}| \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |\end{split}\]; This form for the Hartree–Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; \(\mathbb{R}^6\) instead of a more complicated effect in; \(\mathbb{R}^N\).; Considering the electronic Hamiltonian,. \[\hat H = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \sum_{i} \sum_{A} -; \frac{Z_A}{r_{iA}} + \sum_{i>j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}},\]; the Hartree–Fock energy is, by Slater’s rules,. \[E_{\mathrm{HF}} =; \langle \Psi_0 | \hat H | \Psi_0 \rangle; = \sum_{i} \langle i | \hat h | i \rangle; + \frac 1 2 \sum_{i,j} [ii|jj] - [ij",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/scf.html

This will result in a higher computational cost of each iteration, but should; make the solver better behaved. However, note that SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE should never be larger than; the full subspace minus the number of desired roots to avoid adding artificial zero eigenvalues.; This may happen in minimal basis sets, especially with symmetry, but the code automatically adjusts; SOLVER_MAX_SUBSPACE if it is too large.; If the solver seems to converge on the wrong eigenvalue, try increasing SOLVER_N_GUESS.; Otherwise, if the solver is almost converged but reaches the maximum number of iterations, try increasing; SOLVER_MAXITER. Effective core potentials (ECPs)¶; PSI4 supports the use of effective core potentials to describe the; innermost electrons in heavy elements. If a basis set is designed to use an; effective core potential, the ECP definition should be simply placed alongside; the orbital basis set definition, c.f. Inputting effective core potentials (ECPs). All; information related to the definition and number of core electrons will; automatically be detected and no further input is required to use the; ECP-containing basis set. See scf-ecp and dfmp2-ecp; for examples of computations with ECP-containing basis sets. Warning; Analytic derivatives of ECPs are not yet available. The HF and DFT derivatives are implemented in a semi-numerical scheme, where numerical ECP gradients are added to analytic SCF gradients. Analytic gradients for (DF)MP2 are not yet available, but the standard numerical gradients will work correctly. Fully analytic gradients will be implemented soon. Warning; ECPs have not been tested with projected basis set guesses or with FI-SAPT calculations. If you require this functionality, please contact the developers on GitHub and/or the forum.

Recommendations¶; The SCF code is quite flexible and powerful.; We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your orbital basis/atom type. Then use; DIRECT.; Don’t mess with the DIIS convergence options unless convergence is a problem.; We have optimized the parameters for efficiency over a wide array of system; types.; Buy a developer a beer!.

The solvers can be used to extract the first few roots of interest for the full; time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) equations, also known as the random-phase; approximation (RPA), or its Tamm–Dancoff approximation.; The former is a generalized eigenvalue problem and our solver leverages; the Hamiltonian structure of the equations to ensure robust convergence [stratmann:1998].; The latter is a Hermitian eigenvalue problem and we employ a Davidson solver. Known limitations¶. Warning; The implementation cannot currently handle the following cases:; - Excited states of triplet symmetry from a restricted DFT reference.; - Excited states from an unrestricted reference other than HF or LDA. Warning; The length-gauge rotatory strengths PSI4 computes are; currently not gauge-origin invariant. Theory¶; The excitation energies and corresponding states are obtained from the following generalized; eigenvalue problem, also known as the response eigenvalue problem:. \[\begin{split}\begin{pmatrix}; \mathbf{A} & \mathbf{B} \\; \mathbf{B}^{*} & \mathbf{A}^{*}; \end{pmatrix}; \begin{pmatrix}; \mathbf{X}_{n} \\; \mathbf{Y}_{n}; \end{pmatrix}; =; \omega_{n}; \begin{pmatrix}; \mathbf{1} & \mathbf{0} \\; \mathbf{0} & -\mathbf{1}; \end{pmatrix}; \begin{pmatrix}; \mathbf{X}_{n} \\; \mathbf{Y}_{n}; \e",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/tdscf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/tdscf-1.html

Furthermore, the excitation; eigenvectors, \((\mathbf{X}_{n} \mathbf{Y}_{n})^{t}\),; provide information on the nature of the transitions and can be used to form; spectroscopic observables, such as oscillator and rotatory strengths.; The \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) matrices appearing on the left-hand side are; the blocks of the molecular electronic; Hessian, [Norman2018-tn]; whose dimensionality is \((OV)^{2}\), with \(O\) and \(V\) the number of occupied and; virtual molecular orbitals, respectively.; This prevents explicit formation of the full Hessian, and subspace iteration; methods need to be used to extract the first few roots.; In such methods, the eigenvectors are expanded in a subspace of trial vectors,; whose dimensionality is greatly lower than that of the full eigenproblem.; The Hessian is projected down to this subspace where conventional full; diagonalization algorithms can be applied.

The solvers can be used to extract the first few roots of interest for the full; time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) equations, also known as the random-phase; approximation (RPA), or its Tamm–Dancoff approximation.; The former is a generalized eigenvalue problem and our solver leverages; the Hamiltonian structure of the equations to ensure robust convergence [stratmann:1998].; The latter is a Hermitian eigenvalue problem and we employ a Davidson solver. Known limitations¶. Warning; The implementation cannot currently handle the following cases:; - Excited states of triplet symmetry from a restricted DFT reference.; - Excited states from an unrestricted reference other than HF or LDA. Warning; The length-gauge rotatory strengths PSI4 computes are; currently not gauge-origin invariant.

The solvers can be used to extract the first few roots of interest for the full; time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) equations, also known as the random-phase; approximation (RPA), or its Tamm–Dancoff approximation.; The former is a generalized eigenvalue problem and our solver leverages; the Hamiltonian structure of the equations to ensure robust convergence [stratmann:1998].; The latter is a Hermitian eigenvalue problem and we employ a Davidson solver.

First, an initial CISD computation is run to get the natural orbitals; this allows a meaningful partitioning of the virtual orbitals into groups of different importance. Next, the RASCI is run. The split-virtual CISD[TQ] takes all singles and doubles, and all triples and quadruples with no more than 2 electrons in the secondary virtual subspace (RAS 3).

First, an initial CISD computation is run to get the natural orbitals; this allows a meaningful partitioning of the virtual orbitals into groups of different importance. Next, the RASCI is run. The split-virtual CISD[TQ] takes all singles and doubles, and all triples and quadruples with no more than 2 electrons in the secondary virtual subspace (RAS 3).

First, an initial CISD computation is run to get the natural orbitals; this allows a meaningful partitioning of the virtual orbitals into groups of different importance. Next, the RASCI is run. The split-virtual CISD[TQ] takes all singles and doubles, and all triples and quadruples with no more than 2 electrons in the secondary virtual subspace (RAS 3).

Default takes into account symmetry reduction through asymmetric isotopic substitution and is unaffected by user-set symmetry on molecule, so this option is the sole way to influence the symmetry-dependent aspects of the thermodynamic analysis. Note that this factor is handled differently among quantum chemistry software. Type: integer; Default: 1.

If the wavefunction is retained, it may be reused; at a different temperature, pressure, rotational symmetry number, or; isotopic substitution through the function psi4.driver.qcdb.vib.thermo(); as is shown in freq-isotope2.; A few summary psivars are set: “ZPVE”, “THERMAL ENERGY CORRECTION”,; “ENTHALPY CORRECTION”, “GIBBS FREE ENERGY CORRECTION”, “ZERO K; ENTHALPHY”, “THERMAL ENERGY”, “ENTHALPY”, “GIBBS FREE ENERGY”.; But additionally, every valid combination of {S, Cv, Cp, ZPE, E, H, G}; with {elec, trans, rot, vib, corr, tot} (e.g., vibrational entropy,; S_vib, and enthalpy correction, H_corr) is returned by dictionary; from the thermo function.

Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #! Optimize H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'). This should perform a series of gradient computations. The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation and grep-able with ~), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; Step Total Energy Delta E MAX Force RMS Force MAX Disp RMS Disp ~; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; 1 -76.026632734857 -76.026632734857 0.01523505 0.01245744 0.02742199 0.02277500 ~; 2 -76.027022668419 -0.000389933562 0.00178749 0.00142923 0.01007985 0.00594840 ~; 3 -76.027032729361 -0.000010060942 0.00014016 0.00008485 0.00077279 0",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/tutorial-1.html

However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True, dertype=1). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements. From this, it can obtain the harmonic vibrational; frequencies, given below (roundoff errors of around 0.1 cm-1; may exist):; Irrep Harmonic Frequency; (cm-1); -----------------------------------------------; A1 1775.6480; A1 4113.3794; B2 4212.1826; -----------------------------------------------.

Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ. Because we have a few more options now, it’s; convenient to place them together into the set; block, bounded by {...}. This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse \(d\) functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10].

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want.

This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals.

Note; Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with PSI4. In; Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language; (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then; submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into; pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure; Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind; the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

For; open-shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree–Fock, or UHF), or restricted orbitals (restricted; open-shell Hartree–Fock, or ROHF).

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics; analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation.; You can see this in the next section of the output file. The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider.

This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse \(d\) functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10].

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it’s important to keep in mind that; the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular; geometry. Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies; at the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We could set up a second input file to perform; the vibrational frequency analysis, being very careful to copy over the; optimized geometry from the bottom of the output file for the geometry; optimization. This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #!

The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements.

Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want.

Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name.

A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory.

If everything goes well, the computation should complete and should report; a final restricted Hartree–Fock energy in a section like this:; Energy converged. @RHF Final Energy: -76.02663273410671. By default, the energy should be converged to about \(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\), so agreement; is only expected for about the first 6 digits after the decimal. If the; computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the; compilation or installation of the program (see the installation; instructions in Sec. Compiling and Installing from Source).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3).

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations.

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt).; #!

The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation and grep-able with ~), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; Step Total Energy Delta E MAX Force RMS Force MAX Disp RMS Disp ~; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; 1 -76.026632734857 -76.026632734857 0.01523505 0.01245744 0.02742199 0.02277500 ~; 2 -76.027022668419 -0.000389933562 0.00178749 0.00142923 0.01007985 0.00594840 ~; 3 -76.027032729361 -0.000010060942 0.00014016 0.00008485 0.00077279 0",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/tutorial.html

However, there’s a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over.; So, it’s easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; tu4-h2o-freq):; #! Optimization followed by frequencies H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'); scf_e, scf_wfn = frequencies('scf', return_wfn=True, dertype=1). The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements.

Note; Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with PSI4. In; Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language; (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then; submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into; pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure; Python script with import psi4 at the top and commands are behind; the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the Psithon; mode. Note; Some PSI4 functions and keywords have aliases. For example,; frequency(), frequencies(), and freq() all work to; obtain vibrational frequencies. Basic Input File Structure¶; PSI4 reads input from a text file, which can be prepared in any standard; text editor. The default input file name is input.dat and the; default output file name is output.dat. So that you can give your; files meaningful names, these defaults can be changed by specifying; the input file name and output file name on the the command line.; The syntax is:; >>> psi4 input-name output-name. If you give an input name but no output name, then the output name will; be the same as the input name (replacing any “.in” or “.dat” extension by “.out”). Sample Input Files¶; Below, we will provide a few simple input files as examples. A large; number of sample input files, covering everything from single-point energies; using density-functional theory to response properties from coupled-cluster; theory, can be found in the psi4/samples directory.

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations.

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge. At; the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the; perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.; Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical; understanding about the interaction between the two monomers. Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy with Psithon¶; Finally, let’s consider an example that shows how the Python driver; in PSI4 simplifies some routine tasks. PSI4 can interpret; valid Python code in addition to the computational chemistry directives; we’ve seen in the previous examples; we call this mixture Psithon.; The Python computer language is very easy to pick up, and even users; previously unfamiliar with Python can use it to simplify tasks by; modifying some of the example input files supplied with PSI4; in the psi4/samples directory.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as; computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various; interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; L",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/tutorial.html

Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below. In this example we will also specify the bond length; and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are given; at the end of the Z-matrix specification.; #!

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics; analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation.; You can see this in the next section of the output file. The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (*i.e.*, ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. }.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

If everything goes well, the computation should complete and should report; a final restricted Hartree–Fock energy in a section like this:; Energy converged. @RHF Final Energy: -76.02663273410671. By default, the energy should be converged to about \(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\), so agreement; is only expected for about the first 6 digits after the decimal. If the; computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the; compilation or installation of the program (see the installation; instructions in Sec. Compiling and Installing from Source).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S+1 = 3\)).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3).

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function).

In order to tackle; the oxygen 1s edge, i.e simulate a O 1s XAS spectrum, one may; just set NUM_CORE_ORBITALS to 1. This will select the; oxygen 1s orbital for the core space as it is energetically the lowest.; For C 1s core excitations the NUM_CORE_ORBITALS value needs; to be set to 5, such that both the O 1s and all four C 1s orbitals; are part of the core space.; Other keywords and examples.; Apart from the mentioned keywords, the following are common:.

Interface to adcc¶; Code author: Michael F. Herbst; Section author: Michael F. Herbst; For most implemented ADC methods PSI4 relies; on an interface to the adcc python package.; The approach of adcc is to directly diagonalise the; ADC matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) in an iterative diagonalisation; procedure, usually a Jacobi-preconditioned Davidson. Expensive parts; of the ADC matrix-vector product are precomputed and stored; in memory. This approach is general in the sense; that it can be applied to a large range of ADC methods and variants.; So far levels up to ADC(3) and CVS-ADC(3) are available; and additional approximations such as; FREEZE_CORE and NUM_FROZEN_UOCC; are supported with all ADC methods using the adcc backend.; Currently adcc is only capable of performing in-core calculations,; for which, however, permutational symmetry and spin symmetry",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/adc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/adc.html

Construction of the denominator of the second term in the above; equation is less computationally expensive than construction of one \(\sigma\)-vector; with respect to the effective response matrix. The non-iterative excitation energy stated; above is calculated as a diagonal element of the Davidson mini-Hamiltonian matrix in the SEM as,. \[\omega^{Non-Iterative}=; \mathbf{X_{CIS}}^{\dagger}[\mathbf{A_{SS}^{(2)}}+; \mathbf{A_{SD}^{(1)}}^{\dagger}(\omega^{CIS}-\mathbf{A_{DD}^{(0)}})^{-1}; \mathbf{A_{DS}^{(1)}}]\mathbf{X_{CIS}}\]; where \(\omega^{CIS}\) and \(\mathbf{X_{CIS}}\) denote the CIS; excitation energy and wave function, respectively.

An alternative viewpoint; has been addressed for example in [Haettig:2002], where ADC(2) is related; to other response theories such as CC2-LR, CIS(D) and CIS(D\(_n\)).; In this sense one may consider the ADC matrix the correlated response matrix; to a response problem based on CIS; and apply the simultaneous expansion method (SEM),; in which the σ-vectors (ADC matrix-vector products); are constructed several times.; The structure and order of the blocks in the equation above; depend on the ADC level employed.

Interface to adcc¶; Code author: Michael F. Herbst; Section author: Michael F. Herbst; For most implemented ADC methods PSI4 relies; on an interface to the adcc python package.; The approach of adcc is to directly diagonalise the; ADC matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) in an iterative diagonalisation; procedure, usually a Jacobi-preconditioned Davidson. Expensive parts; of the ADC matrix-vector product are precomputed and stored; in memory. This approach is general in the sense; that it can be applied to a large range of ADC methods and variants.; So far levels up to ADC(3) and CVS-ADC(3) are available; and additional approximations such as; FREEZE_CORE and NUM_FROZEN_UOCC; are supported with all ADC methods using the adcc backend.; Currently adcc is only capable of performing in-core calculations,; for which, however, permutational symmetry and spin symmetry is taken; into account for both tensor computations and tensor storage.; Inside adcc some heuristic checks for overly excessive memory requirements; are implemented, resulting in a warning in case a; successful execution is unlikely.
