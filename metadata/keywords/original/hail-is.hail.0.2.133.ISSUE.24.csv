It's possible there's a memory leak somewhere else. My guess on why this change could solve the issue is that because we open the files in ""r+b"" mode when writing to a local file in parallel, the kernel was caching the data as much as possible based on the available amount of memory to the container because it was anticipating sequential reads. I'd think the kernel is smart enough to evict data when needed, but maybe when using an attached disk with a network drive, the contention is high if the disk starts to lag and it couldn't write all of the data in the write buffer quickly enough and evict unneeded data to meet demand???

The only change that gave me pause was the handling of `mjs_fut`, whose lifetime is a little tricky since it is potentially passed to yet another task.

Most importantly, the newer spark version brings with it a newer jackson version which is sufficient for the azure-storage-blob dependency, meaning we don't need to build against two different spark versions for spark and batch.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12701

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12733:58,Usability,simpl,simple,58,"CHANGELOG: `hl.export_vcf` is now substantially faster on simple pipelines. I fell into a bit of a rabbit hole. I started off using the balding nichols model as my test dataset. I improved random number generation a bit by making `rand_unif` into a method, but eventually bailed out to focus on other improvements. I also originally used `vcf.bgz` but bgzip is quite slow and it obscured the slow parts of what I could control, i.e. hail. I finally settled on this test case run against the Spark backend:; ```; import hail as hl; hl.init(master='local[1]'); hl._set_flags(write_ir_files='1'); mt = hl.utils.range_matrix_table(n_rows=1000_000, n_cols=4_000); mt = mt.key_cols_by(s = hl.str(mt.col_idx)); mt = mt.key_rows_by(locus = hl.locus(""1"", mt.row_idx + 1), alleles = ['G', 'T']); mt = mt.annotate_entries(GT = hl.call(mt.row_idx % 2, mt.col_idx % 2)); hl.export_vcf(mt, '/tmp/foo.vcf'); ```; It generates a 15GiB file. My initial tests, which used the balding nichols model, had write times of ~8MiB/s. With all my changes, I once saw 177 MIB/s but I think that may have been a fluke. I see pretty consistent ~110MiB/s in the profiler's estimate of bandwidth to the FileOutputStream. When measured by `time python3 test.py` this script writes at ~93MiB/s. Ideally we would hit 250MiB/s (1/8th of an n1-standard-8's network bandwidth), but, considering that we have to split that bandwidth with reading in most cases, ~91 MiB/s ain't so bad. On main, this pipeline writes at 32 MiB/s. The wins in decreasing order of importance were:; 1. Use buffered I/O. All of our exporters should now use buffered I/O because I changed it in the EmitMethodBuilder. I didn't change it in HadoopFS because (a) Hail's native I/O has buffering and (b) buffering and position tracking requires work.; 2.

Well, that and you can add another developer to a dev namespace as a developer without destroying the developer's existing namespace.

These use the normal create and delete API instead of copying the user's gsa from the production namespace.
