The utility of this method specification is that examination can be made; of the reference, the derivative level, the excitation level, etc. and; some options can be set according to best practices. Practically speaking,; CFOUR_CC_PROGRAM (and eventually CFOUR_ABCDTYPE) will; always be set to the fastest safe value.; For example, the input above will run with CFOUR_CC_PROGRAM=ECC; unless explicitly set to VCC.; An advantage of PSI4‘s Python driver is that any number of common; work-up procedures can be automated and wrapped around the; conventional single-point and optimization procedures at the heart of all; quantum chemistry codes. Three core “wrappers” available in PSI4 are; nbody_gufunc(),; database(), and; cbs(); read their respective sections; for details, but an overview is provided here. nbody_gufunc(); computes the interaction energy of a bimolecular complex (counterpoise-corrected,; not, or both).; molecule dimer {; Ne; --; Ne 1 R; symmetry c1; }.

Next, the database() wrapper allows any computational; model chemistry to be applied a predefined collection of molecules. Thus; an input; set {; basis jun-cc-pvdz; d_convergence 9; }. database('c4-mp2','nbc10',cp='on',subset='MeMe'). yields the counterpoise-corrected interaction energy for several points; along the dissociation curve of methane dimer, which is a member of the; NBC10 database:; //>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>//; // Database nbc10",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/cfour.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/cfour.html

The latter is what actually occurs. If; there is both a PSI4 molecule and a molecule in the cfour block,; ZMAT will end up with multiple molecules and multiple *CFOUR(...); blocks, and it will not run. Therefore, if mixing sandwich and; standard or pure-PSI4 computations in an input file, place all; the sandwich jobs at the beginning before declaring PSI4; molecules. If necessary, clear the cfour block with cfour {} before; commencing standard P4C4 jobs. Output¶; The output of xcfour invoked from a PSI4 input file is; written to the PSI4 output file as the computation progresses.

Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0]; set basis aug-cc-pVDZ. for R in Rvals:; dimer.R = R; ecp = cp('c4-mp2'); print_stdout('R [A] = %.1f IE [kcal/mol] = %.3f\n' % (R, psi_hartree2kcalmol * ecp)). yields; R [A] = 2.5 IE [kcal/mol] = 0.804; R [A] = 3.0 IE [kcal/mol] = 0.030; R [A] = 4.0 IE [kcal/mol] = -0.014. Next, the database() wrapper allows any computational; model chemistry to be applied a predefined collection of molecules. Thus; an input; set {; basis jun-cc-pvdz; d_convergence 9; }. database('c4-mp2','nbc10',cp='on',subset='MeMe'). yields the counterpoise-corrected interaction energy for several points; along the dissociation curve of methane dimer, which is a member of the; NBC10 database:; //>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>//; // Database nbc10 Results //; //<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<//.

Thirdly, the cbs() wrapper allows any; compound computational method that can be expressed through CBS to be applied to a molecule while employing the minimum number; of calculations. For example, the job below computes a; triple-quadruple-zeta Helgaker extrapolation of the mp2 correlation energy; atop a quadruple zeta reference to which is appended a double-triple-zeta; Helgaker extrapolated ccsd(t) - mp2 delta correction. Since the mp2 has; been requested through PSI4 and the ccsd(t) through Cfour, the; wrapper runs only MP2/cc-pVQZ (P4), CCSD(T)/cc-pVDZ (C4), and; CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ (C4) single-points.; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 1.0 0.0 0.0; }. set mp2_type conv. cbs('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pV[TQ]Z', delta_wfn='c4-ccsd(t)', delta_basis='cc-pV[DT]Z').

Here, the contents of the cfour {...} block are written directly to a; ZMAT file. This is joined by a default GENBAS file; (psi4/psi4/share/psi4/basis/GENBAS). To preferentially use your own GENBAS,; place it in PATH or PSIPATH. The line calling; energy() with argument 'cfour' invokes; xcfour.; After execution of the energy('cfour') line completes, Cfour results; are read back into PSI4 format and are thereafter accessible for; further processing in the input file. See Output for; details. This storage of results in variables and arrays in memory for; the duration of the PSI4 instance (as opposed to solely in files); is the only advantage thus far incurred by the P4C4 interface. We’ll call; this mode of basic utility the “sandwich” mode.; Molecule specification in PSI4 allows Cartesians, Z-matrices, mixed; Cartesian/Z-matrix, negation of variables, delayed specification of; variables, specification of fragments, etc., all in a whitespace-tolerant; format. See Molecule and Geometry Specification for details and; cfour/mints5 for examples. When a PSI4-style molecule is; supplied, its geometry is written to ZMAT in Cartesian form and the; CFOUR_COORDINATES=CARTESIAN, CFOUR_UNITS=ANGSTROM,; CFOUR_CHARGE, and CFOUR_MULTIPLICITY keywords are set; appropriately in the *CFOUR(...) directive. Warning; There exist molecules (e.g., allene) where the; inertial frame is not unique (planes along atoms or between; atoms). The orientation reconciling machinery currently does not; handle these cases and will fail with “Axis unreconcilable between; QC programs”.

Specification of strings and integers requires no; translation; booleans have extended freedom of; format; arrays must be translated into Python-style (square-bracket; bounded and comma delimited) of appropriate dimension. There are many; sample inputs in psi4/tests/cfour/ starting with sp- that take; examples from the Cfour manual and first run them in sandwich mode and; then run them as translated into PSI4 format.

Because of the limitations on geometry specification for; optimizations in Cfour, optking-driven optimizations are the only; optimizations allowed in the P4C4 interface.

Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source.

Gradient transformed back into the frame; in which it was shipped off to Cfour is also written to the PSI4; output file and is available from input as get_gradient().; sandwich mode := molecule and cfour list within; Naturally, additional jobs can follow in the input file.; Depending on the nature of preceding or following jobs, it is prudent to; separate them with the following:; clean() # removes Psi4 scratch files; clean_variables() # empties the PSI variables list; cfour {} # empties. In this scheme, the contents of the cfour {...} block are tacked onto; the end of the ZMAT file that is otherwise written from psi style; format. It is by this route that, for example %excite* sections can at; present be specified.; The execution of xcfour can be modified by a few parameters. Setting; the option CFOUR_OMP_NUM_THREADS sets the environment variable; OMP_NUM_THREADS for only the duration of the Cfour computation.; That is, portions of an input file that run PSI4 modules are; unaffected.

Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples; PSI4 contains code to interface to the Cfour quantum chemistry suite of; John F. Stanton (U. Texas, Austin) and Jürgen Gauss (U. Mainz),; which is available after a license agreement from; http://www.cfour.de/. Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH. If PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error; will be reported. Caution; The p4c4 interface hasn’t been fully adapted for the new March 2014 version. Cfour for PSI4 Users¶. Set memory as usual; Set molecule as usual; Set basis set as usual (Cfour only cares about orbital basis, no fitting; bases); Set the task as usual, indicating Cfour as the intended code by; prepending “c4-” to the method argument. So energy('scf') becomes; energy('c4-scf') and optimize('ccsd(t)') becomes; optimize('c4-ccsd(t)').

Warning; Because p4c4 does not inspect the contents of the cfour {...}; block, once the user specifies a PSI4-style molecule, the; interface cannot judge whether a sandwich mode (drop the PSI4 molecule; and use the cfour block as the entirety of the ZMAT) or a standard mode; (translate the PSI4 molecule and append additional input from the; cfour block) is intended. The latter is what actually occurs. If; there is both a PSI4 molecule and a molecule in the cfour block,; ZMAT will end up with multiple molecules and multiple *CFOUR(...); blocks, and it will not run. Therefore, if mixing sandwich and; standard or pure-PSI4 computations in an input file, place all; the sandwich jobs at the beginning before declaring PSI4; molecules. If necessary, clear the cfour block with cfour {} before; commencing standard P4C4 jobs.

It is then helpful if these tools be part of your development toolchain.; Once clang-format and yapf are installed, there are three ways in which; formatting of the code can be accomplished, in decreasing order of automation:. By integrating the formatters into your editor.; By installing Git hooks to run the formatters when committing.; By running the formatters manually on the modified files. How to impose code style through your editor¶; Both clang-format and yapf can be integrated into widely used editors.; The Neoformat plugin can be configured; to format files when saving them to disk.

Install PSI4. You can install into the main conda environment so that whenever commands conda or (Ana/Miniconda’s) python are available, then psi4 is available, too. >>> conda install psi4; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/bin/psi4. Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda. This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The conda activate command (conda >=4.4; December 2017) works in all shells, but if you’re using old source activate that only works for bash; adjust as needed for csh/tcsh.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> conda activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4.

In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The conda activate command (conda >=4.4; December 2017) works in all shells, but if you’re using old source activate that only works for bash; adjust as needed for csh/tcsh.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> conda activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4.

This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The conda activate command (conda >=4.4; December 2017) works in all shells, but if you’re using old source activate that only works for bash; adjust as needed for csh/tcsh.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> conda activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4. Configure environment. Preceding steps have placed conda and psi4 in your PATH, either permanently through rc-files or temporarily in this terminal session. You can keep or undo these changes. For general psi4 use, you must enable the psi4 executable to be found through any of:. prepending to PATH in shell, ~/.bashrc, ~/.tcshrc, or PBS cmd file; activating the conda environment (p4env above) in shell, ~/.bashrc, or PBS cmd file; supplying full path to executable (shell or PBS cmd file). Similarly, the scratch directory (see Scratch Files) must be specified through:. defining PSI_SCRATCH in shell, ~/.bashrc, ~/.tcshrc, or PBS cmd file. Useful Commands¶. Initially install PSI4 stable release. # equivalent; >>> conda install psi4 -c psi4; >>> conda install psi4 --channel psi4. Initially install PSI4 stable release with non-current python. >>> conda install psi4 python=3.8 -c psi4. Update to latest PSI4 stable release. >>> conda update psi4 -c psi4. Initially install stable release into a conda environment “p4env” instead of “root”. This creates a sandbox with PSI4 and python (loaded as dependency). >>> conda create -y -n p4env psi4 -c psi4; >>> conda activate",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/conda-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/conda-1.html

Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda. This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The conda activate command (conda >=4.4; December 2017) works in all shells, but if you’re using old source activate that only works for bash; adjust as needed for csh/tcsh.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> conda activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4.

Interfaces: Enhancing PSI4 Capabilities; Interface to CPPE by M. Scheurer. Interface to CPPE by M. Scheurer¶; Code author: Maximilian Scheurer; Section author: Maximilian Scheurer; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables. PSI4 contains code to interface to the CPPE library developed; by M. Scheurer.; The CPPE library requires no additional licence, downloads, or; configuration. The library allows for calculations in solution with the; polarizable embedding model (PE), an explicit, fragment-based solvent model [Olsen:2010:3721].; For a general tutorial on how to prepare/perform PE calculations, read the; tutorial review. Installation¶; Binary. CPPE is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).; If using the PSI4 binary, CPPE has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; CPPE can be obtained through conda install cppe -c psi4.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_cppe,; hint its location with cppe_DIR,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect CPPE and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove cppe. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want CPPE built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_cppe,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code. Using the polarizable embedding model¶; The inclusion of a PE description of the solvent into your calculation; is achieved by setting PE true in your input file. Note; At present, PE can only be used for energy calculations with SCF; wavefunctions and CC wavefunctions in the PTE approximation [Cammi:2009:164104].; All ERI algorithms (PK, OUT_OF_CORE, DIRECT, DF, CD) are supported. Note; linear response calculations (static polarisabilities, TD-SCF) are supported for RHF/UHF if available.

Scheurer¶; Code author: Maximilian Scheurer; Section author: Maximilian Scheurer; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables. PSI4 contains code to interface to the CPPE library developed; by M. Scheurer.; The CPPE library requires no additional licence, downloads, or; configuration. The library allows for calculations in solution with the; polarizable embedding model (PE), an explicit, fragment-based solvent model [Olsen:2010:3721].; For a general tutorial on how to prepare/perform PE calculations, read the; tutorial review. Installation¶; Binary. CPPE is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell).; If using the PSI4 binary, CPPE has already been installed alongside.; If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; CPPE can be obtained through conda install cppe -c psi4.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_cppe,; hint its location with cppe_DIR,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect CPPE and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove cppe. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want CPPE built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_cppe,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code. Using the polarizable embedding model¶; The inclusion of a PE description of the solvent into your calculation; is achieved by setting PE true in your input file. Note; At present, PE can only be used for energy calculations with SCF; wavefunctions and CC wavefunctions in the PTE approximation [Cammi:2009:164104].; All ERI algorithms (PK, OUT_OF_CORE, DIRECT, DF, CD) are supported. Note; linear response calculations (static polarisabilities, TD-SCF) are supported for RHF/UHF if available. Warning; The CPPE library cannot exploit molecular point group symmetry. A typical input for a Hartree–Fock calculation with PE would look like the following:; molecule pna {; C 8",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/cppe.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/cppe.html

Isocontour range for 85% of the density: (0.0787495,-0.0787495). The second line reports the isocontour values that capture 85% of the probability density using; the least amount of grid points. This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option CUBEPROP_ISOCONTOUR_THRESHOLD. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals). DENSITYThis task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\), together; with the total density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) + \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\),; and the spin density; \(\rho",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/cubeprop-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/cubeprop-1.html

Introduction¶; PSI4 has the ability to export cube files that store information about; basis functions, molecular orbitals, the electron density, and; the electrostatic potential (ESP). Cube files store the value of a scalar; quantity on a regular Cartesian grid, and can be visualized with several; visualization programs, some of which are free, like VMD; (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).; An example utilization of the code is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set scf_type df; set freeze_core True; set cubeprop_tasks ['orbitals']; set cubeprop_orbitals [5,6,-5,-6]. E, wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True); cubeprop(wfn). In this example, the cubeprop(); call after the energy('scf') command; executes the cubeprop code. The array CUBEPROP_TASKS specifies which; tasks should be executed. In this case the task 'orbitals' generates cube; files for orbitals. The CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option specifies that cube files; should be generated only for alpha orbitals 5 (HOMO) and 6 (LUMO) and; beta orbitals 5 (indicated as -5) and 6.; If the option CUBEPROP_ORBITALS is not provided, then cube files are; generated for all orbitals.; After running, the above input will generate four files: Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube,; Psi_a_6_4-A1.cube, Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube, and Psi_a_6_4-A1.cube.

The second line reports the isocontour values that capture 85% of the probability density using; the least amount of grid points. This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option CUBEPROP_ISOCONTOUR_THRESHOLD. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals).

Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals).

This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option CUBEPROP_ISOCONTOUR_THRESHOLD. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry. FRONTIER_ORBITALSProduces cube representations of the frontier molecular orbitals. For closed shell; species, the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) alpha orbitals (ie.; \(\psi_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r})\)) are printed, while for open shell species a total; of \((4 + M_s)\) orbitals are printed (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\); spin for both lowest virtual (LVMO) and highest doubly occupied; orbitals (DOMO), along with all \(\alpha\) singly occupied (SOMO) orbitals). DENSITYThis task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\r",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/cubeprop.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/cubeprop.html

BASIS_FUNCTIONSThis task is useful to produce cube files of the atomic orbital basis; functions \(\chi_\mu(\mathbf{r})\). ESPCalculates the total (nuclear + electronic) electrostatic potential; \(V(\mathbf{r})\). DUAL_DESCRIPTORCalculates the dual descriptor from frontier orbitals:; \(f^2(\mathbf{r})=\rho_{\mathrm{LUMO}}(\mathbf{r})-\rho_{\mathrm{HOMO}}(\mathbf{r})\).; The dual descriptor is a good measure of nucleophilicity and electrophilicity,; containing information essentially equivalent to both Fukui functions combined.; More details on the dual descriptor itself can be found in [Morell:2005:205],; while the current implementation is described in [Martinez-Araya:2015:451].; This feature is currently only supported for closed shell systems. Note; The ESP task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis; via the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword. Warning; It is important to specify the CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option when; dealing with large molecules to avoid running out of disk space.; For example, using the default grid spacing of; 0.2 Ångström, the size of a single cube file for a molecule like water; is of the order of 1.4 MB. For a molecule with 200 basis functions, the cube; files for all the orbitals occupy more than half a GB. Keywords¶. CUBEPROP_TASKS¶. Properties to compute.

Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the; AO_BASIS DISK option is recommended (set by default).; In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the AO_BASIS DISK option; is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm fo",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/dct-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/dct-1.html

Theoretical Methods: SCF to FCI; DCT: Density Cumulant Theory. DCT: Density Cumulant Theory¶; Code author: Alexander Yu. Sokolov, Andrew C. Simmonett, and Xiao Wang; Section author: Alexander Yu. Sokolov; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DCT. Theory¶; Density cumulant theory (DCT) is a density-based ab initio theory; that can compute electronic energies without the use of a wavefunction. The; theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and; two-particle density matrices (\(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\)):. \[E = h_p^q \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{2} g_{pq}^{rs} \gamma_{rs}^{pq}\]; Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices.; \(h_p^q\) and \(g_{pq}^{rs}\) are the standard one- and two-electron integrals, and; \(\gamma_p^q\) and \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) are the elements of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\),; respectively. Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements \(\gamma_p^q\) and; \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction.

Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the; AO_BASIS DISK option is recommended (set by default).; In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the AO_BASIS DISK option; is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm for the closed-shell molecules, it; is recommended to set the QC_COUPLING option to FALSE for efficiency; reasons (set by default).; For the ODC computations, the user has a choice of performing the computation of the guess orbitals and cumulants; using the corresponding DC method (set ODC_GUESS to TRUE). This can often lead to; significant computational savings, since the orbital update step in the DC methods is cheap.; Convergence of the guess orbitals and cumulants can be controlled using the; GUESS_R_CONVERGENCE option. table of contents.

The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive \({\cal O}(N^5)\) integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive \({\cal O}(N^6)\); cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis. In order to do that one needs to set the AO_BASIS option to; DISK (currently used by default). For more recommendations on the choice of the algorithm see; Recommendations. Analytic Gradients¶; Analytic gradients are available for the DC-06, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13 methods.; For DC-06, the evaluation of the analytic gradients requires the solution of the; coupled response equations.

These algorithms are similar to those; described for the orbital and cumulant updates in the Iterative Algorithms; section and usually exhibit similar efficiency.

Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements \(\gamma_p^q\) and; \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; \(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\) and a correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\):. \[\gamma_p^q = \kappa_p^q + \tau_p^q\]; The idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) corresponds to a mean-field Hartree–Fock-like density,; while the non-idempotent correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\); depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.; Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:. \[E_{DCT} = \frac{1}{2} \left( h_p^q + f_p^q \right) \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{4} \bar{",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/dct-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/dct-1.html

First,; the energy is now a function of two sets of independent parameters, the; idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) (\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\)) and the density cumulant; (\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\)). As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,; which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability; problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) is; N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\).; In order to obtain the DCT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:.

This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)).

While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive \({\cal O}(N^5)\) integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive \({\cal O}(N^6)\); cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis.

As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis. In order to do that one needs to set the AO_BASIS option to; DISK (currently used by default). For more recommendations on the choice of the algorithm see; Recommendations. Analytic Gradients¶; Analytic gradients are available for the DC-06, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13 methods.; For DC-06, the evaluation of the analytic gradients requires the solution of the; coupled response equations. Two algorithms are available for their iterative; solution: TWOSTEP (default) and SIMULTANEOUS. These algorithms are similar to those; described for the orbital and cumulant updates in the Iterative Algorithms; section and usually exhibit similar efficiency. The choice of the algorithm can; be made using the RESPONSE_ALGORITHM option. For the DC-12 method the; analytic gradients are not yet available, one has to use numerical gradients to; perform the geometry optimizations.

Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements \(\gamma_p^q\) and; \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; \(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\) and a correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\):. \[\gamma_p^q = \kappa_p^q + \tau_p^q\]; The idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) corresponds to a mean-field Hartree–Fock-like density,; while the non-idempotent correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\); depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.; Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:. \[E_{DCT} = \frac{1}{2} \left( h_p^q + f_p^q \right) \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{4} \bar{",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/dct.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/dct.html

First,; the energy is now a function of two sets of independent parameters, the; idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) (\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\)) and the density cumulant; (\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\)). As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,; which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability; problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) is; N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\).; In order to obtain the DCT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:. The energy must be stationary with respect to a set of orbitals. This can be done by; diagonalizing the generalized Fock operator (as in the DC-06 and DC-12 methods, see below),; which introduces partial orbital relaxation, or by fully relaxing the orbitals and minimizing the entire energy expression; (as in the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods).; The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density; cumulant \(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\), constrained to N-representability conditions.

A. Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; Th",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/detci-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/detci-1.html

A. Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; Th",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/detci-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/detci-1.html

For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are particularly inefficient for CISD and may result in the program; running out of memory and crashing for CISD except on very small molecules.; Instead, DETCI was designed to be efficient; in handling more highly correlated CI wavefunctions that can be helpful in more; challenging cases such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions.

Arbitrary Order Perturbation Theory¶; The DETCI module is capable of computing energies for arbitrary; order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MPn, for closed-shell; systems with an RHF reference) and for Z-averaged perturbation theory; (ZAPTn, open-shell systems with a ROHF reference). However, please; note that these computations are essentially doing high-order CI (up to; full CI) computations to obtain these results, and hence they will only; be possible for very small systems (generally a dozen electrons or less).; The simplest way to run high-order perturbation theory computations is to; call, e.g., energy('mp10') to invoke a MP10 computation or; energy('zapt25') to invoke a ZAPT25 computation. This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy.

For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are particularly inefficient for CISD and may result in the program; running out of memory and crashing for CISD except on very small molecules.; Instead, DETCI was designed to be efficient; in handling more highly correlated CI wavefunctions that can be helpful in more; challenging cases such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions. The CI; code is based on the fast, determinant-based string formalism; of Handy [Handy:1980]. It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI’s.

Spin Multiplicities of Higher Roots¶; As mentioned above, DETCI works in a basis of Slater determinants, rather than; configuration state functions. The correct value of \(M_s\) is easily enforced; by fixing the number of alpha and beta electrons to be constant across all determinants; selected for the CI computation. However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/detci-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/detci-1.html

The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI]. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are particularly inefficient for CISD and may result in the program; running out of memory and crashing for CISD except on very small molecules.; Instead, DETCI was designed to be efficient; in handling more highly correlated CI wavefunctions that can be helpful in more; challenging cases such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions.

However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)), the program; will typically return singlets and not triplets.

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI].

All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code.

A. Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; Th",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/detci.html

Spin Multiplicities of Higher Roots¶; As mentioned above, DETCI works in a basis of Slater determinants, rather than; configuration state functions. The correct value of \(M_s\) is easily enforced; by fixing the number of alpha and beta electrons to be constant across all determinants; selected for the CI computation. However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/detci.html

This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy.

However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin \(S\). For example, diagonalizing the; Hamiltonian in a space spanned by determinants with \(M_s = 0\) can yield; both singlet and triplet solutions, because triplets (\(S = 1\)) also have an; \(M_s = 0\) component. (Indeed, even higher spin multiplicities may be encountered; if the excitation level is high enough). For closed-shell references with \(M_s = 0\),; the program will assume by default that a singlet (\(S = 0\)) computation is desired,; and will utilize alpha/beta interchange symmetries to speed up the computation; (this is controlled by the advanced keyword MS0, which defaults to TRUE).; Thus, if a user requests multiple roots (NUM_ROOTS = \(n\)), the program; will typically return singlets and not triplets. However, if enough roots are sought,; higher-multiplicities may enter in. This can be avoided by ensuring that all the guess; vectors have the correct spin multiplicity, by setting CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE).; It is also possible to ask DETCI to compute roots of higher multiplicities. The desired value of spin may be; provided by setting S = \(S\). Typically, it would be a good idea in this context to also set; CALC_S_SQUARED to TRUE to ensure the guess roots have the right spin.

Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI]. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are pa",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/detci.html

An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code.

Arbitrary Order Perturbation Theory¶; The DETCI module is capable of computing energies for arbitrary; order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MPn, for closed-shell; systems with an RHF reference) and for Z-averaged perturbation theory; (ZAPTn, open-shell systems with a ROHF reference). However, please; note that these computations are essentially doing high-order CI (up to; full CI) computations to obtain these results, and hence they will only; be possible for very small systems (generally a dozen electrons or less).; The simplest way to run high-order perturbation theory computations is to; call, e.g., energy('mp10') to invoke a MP10 computation or; energy('zapt25') to invoke a ZAPT25 computation. This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy. The program then; sets MAX_NUM_VECS to the required order in the; wavefunction.; By default, the requested n-th order energy is saved as the current; energy to the process environment.

Recommendations¶; All-in-all, DFMP2 should be a simple module to use, with few keywords (fully; documented in the Appendix DFMP2). Some basic recommendations are included below:. DFMP2 should be run with the \(ov\)-type RI or MP2FIT auxiliary; basis sets, not the -JKFIT basis sets. The automatic basis selector; should work fine for most all bases (exceptions are less common elements; at higher than quadruple-zeta). Generally, it is always better to specify; only the orbital basis set and let the auxiliary bases be chosen; automatically. If you want to specify manually, use the; DF_BASIS_MP2 keyword.; DFMP2 likes memory. At a minimum, \(2Q^2\) doubles are required,; where \(Q\) is the size of the auxiliary basis set. However, there is; one disk transpose of the \((Q|ov)\) tensor in the RHF-MP2 algorithm; [two for UHF-MP2 and ROHF-MBPT(2)], so more memory will reduce seek times.; If you notice DFMP2 using more memory than allowed, it is possible that; the threaded three-index ERI computers are using too much overhead memory.; Set the DF_INTS_NUM_THREA",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/dfmp2-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/dfmp2-1.html

Introduction¶; Second-order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor \({\cal O}(N^5)\) treatment of; dynamic electron correlation.

Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach.

See; MP2_TYPE for performing a MP2 with conventional integrals.; An example utilization of the code is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set scf_type df; set freeze_core True. energy('mp2'). The energy('mp2') call to energy() executes; the predefined DF-MP2 procedure, first calling; the SCF module with a default RHF reference and DF algorithm for the; two-electron integrals. When the orbitals are converged, the DF-MP2 module is; launched, which forms the density-fitted \((Q|ov)\) integrals and then builds the; full \((ov|ov)\) tensor in blocks, evaluating the contributions to the MP2 energy; as it goes. A RHF-MP2 wavefunction is selected automatically due to the RHF; reference. In this example, we freeze the core, both for efficiency and; because split-valence bases like cc-pVDZ do not contain core correlation; functions.

Recommendations¶; All-in-all, DFMP2 should be a simple module to use, with few keywords (fully; documented in the Appendix DFMP2). Some basic recommendations are included below:. DFMP2 should be run with the \(ov\)-type RI or MP2FIT auxiliary; basis sets, not the -JKFIT basis sets. The automatic basis selector; should work fine for most all bases (exceptions are less common elements; at higher than quadruple-zeta). Generally, it is always better to specify; only the orbital basis set and let the auxiliary bases be chosen; automatically. If you want to specify manually, use the; DF_BASIS_MP2 keyword.; DFMP2 likes memory. At a minimum, \(2Q^2\) doubles are required,; where \(Q\) is the size of the auxiliary basis set. However, there is; one disk transpose of the \((Q|ov)\) tensor in the RHF-MP2 algorithm; [two for UHF-MP2 and ROHF-MBPT(2)], so more memory will reduce seek times.; If you notice DFMP2 using more memory than allowed, it is possible that; the threaded three-index ERI computers are using too much overhead memory.; Set the DF_INTS_NUM_THREA",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/dfmp2.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/dfmp2.html

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # IP fitting runs in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Optional arguments are minimum omega, maximum omega, molecule object; omega = ip_fitting('wb97', 0.4, 2.0, molecule=h2o).

PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral. An example is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # FRAC jobs will be be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do all kinds of weird stuff; basis aug-cc-pvdz # Augmented functions are very important on the anion side; scf_type df; }. # Argument is functional.; # Many optional arguments are available, see the python file; frac_traverse('wb97', molecule=h2o). The other macro is frac_nuke(), which strips several electrons out of the; system to gather information on the MSIE over a range of orbitals. The input is; identical to the above, except that the frac_traverse() call is substituted; for something like:; # Argument is the functional.; # A useful optional argument is nmax, the total number of electrons to; # strip out of the molecule, in this case, 2.; # Many optional arguments are available, see the python file; frac.frac_nuke('wb97', molecule=h2o, nmax = 2).

The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integer (typically 50-100). The radial grids are “centered” on the Bragg-Slater; radius of each atom, as described in Becke’s 1988 paper. If inaccurate; integration is suspected in systems with anions or very diffuse basis functions,; the DFT_BS_RADIUS_ALPHA option may be increased from 1.0 to a larger value to force the radial grid to span a larger extent in space.; The atomic weighting scheme is controlled by the DFT_NUCLEAR_SCHEME; option, which may be one of TREUTLER, BECKE, STRATMANN, NAIVE,; or SBECKE.

This guarantees the asymptotics of; the exchange potential,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{tuned-LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r} + I_{\mathrm{IP}} +; \epsilon_{\mathrm{HOMO}}\]; Note that LRC functionals with default \(\omega\) only capture the; \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r},\]; hybrid functionals only capture part of the \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Hybrid}} (r) = -; \frac{\alpha}{r},\]; and local functionals decay exponentially, resulting in completely incorrect; asymptotics,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Local}} (r) = 0\]; IP-tuned LRC functionals effectively pin the chemical potential at \(N\); electrons to the correct value determined by the ionization potential.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131. The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial; points are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/dft-1.html

The last is a smoother variant of the BECKE scheme recently introduced; by Laqua [Laqua:2018:204111] that should behave better for weak interactions.; Pruning of the quadrature grid is controlled by the DFT_PRUNING_SCHEME; option. The options ROBUST and TREUTLER divide the grid into spherical regions; based on the Bragg-Slater radius of each atom and apply different orders to them.; The ROBUST scheme is a less aggressive variant of the TREUTLER approach and; suitable for benchmark-level quality (MAD < 0.002 kcal/mol for the S22 with PBE/aug-cc-pVTZ; for pruned versus unpruned grid). Our implementation of the TREUTLER scheme shows an; error of 0.02 kcal/mol for the same benchmark. Both also reduce the grid order by 1 for H; and He atoms and avoid any pruning of heavy atoms (Z >= 36) Other schemes mentioned in; the keyword documentation (e.g. P_SLATER) are experimental and should be considered expert-only.; Once the molecular quadrature grid is built, the points are partitioned into; blocks of points which are spatially close to each other. We use an octree; algorithm for this procedure, which produces a good balance between spatial; compactness of each block (which helps achieve linear scaling due to the; exponential decay of the basis functions), and retaining a large number of; points in each block (which helps keep the FLOP rate up by allowing for a; reasonably large amount of BLAS3/BLAS2 work to form the densities and potentials; in each block). For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/dft-1.html

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # IP fitting runs in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cati",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/dft-1.html

This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0. Larger systems,; particularly conjugated systems, will typically have an optimized \(\omega\); between 0.1 and 0.5. Fractional Particle Curves¶; The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies. PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization.

Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, LIBFUNCTIONAL, LIBFOCK, LIBSCF_SOLVER; Both density functional theory and Hartree–Fock theory are controlled; through the SCF module, and the SCF Introduction; section is also relevant here. Note; Starting version 1.5, the WCOMBINE option is temporarily disabled. Note; Starting version 1.4 (tag v1.4a1 in the development repository), PSI4 uses an updated and extended (to 104 elements) set; of Bragg-Slater radii. This leads to minimal deviations in absolute energies (1E-06 au) and; relative energies (below 0.002 kcal/mol for S22), depending also on the applied grid, compared; to older versions. We advise not to mix absolute energies absolute energies from before and after this change for the; calculation of relative energies.
