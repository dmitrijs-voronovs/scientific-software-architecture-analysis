Certainly interesting to see that the VCF report here. (Side note: Maybe we should consider attaching these reports as part of our documentations like [metrics.md](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.4/docs/metrics.md). I'll take a note to consider for future releases!). By the way, In the past (starting v1.2), we did try augmenting the training data by creating 100bp and 125bp reads, but we did so by trimming. See this document: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.4/docs/deepvariant-details-training-data.md#vfootnote12; But it's possible that our model still didn't feel confident enough with your datatype.

I believe that we internally stratified calls and (though my memory is hazy) found that another factor in the bimodal distribution is whether a site is HET or HOM. Specifically, HET sites with lower depth have lower GQs, and I believe the explanation for this is that as coverage drops, it can become difficult to tell a HET site from either a REF or HOM, while HOM sites have more effective signal for them as non-REF. I don't think that the model is likely to be less confident in 100bp reads because they are not as much of the training data, but I expect the fact that 100bp reads are harder to uniquely map and will results in more variability in the coverage of high-MAPQ reads would indirectly contribute.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/586#issuecomment-1320629275

One other possibility is that the insert sizes for this sample are different and this is interacting with the input channel for insert length. .

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/586#issuecomment-1334570619:394,Usability,simpl,simply,394,"Hi @JakeHagen . I took one of our 50x NovaSeq samples that are 150bp PE reads and trimmed the reads into 4 WGS consisting of a sample each for:. 1. first 100bp of the reads; 2. last 100bp of the reads; 3. first 75bp of the reads; 4. last 75bp of the reads. I wasn't able to replicate the effect that you see in any off the output reports. In your approach, did you trim the reads from the end (simply truncating to the first 75bp)? If so, I wasn't able to replicate the effect you see. There might be something more complicated about your sample. One possible explanation is that you have a run with lower sequencing quality and trimming to the first 75bp reads removes some lower quality parts which look suspicious to DeepVariant. If so, I wonder if your results would differ if you retained only the last 75bp reads. But I am not quite sure how to further diagnose.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/592#issuecomment-1332875716:2112,Safety,detect,detect,2112," GT from the two runs indicates that the neural network assesses the probability of 0/1 and 1/1 calls to be very similar (in the first entry they are rounded identically in the PL field). Your collaborator calls do have a small lean toward 1/1. DeepVariant should give identical results when the same version is run on the same hardware platform (e.g. CPU-CPU). However, there can be floating point differences with very minor (almost never at the level of the variant call, but mostly at the GQ level) between compute platforms.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/592#issuecomment-1332875716:1909,Usability,learn,learning,1909," GT from the two runs indicates that the neural network assesses the probability of 0/1 and 1/1 calls to be very similar (in the first entry they are rounded identically in the PL field). Your collaborator calls do have a small lean toward 1/1. DeepVariant should give identical results when the same version is run on the same hardware platform (e.g. CPU-CPU). However, there can be floating point differences with very minor (almost never at the level of the variant call, but mostly at the GQ level) between compute platforms.

Thank you for the BAM file, I've been able to download it and look at the region in IGV. To my eye, I can't see the reason DeepVariant is calling 0/1 based on the pileup I see. We're going to run a few experiments with this and see if we can identify either something DeepVariant sees that we don't or if this is highlighting some sort of edge case or bug in the code.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/592#issuecomment-1334238783

For the question about why does the model have a difficult time calling this 1/1 versus 0/1, we have done further investigation. First, it doesn't look like this is a bug in pre-processing or how the data is represented. It seems to be a property of the model. . Second, the property of the model seems to reflect something learned about exome sequencing as opposed to WGS. To determine that, we ran your snippet through both the WGS and WES models. The WGS model is able to confidently call this site as 1/1:. ```; chr2 24146804 . C T 34.1 PASS . GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL 1/1:34:162:0,162:1:34,45,0; ```. When we run the WES model, we replicate your finding (this is with the most recent DeepVariant v1.4, so there is a small difference in the GQ values. ; ```; chr2 24146804 . C T 29.3 PASS . GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL 0/1:4:162:0,162:1:26,0,1; ```. This suggests that there is some aspect of exome sequencing that the DeepVariant WES model has learned makes this variant difficult to genotype, possibly because there is some signal that indicates only one allele is present. The reason for this might be some factor which isn't understood (at least by me). This is an interesting observation, but really understanding the reason for a 0/1 call at this position would probably need more investigation (for example, by going into the GIAB training labels for exome sequencing and seeing how often positions that look like this are 0/1 versus 1/1 and trying to understand why). With respect to why your collaborator has different results from you, it's very likely that the difference in mappers has a small effect on which reads are present and how many map discordantly. This small difference pushes the output for the variant on the edge of probabilities between 0/1 an 1/1 to the other side.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/592#issuecomment-1335960453

From the DeepVariant REF column have G and the ALT column have GCTCT,GCTCTCT. Two different alternate alleles of both insertion types. So I can say this comes under Multiallelic Insertion category. . From the truth VCF file, there is no line for this coordinate position. When I evaluated using hap.py, it returns error as I commented earlier in the above post. . Does the model consider both Multiallelic variant type and Biallelic or only Biallelic during evaluation?

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/609#issuecomment-1423013212:505,Testability,benchmark,benchmarks,505,"Hi @karoliinas . As Pi-Chuan mentioned, it is (in theory) possible to train a quartet model, but it would take work. If you want to always have consistent calls between parents and child, the best thing is probably to either use parent calling from only 1 DeepTrio run, or to run DeepVariant instead on the full quartet. In the event that you do want to use DeepTrio on both trios as opposed to DeepVariant on the four, there are some things you can look at to increase sensitivity for de novos. From our benchmarks, DeepTrio has a higher overall accuracy for de novos, but is more conservative (lower sensitivity, higher specificity). You could potentially use the GQ/PL values for no-call sites that are potential de novos sites and rank these by confidence, setting your own threshold. I mention the above possibility as an option. It sounds like for your use case of having a quartet and wanting higher sensitivity, the most straightfoward approach is to just use DeepVariant for joint genotyping.

I realize in looking at the VCF entry, I was mistaken in saying DeepVariant sees a SNP and an Indel. In fact, it sees the candidates as you wrote. CAGCAGCGCT -> C; CAGCAGCGCT -> T. That's entirely on me, it should be clear from the VCF, and I don't have an excuse to make such a basic mistake. The call looks correct, it does look like a HET deletion of AGCAGCGCT. It looks like the realigner has decided to place a gap at this position and left-align the trailing T at the edge of the deletion so that when it is present it looks like a SNP. It's hard to authoritatively say why the realigner is going something without getting the actual BAM snippet and looking at the realignment. That part is in the heuristics of DeepVariant not the neural net. As a result of the re-alignment, DeepVariant sees the T SNP as a candidate but seems to correctly reject it. I think that's what's going on. In any case, a candidate here for the SNP seems to be a function of the realigner? . The behavior should not have changed from DeepVariant v1.2 to v1.5. In general, uncalled multiallelic events should be a relatively rare phenomenon. . Generally, if you need to, you can prune the alleles that are not called in DeepVariant VCF as long as the result of pruning stays compliant with the VCF spec expected by any downstream tools.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/618#issuecomment-1470986150

The contents of the INFO field are generally used by other calling methods to describe statistics about the variant position that are used in the process of variant calling (for example ""##INFO=<ID=ClippingRankSum,Number=1,Type=Float,Description=""Z-score From Wilcoxon rank sum test of Alt vs. Ref number of hard clipped bases"">""). . In DeepVariant, instead of directly calculating many of these values to use in a statistical model, the more raw read-level data is directly presented to a neural network and the neural network itself determines what properties in the raw data are useful for variant calling. So we don't populate the INFO field as we don't calculate many of those derived features. One thing that people often use the INFO field for is to filter variant calls by different properties. We've looked into the most effective ways to filter calls, and it is consistently the case that the sample level GQ field is well-calibrated to the probability of a call being correct. If you want to see some data for this, you can look at the calibration in Figure 2 of the DeepVariant paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4235) or at the general work in our cohort calling paper (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/24/5582/6064144). Are there fields in particular you generally use within INFO? It's unlikely we could easily add them, but it might be useful for us to know.

The most comparable version would be v1.0, but there are some code and data changes that occurred between the pFDA submission and the general release. There is one minor difference that could be partially relevant here, which is that I believe that the PrecisionFDA results were generated with --min_mapping_quality=1 where our default for DV1.0-1.5 is min_mapping_quality=5. We generally don't see a large accuracy improvement from that, though. The precisionFDA submission does not have additional filtering, and reflects the output of DeepVariant from the model as occurs with other versions. . One thing to note for fluctuations between precision and recall is that much of the difference can be exactly where on the ROC the model is chosen. If you would like higher recall, it may be possible to use the PL values to set a threshold below the no-call/RefCall threshold. Does this answer your question?

For more information on the inputs to DeepVariant, see: [our blog looking through DeepVariant's eyes](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2020-02-20-looking-through-deepvariants-eyes/). DeepVariant will incorporate the strand information as a part of its estimation for the confidence in the variant call (e.g. in the QUAL field and the GQ value). The GQ value is the best-calibrated value to use for filtering or evaluation. DeepVariant doesn't annotate the supporting information in the VCF, so if you want to directly access the support for strand, you will need to run some other program to annotate the VCF with the BAM information. For strand, realignment is unlikely to have a noticeable effect, as it will change the coordinates of read positions (and when doing so may alter which reads overlap a variant position), but it will not alter the forward or reverse orientation of a read.

I think it'd be helpful if you can share individual gVCF calls for the problematic site before merging (hopefully with a fewer number of samples) so that we can try to reproduce it. As you said we'll have to ask GLnexus maintainers about this issue.; I found this issue on the GLnexus repo https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus/issues/286 - I'd recommend adding a reproducible example there as well. About the PASS filter, if your downstream application explicitly requires having that filter value, I'd recommend using tools like `bcftools` to add it. I think `bcftools annotate --rename-annots` would work based on this page, using `FILTER/. PASS` as the mapping: https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#annotate. Thank you.

This operation is handled by DeepVariant.; 2. There are two arguments being passed here: `--make_examples_extra_args=""split_skip_reads=true, channels=''`; - `--make_examples_extra_args=""split_skip_reads=true` - Turns on operation that splits reads.

Can you clarify - are all of these variants listed considered false positives or just the first two (low coverage) sites?. `GQ` assesses genotype quality. It will be correlated with depth, but is also impacted by other factors, and as you see the `GQ` can still be high even for some variants with low depth. Can you apply filteres that target low depth or missingness?. For example:. * Filter sites with high missing rates (e.g. > 20% of samples with a `./.`).; * Filter sites where the average depth per sample is < 5.; * Do you expect higher coverage at these sites based on your WES setup? You can also consider filtering for sites that your WES assay is expected to capture.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/645#issuecomment-1542581479

However, internal phasing does not permit the output of phased variants due to the operation being limited to 25,000 base regions at a time, with no synchronization between these regions. * From version 1.4 onwards, DeepVariant internally handles read phasing, eliminating the need for external phasing to attain the anticipated accuracy. * If desired, one may opt to run third-party phasing after executing DeepVariant.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/649#issuecomment-1551634414

There have been a number of changes to DeepVariant over releases. However, I don't think we've deeply revisited the timing advantages between CPU and GPU. I think that in our investigations, we see that in the GCP machines we use CPU instances still have some degree of cost advantage relative to GPU. I agree that it's likely we're not optimally using the GPU, and I don't think we've specifically optimized for higher utilization of it. Although that's something we could look more into over time, right now we're prioritizing other feature improvements. . For GPUs, how do you consider Parabricks as an option? I believe that with their most recent release, they will be able to run v1.5. For the optimization of GPU performance, I expect they are much better in using the GPU than our out-of-the-box code. By the way, $100/sample seems high to me relative to our current experience. I hope that might be a function of the older method being Call-Phase-Call. If you have new benchmarks for this I would be curious to know.

Thank you both for the detailed statistics background information. For PEPPER - we're now not using the code from that approach and instead are using the make_examples logic in DeepVariant.

Improving GPU utilization is an area we could make progress on. However, the skill profile of the team will allow us to do the work, but not as quickly as for groups that have more experience optimizing GPU performance. As a result, we don't feel that our team's leverage is as high for that work as opposed to other projects. We may get to it eventually, but it will probably remain lower priority. @pgrosu Thank you for the I/O profile.

What I'm seeing above is something quite interesting. The execution seems heavy on [eager execution rather than graph execution](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/08/code-with-eager-execution-run-with-graphs.html), which could be the culprit.

With respect to the mechanics of DeepVariant - You can merge a BAM file with multiple read groups or from several files with the same read group. When you do so, if there is only one Sample among these files (specifically, all read groups have the same SM: value), DeepVariant will call all of them together, and will use that sample name for the VCF header field. If the read groups have more than one Sample, DeepVariant will give an error. If you really need to run on that file even so, there is a flag you can provide to apply a sample name to the BAM.

First, DeepVariant has a very low confidence in this call. The GQ of 4 corresponds to a 40% chance of being incorrect. Interestingly, the second most likely call at this position according to DeepVariant is 0/0 (HomRef). This is in spite of a 0.27 variant allele frequency (something that most callers would probably consider as either 0/0 HomRef or 0/1 HET). . This is an indication that DeepVariant may think that one of the haplotypes (either the Ref one or the Alt one) are unreliable (e.g. that they are reads which map from a different part of the genome), but doesn't know which to consider. Some other lines of evidence DeepVariant might use for that is the higher coverage (1200 is a coverage that would often be seen in duplicated parts of the genome) and the unusual allele frequency ratio (70% Ref, 30% Alt). Another piece of evidence we can't see but DeepVariant may use is the Insert Size channel if this is Illumina data. . A few questions -. 1) What is the sequencing technology used here, and which type of instrument. Is this PacBio or Illumina here? ; 2) Is this some form of panel sequencing targeting the region? . One suggestion to try (especially if this is panel short read sequencing) - downsample the region to ~80-100 coverage and see if the call changes. Especially look for the GQ confidence to go up as 4 is very low. If you want to avoid such situations more, you might want to put a higher GQ threshold for downstream filtering, and for a specific case like this look for cases where the PL values show higher probability for HOMREF and ALT than HET. A GQ threshold of 10 would be a 90% probability the call is correct, a GQ threshold of 20 would be a 99% threshold. .

Below is what I have:. ```; $ cat /usr/lib/llvm-11/lib/cmake/llvm/LLVMConfig.cmake | grep PACKAGE_VERSION; set(LLVM_PACKAGE_VERSION 11.1.0); $ cat /usr/lib/llvm-11/cmake/LLVMConfig.cmake | grep PACKAGE_VERSION; set(LLVM_PACKAGE_VERSION 11.1.0); $ cat /lib/llvm-11/cmake/LLVMConfig.cmake | grep PACKAGE_VERSION; cat: /lib/llvm-11/cmake/LLVMConfig.cmake: No such file or directory; $; ```. If you have a mismatch between the version and config, you can make a clean removal of `llvm` via the following:. ```; sudo apt-get remove llvm-11*; ```. The way clif is installed is via the following:. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh; sudo tools/build_clif.sh; ```. Let me know what you see.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/657#issuecomment-1575894236:335,Usability,simpl,simplify,335,"This is very good! . #### For Singularity . You can take a look at the following two links:. https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deeptrio-quick-start.md#notes-on-singularity. https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/scripts/install_singularity.sh. #### For your Ubuntu instance . You are getting very close! To simplify the install in the `run-prereq.sh` file you can comment out (with the `#` symbol) the following sections:. 1) For the ""Install TensorFlow pip package"" keep only the ones with **CPU-only**, and comment out the others. 2) For ""Install CUDA"", comment out everthing. 3) For ""Install TensorRT"", comment out everthing. And then run it again. The rest of the errors in the `run-prereq.sh` are easy to fix, which we can do later individually by removing each one, and installing the minimum required version. Before we fix `clif`, could you tell me what you get for the following:. ```; lsb_release -sc. wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | apt-key add - . add-apt-repository ""deb http://apt.llvm.org/$(lsb_release -sc)/ llvm-toolchain-$(lsb_release -sc)-11 main"". sudo apt-get update. sudo apt-get install -y llvm-11 llvm-11-dev clang-11 llvm-11-tools; ```.

Your zip files will be under the `bazel-bin/deepvariant/`. The `zip` files will require some patching, which I can show you once you have a successful built of the above. The output of a successful build should look something like this:. ```; ...; bazel-bin/deepvariant/postprocess_variants; bazel-bin/deepvariant/postprocess_variants.zip; bazel-bin/deepvariant/runtime_by_region_vis; bazel-bin/deepvariant/runtime_by_region_vis.zip; bazel-bin/deepvariant/show_examples; bazel-bin/deepvariant/show_examples.zip; bazel-bin/deepvariant/vcf_stats_report; bazel-bin/deepvariant/vcf_stats_re",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/657#issuecomment-1581784104

Just a note, you will require several GB of space for this to work. The DeepVariant zip files we eventually get will be quite small. (The zip files are basically Python scripts and bytecode with a compiled shared library.). Regarding what's missing or incompatible during the build, we will let the compiler tell us that, which will make it a bit easier to troubleshoot. Just to be sure we minimize surprises, we will do a couple of things first. To ensure the TensorFlow code we will compile against is of the same version as the TensorFlow python package (2.11.0), run the following in your `git clone` TensorFlow folder (the assumption is that your TensorFlow folder is outside your DeepVariant one):. ```; # Assuming you are in the DeepVariant directory. cd ../tensorflow; git checkout origin/r2.11 -f. # Here configure like before with the defaults; ./configure. cd ../deepvariant; ```. Once in the DeepVariant directory, perform each of these separately so we can isolate any issues:. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r1.5/.bazelrc. bazel build -c opt ${DV_COPT_FLAGS} --build_python_zip :binaries; ```.

As @kishwarshafin indicates, when you visualize the Insertion and Deletion items, you'll see these events. . However, this is only part of the story. It looks to me like these are two equivalent ways of representing the same variant. The underlying event is that one chain of Cs is one longer and another chain of As is one shorter. This can be represented as a C -> A SNP event, or as a deletion of A and an insertion of C. The issue is that the mapper is not consistently choosing a representation for the reads. For Illumina data, DeepVariant would perform its own realignment and make a representation that is consistent within itself. But we don't do that realignment step for DeepVariant. I suspect, but have not validated, that example here relates to the use of homopolymer compression by minimap. That is, the AA in the reference is represented as only a single A during mapping, which can cause the location of the deletion not to get reconciled. It may be possible to fix this by mapping the sample with the --preset HiFi flag (which now does not use homopolymer compression).

I have reviewed my files and reconfigured my IGV. As @AndrewCarroll mentioned, this anomaly is that two different representations of a varaint. While both representations are equivalent, I believe that people might prefer a simpler representation here (e.g., homozygous SNV instead of three heterozygous varaints). Do you have any recommendations for post-processing methods to normalize these types of varaints into a single representation? Alternatively, can DeepVariant introduce more advanced models or encoding methods to handle this situation?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/660#issuecomment-1590364272
https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/660#issuecomment-1590741602:170,Deployability,rolling,rolling,170,"Hi @PengJia6 . Please see ; ![This IGV screenshot](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/583711/1a448812-6b85-4614-bbda-6504595a50af). which shows the reads after rolling back to FASTQ and mapping with different parameters (top row) versus the original alignments (bottom row) for one of the samples. You can see the top row has a consistent representation in the reads. I mapped these with pbmm2 using `--preset HiFi`. However, you should be able to replicate this effect in minimap using the flag `-ax map-hifi`. If remapping is an option, this will be the cleanest way to improve these cases. If you are considering remapping, I want to mention that we recommend mapping to a version of GRCh38 without ALT contigs (for example [GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta.gz](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/references/GRCh38/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta.gz). We observe this to have higher accuracy across technologies, but it makes an especially large difference for long read technologies. I also note that you are using DeepVariant v1.1, but your BAM files don't have HaplotypePhase labels from running WhatsHap. Before version v1.4, we recommend a 2 step process of call-phase-call with WhatsHap in the middle for phasing. At version v1.4 and later, we started to do the phasing within DeepVariant, eliminating the need for this.

There are non-human species for which we know DeepVariant works well,for example [rice](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/analyzing-3024-rice-genomes-characterized-by-deepvariant),. You are correct that with a good long-read dataset it should be possible to train a short read DeepVariant method. If you are able to make those data and reference available, we could try it. There are two things to keep an eye on when assessing whether DeepVariant will work well for your samples. First, keep an eye that runtime doesn't get unreasonable. DeepVariant runs per-site, which scales linearly with number of variant positions. . The second, is to look if there are many cases where DeepVariant is calling many variants as 0/0 which have high support for the alternate allele. It's possible that a high variant density will resemble the signature of copy number variation in humans and since humans don't have much variation relative to the reference, it may become hesitant to call such variants. Really the only way to know is to try and then do some QC on the results.

BAI is an R-tree approach, while PBI seems to be HDF5-like -- basically different formats. Regarding the error you see is because your BAM and reference don't match in their sequence contig names.

BAI is an R-tree approach, while PBI seems to be HDF5-like -- basically different formats. Regarding the error you see is because your BAM and reference don't match in their sequence contig names.

This collection of trained kernels is what the PacBio model contains. So now to answer the two questions in order:. 1) If you think of the PacBio model retaining previously seen (trained) regions of portions of the channels, it will go through the kernel transformation pooled across the channels to determine the probabilities of genotypes. The highest value will be used to Phred-scale the GQ value. So it's a bit more complex as the sub-slices are taken across a 100 x 199 region for 6 channels, rather than just a 100 x 1 (where the majority ref-representation of alleles reside), but that will also have an impact in the matrix calculations of probabilities of most represented genotype. 2) Now if the probability is low, then the mod",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/666#issuecomment-1604221424

The last question I might raise is: What is your intention to have those positions added to the VCF by default and not as a opt-in option. To me it sound rather counterintuitive because I would argue that the majority of use-cases do not need those positions and/or removed them in downstream-analysis.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/666#issuecomment-1612282088:854,Safety,detect,detect,854,"Hi @Npaffen,. To expand a bit on my previous explanation, regarding the way you can view a variant coming from a neural network is through the idea of preserving $`information`$ $`propagation`$. You saw the previous description of how the different channels get encoded, but let's start with a simpler version. Let say you have a one-line matrix with the following columns:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/d46a3924-2ea4-4b92-8c9c-9fcc29bb7219). This could denote a simplified version of your read base representation, where you notice the middle denotes the variant, and the last column the channel it represents. Now I want to create new types of data from this, which will help me with identifying unique areas of patterns within it. This could be of the form of transformation of the values to ranges that are easier to detect differences among columns. One of these can be dividing all the values by 10, and labeling that channel 2. In this transformation, 10 represents a kernel I described previously and the output is a new feature map (a transformed matrix that helps with detecting unique features based on the numerical representation). Now the data would look like this:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/e52786fd-00b8-4dc9-ad60-c400a30b0f79). Now imagine I create different transformations of these rows, to expand on specific areas among these values where intriguing patterns might emerge. Suppose I create 5 different transformations having then 5 channels with multiple copies of each row, in order to have a fuller dataset that mimics the number of reads.

You saw the previous description of how the different channels get encoded, but let's start with a simpler version. Let say you have a one-line matrix with the following columns:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/d46a3924-2ea4-4b92-8c9c-9fcc29bb7219). This could denote a simplified version of your read base representation, where you notice the middle denotes the variant, and the last column the channel it represents. Now I want to create new types of data from this, which will help me with identifying unique areas of patterns within it. This could be of the form of transformation of the values to ranges that are easier to detect differences among columns. One of these can be dividing all the values by 10, and labeling that channel 2. In this transformation, 10 represents a kernel I described previously and the output is a new feature map (a transformed matrix that helps with detecting unique features based on the numerical representation). Now the data would look like this:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/e52786fd-00b8-4dc9-ad60-c400a30b0f79). Now imagine I create different transformations of these rows, to expand on specific areas among these values where intriguing patterns might emerge. Suppose I create 5 different transformations having then 5 channels with multiple copies of each row, in order to have a fuller dataset that mimics the number of reads. This data is multi-dimensional as it contains different values of X. This can be pretty hard to interpret, but we can collapse these differences to a 2D representation using [t-SNE plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) to visualize these differences.

This helps me understand which channels (feature maps) might be similar, or different. Now if we look at the heatmap for the original data it would look something like this (notice the variant in the middle):. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/858f235a-79d1-4fdb-bfad-a9ee79ade41a).

Now comes the fun part! Let's have different matrices (like the ones that generated the new channels above) that will identify interesting features that might expose one type of a genotype or another with confidence. Imagine that instead of dividing by 10, I find the values (matrices) that best helps separate the data in a BAM file I know should have specific variants at specific loci. I want to maximize that precision to be able to recall. Now you notice that the original data and transformations (feature maps) are linked preserving this $`propagation`$ $`of`$ $`information`$, as this flow of information is enabled through these sets of transformations. An interesting thing then begins to emerge as you move up the layers of transformation. For example, early on in the neural network's set of transformations you will see patterns like this:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/bc3cff8b-efa8-4029-abbe-75ad06973d24).

I believe you must be running DeepVariant on the 40 single samples and then GLnexus on the gVCF output as recommended in our best practices. The sample name that occurs in the gVCF file comes from the sample name in the BAM file tag. (as @pgrosu suggests, that should be what follows the `SM:` tag from the output of `samtools view -H ${CRAM} | grep SM`. DeepVariant should take that value as its sample name. DeepVariant should raise an error if a single BAM file has multiple sample names, suggesting that if these files were able to run through and produce output, they should be using the reads appropriately. . In either case, you can tell DeepVariant to over-ride any sample names present in a file and produce output from all reads with a sample name provided by you as a user.

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/671#issuecomment-1610040880:264,Availability,Error,Error,264,"Hi @geng-lee,. Just to expand on a few things. To understand the impact of the information, you would need to look at each one individually, for example:. - $`GQ`$ $`(genotype`$ $`quality)`$: Tells you the genotype is incorrect using a Phred-scaled $`-10*log_{10}(Error)`$ value. So with low error you will get a higher score -- a higher score you are confident the call is correct. In this case your highest is 19, which is borderline for DeepVariant which has it at 20.

This basically makes the output directory visible from within the running Docker container, so that the results are available after Docker completes its run. $`2)`$ Next define the `FQ` variable, as it seems to be referenced as `$FQ`, but I'm not seeing it defined. If it is already defined previously, then that's fine. If you have multiple lines, you will need to also add the backslash `\` as follows, so that the command doesn't get started before the last line gets pasted:. ```; sudo docker run \; -v ""${INPUT_DIR}"":""/input"" \; -v ""${OUTPUT_DIR}"":""/output"" \; google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; /opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant \; --model_type=WES \; --ref=/input/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta \; --reads=/input/$FQ.align.sort.marked.bam \; --output_vcf=/output/$FQ.vcf.gz \; --output_gvcf=/output/$FQ.g.vcf.gz \; --num_shards=2 ; ```.

That seems a bit small compared to other WES BAM files, which are between 5 - 10 GB:. https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001005247/files. The disk space seems okay, though you have some memory-mapped file-systems, which should be okay if you have a good amount of memory. . Memory on Ubuntu can be checked with `cat /proc/meminfo` or (`top`). For example, when I ran the variant candidate selection, on just a small region of a chromosome and monitored memory usage, I saw the following trend:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/7e200851-3fde-4ad6-bf75-477ccefb9e32). You'll notice that it can be resource intensive. This is the reason I was opting we troubleshoot by first trying with a smaller region of a chromosome using `--regions`, ideally one you know variants should be present. A preliminary check with `samtools view -c BAM REGION` would ensure you have mapped reads there for DeepVariant to find, and with `samtools flagstat` to check on that subregion for the number of quality reads. .

https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/675#issuecomment-1651377100:340,Performance,load,load,340,"Hi Fra,. If it cannot find candidates, that happens during the `make_examples` stage. `make_examples` goes through an allele counter, and very sensitive variant caller to determine if there is enough read support for a candidate. Was the same genome (fasta) used for the alignment phase (from fastq) when generating the BAM files? When you load your BAM file in IGV to how many chromosomes and chromosomal regions does it show alignment for? . In the [quickstart tutorial](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md#run-deepvariant-with-one-command) it uses the WGS model not the WES one (as indicated by `--model_type=WES` above). Also I believe your BAM file is only 300 Mb, which a bit small compared to other WES ones:. https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001005247/files. Is your dataset a WES or WGS dataset? .

DeepVariant is trained to assess probabilities of diploid models, and its training data is diploid with some likely minor subclonal acquired variants. We've found that for diploid genomes, the output probabilities (represented as GQ values) are very well calibrated against the empirical error probability, and so are highly informative with respect to the quality of a call. . Subclonal variants will not look like the signature of true germline variants in a diploid organism, and so will not be likely to be assigned a high probability of a variant call. However, it is also the case that subclonal variants will not look like the signature of the noise-derived errors typical for rejected calls. As a result, it could be the case that the probabilities for the genotype classes for REF (0/0) or No-Call (./.) are informative in a manner you could use. DeepVariant will nominate candidates and write output for any SNP site that has the following properties: At least 2 non-variant alleles of a given candidate and a frequency of 0.12 or higher.

That's good, and that just tells you that there might be high GQ regions of possible correct calls, which you need to validate. Now what you want is to determine the stationary areas of variation, which would not fall within noise signatures. As Andrew mentioned, you want to look at GQ regions with their VAF, and begin to stratify confidence regions backed up by good alignment of reads (IGV, or your favorite browser). Then you want to determine what regions of high-confidence with stable high GQ (correct call) mean in terms of VAF genotype regions, which might look like this (but not exactly):. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/0847f683-8d69-4bb6-a6d4-eddd7e166993).

It is extremely irritating. . @pgrosu I know about sam format (reasonably well) but my point is that I have seen that pop up a lot in my experiment, the same state of character called with high confidence in parts of the reads, and with low confidence in other parts of the reads. There might (might) be something in this genome that throws off the tools we have. My guess is that it's the high heterozygosity distributed all across the chromosomes. It's somehow disappointing to see the problem reappears here with HiFi reads, I was hoping to get rid of it when ditching Illumina, and using the HiFi to model the calling errors of the Illumina (which in itself is immensely ambitious). . I have a plan B, which is assembling genomes de novo, we have good results. Will it have the accuracy needed? That's the big question. EDIT: do you personally trust, based on the evidence presented here, there is a clone of low frequency?

So sorry about that. I apologize @Joe-r-code ; - We are going to do high coverage ONT sequencing, which should allow for a better SNP calling. If it works well, would you be interested to train DeepVariant on my data set? That would make it able to manage high heterozygous genomes. You have been very helpful and I really appreciated it. So, I think we could plan to collaborate on training deepvariant on a highly heterozygous genome with many paralogs?

Basically, this all happens when the candidates are selected during the `make_examples` stage:. $`1)`$ DP (read depth) is set from the total allele counts [in this line](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/deepvariant/variant_calling.cc#L307):. ```Python; nucleus::SetInfoField(kDPFormatField, TotalAlleleCounts(allele_count), call);; ```. $`2)`$ In the `make_examples` stage, a tensor image (set of matrices) representing information about your reads gets created. That tensor is usually preinitialized with zeros (0), and then the values get updated with the read information for the rows. The first 5 rows are the reference representation anyway, before it gets populated with your read representation starting with row 6. Then this tensor gets processed through the model $`-`$ during the `call_variants` stage $`-`$ generating the genotype probabilities for: homozygous ref, het, and homozygous alt. $`3)`$ Then in `postprocess_variants` $`-`$ based on the most likely genotype (having the maximum genotype probability) from step $`2`$ $`-`$ the [`compute_filter_fields()`](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/deepvariant/postprocess_variants.py#L170-L190) function assigns the `PASS` or `RefCall` for the `FILTER` column of the VCF file. $`4)`$ If you want to filter out these low depth candidates, you can adjust this via the `--make_examples_extra_args=`, by setting some or all of the following parameters to your preference (notice the the default count is already 2, which you are obvserving):. * vsc_min_count_snps (the default is 2); * vsc_min_count_indels (the default is 2); * vsc_min_fraction_snps (the default is 0.12); * vsc_min_fraction_indels (the default is 0.06); * vsc_min_fraction_multiplier (the default is 1.0).

DeepVariant I don't believe has the models trained for that, as it is usually geared for autosomal DNA. So, if you just want a VCF file without the large amount of analysis that is required for dealing with mtDNA, you can use the mitochondria mode of Mutect2 in GATK like this, which performs a lot of it for you:; ; ```; gatk Mutect2 \; -R reference.fa \; -L chrM \; --mitochondria-mode \; -I mitochondria.bam \; -O mitochondria.vcf.gz; ```.

So there is both a parent and child model that was created, through which the tensor image (generated from your reads) is fed to provide inference about your child or parent variation. The reason you will need to run it again is because these models were trained with the assumption that the child resides in the middle between the two parents, as in the pileup image shown below. With such a trained configuration, your data would also need to be formatted with the same tensor configuration -- as provided through your assignments -- as it would be most informative when calling using the child model with the parents providing the supporting evidence -- and vice versa when processing the tensor through the parent model:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/080684de-68b9-4f8b-8c45-1625484d96af).

Now just look in your VCF file for the region in question, and try to confirm with what you see in IGV using the realigned BAMs. For example, you had the following variant the last time:. chr15 | 41570158 | . | T | C | 6.5 | PASS | . | GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL | 0/1:7:23:14,9:0.391304:5,0,46; -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --. Do you still see that variant in your current VCF file, and do the number of variations match (or exceed because of base quality) in IGV for that position? Given the counts for the alternate allele (C) the last time, it would need to have been at least 9, but I just see 1 in your picture. Does the VCF this time also reflect 1 (or less), or does it still say 9 for the alternate allele (C) as the last time?. Basically the numbers have to confirm each other between the realigned BAM and current VCF if realignment has been performed for that region, or the original BAM and current VCF if no realignment was performed for that region. Ideally as a first pass check multiple regions to be sure, but start with our original variant (T/C at chr15:41570158) as a known starting point.

This is possibly because most of the decoy contigs are excluded by default through the following file (because of possible large incorrect mappings):. https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/deepvariant/exclude_contigs.py. More of this is discussed in [issue 37](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/37). In this situation, besides trying with GRCh38 -- which could be a good check -- some of your reads probably have better alignment to the decoy contigs with suboptimal alignment to chromosome Y (or vice-versa). One thing you could try is to indirectly determine the sex of the sample via a threshold that compares differences between allele depth (AD) and depth of coverage (DP) across variants in the sample. If that is not enough (in case they are equal), then a comparison between GQ and QUAL might provide better granularity. The idea is that suboptimal vs optimal read alignments for chrY might work as an inference of sex. For this to work, you would need to create a test and validation set of samples where the sex is known to extract what the threshold would be. I'm assuming these are not in the pseudo-autosomal (PAR) regions, as both chrX and chrY are identical in the PAR regions of the genome assembly. As a last resort you can rename the decoys in your BAM and reference with something different than the ones in the excluded file, so that they would be included in the VCF.

A GPU has many more baskets, but containing fewer, more specialized functions. A high-end CPU can have 64 cores (baskets), while a nice high-end GPU can have between 2,560-16,384. Thus a GPU can operate on a specialized set of functions much faster in parallel, but with one caveat. The thing is that your program would need to be coded and compiled for a GPU. DeepVariant only can utilize 1 GPU for the middle stage (`call_variants`) of the three stages, as the other two (`make_examples` and `postprocess_variants`) are single-threaded (meaning they are CPU-based). Regarding the compute instance of EC2, that is a high-end one, but you need to experiment to see what works for you and is within your budget. DeepVariant can also utilize a lot of memory depending on what stage it is running, and how much of the genome your are covering.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/696#issuecomment-1679300379

But somethings confused me again, for example, my research topic is about repeat times in the NGS data, and my original intention in using Deepvariant is to detect the sequencing noise and delete them or find the true data in noised data. However ,what I saw is that the Deepvariant only can print one mutation such like following string:. chx xxxxxx .	TAAA	T	1.6	RefCall	.	GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL	./.:5:490:36,81:0.165306:0,3,25. This is very contrary to common sense, because in this loci it have at least 490 reads to cover it (it maybe more because Deepvariant can't recognize all reads due to empty align), Deepvariant only give one mutation that is TAAA to T, but when I open IGV to focus on the loci, it shows that they are more than one mutation, in fact, it's far more than one mutation. I mentioned in the previous paragraph that I am very grateful for your reply because you give me one tip is that :"" Keep in mind, the pileup images for DeepVariant are ~100 reads, so it will randomly down-sample from the reads to fit into the maximum of the allowed pileup image."" So I think maybe what confuse me is that Deepvariant only can detect 100x depth data? or somethings else I can do to detect truth sequence data in NGS data?.

Make sure to create the `realigned_reads` directory first, by adding the following line to your script, below your first `mkdir` statement:. `mkdir -p ""${OUTPUT_DIR}/realigned_reads""` . After you relaunch the script, the BAM file(s) representing that region would be the one you would use in IGV. $`2)`$ Now given that, there would still be a lot of reads in that region for the allele counter to create candidates from. You have below the 1,500 maximum read depth, as noted in the following [FAQ section](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/FAQ.md#how-are-ad-and-dp-values-calculated), but quite a few seem to still remain. You noticed that only 490 appear supporting that position, and DeepVariant is position-specific. If the quality of the allele is low those are not used. For example, your GQ here is 5 to support the variant, and your QUAL 1.5, which tells me there is no variant and the error is 32% of it being that variant. It would also help to check your gVCF as that contains everything. Also if there are multiple deletions at the same location it determines the deletions with the highest read support, and deletes all other deletions from the allele map. $`4)`$ There are additional cutoffs for the type of candidates it selects. If you want to adjust thresholds for specific types of candidates, you can adjust this via the `--make_examples_extra_args=`, by setting some or all of the following parameters to your preference:. * vsc_min_count_snps (the default is 2); * vsc_min_count_indels (the default is 2); * vsc_min_fraction_snps (the default is 0.12); * vsc_min_fraction_indels (the default is 0.06); * vsc_min_fraction_multiplier (the default is 1.0). Here is an example:. ```; --make_examples_extra_args='vsc_min_count_snps=3,vsc_min_count_indels=3,vsc_min_fraction_snps=0.12,vsc_min_fraction_indels=0.06'; ```.

So DeepVariant first picks candidates by going through the regions of the genome you specify, and are also in your BAM file. Now given those candidates, it then picks data from your reads of roughly ~100 positions on each side of your variant (actually it is 199) to build an image to run through the prediction model. Information that is collected for building that image, is things such as the read base, base quality, if the read supports the variant, etc., all which you can read in [the following blog](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2020-02-20-looking-through-deepvariants-eyes/). For each of these pieces of information it can only fit 100 rows of it, as the model operates optimally with only a height of ~100, and was trained as such. So the model is only used to infer your GT with the supporting GQ, as the candidates are already selected before it even gets to the prediction portion of DeepVariant. . $`5)`$ Since you're trying to find the true candidates among noisy data, you have the option of running known truth candidates with different gradations of noise to determine what your parameters and thresholds for those parameters should be. Some of that could be done with some preprocessing of your BAM files or reads, if you know specific parameters that your data should exhibit. Regarding truth candidates, you can look at the list of samples that were used to train DeepVariant:. https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-details-training-data.md. Given those samples you can simulate or vary the reads to determine the effect on the prediction of known variants, where you would also explore the parameter space for optimization.
