(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded. Check the changes in this PR to ensure they won't cause issues with your project. ------------. **Note:** *You are seeing this because you or someone else with access to this repository has authorized Snyk to open fix PRs.*.

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14366:265,Performance,perform,perform,265,"I assessed three query options, but keep in mind that the database is currently at nearly 100% CPU so these timings are high variance. I'm honestly pretty surprised that the first one isn't the fastest. It seems to me like the obvious SQL query and yet it does not perform as well as those using lateral joins. Option 2 and Option 3 both use lateral joins. Option 2 uses a LEFT JOIN followed by a `WHERE ... IS NOT NULL` which is definitionally an `INNER JOIN`. For that reason, I also explored Option 3, directly using `INNER JOIN`, which appears to be very slightly faster and lower variance. | Option | Timing (mean + stddev, in seconds) |; |--------|------------------------------------|; | 1 | 9.92 +- 2.02 |; | 2 | 5.35 +- 1.87 |; | 3 | 5.11 +- 1.15 |. ## Option 1; ```; SELECT DISTINCT; group_resources.batch_id,; group_resources.update_id,; group_resources.job_group_id; FROM job_group_inst_coll_cancellable_resources AS group_resources; INNER JOIN job_group_self_and_ancestors AS descendant; ON descendant.batch_id = group_resources.batch_id; AND descendant.job_group_id = group_resources.job_group_id; INNER JOIN job_groups_cancelled AS cancelled; ON descendant.batch_id = cancelled.id; AND descendant.ancestor_id = cancelled.job_group_id; ORDER BY group_resources.batch_id desc, group_resources.update_id desc, group_resources.job_group_id desc; LIMIT 1000;; ```; ```; 1000 rows in set (11.81 sec); 1000 rows in set (8.91 sec); 1000 rows in set (11.86 sec); 1000 rows in set (7.08 sec); ```; ## Option 2; ```; SELECT DISTINCT; group_resources.batch_id,; group_resources.update_id,; group_resources.job_group_id; FROM job_group_inst_coll_cancellable_resources AS group_resources; LEFT JOIN LATERAL (; SELECT; 1 AS cancelled; FROM job_group_self_and_ancestors AS descendant; INNER JOIN job_groups_cancelled AS cancelled; ON descendant.batch_id = cancelled.id; AND descendant.ancestor_id = cancelled.job_group_id; WHERE descendant.batch_id = group_resources.batch_id; AND descendant.job_group_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14366

Most stored procedures take either a shared or exclusive lock on a relevant row of the `jobs` table near the start of the procedure, but not all. This appears to interact poorly with the `attempts_after_update` trigger as it attempts to take an exclusive lock on rows in the `jobs` table in the below join with the attempt resources tables. It's not clear exactly what the right fix is. It should be simple enough not to join on the jobs table in the `FOR UPDATE`, but we should also evaluate when in our various transactions a lock should be taken on the jobs table and whether it should be an X or S lock. ### Version. 0.2.128. ### Relevant log output. ```shell; ------------------------; LATEST DETECTED DEADLOCK; ------------------------; 2024-02-29 15:07:05 140331971655424; *** (1) TRANSACTION:; TRANSACTION 2486515, ACTIVE 0 sec inserting; mysql tables in use 27, locked 27; LOCK WAIT 16 lock struct(s), heap size 1128, 9 row lock(s), undo log entries 1; MySQL thread id 703, OS thread handle 140330830395136, query id 4745489 10.32.3.39 dgoldste-batch-user executing; INSERT INTO aggregated_billing_project_user_resources_v3 (billing_project, user, resource_id, token, `usage`); SELECT cur_billing_project, cur_user,; attempt_resources.deduped_resource_id,; rand_token,; msec_diff_rollup * quantity; FROM attempt_resources; WHERE attempt_resources.batch_id = NEW.batch_id AND attempt_resources.job_id = NEW.job_id AND attempt_id = NEW.attempt_id; FOR UPDATE; ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE `usage` = aggregated_billing_project_user_resources_v3.`usage` + msec_diff_rollup * quantity. *** (1) HOLDS THE LOCK(S):; RECORD LOCKS space id 351 page no 4 n bits 248 index PRIMARY of table `dgoldste-batch`.`instances_free_cores_mcpu` trx id 2486515 lock_mode X locks rec but not gap; Record lock, heap no 176 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 4; compact format; info bits 0; 0: len 30; hex 62617463682d776f726b65722d64676f6c647374652d7374616e64617264; asc batch-worker-dgoldste-standard; (total ",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14380

This set of changes started out as refactoring and trying to better understand `extract.scala`. But the bigger change ended up being getting rid of AggLet in favor of allowing bindings in `Let` to be agg/scan bindings. So each binding in a `Let` now has a binding scope, encoded using the pre-existing `Scope` enum. I also renamed `Let` to `Block`. While I think that's a better name for what `Let` has become, and what I hope it will further become in the future, I initially tried to keep the name `Let`. I changed it so that I could keep `Let.apply` the way it is, specialized to bindings all in the eval scope.

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14410:601,Testability,log,log,601,"### What happened?. The current query code uses `EXISTS` and `IN` to check whether a batch / job / job group has a particular attribute. This is extremely slow especially for queries that have a lot of matches. The fix for this is to use a `LEFT JOIN LATERAL`. However, by adding a new optional table join, I believe the code has to be more complicated than it currently is because there's a second WHERE clause. Note that the fix needs to be applied to both v1 and v2 queries. .

For each partition in the refinement, we want to read in the corresponding range from the appropriate input partition, then we want to group the partitions in the refinement to match the new partitioner. The code finds ""the appropriate input partition"" by taking the first input partition which overlaps the refinement partition, using `lowerBoundInterval`. That works if there is only one overlapping input partition, but here fails, since the refinement partition `[5, 8]` overlaps both input partitions. So the code mistakenly reads from the input partition `[1, 5]` to produce the refinement partition `[5, 8]`, and so completely drops all rows in the input `[5, 8]`. In practice, I think the most likely way to run into this (and the way it was found by a user) is to have a dataset keyed by `[""locus"", ""alleles""]`, which has split multi-allelics, so there are multiple rows with the same locus. Then shorten the key to `[""locus""]`, write the dataset to disk, and read it back with a different partitioning, e.g. by passing a `_n_partitions` argument to `read_table` or `read_matrix_table`. For instance, if the partitioning was originally `[ [{1:1, [""A""]}, {1:500, [""G""]}), [{1:500, [""G""]}, {1:1000, [""C""]}] ]`, then after shortening the key it would be `[ [1:1, 1:500], [1:500, 1:1000] ]`. Notice that even though the original partitioning had no overlap, it does after shortening the key, because rows with locus `1:500` with alleles less than `[""G""]` are allowed in the first partition, so we have to make the right endpoint inclusive after shortening. You would then need to write this rekeyed dataset to disk and read it back with different partitioning (note that `ds.repartition` is enough to do this in the batch backend). I still need to think through what holes in our testing allowed this to remain undetected for so long, and attempt to plug them. We should also plan for what to tell a user who is concerned they may have been affected by this in the past.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14420

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14432:467,Performance,concurren,concurrent,467,"In QoB, the Query Driver and all Query Worker jobs reside in the same batch. Currently, the Query Driver submits worker jobs and then waits for them to finish before collecting their results from GCS. The way it waits is by polling the status of the batch and waiting for the number of completed jobs to reach `n_total_jobs - 1` (to account for itself). This is both awkward and prevents a couple potentially valuable pieces of functionality: you cannot run multiple concurrent Query Drivers, and you cannot take advantage of Batch's `cancel_after_n_failures` functionality because you do not want to cancel the Query Driver itself. The introduction of job groups addresses both these problems, as the Query Driver can create a job group for the stage of worker jobs and then await its completion. This PR makes a job group for the query driver and then the query driver creates a nested job group per stage of workers that it creates. Utilizing `cancel_after_n_failures` to fail a stage early is future work.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14432

Select N ready jobs from the database to schedule on available workers; 2. Compute placement of a subset of the jobs in available slots in the worker pool; 3.

Using that information, load the full job spec from blob storage; 3. Spawn a task to run the job asynchronously; 4. Respond to the driver with a 200. The key point relevant to this issue is that the driver currently must wait for all the requests to workers in an iteration to complete before it starts the next iteration of the scheduler.

Batch does not guarantee that there is always at most 1 running attempt for a job at any given time. While rare, this double scheduling can sometimes happen so there is a background task that checks the database for ""orphaned"" attempts -- attempts that are running but are not noted as the current attempt for the relevant job -- and stops them to reduce wasted spend.
