https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/554:1023,Testability,Test,TestCase,1023,"nges; Hi all,; there is a little bug in the loading of the primal solution for the DiscAdjFluid Iteration for DualTimeStepping 1st order. ; 1. The solution for timestep n-1 should be loaded instead of n-2 -> I added an if statement there.; 2. solution_old is used as a temporary container for the freshly loaded solution. Then the solution which is currently at solution_time_n is pushed to be the ""main"" solution n+1. Afterwards the solution_old is put in the solution_time_n container -> That last step was wrong such that the loaded solution never gets involved. I used the regression test in disc_adj_rans/cylinder which covers DualTimeStepping 2nd order and reused it for a new Testcase which covers 1st order. ; For now, the .travis.yml has a different su2code/Testcases branch in it such that other are not hindered by this PR when running travis. If this PR is merged with the new Testcase, the TestCases repo has to be updated and the .travis.yml needs to be reverted. ; Let me know if adding a new TestCase is OK. I am aware that not every detail can get its own regression test. . I checked my changes against finite differences for that Testcase. I'll post the result below. Additionally I suppressed the output of .csv files in driver_structure.cpp for unsteady simulations if `WRT_CSV_SOL= NO` is set. .

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/581:535,Availability,avail,available,535,"Hey everyone, . Following the discussions at the SU2 Developers meeting this week, I wanted to start a conversation about compiling a comprehensive set of V&V cases for SU2 that can showcase it's performance in comparison to other solvers. . I think the the [NASA TMR website](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/index.html) is a good model to base it on. The idea would be to present the V&V case, provide working configuration and mesh files, and provide results comparing performance to other solvers and to higher fidelity data (when available). This allows people to see the performance of SU2 and replicate it, if need be. . The first step would be compiling a list of cases that should be covered. The [SU2 2014 SciTech paper](https://su2code.github.io/documents/SU2_AIAA_SciTech2014.pdf) would be a good starting point as it already had a couple of validation cases. This list can be bolstered with some of the NASA TMR cases, and with grid convergence studies. I would like to propose an initial list that the community can talk through and make changes as we see fit. I am mostly only familiar with canonical CFD flows that are used in these cases. But it would be great to have other cases, such as Turbo-machinary or FSI cases, that show the full breadth of SU2's abilities. This is by no means an exhaustive list:. 1. Zero Gradient Flat Plate; 2. 2D and 3D Bump in Channel; 3. Asymmetric Diffuser; 4. Backward facing step; 5. Unsteady Square cylinder; 6. NACA0012; 7. NACA4412 Trailing Edge Seperation; 8. Joukowski Airfoil; 9. 30P30N High Lift airfoil; 10. ONERAM6 Wing; 11. NASA CRM; 12. Subsonic and Supersonic Jets.

But it wasn't terminating when it should have. . After doing some digging through the code, I came across a comment in CDiscAdjFluidIteration::Iterate where it says that only residual convergence criterion is possible. . It would be super helpful to add this as a comment in the config_template itself so that people aren't trying to use the Cauchy convergence with the discrete adjoint. But on another note, is there a reason that the Cauchy convergence is not implemented for the Discrete adjoint? The code required for it is present in CIntergration::Convergence_Monitoring, but just the right input (su2double monitor) needs to be set when calling the Convergence_Monitoring function. . I can implement this, but wanted to check to see if there was a reason why Sens_Mach or Sens_AoA weren't already being used as Cauchy criterion. .

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/638:209,Availability,avail,available,209,"## Proposed Changes; The current PR serves two purposes. First, it extends the sliding interface capabilities for multi-zone fluid-fluid interfaces to incompressible flows. Until now, these features were only available for compressible flows. For example, take the following case of a viscous flow enclosed by diathermal walls and discretized using two different zones with a permeable, non-matching interface:. ![testcase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8706821/51894668-b6cee100-23a8-11e9-8ee8-4b3d846417b2.png); ![discretization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8706821/51894939-5e4c1380-23a9-11e9-8acb-8ac04d555e2b.png). With the current SU2 implementation, the solution diverges due to the lack of interface boundary conditions. After only 10 iterations, the contours of velocity are:. ![former](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8706821/51894620-99017c00-23a8-11e9-938a-d8b0e38fa141.png). With this PR, the problem can be successfully solved with a multizone solution process. The contours of velocity and temperature are now:. ![velocity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8706821/51894679-bdf5ef00-23a8-11e9-9466-d360fdc42733.png); ![temperature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8706821/51894683-bfbfb280-23a8-11e9-8ffe-1901b33677bf.png). and also for unsteady problems. ![unsteady](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8706821/51894695-c4846680-23a8-11e9-87f5-35041d71fee4.gif). For the latter case I haven’t yet rotated the inner circle, because there are some missing features for dynamic meshes in the incompressible solver. The previous test case for steady-state flows has been added.

This PR contains a complete refactoring of the point-to-point MPI infrastructure and an entirely new implementation of the periodic BC for the FV solvers. For the MPI refactoring:; - All calls are abstracted to parent classes (geometry, solver, matrix), meaning we will remove all Set_MPI_* routines.; - Point-to-point comms are all non-blocking calls that have been separated into InitiateComms() & CompleteComms(), so that, in theory, they can be overlapped with computation where possible. It would also be possible now to group the comms into larger messages easily. These optimizations are a next step (not for this PR).; - Persistent communication schedules and memory are used throughout the calculation.; - Results are the same, this is just a refactoring to improve performance, scalability, etc. while making the code much simpler and separating the periodic part. For the periodic BC:; - No longer need a preprocessing with SU2_MSH - use the original grid and just call SU2_CFD.; - Adjacent periodic faces are now possible, e.g., triply-periodic cube.; - Concept is now based on completing the residuals from partial control volumes on either side of a periodic face instead of creating extra halo cells.; - All periodic comms have been separated from the MPI point-to-point comms and are performed first for consistency.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/657:1303,Usability,clear,clear,1303,"e. Create a reflected halo node which enforces symmetry and compute the occurring flux just as in the interior. Problem: the primitive gradients are not adapted nor a viscous flux based on that is computed. Incompressible: Here a ""direct flux"" approach is chosen in Euler Wall. Insert the symmetry conditions directly in the FV derivation on the boundary part and thereby eliminate most terms. For the convective terms only a pressure contribution in the momentum equation remains. No Viscous terms are currently considered which is not correct for the momentum equation. . For both solvers I implemented a ""reflected state"" approach in C*Solver::BC_sym_plane as I didn't want to touch the Euler_wall implementations especially from the compressible solver. . I (informally) wrote a bit down as explanation in Latex how I did the derivation.; [Symmetry_BC.pdf](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/2891210/Symmetry_BC.pdf); Note that in the DG-FEM solver of @vdweide the same ""reflected state"" approach is implemented although it is not clear to me how the derivation was done there. See the bottom of the pdf for more info. I would be happy to get some insight here :). I also did a bit of testing with some cases and will showcase the differences between current develop and my implementation with pictures below. I attached two easy 2D cases (compr. & incompr. half cylinder) which you could quickly compare the current develop and this PR with.; [Sym_plane_testcases.gz](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/2891254/Sym_plane_testcases.gz); tar xzf Sym_plane_testcases.gz. 1.

I have the original .su2 mesh file which is undeformed, and I wish to supply the new deformed coordinates of the wing surface to be used to deform the mesh, and then run a steady state simulation using SU2_CFD on the deformed wing. I have the .cfg file, undeformed .su2, and the coordinates of the new deformed wing surface called “surface_positions_00000.dat”. When I run the solver, I get the following error which I know is something to do with the memory but I am not familiar with C++ so I cannot identify it in the source code. .

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/670:1178,Testability,test,test,1178,"## Proposed Changes. For 2D problems, the calculation for the magnitude of the rate-of-strain tensor is missing a term. When summing over the diagonal components of the deviatoric rate-of-strain tensor, the code loops over `nDim` diagonal components. In 2D, that means it only adds the first two diagonal components. This creates problems, because the third component is *not* zero, even for 2D flow. While third component of the rate-of-strain tensor in 2D is zero (i.e. S_33 = 0), the deviatoric rate-of-strain tensor has a nonzero third diagonal component. So in 2D, the third diagonal component must be explicitly added. This should only make significant impacts on problems where the divergence of velocity is non-negligible when compared to the diagonal components of the rate-of-strain tensor (i.e. for higher Mach cases). ## Related Work; None that I know of. ## PR Checklist. - [x] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [ ] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [x] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [ ] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/670

We have added an extensible library of classes for the purposes of solution verification. We hope that folks will use it and continue growing the library to increase the formal verification activity for the code. Our design goals for the classes were:. * lightweight & small memory footprint.; * reusable by different solvers (so far: all DG and FV fluid solvers).; * require almost no changes to the solver classes when switching between different solutions by using polymorphism (other than maybe where they get instantiated).; * applicable for any of the following: imposing initial conditions, analytic solutions, or manufactured solutions. There is also now a user-defined solution class that folks can use to prescribe initial conditions as a function of space for any type of calculation. It should be easy to add new solutions to the library by creating new child classes. We are placing a few cases in the regressions, but we will also add full cases with analysis to the V&V repo. It will also be discussed in a presentation at the developers meeting. You will find a few other small bug fixes in the PR as well.

Curiously, in output_structure.cpp where values such as Total_Sens_AoA are called again to be printed to screen, these values differ from those calculated inside solver_adjoint_discrete.cpp. This to me suggests that the sensitivity values are altered elsewhere, but I cannot seem to find where this occurs. Any help would be appreciated. Kind regards,; Amir",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/679

It will remain stuck indefinitely (I've only left it for up to 20 hours, however). This has only happened to prism meshes that I've generated with Pointwise's T-Rex function. However, it only seems to affect some of them. I should mention that the geometry has a very sharp and flat wingtip - sometimes the final few cells on the wingtip become 2D flat plates rather than 3D cells. Will SU2 handle these? I notice that not all meshes with 2D tips get stuck, but all the meshes that are stuck are meshes with 2D tips. (i.e. some meshes seem to run fine.). I'm not sure if this is a bug or user error but I've also attached some images to demonstrate what I mean.

Many of the convective schemes we have are small variations of each other, and so I was thinking we can maybe have some intermediate numerics classes to make things a bit easier to maintain, quicker to compile etc.; So far I experimented with having a base class for central schemes, the ComputeResidual method is moved to this class and the children classes (Lax, JST, and JST_KE) only implement the artificial dissipation part specific to them.; Similarly AUSM+up(1/2) and SLAU(1/2) only differ in how the mass and pressure fluxes are computed so again a common base for these 4 could be devised. Isolating the computation of mass and pressure fluxes could be an interesting way to compute the Jacobians of these schemes in a hybrid way (currently the Roe Jacobian is used).; There is a very small performance penalty (maybe 1-2% for explicit solution methods) but my reason to be looking at the numerics in the first place is that with some small tweaks to the Jacobians we can probably run most schemes at higher CFL (namely increase the dissipative part of the Jacobian to make the system matrix more diagonal dominant) so for implicit solution methods there would be a speedup.; So, what do you think?; Cheers,; Pedro. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [x] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/691

It is not intended to replace validation testing or formal verification tests. Instead, it serves a unique purpose. Consider the three following use cases:. + You're developing a new feature, and you want to test it to see if it works. You could do a full simulation, but that takes a lot of time and computing power. You want to check if your new behavior behaves as you suspect before you throw a lot of resources at it.; + You submit a PR and discover that one of the regression tests has failed. But...why? You know that something is broken, but its hard to track down what broke. You want more granular test coverage that can demonstrate what broke.; + You are fixing a very small bug. You know that you should prove that your bug fix worked, but it doesn't seem logical to dedicate an entire validation case to one small bug fix. You want to write a small test for a small fix. In all of these cases, unit testing fills a unique role. Unit testing increases time spent in development, but decreases the amount of time spent in bug-fixing and maintaining.

Our research group at UT Austin has implemented a unit testing framework on our branch, which we're happy with.

This should vaguely resemble an RCM ordered 2D connectivity.; We will measure the cost of this edge loop relative to using a row-major storage of our variables.; ```; double* solution = new double [nNode*nVar];; for(int i=0; i<nNode*nVar; ++i) solution[i] = 1.0;; ...; double r = numerics->ComputeResidual(&solution[p0*nVar], &solution[p1*nVar]);; ...; ```; OK, so we run this for 1000000 nodes with 4 variables per node and a overhead (or ""space between variables"") of 200 and we see that CVariable is **8.4** times slower.; But we can actually confuse the CPU further by accessing the variables through the virtual method, i.e.; ```; ...; double r = numerics->ComputeResidual(node[p0]->GetSecondary(), node[p1]->GetSecondary());; ...; ```; and now we measure our loop to be **10** times slower.; If we remove all overhead the loop is only **1.5** and **1.9** times slower respectively, it is really the enormous distance that kills performance. **Proposed solution**; Now, I would like to get better performance, but I do not want to re-write the entire code, and I recognize the usefulness of polymorphism and that encapsulating data keeps the code more manageable and readable.; To that end I propose that CVariable should allocate data for all nodes, so CSolver would have one CVariable and not one per node e.g.; ```; class DenseVariableBase; {; protected:; double* primary;; int n, i;; public:; DenseVariableBase(int nVar, int nNode); {; primary = new double [nVar*nNode];; ...; }; virtual ~DenseVariableBase() {delete [] primary;}; inline DenseVariableBase* operator[]",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/716

If you have ever looked into the old output_structure.cpp file, you probably noticed that it was quite messy. To add new output to screen or history people just copied what was there and modified it to suit there own needs. This resulted in a lot of if/switch statements and was hard to read ... one reason for this was that we have not really used an object oriented structure for the output. Despite rearranging everything into separate classes, here is a non-exhaustive list of new features and changes:. - Fully customizable screen, history and volume output; - New multizone screen output; - New flexible way so set convergence criteria (any residual and/or coefficient can be used as a monitor); - Consistent naming of iteration variables (TIME_ITER, OUTER_ITER, INNER_ITER); - Consistent file naming options (RESTART_FILENAME, SOLUTION_FILENAME); - On-the-fly writing of all visualization files; - New Singlezone and Multizone drivers are now used by default. Note that this is a very big change. And i apologize for any inconvenience and troubles that this might cause. I can only maintain features covered by the regression tests.

Even though the name has gradient in it, this scaling is applied to both, the objective/constraint, and its gradient. I would like to change the name to OPT_GLOBAL_FACTOR. The reason why this is **global** and different from the objective/constraint scaling is because it's applied uniformly to all objectives and constraints. 4. OPT_RELAX_FACTOR: This is a scaling factor that purely multiplies the DV_VALUES from a config file, before applying the deformation to the mesh. For example, if you are performing a 2D optimization using a FFD and the optimizer spits out a suggested DV_VALUE of 0.001, the mesh deformation routine will move the FFD control point by 1 (according to the scaling given above). 5. OPT_LINE_SEARCH_BOUND: This is an interesting one and the one I am least sure off. This option limits the maximum final movement of the FFD control points in the cartesian coordinate system. So, DV_VALUE * OPT_RELAX_FACTOR results in a movement of the FFD_CONTROL_POINT. If the the maximum movement of any of the control points is greater than OPT_LINE_SEARCH_BOUND, then all the control point movements are scaled such that the maximum movement = OPT_LINE_SEARCH_BOUND. . 6.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/734:1194,Usability,guid,guide,1194,"## Proposed Changes; Added a dry run mode (can be enabled by adding -d as flag to the SU2_CFD binary). If this mode is enabled, all of the expensive geometrical preprocessing steps are skipped and no solver is started, but all other steps during the driver construction are executed. This is great to check whether the setup is sane and the physical settings are correct without having to wait until the mesh is read and the partitioning is done. For the implementation I created a dummy geometry class with zero elements and points and a dummy driver which does essentially nothing. Initially I thought it would be more work, but apparently it almost worked out of the box. I also added a table output during the solver preprocessing for the DG solver. Furthermore I moved parts of the Input_Preprocessing() routine dealing with the geometry to the Geometrical_Preprocessing() routine where it should belong. The changes in SU2_CFD.cpp look more complicated then they are. Just hide white space changes. ## Related Work. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

I will consider this as a possible bug until I hear the opinion of the SU2 community. As a validation test case for turbulence models, I am running the NASA Hump test case (https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/nasahump_val.html). However, the results obtained from the develop and master branch are quite different, specially the pressure distribution over the hump. The same difference also appears when other numerical scheme is used (SLAU2 instead of Roe). On the other hand, the skin friction seems not be affected. Please see attached figures. Also, I attached the plot of the residual over iterations, showing that all simulations converged nicely. Firstly, I thought that this was related to pull request #670 but I ran the same case with an older version of the dev branch and the results were identical. This suggest that the difference started from pull requests that were merged before #670. I also attached the config and mesh files if someone wants to reproduce.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/741:411,Energy Efficiency,charge,charge,411,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**. Hello guys,. Have you ever heard about MHD(magnetohydrodynamics) simulation? That's used in plasma physics with the hypothesis that most of the particles in a control volume have the same velocity.

So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored. You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think. A lot of problems we have come from the fact the we support python 2 and python 3. As I was setting up travis (getting there in a moment) I noticed that is easily possible to compile the code with python 3 (for the python wrapper) and run the python scripts with python 2 and vice versa, which eventually leads to errors and crashes.

It needs a compilation, but again it has no dependencies apart from python. ### How to use ?; The correct meson and ninja versions are added as git submodules. So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored.

It now refers actually to a numerical method that solves a particular problem and not to the physical problem. So I renamed it to `SOLVER`. . Additionally, I removed the `REGIME_TYPE` option and added the incompressible solvers as dedicated values (`INC_EULER`, `INC_RANS`, `INC_NAVIER_STOKES`) for the new `SOLVER` option. The method `GetRegime_Type()` is also removed and it is now explicitly checked for the kind of solvers. This way we remove the implicit assumption that every feature also works with the incompressible solvers. Developers have to deliberately add a check now ...

But when I try to use time-stepping (not dual-time-stepping), the periodic boundary condition shows some artifacts. For a problem that's homogeneous in the periodic direction, the transient solution is not homogeneous in the periodic direction. **To Reproduce**. To verify the problem, I looked at the ""navierstokes/poiseuille"" test case. This case is homogeneous in the y direction, and has periodic boundaries. Instead of treating it as a steady-state problem, I did time-marching wit simple time-stepping. I then compared the results with the same simulation on v6.2.0 (before PR #652 changed the periodic boundaries). The y-momentum is very similar in both cases. However, the x-momentum shows inhomogeneity on the develop branch:. ![comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13340225/63468140-bc674380-c42c-11e9-976a-ba94def43bd8.gif).

One of my colleagues pointed out that `CSolver::InitiatePeriodicComms` and `CSolver::CompletePeriodicComms` only communicate the residual and the Jacobian of point ""i"" with respect to point ""i"". The Jacobian of point ""i"" with respect to point ""j"" is *not* communicated. This means that a different problem is being passed to the linear solver at the periodic nodes. In v6.2.0, a halo node approach was used, so the linear solver problem was identical for all nodes along a homogeneous direction. If this analysis is correct, then this could be fixed by communicating the full Jacobian (with respect to all neighbors) at the periodic points. **Desktop**; - OS: Ubuntu 18.04; - C++ compiler and version: icc 19.0.2.187; - MPI implementation and version: mpich2/3.2; - SU2 Version: develop branch",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/763

And the first two as solvers via options PASTIX_LU and PASTIX_LDLT (in which case you should use a preconditioner type that does not cause CSysMatrix to allocate extra memory (LU_SGS).; The reason LDLT and LU can also be used as preconditioners is that it is possible to set a factorization frequency (via PASTIX_FACTORIZATION_FREQUENCY) so that the factorizations are only computed every N iterations or only on the first call (frequency set to 0), this is very useful for non linear elasticity.; The fill-in for the ILU is set via PASTIX_FILL_LEVEL, I did not reuse the option we have again to keep CSysMatrix from allocating any more than it needs to.; By default the solvers run silently, but more verbosity can be set via PASTIX_VERBOSITY_LEVEL (0 : silent, 1 : only during major operations, 2 : 1 + on every solve). ## Compilation; _TODO_; This needs linking with another library (Scotch) and with BLAS, I will explain this in detail.; Question: For v7 are we moving exclusively to meson?. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [ ] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/771

Currently if you want to run multipoint optimization with restarts, the python scripts only keep track of one restart file (the first of the multipoint conditions). This is acceptable when the multipoint conditions are similar, but does not work when the conditions are very different. For example, if one point is supersonic and the other is subsonic, and the subsonic case is restarted from the supersonic solution, it immediately diverges. . This PR allows the python scripts to keep track of restarts for each point in the multipoint set up. It is robust in the sense that you can start with 0 restart files or some subset of restart files. For example, if you are running a 3 point optimization but only have the restart for one of the points, this will handle that case by starting the other two points from scratch, but keeping track of the restart files after the first design iteration. There is a naming convention that is presumed. The restarts get 'point#' added to its base name. So for example, if the SOLUTION_FILENAME= solution_flow.dat then it will look for files named solution_flow_point0.dat, solution_flow_point1.dat and so on. For adjoints this is solution_adj_point0_cd.dat etc. This naming convention can be tweaked according to comments. . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

The changes are the following:; - New under-relaxation strategy. Variables such as density and energy are only allowed to change by +/- 20% with each nonlinear iteration by applying an under-relaxation parameter to the updates at each node, which helps with difficult transients, especially at calculation startup. Also applied to turbulence model updates (though threshold is larger).; - CFL adaption via an exponential progression with under-relaxation approach, i.e., changes to CFL are coupled to the under-relaxation parameter (small under-relaxation parameter = decrease, and large = increase). CFL is now locally defined for each CV for this process.; - Modified realizability checks to avoid negative density/pressure/temperature at the nodes and also during 2nd-order reconstruction at cell faces.; - CV face states for 2nd-order MUSCL are now optionally reconstructed with a separate gradient method (unweighted least squares recommended), which is very important for robustness. Gradients for viscous terms and sources are still computed via GG or WLS for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed.

Experiment yourselves.. sometimes you can get even more performance, sometimes less, case depending. I could use help testing this one with your cases, since I think almost all regression tests will change. As a start, I have run all of the NASA TMR 2D bump-in-channel cases. Everything looks good with that (see figures). I have also checked that the inviscid and laminar MMS give 2nd-order accuracy properly. ![bump_cd_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910870-09f36b00-d6d0-11e9-9e1c-553fd09b42c8.png); ![bump_cf_0p63_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910871-09f36b00-d6d0-11e9-8148-f211260dbf8f.png); ![bump_cf_0p75_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910872-09f36b00-d6d0-11e9-8772-6e26a8bd08b0.png); ![bump_cf_0p87_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910873-0a8c0180-d6d0-11e9-8c61-208809ff64e0.png); ![bump_cl_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910874-0a8c0180-d6d0-11e9-8add-2489b1c42a5c.png); ![residual_convergence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910875-0a8c0180-d6d0-11e9-8c0c-0ec2008734",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790

Using SA turbulence model, this behaviour is not shown. It looks like the tubulent kinetic energy field affect the computation of pressure field, leading to a non zero gradient pressure at wall, as shown in the attached figures:. In the figures it can be seen a comparison between the in-house solver of the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA), where SST model is implemented, and SU2 using both available turbulence models, SST and SA. The isolines represent the pressure field and the contour is the TKE field obtained with SU2 with SST. In particular, solid red line is CIRA solver, the solid black line is SU2-SST, and dashed black line is SU2-SA. Near the LE where TKE is 0, the isolines are similar and 0 pressure gradient at the wall is obtained with both turbulence models. When TKE starts to grow, the pressure computed with SU2-SST shows a non constant behaviour and at the wall has non 0 gradient. Furthermore, in the wake region the defect is more evident.

Therefore, I would like to ask for support from @oleburghardt and @pcarruscag to make this work with their changes. ## Related Work; #724 involuntarily removed the discrete adjoint FSI cases from the regression tests.; Branch [fix_discadjfsi](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/fix_discadjfsi) successfully recovers the functionality removed.; #774 introduced relevant changes to the adjoint solver that are making.; #753 was merged and, although I tried to adapt to it, I can't guarantee it's working correctly. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

I'm trying to compare the gradient from Discrete Adjoints to Finite differences using SU2v6.2 for a RAE2822 airfoil (2D) with a sharp trailing edge. I'm using the Spalart Allmaras turbulence model. The flow is transonic. I've used FFD to parameterize the airfoil. However, I cannot get my discrete adjoint values to match my finite difference values. The directions of the gradients match, however, the magnitudes differ significantly. .

You can even download the compiled binaries produced on github and run them locally to further debug problems.; - It is faster and more flexible.

There is potential to further speed things up by splitting the test case scripts into several files. All of that requires minimal work. Unfortunately there is no caching using ccache at the moment, but it is likely that github introduces this feature mid of november. ; - Additional tests like unit tests can make use of the same docker containers and can be easily set up by creating a new workflow file.; - We can easily add a deployment step to automatically create releases and/or nightly builds. **Note:** the linked docker containers are **only** for development/testing purposes.

[plotting_script.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/4217388/plotting_script.txt). Please note that the inlet file was created with random fluctuating values to ensure correct inlet interpolation is happening. Some values and patterns may look unrealistic. Additionally, note that Akima can extrapolate values as well but will display a warning if it is doing so. Linear will only do interpolation and will exit if the inlet file does not have the specific radius data. However, it will show on the console which radius data is missing so the user can add it. Also, currently, the flow should be in z-direction only. I don't know how to find the flow direction through any built-in method in SU2 during run. If you can tell me that I can update the code to support any flow direction. During interpolation, it will display that flow direction must be in z-direction to avoid any mistake by the user.

The solver can then interpolate the data two ways: 1D Linear Interpolation or 1D Akima Interpolation. I added three new options in .cfg file:; INLET_INTERPOLATION_FUNCTION = None, Linear_1D, Akima_1D; INLET_INTERPOLATION_TYPE = vr_vtheta, alpha_phi; PRINT_INLET_INTERPOLATED_DATA = yes/no (for those curious what is the exact interpolated data).

In the MatchPeriodic routine, there is a check to make sure we never map to the same point when finding periodic pairs. However, if a node lies on the axis of rotation it has to map on to itself.
