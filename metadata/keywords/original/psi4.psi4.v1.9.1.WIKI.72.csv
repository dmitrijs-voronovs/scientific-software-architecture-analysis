Frozen doubly occupied orbitals (FROZEN_DOCC) are doubly; occupied in each reference determinant and are not correlated in the; MRCC procedure.; Doubly occupied orbitals (RESTRICTED_DOCC) are doubly; occupied in each reference determinant and are correlated in the MRCC; procedure.; Active orbitals (ACTIVE) are partially occupied in each; reference determinant.; Frozen virtual orbitals (FROZEN_UOCC) are unoccupied in; all reference determinants and are excluded from the correlated wave; function. The model space is selected by considering all possible occupations; of the electrons among the orbitals in the active space that result; in determinants with the correct symmetry (WFN_SYM); and the correct value specified by the keyword; CORR_MULTP. Note that this does not consider the multiplicity; of the wavefunction. Thus, in order to obtain the wavefunction; with a set of reference determinants for; an open-shell system you should request a CORR_MULTP of; 1 within the PSIMRCC module, and select the root of the effective; Hamiltonian that corresponds to the state of interest. In addition,; the WFN_SYM keyword needs to be specified otherwise the; wavefunction belonging to the all-symmetric irrep will be selected. In; addition, it should be noted that for an open-shell singlet based; on two determinants the eigenvector is; [], which corresponds; to a wavefunction of the following form:.

This method is implemented and shown to be a powerful tool in; [Evangelista:2006:154113] and [Evangelista:2008:124104].

SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]; in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so; simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragements. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule{; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html

Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group.

When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the ; state of water cation, we can specify. SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]; in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods.

The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; set globals basis cc-pVDZ. or. set basis cc-pVDZ. or. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. or. set basis = cc-pVDZ. or. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. or. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. or. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, viz.:; set {; docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]; }. List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening [ is; on the same line as the name of the keyword.; Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the set keyword. Omitting the module; name, or using the name global or globals will result in the keyword being; applied to all modules. For example, in the following input; molecule{; o; h 1 roh; h 1 roh 2 ahoh. roh = 0.957; ahoh = 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1; energy('ccsd'). the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print; level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs cou",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html

Note that; PSI variables accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by; clean(). So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI; followed by a aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables(); command, the last will include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and; FCI TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a high-quality calculation; cheaply. Refer to Appendix PSI Variables by Module for a listing of the; variables set by each module. Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets=[""cc-pVDZ"",""cc-pVTZ"",""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of basis_set is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign. The geometry; specification supports delayed initialization of variable, which permits; potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the angle and bond; length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H1 R; H1 R2 A; }. Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]; Avals=range(102,106,2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword. Tables of Results¶; The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the Table() Psithon; function. For example, in the following potential energy surface scan for water; molecule h2o {;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html

As the potential energy scan is performed, the results are stored; (line 22) and the final table is printed to the output file (line 24). The; table is converted from absolute energies to relative energies (in kcal mol-1); on line 26, before being printed again. The relative energies are reported with; respect to the lowest value in each column. More examples of how to control the; formatting of the tables can be found in the sample input files provided; see; Appendix Test Suite and Sample Inputs for a complete listing. Python Wrappers¶; The Python foundations of the PSI4 driver and Psithon syntax permit; many commonly performed post-processing procedures to be integrated into; the PSI4 suite.; Among these are automated computations of interaction energies through; cp(), of a model chemistry applied to a database of systems through; database(), and of several model chemistries together approximating greater; accuracy through cbs().; These are discussed separately in section Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation.; Note that the options documented for Python functions are placed as arguments; in the command that calls the function; not in the set globals block or with any other set command.

Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, PSI4 was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; PSI4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level PSI4 source directory, and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all PSI4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the PSI4 code (which; are obtained from the 3rd edition of the IUPAC Green; book [Cohen:GreenBook:2008]) are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that ~/.psi4rc values can be overridden by; the user).; The physical constants used within PSI4, which are automatically; made available within all PSI4 input files.; psi_h = 6.62606896E-34 # The Planck constant (Js) ; psi_c = 2.99792458E8 # Speed of light (ms$^{-1}$) ; psi_kb = 1.3806504E-23 # The Boltzmann constant (JK$^{-1}$) ; psi_R = 8.314472 # Universal gas constant (JK$^{-1}$mol$^{-1}$) ; psi_bohr2angstroms = 0.52917720859 # Bohr to Angstroms conversio",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html

For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so; simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragements. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule{; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }.

One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a memory; command in the ~/.psi4rc file, as detailed in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File. Return Values and PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results of; each computation are made available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of H2; and H atom:; molecule h2{; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h{; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy); print""De=%f""%D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the computation, which we; assign to a Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a; dissociation energy and printed to the output file using standard Python; notation. Sometimes there are multiple quantities of interest; these can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after performing a; density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component scaled energy and the; unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2=get_variable('DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of; a calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file; with the input file command print_variables(). Note that; PSI variables accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by; clean(). So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI; followed by a aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables(); command, the last will include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and; FCI TOTAL ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html

This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all PSI4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the PSI4 code (which; are obtained from the 3rd edition of the IUPAC Green; book [Cohen:GreenBook:2008]) are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that ~/.psi4rc values can be overridden by; the user).; The physical constants used within PSI4, which are automatically; made available within all PSI4 input files.; psi_h = 6.62606896E-34 # The Planck constant (Js) ; psi_c = 2.99792458E8 # Speed of light (ms$^{-1}$) ; psi_kb = 1.3806504E-23 # The Boltzmann constant (JK$^{-1}$) ; psi_R = 8.314472 # Universal gas constant (JK$^{-1}$mol$^{-1}$) ; psi_bohr2angstroms = 0.52917720859 # Bohr to Angstroms conversion factor ; psi_bohr2m = 0.52917720859E-10 # Bohr to meters conversion factor ; psi_bohr2cm = 0.52917720859E-8 # Bohr to centimeters conversion factor ; psi_amu2g = 1.660538782E-24 # Atomic mass units to grams conversion factor ; psi_amu2kg = 1.660538782E-27 # Atomic mass units to kg conversion factor ; psi_au2amu = 5.485799097E-4 # Atomic units (m$@@e$) to atomic mass units conversion factor ; psi_hartree2J = 4.359744E-18 # Hartree to joule conversion factor ; psi_hartree2aJ = 4.359744 # Hartree to attojoule (10$^{-18}$J) con",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html

See dfmp2_1; and ghosts for a demonstration of both mechanisms for specifying; ghost atoms. Geometries from the PubChem Database¶; Obtaining rough starting guess geometries can be burdensome. The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, PSI4 can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem] database.; For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; PSI4 to search PubChem for a starting structure. The search is actually; performed for compounds whose name contains “benzene”, so multiple; entries will be returned. If the name provided (“benzene” in the above; example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used. If no; exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier; (CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more; specific name. For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a; compound whose name(s) contain “benzene”, but we’re not sure of the exact IUPAC; name, the following input can be used:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene*; }. Appending the “*” prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time; of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file:; Chemical ID IUPAC Name; 241 benzene; 7371 benzenesulfonic acid; 91526 benzenesulfonate; 244 phenylmethanol; 727 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane; 240 benzaldehyde; 65723 benzenesulfonohydrazide; 74296 N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide; 289 benzene-1,2-diol; 243 benzoic acid; 7370 ben",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html

Note that some of these results do not contain the string “benzene”; these; compounds have synonyms containing that text. We can now replace the; “benzene*” in the input file with one of the above compounds using either the; IUPAC name or the CID provided in the list, viz:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:637563; }. or. molecule benzene {; pubchem:1-methoxy-4-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]benzene; }. Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, PSI4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Sec. Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjuction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

In this case, the charge and multiplicity of each interacting fragment is; explicitly specified. If the charge and multiplicity are specified for the; first fragment, it is assumed to be the same for all fragments. When; considering interacting fragments, the overall charge is simply the sum of all; fragment charges, and any unpaired electrons are assumed to be coupled to; yield the highest possible value. Job Control¶; PSI4 comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file, detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module, which; control its function. The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; set globals basis cc-pVDZ. or. set basis cc-pVDZ. or. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. or. set basis = cc-pVDZ. or. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. or. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. or. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }.

When most popular basis sets are being used, including Dunning and; Pople-style, the SCF, DF-MP2, and SAPT codes will chose the appropriate; auxiliary basis set automatically according to Auxiliary Basis Sets,; unless instructed otherwise by setting the auxiliary basis set in the; input. Finally, we note that the basis {...} block may also be used; for defining basis sets, as detailed in Sec. User-Defined Basis Sets. Memory Specification¶; By default, PSI4 assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available; to PSI4:; memory 2 Gb. or. memory 2000 Mb. or. memory 2000000 Kb. One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a memory; command in the ~/.psi4rc file, as detailed in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File.

D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy); print""De=%f""%D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the computation, which we; assign to a Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a; dissociation energy and printed to the output file using standard Python; notation. Sometimes there are multiple quantities of interest; these can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after performing a; density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component scaled energy and the; unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2=get_variable('DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of; a calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file; with the input file command print_variables(). Note that; PSI variables accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by; clean(). So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI; followed by a aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables(); command, the last will include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and; FCI TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a high-quality calculation; cheaply. Refer to Appendix PSI Variables by Module for a listing of the; variables set by each module.

Note that whenever the molecule is changed, the basis set must be specified; again. The following section provides more details about the job control; keywords used in the above examples. Molecule Keywords¶; In addition to specifying the geometry, additional information can be provided; in the molecule block. If two integers are encountered on any line of the; molecule block, they are interpreted as the molecular charge and multiplicity; (), respectively. The symmetry can be specified by a line reading; symmetry symbol, where symbol is; the Schönflies symbol of the (Abelian) point group to use for the; computation; see Sec. Symmetry for more details. This need not be; specified, as the molecular symmetry is automatically detected by PSI4.; Certain computations require that the molecule is not reoriented; this can be; achieved by adding either no_reorient or noreorient.

Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter. Ordering of irreducible representations (irreps) used in PSI4.

For example, water ( symmetry) has 3 doubly occupied ; orbitals, as well as 1 each of and symmetry; the; corresponding DOCC array is therefore:; DOCC = [3, 0, 1, 1]. Although PSI4 will detect the symmetry automatically, and use the largest; possible Abelian subgroup, the user might want to run in a lower point group.; To do this the symmetry keyword can be used when inputting the molecule; (see Sec. Molecule Specification). In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with symmetry in , the; axis can be chosen as either the , the , or the ; these can; be specified by requesing the symmetry as c2vx, c2vy, or c2vz, respectively.; Likewise the c2x, c2y, c2z, c2hx, c2hy, and c2hz; labels are valid. For symmetry the labels csx, csy, and; csz request the , , and planes be used as the mirror plane,; respectively. If no unique axis is specified, PSI4 will choose an appropriate; subgroup.; Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational; frequencies, might ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput-1.html

We use a snippet from the mints2 sample; input file, which performs a benzene SCF computation, to demonstrate this; feature.; basis {; assign DZ; assign C 3-21G; assign H1 sto-3g; assign C1 sto-3g; }. The first line in this block assigns the DZ basis set to all atoms. The next; line then assigns 3-21G to all carbon atoms, leaving the hydrogens with the DZ; basis set. On the third line, the hydrogen atoms which have been specifically; labelled as H1 are given the STO-3G basis set, leaving the unlabelled hydrogen; atoms with the DZ basis set. Likewise, the fourth line assigns the STO-3G; basis set to just the carbon atoms labelled C1. This bizzare example was; constructed to demonstrate the syntax, but the flexibility of the basis set; specification is advantageous, for example, when selectivily omitting diffuse; functions to make computations more tractable.; In the above example the basis sets have been assigned asymmetrically, reducing; the effective symmetry from to ; PSI4 will detect this; automatically and run in the appropriate point group. The same syntax can be; used to specify basis sets other than that used to define orbitals. For; example,; set df_basis_mp2 cc-pvdz-ri. or. basis {; assign cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2; }. are both equivalent ways to set the auxiliary basis set for density fitted MP2; computations. To assign the aug-cc-pVDZ-RI to carbon atoms, the following; command is used:; basis {; assign C aug-cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2; }. When most popular basis sets are being used, including Dunning and; Pople-style, the SCF, DF-MP2, and SAPT codes will chose the appropriate; auxiliary basis set automatically according to Auxiliary Basis Sets,; unless instructed otherwise by setting the auxiliary basis set in the; input. Finally, we note that the basis {...} block may also be used; for defining basis sets, as detailed in Sec. User-Defined Basis Sets.

One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a memory; command in the ~/.psi4rc file, as detailed in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File. Return Values and PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results of; each computation are made available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of H2; and H atom:; molecule h2{; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h{; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy); print""De=%f""%D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the computation, which we; assign to a Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a; dissociation energy and printed to the output file using standard Python; notation. Sometimes there are multiple quantities of interest; these can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after performing a; density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component scaled energy and the; unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2=get_variable('DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of; a calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file; with the input file command print_variables(). Note that; PSI variables accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by; clean(). So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI; followed by a aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables(); command, the last will include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and; FCI TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a high-quality calculation; cheaply. Refer to Appendix PSI Variables by Module for a listing of the; variables set by each module.

The declaration of basis_set is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign. The geometry; specification supports delayed initialization of variable, which permits; potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the angle and bond; length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H1 R; H1 R2 A; }. Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]; Avals=range(102,106,2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword. Tables of Results¶; The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the Table() Psithon; function. For example, in the following potential energy surface scan for water; molecule h2o {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }.

Job Control¶; PSI4 comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end.

Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of; a calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file; with the input file command print_variables(). Note that; PSI variables accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by; clean(). So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI; followed by a aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables(); command, the last will include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and; FCI TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a high-quality calculation; cheaply. Refer to Appendix PSI Variables by Module for a listing of the; variables set by each module.

D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy); print""De=%f""%D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the computation, which we; assign to a Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a; dissociation energy and printed to the output file using standard Python; notation. Sometimes there are multiple quantities of interest; these can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after performing a; density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component scaled energy and the; unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2=get_variable('DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of; a calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file; with the input file command print_variables(). Note that; PSI variables accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by; clean(). So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI; followed by a aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables(); command, the last will include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and; FCI TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a high-quality calculation; cheaply. Refer to Appendix PSI Variables by Module for a listing of the; variables set by each module. Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets=[""cc-pVDZ"",""cc-pVTZ"",""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; s",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html

Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, PSI4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Sec. Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjuction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

For example, water ( symmetry) has 3 doubly occupied ; orbitals, as well as 1 each of and symmetry; the; corresponding DOCC array is therefore:; DOCC = [3, 0, 1, 1].

When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the ; state of water cation, we can specify. SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]; in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse.

Finally, we note that the basis {...} block may also be used; for defining basis sets, as detailed in Sec. User-Defined Basis Sets. Memory Specification¶; By default, PSI4 assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available; to PSI4:; memory 2 Gb. or. memory 2000 Mb. or. memory 2000000 Kb. One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a memory; command in the ~/.psi4rc file, as detailed in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File. Return Values and PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results of; each computation are made available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of H2; and H atom:; molecule h2{; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h{; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy); print""De=%f""%D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the computation, which we; assign to a Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a; dissociation energy and printed to the output file using standard Python; notation. Sometimes there are multiple quantities of interest; these can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after performing a; density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component scaled energy and the; unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2=get_variable('DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 TOTAL ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html

In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with symmetry in , the; axis can be chosen as either the , the , or the ; these can; be specified by requesing the symmetry as c2vx, c2vy, or c2vz, respectively.; Likewise the c2x, c2y, c2z, c2hx, c2hy, and c2hz; labels are valid. For symmetry the labels csx, csy, and; csz request the , , and planes be used as the mirror plane,; respectively. If no unique axis is specified, PSI4 will choose an appropriate; subgroup.; Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational; frequencies, might lower the symmetry of the molecule. When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the ; state of water cation, we can specify. SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]; in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse.

When; considering interacting fragments, the overall charge is simply the sum of all; fragment charges, and any unpaired electrons are assumed to be coupled to; yield the highest possible value. Job Control¶; PSI4 comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file, detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module, which; control its function. The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; set globals basis cc-pVDZ. or. set basis cc-pVDZ. or. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. or. set basis = cc-pVDZ. or. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. or. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. or. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, viz.:; set {; docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]; }. List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening [ is; on the same line as the name of the keyword.; Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the set keyword. Omitting the module; name, or using the name global or globals will result in the keyword being; applied to all modules. For example, in the following input; molecule{; o; h 1 roh; h 1 roh 2 ahoh. roh = 0.957; ahoh = 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1; energy('ccsd'). the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print; level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs cou",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html

Note that; PSI variables accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by; clean(). So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI; followed by a aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables(); command, the last will include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and; FCI TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a high-quality calculation; cheaply. Refer to Appendix PSI Variables by Module for a listing of the; variables set by each module. Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets=[""cc-pVDZ"",""cc-pVTZ"",""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of basis_set is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign. The geometry; specification supports delayed initialization of variable, which permits; potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the angle and bond; length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H1 R; H1 R2 A; }. Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]; Avals=range(102,106,2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword. Tables of Results¶; The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the Table() Psithon; function.

The psi_ prefix is to prevent clashes with user-defined variables in; PSI4 input files. Molecule Specification¶; PSI4 has a very flexible input parser that allows the user to provide; geometries as Cartesian coordinates, Z-matrix variables, or a combination of; both. The use of fixed values and variables are supported for both. For; example, the geometry for H2 can be specified a number of ways, using the; molecule keyword:; molecule{; H; H 1 0.9; }. or. molecule{; H; H 1 r; r = 0.9; }. or. molecule{; H1; H2 H1 0.9; }. or. molecule{; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 0.9; }. or. molecule{; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.9; }. or. molecule{; H 0.0 0.0 -r; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.45; }. Blank lines are ignored and, unlike regular Python syntax, indentation within; the molecule block does not matter, although the molecule keyword itself must; be aligned within the input according to standard Python syntax. For more; examples of geometry specification, see the mints1 input file in the samples; folder. It is also possible to mix Cartesian and Z-matrix geometry; specifications, as demonstrated in the mints4 sample input file. Multiple Molecules¶; To facilitate more elaborate computations, it is possible to provide a name for; each molecule, and tell PSI4 which one should be used in a given; cal",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html
https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html:13676,Modifiability,adapt,adapted,13676,"pped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:. SOCC = [0, 1]; Some caution is required, however. The state can be obtained with; the. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]; specification, which would become. SOCC = [1, 0]; under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]; would be mapped to. SOCC = [1, 0]; which is the same occupation as the state. In this case, the; state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so; simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragements. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule{; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }.

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html:20564,Modifiability,variab,variable,20564," algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available; to PSI4:; memory 2 Gb. or. memory 2000 Mb. or. memory 2000000 Kb. One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a memory; command in the ~/.psi4rc file, as detailed in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File. Return Values and PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results of; each computation are made available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of H2; and H atom:; molecule h2{; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h{; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy); print""De=%f""%D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the computation, which we; assign to a Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a; dissociation energy and printed to the output file using standard Python; notation. Sometimes there are multiple quantities of interest; these can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after performing a; density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component scaled energy and the; unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2=get_variable('DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of; a calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file; with the input file command print_variables(). Note that; PSI variables accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by; clean().

See dfmp2_1; and ghosts for a demonstration of both mechanisms for specifying; ghost atoms. Geometries from the PubChem Database¶; Obtaining rough starting guess geometries can be burdensome. The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, PSI4 can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem] database.; For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; PSI4 to search PubChem for a starting structure. The search is actually; performed for compounds whose name contains “benzene”, so multiple; entries will be returned. If the name provided (“benzene” in the above; example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used. If no; exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier; (CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more; specific name. For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a; compound whose name(s) contain “benzene”, but we’re not sure of the exact IUPAC; name, the following input can be used:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene*; }. Appending the “*” prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time; of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file:; Chemical ID IUPAC Name; 241 benzene; 7371 benzenesulfonic acid; 91526 benzenesulfonate; 244 phenylmethanol; 727 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane; 240 benzaldehyde; 65723 benzenesulfonohydrazide; 74296 N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide; 289 benzene-1,2-diol; 243 benzoic acid; 7370 ben",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html

Note that some of these results do not contain the string “benzene”; these; compounds have synonyms containing that text. We can now replace the; “benzene*” in the input file with one of the above compounds using either the; IUPAC name or the CID provided in the list, viz:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:637563; }. or. molecule benzene {; pubchem:1-methoxy-4-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]benzene; }. Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, PSI4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Sec. Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjuction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule{; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }. In this case, the charge and multiplicity of each interacting fragment is; explicitly specified. If the charge and multiplicity are specified for the; first fragment, it is assumed to be the same for all fragments. When; considering interacting fragments, the overall charge is simply the sum of all; fragment charges, and any unpaired electrons are assumed to be coupled to; yield the highest possible value. Job Control¶; PSI4 comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file, detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module, which; control its function. The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; set globals basis cc-pVDZ. or. set basis cc-pVDZ. or. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. or. set basis = cc-pVDZ. or. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. or. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. or. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, viz.:; set {; docc ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/psithoninput.html

On the third line, the hydrogen atoms which have been specifically; labelled as H1 are given the STO-3G basis set, leaving the unlabelled hydrogen; atoms with the DZ basis set. Likewise, the fourth line assigns the STO-3G; basis set to just the carbon atoms labelled C1.

The same syntax can be; used to specify basis sets other than that used to define orbitals. For; example,; set df_basis_mp2 cc-pvdz-ri. or. basis {; assign cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2; }. are both equivalent ways to set the auxiliary basis set for density fitted MP2; computations.

When most popular basis sets are being used, including Dunning and; Pople-style, the SCF, DF-MP2, and SAPT codes will chose the appropriate; auxiliary basis set automatically according to Auxiliary Basis Sets,; unless instructed otherwise by setting the auxiliary basis set in the; input. Finally, we note that the basis {...} block may also be used; for defining basis sets, as detailed in Sec. User-Defined Basis Sets. Memory Specification¶; By default, PSI4 assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available; to PSI4:; memory 2 Gb. or. memory 2000 Mb. or. memory 2000000 Kb. One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a memory; command in the ~/.psi4rc file, as detailed in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File. Return Values and PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results of; each computation are made available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of H2; and H atom:; molecule h2{; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h{; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf').

D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy); print""De=%f""%D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the computation, which we; assign to a Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a; dissociation energy and printed to the output file using standard Python; notation. Sometimes there are multiple quantities of interest; these can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after performing a; density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component scaled energy and the; unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2=get_variable('DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of; a calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file; with the input file command print_variables(). Note that; PSI variables accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by; clean(). So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI; followed by a aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables(); command, the last will include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and; FCI TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a high-quality calculation; cheaply. Refer to Appendix PSI Variables by Module for a listing of the; variables set by each module. Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, which can be used within PSI4; input files.

Note that whenever the molecule is changed, the basis set must be specified; again. The following section provides more details about the job control; keywords used in the above examples. Molecule Keywords¶; In addition to specifying the geometry, additional information can be provided; in the molecule block. If two integers are encountered on any line of the; molecule block, they are interpreted as the molecular charge and multiplicity; (), respectively. The symmetry can be specified by a line reading; symmetry symbol, where symbol is; the Schönflies symbol of the (Abelian) point group to use for the; computation; see Sec. Symmetry for more details. This need not be; specified, as the molecular symmetry is automatically detected by PSI4.; Certain computations require that the molecule is not reoriented; this can be; achieved by adding either no_reorient or noreorient. By default,; Ångström units are used; this is changed by adding a line that reads; units spec, where spec is one of ang,; angstrom, a.u., au, or bohr. Ghost Atoms¶; While many common computations, such as SAPT and counterpoise corrections, can; be greatly simplified using the notation described in Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments,; manual specification of ghost atoms is sometimes required. Either; molecule he2 {; He; Gh(He) 1 2.0; }. or; molecule he2 {; He; @He 1 2.0; }. will generate a helium dimer, with the second atom ghosted, i.e., possessing; basis functions but no electrons or nuclear charge. See dfmp2_1; and ghosts for a demonstration of both mechanisms for specifying; ghost atoms. Geometries from the PubChem Database¶; Obtaining rough starting guess geometries can be burdensome.

Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter. Ordering of irreducible representations (irreps) used in PSI4.

For example, water ( symmetry) has 3 doubly occupied ; orbitals, as well as 1 each of and symmetry; the; corresponding DOCC array is therefore:; DOCC = [3, 0, 1, 1]. Although PSI4 will detect the symmetry automatically, and use the largest; possible Abelian subgroup, the user might want to run in a lower point group.; To do this the symmetry keyword can be used when inputting the molecule; (see Sec. Molecule Specification). In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with symmetry in , the; axis can be chosen as either the , the , or the ; these can; be specified by requesing the symmetry as c2vx, c2vy, or c2vz, respectively.; Likewise the c2x, c2y, c2z, c2hx, c2hy, and c2hz; labels are valid. For symmetry the labels csx, csy, and; csz request the , , and planes be used as the mirror plane,; respectively.

Job Control¶; PSI4 comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file, detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module, which; control its function. The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; set globals basis cc-pVDZ. or. set basis cc-pVDZ. or. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. or. set basis = cc-pVDZ. or. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. or. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. or. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }.

D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy); print""De=%f""%D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the computation, which we; assign to a Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a; dissociation energy and printed to the output file using standard Python; notation. Sometimes there are multiple quantities of interest; these can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after performing a; density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component scaled energy and the; unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2=get_variable('DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of; a calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file; with the input file command print_variables(). Note that; PSI variables accumulate over a PSI4 instance and are not cleared by; clean(). So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI; followed by a aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables(); command, the last will include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and; FCI TOTAL ENERGY. Don’t get excited that you got a high-quality calculation; cheaply. Refer to Appendix PSI Variables by Module for a listing of the; variables set by each module. Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets=[""cc-pVDZ"",""cc-pVTZ"",""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of basis_set is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.

A reaction is a combination of one or more; reagent energies whose value you are interested in and a reference value; for which you may or may not be in possession of. A few examples follow.; In a database of interaction energies, the reagents are dimers and their; component monomers (usually derived from the dimer geometry), and the; reactions are the dimer less monomers energies. In a database of barrier; heights, the reagents are reactants, products, and transition-state; structures, and the reactions are the transition-states less; minimum-energy structures. Possibly you may have a collection of; structures to simply be acted upon in parallel, in which case the; structures are both the reagents and the reactions. The role of the; database.py file is to collect arrays and dictionaries that define the; geometries of reagents (GEOS), their combination into reactions (RXNM &; ACTV), available reference values for reactions (BIND), and brief comments; for reagents and reactions (TAGL). The journey from reagent geometries to; functional database.py file is largely automated, in a process described; below. Prepare geometry files; Assemble xyz files for all intended reagent systems in a directory.; Follow the rules below for best results. The filename for each xyz; file should be the name of the system. lowercase or MixedCase is; preferable (according to Sherrill lab convention). Avoid dashes and; dots in the name as python won’t allow them. If you’re determined to; have dashes and dots, they must be replaced by other characters in the; process_input line, then translated back in the GEOS section; see; NBC10.py for an example.

The atom lines should not contain any dummy atoms (what’s the use in cartesian form). For dimer systems, an algorithm is used to apportion the atoms into two fragments; thus the atoms need not be arranged with all fragmentA atoms before all fragmentB atoms. The algorithm will fail for very closely arranged fragments. For dimers, any charge and multiplicity from the second line will be applied to fragmentA (python); charge and multiplicity may need to be redistributed later in the editing step. Run script psi4/lib/scripts/ixyz2database.py. Move into the directory where all your xyz files are located. Run the; script, probably as $PSIDATADIR/scripts/ixyz2database.py. (If you; run it in place, there won’t be any path problems. It will ask a number of; questions about your intended database and generate a python file; named for your database. Uppercase is preferable for database names; (according to Sherrill lab convention). Note your choice for the route; variable for the next step. Edit file database.py.

Creating a Database¶; A necessary consideration in constructing a database is the distinction; between reagents and reactions. A reagent is a single molecular system; (may be a dimer) whose geometry you are possession of and whose electronic; energy may be of interest. A reaction is a combination of one or more; reagent energies whose value you are interested in and a reference value; for which you may or may not be in possession of. A few examples follow.; In a database of interaction energies, the reagents are dimers and their; component monomers (usually derived from the dimer geometry), and the; reactions are the dimer less monomers energies. In a database of barrier; heights, the reagents are reactants, products, and transition-state; structures, and the reactions are the transition-states less; minimum-energy structures. Possibly you may have a collection of; structures to simply be acted upon in parallel, in which case the; structures are both the reagents and the reactions. The role of the; database.py file is to collect arrays and dictionaries that define the; geometries of reagents (GEOS), their combination into reactions (RXNM &; ACTV), available reference values for reactions (BIND), and brief comments; for reagents and reactions (TAGL). The journey from reagent geometries to; functional database.py file is largely automated, in a process described; below. Prepare geometry files; Assemble xyz files for all intended reagent systems in a directory.; Follow the rules below for best results. The filename for each xyz; file should be the name of the system. lowercase or MixedCase is; preferable (according to Sherrill lab convention). Avoid dashes and; dots in the name as python won’t allow them. If you’re determined to; have dashes and dots, they must be replaced by other characters in the; process_input line, then translated back in the GEOS section; see; NBC10.py for an examp",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/quickadddatabase.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/quickadddatabase.html

The Est.Disp22(T); value used in the SAPT energy and dispersion component (see [Hohenstein:2010:104107]; for details). Table Of Contents.

In practice, we have found that the density-fitting; approximation introduces negligable errors into the SAPT energy and greatly; improves efficiency. A First Example¶; The following is the simplest possible input that will perform all; available SAPT computations (normally, you would pick one of these methods).; molecule water_dimer {; 0 1; O -1.551007 -0.114520 0.000000; H -1.934259 0.762503 0.000000; H -0.599677 0.040712 0.000000; --; 0 1; O 1.350625 0.111469 0.000000; H 1.680398 -0.373741 -0.758561; H 1.680398 -0.373741 0.758561. units angstrom; no_reorient; symmetry c1; }. set globals {; basis aug-cc-pvdz; }. energy('sapt0'); energy('sapt2'); energy('sapt2+'); energy('sapt2+(3)'); energy('sapt2+3'). The SAPT module uses the standard PSI4 partitioning of the dimer; into monomers. SAPT does not use spatial symmetry and needs the geometry; of the system to remain fixed throughout monomer and dimer calculations.; These requirements are imposed whenever a SAPT calculation is requested; but can also be set explicitly with the no_reorient and symmetry; c1 molecule keywords, as in the example above. A final note is that the; SAPT module is only capable of performing SAPT computations for; interactions between closed-shell singlets.; The example input shown above would not be used in practice.; To exploit the efficiency of the density-fitted SAPT implementation in; PSI4, the SCF computations should also be performed with density-fitted; (DF) integrals.; set globals {; basis aug-cc-pvdz; df_basis_scf aug-cc-pvdz-jkfit; df_basis_sapt aug-cc-pvdz-ri; guess sad; scf_type df; }. set sapt {; print 1; }.

Hohenstein; Section author: Edward G. Hohenstein; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, LIBSAPT_SOLVER; Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of directly; computing the noncovalent interaction between two molecules, that is, the; interaction energy is determined without computing the total energy of the; monomers or dimer. In addition, SAPT provides a decomposition of the; interaction energy into physically meaningful components: i.e.,; electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion terms. In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, , the fluctuation potential of each monomer, , and the; interaction potential, . The monomer Fock operators, , are; treated as the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the interaction energy is; evaluated through a perturbative expansion of , , and .; Through first-order in , electrostatic and exchange interactions are; included; induction and dispersion first appear at second-order in . For; a complete description of SAPT, the reader is referred to the excellent; review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz [Jeziorski:1994:1887].; Several truncations of the SAPT expansion are available in the SAPT; module of PSI4. The simplest truncation of SAPT is denoted SAPT0; and defined in Eq. (1).

During the SCF procedure, the occupation of orbitals is typically determined by; the Aufbau principal across all spatial symmetries. This may result in the; occupation shifting between iterations. If the occupations are known a priori,; they may be clamped throughout the procedure by using the DOCC and; SOCC options. For instance, all good quantum chemists know that; water is; actually,:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set {; docc [3,0,1,1] # 1A1 2A1 1B1 3A1 1B2; basis cc-pvdz; }. energy('scf'). Broken Symmetry¶; For certain problems, such diradicals, allowing the spin-up and spin-down orbitals to differ in closed-shell computations can be advantageous; this is known as symmetry breaking. The resulting wavefunction will often provide superior energetics, due to the increased flexibility, but will suffer non-physicical spin contamination from higher multiplicity states. PSI4 can compute a high-spin triplet wavefunction and then use this as a guess for the broken-symmetry low spin state. To do this, you request broken symmetry in the energy() call, using one of the following::; energy('uhf', brokensymmetry=True). or, equivalently. set reference uhf; energy('scf', brokensymmetry=True). Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/scf-1.html

If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs per irrep may be slightly smaller than the number of USOs per irrep.; A contrived example demonstrating OSOs/MOs vs. AOs with symmetry is shown; below:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c2 # Two irreps is easier to comprehend; }. set {; s_tolerance 0.0001 # Set an unreasonably tight; # tolerance to force canonical; basis aug-cc-pv5z # This diffuse basis will have; # small-ish eigenvalues for even H2O; }. energy('scf').

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL.

Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) [Default]; Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical.; Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF); Appropriate for most open-shell systems, and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to an; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem.; Restricted Open-Shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF); Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical).; Constrained Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (CUHF); A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz, and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/scf-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/scf-1.html

We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum, and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your primary basis/atom type. Then use; OUT_OF_CORE unless you run out of disk space.; Don’t mess with the DIIS convergence options unless convergence is a problem.; We have optimized the parameters for efficiency over a wide array of system; types.; Buy a developer a beer!.

Broken Symmetry¶; For certain problems, such diradicals, allowing the spin-up and spin-down orbitals to differ in closed-shell computations can be advantageous; this is known as symmetry breaking. The resulting wavefunction will often provide superior energetics, due to the increased flexibility, but will suffer non-physicical spin contamination from higher multiplicity states. PSI4 can compute a high-spin triplet wavefunction and then use this as a guess for the broken-symmetry low spin state. To do this, you request broken symmetry in the energy() call, using one of the following::; energy('uhf', brokensymmetry=True). or, equivalently. set reference uhf; energy('scf', brokensymmetry=True).

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs).

Initial Guess/Convergence Stabilization¶; In each step of the SCF procedure, a new Fock or Kohn–Sham potential is built; according to the previous density, following which the potential is diagonalized; to produce new molecular orbitals, from which a new density is computed.

Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. For GUESS, the SAD guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment.; For wall time, DF may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in PSI4.; Use DF unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your primary basis/atom type.

In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via the options detailed below.; MOM [Off by Default]; MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations. Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is typically visible in the output as a non-converging; SCF which eventually settles down to steady oscillation between two (or more); different total energies. This behavior can be ameliorated by choosing occupied; orbitals by “shape” instead of by orbital eigenvalue, i.e., by choosing the set; of new orbitals which looks most like some previously known “good” set. The; “good” set is typically the occupied orbitals from an one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations , invoking; MOM_START can often rescue the convergence of the SCF.

For more; information on any of these options, see the relevant section below. Spin/Symmetry Treatment¶; PSI4 implements the most popular spin specializations of Hartree-Fock; theory, including:. Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) [Default]; Appropriate only for closed-shell singlet systems, but twice as efficient; as the other flavors, as the alpha and beta densities are constrained to be; identical.; Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF); Appropriate for most open-shell systems, and fairly easy to converge.; The spatial parts of the alpha and beta orbitals are fully independent of each; other, which allows a considerable amount of flexibility in the wavefunction.; However, this flexibility comes at the cost of spin symmetry; UHF wavefunctions; need not be eigenfunctions of the operator. The deviation of; this operator from its expectation value is printed on the output file. If the; deviation is greater than a few hundredths, it is advisable to switch to an; ROHF to avoid this “spin-contamination” problem.; Restricted Open-Shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF); Appropriate for open-shell systems where spin-contamination is problem.; Sometimes more difficult to converge, and assumes uniformly positive spin; polarization (the alpha and beta doubly-occupied orbitals are identical).; Constrained Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (CUHF); A variant of ROHF that starts from a UHF ansatz, and is therefore often; easier to converge. These can be invoked by the REFERENCE keyword, which defaults to RHF.; The charge and multiplicity may either be specified in the molecule definition:; molecule h {; 0 2 # Neutral doublet; H; }. or, dynamically, by setting the relevant attributes in the Python molecule; object:; h.set_molecular_charge(0); h.set_multiplicity(2). Abelian spatial symmetry is fully supported in PSI4, and can be used to; obtain physical interpretation of the molecular orbitals, to assist in difficult; convergence cases, and, in some methods, ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/scf.html

Orthogonalization¶; One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital basis (known; as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis) is then built as a; particular unitary transformation of the OSO basis. In PSI4, the; determination of the OSO basis is accomplished via either symmetric or canonical; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square; root of the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and thereby; MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical problems if the; overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur for large systems or for; systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using; canonical orthogonalization, in which an asymmetric inverse square root of the; overlap matrix is formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination; of eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few combinations; of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of canonical-orthogonalized; OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the number of AOs. In PSI4,; symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless the smallest overlap; eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double option S_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical; orthogonalization is forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues; below the cutoff are eliminated. Use of canonical orthogonalization can be; forced by setting the S_ORTHOGONALIZATION option to CANONICAL. Note; that in practice, the MOs and OSOs are built separately within each irrep from; the symmetry-adapted combinations of AOs known as Unique Symmetry Orbitals; (USOs). For canonical orthogonalization, this implies that the number of MOs; and OSOs ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/scf.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/scf.html

Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; PRINT option. Also printed are the occupied and virtual orbital energies,; which are useful in elucidating the stability and reactivity of the system.

This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets.; For initial orbital selection, several options are available.

Simple, but often too far from the final solution for larger; systems.; SAD; Superposition of Atomic Densities. Builds the initial density as the; spin-averaged sum of atomic UHF computations in the current basis. If an; open-shell system, uniform scaling of the spin-averaged density matrices is; performed. If orbitals are needed (e.g., in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems.; GWH; Generalized Wolfsberg-Helmholtz, a simple Huckel-Theory-like method based on; the overlap and core Hamiltonian matrices. May be useful in open-shell systems.; READ; Read the previous orbitals from a checkpoint file, casting from one basis to; another if needed. Useful for starting anion computations from neutral; orbitals, or after small geometry changes. At present, casting from a; different molecular point group is not supported.

Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt.; #!

The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After about 4 cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; ----------------------------------------------------------------------; Step Energy Delta(E) MAX force MAX Delta(q); ----------------------------------------------------------------------; 1 -76.026653665892 -76.026653665892 1.52e-02 1.52e-02; 2 -76.026907793199 -0.000254127307 9.55e-03 9.55e-03; 3 -76.027052927171 -0.000145133972 4.47e-04 4.47e-04; 4 -76.027053472137 -0.000000544965 1.16e-04 1.16e-04; ----------------------------------------------------------------------.

This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index.

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.17; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z; O 0.000 0.000 -0.067; H 0.000 0.416 0.536; H 0.000 -0.416 0.536. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate. (This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

Notice we have a couple of new keywords in the molecule specification.; no_reorient tells the program not to reorient the molecule; to a different coordinate system (this is important for SAPT to make; sure the same coordinate frame is used for the computations of the two; monomers and for the dimer). The next keyword tells PSI4 to run; in C1 point-group symmetry (i.e., without using symmetry), even if a; higher symmetry is detected. SAPT computations know to turn off; symmetry and fix orientation even without the user specifying these; molecule keywords.; Here’s the second half of the input:; set globals {; basis jun-cc-pVDZ; scf_type DF; freeze_core True; }. energy('sapt0').

This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity ).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3).

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.17; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z; O 0.000 0.000 -0.067; H 0.000 0.416 0.536; H 0.000 -0.416 0.536. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate. (This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider.

This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. But most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index. Note we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. The built-in; Psithon function cp() does it all for us, automatically.; And that’s it! The only remaining part of the example input is a little table; of the different R values and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) energies, converted from; atomic units (hartree) to kcal mol-1 by multiplying by the; automatically-defined conversion factor psi_hartree2kcalmol, which is; defined in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File. Notice the loop over to create; the table looks just like the loop over R to run the different; computations, and the CP-corrected energies ecp[R] are accessed the same; way they were stored.

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }. Notice we have a couple of new keywords in the molecule specification.; no_reorient tells the program not to reorient the molecule; to a different coordinate system (this is important for SAPT to make; sure the same coordinate frame is used for the computations of the two; monomers and for the dimer). The next keyword tells PSI4 to run; in C1 point-group symmetry (i.e., without using symmetry), even if a; higher symmetry is detected. SAPT computations know to turn off; symmetry and fix orientation even without the user specifying these; molecule keywords.; Here’s the second ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/tutorial-1.html

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

For your convenience, this example can be found in; tu1-h2o-energy.; You can run it if you wish.; Once PSI4 is in your path (see the User Configuration; section of the installation instructions), you can run this computation by typing; >>> psi4 input.dat output.dat.

Compiling and Installing).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information.; Notice that we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information; like the charge on the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity; (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference; wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree–Fock, or RHF, is usually; appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity ).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3).

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount.

The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index.

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.17; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z; O 0.000 0.000 -0.067; H 0.000 0.416 0.536; H 0.000 -0.416 0.536. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate. (This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

Notice we have a couple of new keywords in the molecule specification.; no_reorient tells the program not to reorient the molecule; to a different coordinate system (this is important for SAPT to make; sure the same coordinate frame is used for the computations of the two; monomers and for the dimer). The next keyword tells PSI4 to run; in C1 point-group symmetry (i.e., without using symmetry), even if a; higher symmetry is detected. SAPT computations know to turn off; symmetry and fix orientation even without the user specifying these; molecule keywords.; Here’s the second half of the input:; set globals {; basis jun-cc-pVDZ; scf_type DF; freeze_core True; }. energy('sapt0'). Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; set basis cc-pVDZ.

This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse functions ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/tutorial.html

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge. At; the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the; perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.; Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical; understanding about the interaction between the two monomers.

We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity ).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3).

This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. But most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

The built-in; Psithon function cp() does it all for us, automatically.; And that’s it! The only remaining part of the example input is a little table; of the different R values and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) energies, converted from; atomic units (hartree) to kcal mol-1 by multiplying by the; automatically-defined conversion factor psi_hartree2kcalmol, which is; defined in Sec.

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, first we must set up an input; using the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We can easily get the optimized geometry; from the previous computation. Looking at the output from running the; previous example, we see that the OH bond length is about 0.9463 Ångstroms,; and the bond angle is about 104.575 degrees. It’s good to give this many; digits (or more) to make sure there’s not significant roundoff error in the; geometry when running a frequency computation.

(This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary”. We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals.

The exchange contributions are positive; (repulsive). In this example, the most attractive contribution between; ethylene and acetylene is an electrostatic term of -2.12 kcal mol-1; (Elst10,r where the 1 indicates the first-order; perturbation theory result with respect to",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/tutorial.html

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge. At; the same time, the dispersion interaction should be smaller because the; perpendicular geometry does not allow much overlap between the monomers.; Hence, the SAPT analysis helps clarify (and quantify) our physical; understanding about the interaction between the two monomers.

In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as . In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation. As a consequence,; the pre-factor in the polynomial scaling becomes far larger than that; of the CIS(D) even though the quasi-degeneracy of the excited state is; properly accounted for in the ADC(2) model.; In PSI4 the quite efficient and flexible integral-transformation; library named libtrans is newly equipped and utilized in the; production level DCFT code.
