Interfaces: Enhancing PSI4 Capabilities. Interface to CFOUR by J. Stanton & J. Gauss¶; Code author: Lori A. Burns; Section author: Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples; PSI4 contains code to interface to the Cfour quantum chemistry suite of; John F. Stanton (U. Texas, Austin) and Jürgen Gauss (U. Mainz),; which is available after a license agreement from; http://www.cfour.de/. Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH. If PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error; will be reported. Caution; The p4c4 interface hasn’t been fully adapted for the new March 2014 version. Cfour for PSI4 Users¶. Set memory as usual; Set molecule as usual; Set basis set as usual (Cfour only cares about orbital basis, no fitting; bases); Set the task as usual, indicating Cfour as the intended code by; prepending “c4-” to the method argument.

(Though be aware that common; abbreviations like CALC and REF must be fully spelled out as; CFOUR_CALC_LEVEL and CFOUR_REFERENCE when used in; PSI4.); In limited trial cases, keywords nominally directed at non-Cfour modules; are translated into their Cfour counterparts.

Warning; Because p4c4 does not inspect the contents of the cfour {...}; block, once the user specifies a PSI4-style molecule, the; interface cannot judge whether a sandwich mode (drop the PSI4 molecule; and use the cfour block as the entirety of the ZMAT) or a standard mode; (translate the PSI4 molecule and append additional input from the; cfour block) is intended. The latter is what actually occurs. If; there is both a PSI4 molecule and a molecule in the cfour block,; ZMAT will end up with multiple molecules and multiple *CFOUR(...); blocks, and it will not run. Therefore, if mixing sandwich and; standard or pure-PSI4 computations in an input file, place all; the sandwich jobs at the beginning before declaring PSI4; molecules. If necessary, clear the cfour block with cfour {} before; commencing standard P4C4 jobs.

Specifying a piece of input in PSI4 format is entering into; a contract that you mean it. In particular this applies to; molecule (including charge/multiplicity through molecule; optional_molecule_name {...}), memory (through memory; value unit), computational method (through . If Cfour keywords; are specified with values that contradict the PSI4 input,; execution is halted.; As an example, the input below is set up to fail in four ways:; contradictory specification of memory, multiplicity, computational; method, and derivative level.

Role — In PSI4, CheMPS2 is a library that provides additional; quantum chemical capabilities (DMRG).; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) CheMPS2; Upstream Dependencies — CheMPS2 \(\Leftarrow\) BLAS/LAPACK, HDF5 \(\Leftarrow\) zlib. CMake Variables. ENABLE_CheMPS2 — CMake variable toggling whether Psi4 builds with CheMPS2; CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For CheMPS2, set to an installation directory containing include/chemps2/DMRG.h; CheMPS2_DIR — CMake variable to specify where pre-built CheMPS2 can be found. Set to installation directory containing share/cmake/CheMPS2/CheMPS2Config.cmake; CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_CheMPS2 — CMake variable to force internal build of CheMPS2 instead of detecting pre-built; CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_CheMPS2 — CMake variable to force detecting pre-built CheMPS2 and not falling back on internal build.

Wouters¶; Code author: Sebastian Wouters; Section author: Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples. Note; As of late June 2016, DMRG keywords in PSI4 have been; realigned with those of the chemps2 executable, plus a; “dmrg_” prefix. The only exceptions are the orbital space; PSI4 keywords RESTRICTED_DOCC (formerly; CheMPS2 used FROZEN_DOCC, contrary to its; definition) and ACTIVE which are passed along to; CheMPS2 keywords NOCC and NACT. A translation table; is available. Installation¶; Binary. CheMPS2 is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell). If using the PSI4 binary, CheMPS2 has already been installed alongside. If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; CheMPS2 can be obtained through conda install chemps2.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect CheMPS2 and activate dependent code. Previous bullet had details. To build PSI4 from source and use; Libint from conda without thinking, consult sec:condapsi4dev. To remove a conda installation, conda remove chemps2. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want CheMPS2 built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code.

This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4’s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH.

Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda. This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4’s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The conda activate command (conda >=4.4; December 2017) works in all shells, but if you’re using old source activate that only works for bash; adjust as needed for csh/tcsh.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> conda activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4. The output for either of the installation commands above looks like the following. It checks what packages are needed, gets your approval for downloading them, fetches and installs them, prints out some useful information, and runs a PSI4 test case to check that al",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/conda.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/conda.html

Isocontour range for 85% of the density: (0.0787495,-0.0787495). The second line reports the isocontour values that capture 85% of the probability density using; the least amount of grid points. This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option |globals__cubeprop_isocontour_threshold|. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]; Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry.; DENSITY; This task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\), together; with the total density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) + \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\),; and the spin density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) - \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\).; BASIS_FUNCTIONS; This task is useful to produce cube files of the atomic orbital basis; functions \(\chi_\mu(\mathbf{r})\).; ESP; Calculates the total (nuclear + electronic) electrostatic potential; \(V(\mathbf{r})\). Note; The ESP task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis; via the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword.

Introduction¶; PSI4 has the ability to export cube files that store information about; basis functions, molecular orbitals, the electron density, and; the electrostatic potential (ESP). Cube files store the value of a scalar; quantity on a regular Cartesian grid, and can be visualized with several; visualization programs, some of which are free, like VMD; (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).; An example utilization of the code is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set scf_type df; set freeze_core True; set cubeprop_tasks ['orbitals']; set cubeprop_orbitals [5,6,-5,-6]. E, wfn = energy('scf', return_wfn=True); cubeprop(wfn). In this example, the cubeprop(); call after the energy('scf') command; executes the cubeprop code. The array CUBEPROP_TASKS specifies which; tasks should be executed. In this case the task 'orbitals' generates cube; files for orbitals. The CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option specifies that cube files; should be generated only for alpha orbitals 5 (HOMO) and 6 (LUMO) and; beta orbitals 5 (indicated as -5) and 6.; If the option CUBEPROP_ORBITALS is not provided, then cube files are; generated for all orbitals.; After running, the above input will generate four files: Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube,; Psi_a_6_4-A1.cube, Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube, and Psi_a_6_4-A1.cube. The subscript a in; Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube indicates an alpha orbital. The first number (5) is the index of the; orbital while 1-B1 indicates that this is the first orbital that belongs to the B1 irrep.; The file Psi_a_5_1-B1.cube begins with two comment lines:; 1; 2Psi4 Gaussian Cube File.; Property: Psi_a_5_1-B1.

The second line reports the isocontour values that capture 85% of the probability density using; the least amount of grid points. This quantity is determined for orbitals and densities. The; fraction of the density captured by the isocontour values is by default 0.85, but can; be changed via the option |globals__cubeprop_isocontour_threshold|. Note; If your cube plots are too coarse, try to decrease the grid spacing via; the option CUBIC_GRID_SPACING. If the edges of your plot are cut then; increase the size of the grid via the option CUBIC_GRID_OVERAGE. Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]; Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry.; DENSITY; This task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\), together; with the total density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) + \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\),; and the spin density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) - \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\).; BASIS_FUNCTIONS; This task is useful to produce cube files of the atomic orbital basis; functions \(\chi_\mu(\mathbf{r})\).; ESP; Calculates the total (nuclear + electronic) electrostatic potential; \(V(\mathbf{r})\). Note; The ESP task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis; via the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword. Warning; It is important to specify the CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option when; dealing with large molecules to avoid running out of disk space.; For example, using the default grid spacing of; 0.2 Ångström, the size of a single cube file for a molecule like water; is of the order of 1.4 MB.

Cubeprop Tasks¶; The cubeprop utility can be provided a list of tasks to perform.; Tasks are specified by the CUBEPROP_TASKS option, which is a list of strings; that identify the tasks. Several tasks are available. These include:. ORBITALS [Default if CUBEPROP_TASKS is not specified]; Produces cube representations of the molecular orbitals; \(\psi_q(\mathbf{r})\). Orbitals are sorted according to increasing; orbital energy ignoring symmetry.; DENSITY; This task can be used to obtain the alpha and beta electron densities,; \(\rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r})\) and \(\rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\), together; with the total density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) + \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\),; and the spin density; \(\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_\alpha(\mathbf{r}) - \rho_\beta(\mathbf{r})\).; BASIS_FUNCTIONS; This task is useful to produce cube files of the atomic orbital basis; functions \(\chi_\mu(\mathbf{r})\).; ESP; Calculates the total (nuclear + electronic) electrostatic potential; \(V(\mathbf{r})\). Note; The ESP task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis; via the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword. Warning; It is important to specify the CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option when; dealing with large molecules to avoid running out of disk space.; For example, using the default grid spacing of; 0.2 Ångström, the size of a single cube file for a molecule like water; is of the order of 1.4 MB.

Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the; AO_BASIS DISK option is recommended (set by default).; In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the AO_BASIS DISK option; is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm fo",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/dcft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/dcft-1.html

As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis. In order to do that one needs to set the AO_BASIS option to; DISK (currently used by default). For more recommendations on the choice of the algorithm see; Recommendations.

In DCFT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; \(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\) and a correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\):. \[\gamma_p^q = \kappa_p^q + \tau_p^q\]; The idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) corresponds to a mean-field Hartree–Fock-like density,; while the non-idempotent correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\); depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.; Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:. \[E_{DCFT} = \frac{1}{2} \left( h_p^q + f_p^q \right) \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{4} \bar{g}_{pq}^{rs} \lambda_{rs}^{pq}\]; where the antisymmetrized two-electron integrals and the generalized Fock operator; matrix elements were defined as follows:. \[\bar{g}_{pq}^{rs} = g_{pq}^{rs} - g_{pq}^{sr}\]. \[f_p^q = h_p^q + \bar{g}_{pr}^{qs} \gamma_{s}^{r}\]; Energy functional \(E_{DCFT}\) has several important properties. First,; the energy is now a function of two sets of independent parameters, the; idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) (\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\)) and the density cumulant; (\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\)). As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,; which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties.

The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive \({\cal O}(N^5)\) integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive \({\cal O}(N^6)\); cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis. In order to do that one needs to set the AO_BASIS option to; DISK (currently used by default). For more recommendations on the choice of the algorithm see; Recommendations. Analytic Gradients¶; Analytic gradients are available for the DC-06, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13 methods.; For DC-06, the evaluation of the analytic gradients requires the solution of the; coupled response equations. Two algorithms are available for their iterative; solution: TWOSTEP (default) and SIMULTANEOUS. These algorithms are similar to those; described for the orbital and cumulant updates in the Iterative Algorithms; section and usually exhibit similar efficiency. The choice of the algorithm can; be made using the RESPONSE_ALGORITHM option. For the DC-12 method the; analytic gradients are not yet available, one has to use numerical gradients to; perform the geometry optimizations.

If highly accurate results are desired, a; combination of the ODC-13 method with a three-particle energy correction; [\(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)] can be used (see below).; For the detailed comparison of the quality of these methods we refer; users to our publications.; The DCFT functional can be specified by the DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option. The; default choice is the ODC-12 functional. In addition to five methods listed; above, DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option can be set to CEPA0 (coupled electron; pair approximation zero, equivalent to linearized coupled cluster doubles; method, LCCD). CEPA0 can be considered as a particular case of the DC-06 and DC-12; methods in the limit of zero non-idempotency of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\). This option has a limited; functionality and should only be used for test purposes. For the production-level CEPA0 code, see the; OCC module. The DCFT code can also be used to; compute the \((\lambda_3)\) energy correction that perturbatively accounts; for three-particle correlation effects, similarly to the (T) correction in coupled; cluster theory. Computation of the \((\lambda_3)\) correction can be; requested by setting the THREE_PARTICLE option to PERTURBATIVE. A; combination of the ODC-13 functional with the \((\lambda_3)\) correction; [denoted as \(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)] has been shown to provide highly; accurate results for open-shell molecules near equilibrium geometries.; At the present moment, all of the DCFT methods support unrestricted reference; orbitals (REFERENCE UHF), which can be used to perform energy and; gradient computations for both closed- and open-shell molecules.

In DCFT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; \(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\) and a correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\):. \[\gamma_p^q = \kappa_p^q + \tau_p^q\]; The idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) corresponds to a mean-field Hartree–Fock-like density,; while the non-idempotent correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\); depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.; Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:. \[E_{DCFT} = \frac{1}{2} \left( h_p^q + f_p^q \right) \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{4} \ba",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/dcft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/dcft-1.html

First,; the energy is now a function of two sets of independent parameters, the; idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) (\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\)) and the density cumulant; (\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\)). As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,; which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCFT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent.

This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm fo",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/dcft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/dcft.html

Setting the QC_TYPE; option to TWOSTEP will perform the Newton-Raphson update only for the orbitals,; while the equations for the cumulant will be solved using a standard Jacobi update.; If requested by the user (set QC_COUPLING to TRUE), the electronic Hessian can include; matrix elements that couple the orbitals and the density cumulant.; The computation of these coupling elements increases; the cost of the macroiteration, but usually leads to faster convergence and is; recommended for open-shell systems.; It is important to note that the quadratically-convergent algorithm is not yet fully; optimized and often converges slowly when the RMS of the cumulant or; the orbital gradient is below \(10^{-7}\). The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive \({\cal O}(N^5)\) integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive \({\cal O}(N^6)\); cumulant updates.

Setting the QC_TYPE; option to TWOSTEP will perform the Newton-Raphson update only for the orbitals,; while the equations for the cumulant will be solved using a standard Jacobi update.; If requested by the user (set QC_COUPLING to TRUE), the electronic Hessian can include; matrix elements that couple the orbitals and the density cumulant.; The computation of these coupling elements increases; the cost of the macroiteration, but usually leads to faster convergence and is; recommended for open-shell systems.; It is important to note that the quadratically-convergent algorithm is not yet fully; optimized and often converges slowly when the RMS of the cumulant or; the orbital gradient is below \(10^{-7}\). The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive \({\cal O}(N^5)\) integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive \({\cal O}(N^6)\); cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis.

The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive \({\cal O}(N^5)\) integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive \({\cal O}(N^6)\); cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis. In order to do that one needs to set the AO_BASIS option to; DISK (currently used by default). For more recommendations on the choice of the algorithm see; Recommendations. Analytic Gradients¶; Analytic gradients are available for the DC-06, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13 methods.; For DC-06, the evaluation of the analytic gradients requires the solution of the; coupled response equations. Two algorithms are available for their iterative; solution: TWOSTEP (default) and SIMULTANEOUS. These algorithms are similar to those; described for the orbital and cumulant updates in the Iterative Algorithms; section and usually exhibit similar efficiency. The choice of the algorithm can; be made using the RESPONSE_ALGORITHM option. For the DC-12 method the; analytic gradients are not yet available, one has to use numerical gradients to; perform the geometry optimizations.

If highly accurate results are desired, a; combination of the ODC-13 method with a three-particle energy correction; [\(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)] can be used (see below).; For the detailed comparison of the quality of these methods we refer; users to our publications.; The DCFT functional can be specified by the DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option. The; default choice is the ODC-12 functional. In addition to five methods listed; above, DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option can be set to CEPA0 (coupled electron; pair approximation zero, equivalent to linearized coupled cluster doubles; method, LCCD). CEPA0 can be considered as a particular case of the DC-06 and DC-12; methods in the limit of zero non-idempotency of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\). This option has a limited; functionality and should only be used for test purposes. For the production-level CEPA0 code, see the; OCC module. The DCFT code can also be used to; compute the \((\lambda_3)\) energy correction that perturbatively accounts; for three-particle correlation effects, similarly to the (T) correction in coupled; cluster theory. Computation of the \((\lambda_3)\) correction can be; requested by setting the THREE_PARTICLE option to PERTURBATIVE. A; combination of the ODC-13 functional with the \((\lambda_3)\) correction; [denoted as \(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)] has been shown to provide highly; accurate results for open-shell molecules near equilibrium geometries.; At the present moment, all of the DCFT methods support unrestricted reference; orbitals (REFERENCE UHF), which can be used to perform energy and; gradient computations for both closed- and open-shell molecules.

Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements \(\gamma_p^q\) and; \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCFT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; \(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\) and a correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\):. \[\gamma_p^q = \kappa_p^q + \tau_p^q\]; The idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) corresponds to a mean-field Hartree–Fock-like density,; while the non-idempotent correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\); depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.; Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:. \[E_{DCFT} = \frac{1}{2} \left( h_p^q + f_p^q \right) \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{4} \ba",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/dcft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/dcft.html

First,; the energy is now a function of two sets of independent parameters, the; idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) (\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\)) and the density cumulant; (\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\)). As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,; which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCFT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability; problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) is; N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\).; In order to obtain the DCFT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:. The energy must be stationary with respect to a set of orbitals. This can be done by; diagonalizing the generalized Fock operator (as in the DC-06 and DC-12 methods, see below),; which introduces partial orbital relaxation, or by fully relaxing the orbitals and minimizing the entire energy expression; (as in the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods).; The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density; cumulant \(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\), constrained to N-representability conditions. Making the energy stationary requires solution of two sets of coupled; equations for orbitals and density cumulant, respectively (also known as; residual equations).

Arbitrary Order Coupled-Cluster Theory¶; This DETCI-based version of this feature is not yet released. However,; the current version of the code does include an interface to; Kallay’s MRCC code.; The DETCI module is also capable of computing arbitrary-order; coupled-cluster energies, using an approach similar to that of Hirata; and Bartlett [Hirata:2000:216], or of Olsen [Olsen:2000:7140].; Notably, the approach in DETCI also allows arbitrary-order; active space coupled-cluster procedures. The general algorithm; for doing this in DETCI is inefficient compared to optimized; lower-order coupled-cluster codes and should not be used for CCSD,; where the CCENERGY module is much more efficient. For higher-order; CC (like CCSDT and beyond), the code is also not as efficient as the; MRCC code by Kállay, to which PSI4 can interface (see Section; Interface to MRCC by M. Kállay); however, it may allow certain truncations of the model; space that might not be available presently in MRCC. For very small; systems, the code can be useful for testing of, for example, CCSDTQ or; its active-space CCSDtq analog [Piecuch:1999:6103].; To perform arbitrary-order coupled-cluster, set the DETCI; option CC to TRUE, and set; CC_EX_LEVEL (note: not EX_LEVEL); to the desired coupled-cluster excitation level, and invoke; energy('detci').

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is describe",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/detci-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/detci-1.html

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is describe",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/detci-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/detci-1.html

The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI]. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations. Instead, emphasis; has been placed on developing a very efficient program to handle more; general CI wavefunctions which may be helpful in more challenging cases; such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions.

This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy.

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is describe",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/detci.html

Instead, emphasis; has been placed on developing a very efficient program to handle more; general CI wavefunctions which may be helpful in more challenging cases; such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions. The CI; code is based on the fast, determinant-based string formalism; of Handy [Handy:1980]. It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI’s. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than \(n\) holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than \(m\) electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. It can also perform approximate; CASSCF computations in which one uses RAS restrictions on the CI excitations,; rather than doing a full CI in the active space. This is called a; RASSCF.

Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI].

A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than \(n\) holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than \(m\) electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. It can also perform approximate; CASSCF computations in which one uses RAS restrictions on the CI excitations,; rather than doing a full CI in the active space. This is called a; RASSCF. CASSCF and RASSCF computations are types of multi-configurational; self-consistent-field procedures, and are described in sec:mcscf.; As mentioned above, the DETCI module is designed for challenging; chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable.

Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference. An efficient,; threaded, disk-based DF-MP2 code is available in PSI4 for all single; reference types available in the SCF module.; MP2 defaults in PSI4 to the density-fitted code.

Functionals more than; slightly different are B97-D, wB97X (note, not wB97X-D), SOGGA,; DFDL, and M05. Theory¶; Generalized Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) [Kohn:1965:A1133] [Parr:1989] is one of the primary; workhorses of modern computational chemistry due to its phenomenal accuracy/cost; ratio.; Pure Kohn–Sham DFT is built on the Hohenberg–Kohn theorems [Hohenberg:1964:136] which states: A) the energy is a universal; functional of the one-particle electronic density and B) there exists a set of; noninteracting quasiparticles with the same density as the true set of; electrons, with the quasiparticle states determined as eigenvectors of an; effective one-body potential encapsulating the true \(N\)-body quantum; effects. The former idea allows the electronic density to be dealt with instead; of the much more complicated wavefunction, while the latter allows for the; treatment of the troublesome kinetic energy term via the implicit one-body; Kohn–Sham orbitals. KS-DFT borrows much of the machinery of Hartree–Fock, as is; evident by looking at the energy expression,. \[\begin{split}E_{\mathrm{KS}}; &= \sum_{i} \langle i | \hat h | i \rangle; + \frac 1 2 \sum_{i,j} [ii|jj] + E_{\mathrm{xc}} [\rho_\alpha, \rho_\beta] \\; &= D_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{T}}\left(T_{\mu\nu} +; V_{\mu\nu}\right) + \frac{1}{2} D_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/dft-1.html

From a; physics perspective, this implementation of wPBE is extremely useful for; theoretical investigations, as it is parameter free, and properly integrated; against the partition function in the exchange hole.

For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-12.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled. We hope to have a patch for this deficit soon. Please let us; know if you have a strong need for this capability, and we will move the; priority up.

Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds.

This; often cleans up the MSIE problem for a surprisingly large number of high-lying; occupied orbitals, as determined by fractional particle curves. Other gap; fitting techniques involving the electron affinity or band gap are sometimes; also used. IP-fitting is found to be particularly critical for the qualitative; determination of excited state ordering in many low band-gap systems.; For dispersion-bound complexes, a very simple additive empirical dispersion; potential, based on a damped Lennard-Jones potential can often produce; remarkably accurate results with KS-DFT. This approach was championed by Grimme,; whose “-D2” and more modern “-D3” approaches are a de facto industry standards. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a KS-DFT computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('b3lyp') (or other valid functional name):; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('b3lyp'). This will run a B3LYP Restricted Kohn–Sham (RKS) on neutral singlet Helium in; \(D_{2h}\) spatial symmetry with a minimal STO-3G basis, 1.0E-6 energy; and density convergence criteria, a DF ERI algorithm, symmetric; orthogonalization, DIIS, and a core Hamiltonian guess (because single atom). For more information on; any of these options, see the relevant section below, or in the preceding; Hartree–Fock section. Spin/Symmetry Treatment¶; PSI4 implements the most popular spin specializations of KS-DFT, including:.

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS. This; is because ROHF is implicitly assumed to be followed by a correlated method; which can break the positive definiteness of the spin polarization. KS-DFT with; the true functional is expected to be the final step, thus restricting the; solution to positive definite spin polarization is not physical. See the; section in [Szabo:1982] on methyl radical for an example. Functional Selection¶; PSI4 features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call:; 1energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; REFERENCE option before the call to energy:; 1; 2set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by calling energy (or any other keyword); with a dft_functional argument:; 1energy('scf', dft_functional = 'b3lyp'). Another alternative is providing a specially crafted dict-ionary to the dft_functional; argument:; 1; 2custom_functional = { ""name"": ""my_unique_name"", ... }; energy('scf', dft_functional = custom_functional). For further details about this so called dict_func syntax, see; :ref: Advanced Functional Use and Manipulation.; For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; DFT_ALPHA option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree–Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the DFT_OMEGA option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional.; ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/dft-1.html

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled.

IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # IP fitting runs in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Optional arguments are minimum omega, maximum omega, molecule object; omega = ip_fitting('wb97', 0.4, 2.0, molecule=h2o). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0.

Dispersion Corrections¶; DFT-D dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here.; DFT-NL dispersion corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D.

In this case, atom-centered numerical quadratures are used to; evaluate the Kohn–Sham potentials and energies to a high degree of accuracy. The; evaluation of these numerical integrals can be made to be linear scaling with a; reasonable amount of cleverness (mostly related to the fact that the basis; functions decay exponentially), meaning that the Coulomb and diagonalization; steps become rate limiting. This enormous potential speed gain over Hartree–Fock; with potentially exact treatment of electron correlation for “free” was one of; the primary motivations for KS-DFT’s adoption by chemists in the late 1980s and; early 1990s.; Unfortunately, local KS-DFT exhibits several spectacular failures, most of which; stem from the exponential decay of the local Kohn–Sham potential, which cannot; encapsulate long-range information in the exchange and correlation holes.

The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled. We hope to have a patch for this deficit soon. Please let us; know if you have a strong need for this capability, and we will move the; priority up. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # IP fitting runs in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Optional arguments are minimum omega, maximum o",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/dft.html

PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral. An example is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17molecule h2o {; 0 1 # must be neutral; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; # FRAC jobs will be be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do all kinds of weird stuff; basis aug-cc-pvdz # Augmented functions are very important on the anion side; scf_type df; }. # Argument is functional.; # Many optional arguments are available, see the python file; frac_traverse('wb97', molecule=h2o).

A -D functional (Such; as the much cheaper B97-D) should be used instead.; Hybrid Functionals; Many common hybrid functionals, including the ubiquitous B3LYP. PBE0 and the; B97 series are also quite good for many thermochemical problems.; LRC Functionals; LRC functionals are a particular area of interest of the PSI4 DFT team.; LRC functionals are all denoted by a lower-case “w” in front of the standard DFA; functional, such as wPBE. We offer a stable implementation of the Gill; association function for wS and Head-Gordon’s wB97/wB97X functionals.; Additionally, we are pleased to have recently completed a heavily conditioned; implementation of the HJS exchange-hole model, which provides an analytical form; for the short-range enhancement factor for wPBE, wPBEsol, and wB88. From a; physics perspective, this implementation of wPBE is extremely useful for; theoretical investigations, as it is parameter free, and properly integrated; against the partition function in the exchange hole.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes. Pruned grids are; not yet available, but we have plans.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take on",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/dft.html

The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial points; are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integer (typically 50-100). The radial grids are “centered” on the Bragg-Slater; radius of each atom, as described in Becke’s 1988 paper. If inaccurate; integration is suspected in systems with anions or very diffuse basis functions,; the DFT_BS_RADIUS_ALPHA option may be increased from 1.0 to a larger value to; force the radial grid to span a larger extent in space.; The atomic weighting scheme is controlled by the DFT_NUCLEAR_SCHEME; option, which may be one of TREUTLER, BECKE, or NAIVE.; Once the molecular quadrature grid is built, the points are partitioned into; blocks of points which are spatially close to each other.

This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\). This small test case has a tuned; \(\omega\) of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0. Larger systems,; particularly conjugated systems, will typically have an optimized \(\omega\); between 0.1 and 0.5. Fractional Particle Curves¶; The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies. PSI4 features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number \(N\).; Two python macros exist for this code. The first is frac_traverse(), which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral.

Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D.

Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces. Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, \(E_{disp} = -C_6/R^6; -C_8/R^8 -C_{10}/R^{10}-\cdots\). The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; \(C_6^{ij}\), obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, \(R_{ij}\), modulated; by a damping function, \(f_{damp}(R_{ij})\), that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by \(\alpha_6\)); over a distance characterized by the sum of the two atomic vdW radii,; \(R_{vdW}\), while an overall scaling term, \(s_6\), is optimized; to be unique to each \(E_{xc}\) functional. (\(\alpha_6\) is; sometimes allowed to vary as well.). (1)¶\[E_{disp}^{\text{D2}}=-s_6 \sum_{i,j>i}^{N_{at}} \frac{C_6^{ij}}{(R_{ij})^6} f_{damp}(R_{ij})\]. \[f_{damp}(R_{ij}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{- \alpha_6 (R_{ij}/R_{vdW} - 1)}}\]; Grimme recently presented a refined method, DFT-D3, [Grimme:2010:154104]; which incorporates an additional \(R^{-8}\) term in the dispersion; series and adjusts the \(C_{6}^{ij}\) combination formula and damping; function.

From version 3.1.0 onwards, DFTD3 can; be used as-is; for earlier versions, patches are available:; psi4/psi4/share/psi4/scripts/patch_grimme_dftd3.3.0.2. To be used by PSI4, the program binary (dftd3) must be; found in your PSIPATH or PATH (in that order). If; PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error will be reported.; To preferentially use a particular dftd3 compilation, simply adjust its; position in the path environment variables. Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces. Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, \(E_{disp} = -C_6/R^6; -C_8/R^8 -C_{10}/R^{10}-\cdots\). The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; \(C_6^{ij}\), obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, \(R_{ij}\), modulated; by a damping function, \(f_{damp}(R_{ij})\), that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by \(\alpha_6\)); over a distance characterized by the sum of the two atomic vdW radii,; \(R_{vdW}\), while an overall scaling term, \(s_6\), is optimized; to be unique to each \(E_{xc}\) functional. (\(\alpha_6\) is; sometimes allowed to vary as well.). (1)¶\[E_{disp}^{\text{D2}}=-s_6 \sum_{i,j>i}^{N_{at}} \frac{C_6^{ij}}{(R_{ij})^6} f_{damp}(R_{ij})\]. \[f_{damp}(R_{ij}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{- \alpha_6 (R_{ij}/R_{vdW} - 1)}}\]; Grimme recently presented a refin",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.2.1/dftd3.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.2.1/dftd3.html

The parameters; fit for individual functionals are now \(s_6\), \(s_8\),; \(a_1\), and \(a_2\). \[E_{disp}^{\text{D3BJ}}=-\sum_{n=6,8} s_n \sum_{i,j>i}^{N_{at}}; \frac{C_n^{ij}}{(R_{ij})^n + (f_{damp})^n}\]. \[f_{damp} = a_1 \sqrt{\frac{C_8^{ij}}{C_6^{ij}}} + a_2\]; All parameters characterizing the dispersion correction are taken from; http://toc.uni-muenster.de/DFTD3/; or else from the literature. Running DFTD3¶; A number of a posteriori dispersion corrections are available in; PSI4. While most are computed within PSI4’s codebase (-D1, -D2,; -CHG, -DAS2009, -DAS2010), the -D3 correction and its variants are; available only through the DFTD3 program. Once installed, the; dftd3/PSI4 interface is transparent, and all corrections are; interfaced exactly alike.; Dispersion corrections are built into DFT functionals, so appending an a; posteriori correction to a computation is as simple as; energy('b2plyp-d') vs. energy('b2plyp'). For example, the; following input file computes (with much redundant work) for water a; B3LYP, a B3LYP-D2, and a B3LYP-D3 (zero-damping) energy.; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11molecule h2o {; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }; set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }; energy('b3lyp'); energy('b3lyp-d'); energy('b3lyp-d3'). Consult the table -D Functionals to see for each; functional what corrections are available and what default parameters; define them. The dispersion correction is available after a calculation in; the PSI variable DISPERSION CORRECTION ENERGY.; By default, the output from the dftd3; program is suppressed; to see it in the output file, set print > 2.
