CheMPS2 is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell). If using the PSI4 binary, CheMPS2 has already been installed alongside. If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; CheMPS2 can be obtained through conda install chemps2.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect CheMPS2 and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove chemps2. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want CheMPS2 built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code.

Wouters¶; Code author: Sebastian Wouters; Section author: Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples. Note; As of late June 2016, DMRG keywords in PSI4 have been; realigned with those of the chemps2 executable, plus a; “dmrg_” prefix. The only exceptions are the orbital space; PSI4 keywords RESTRICTED_DOCC (formerly; CheMPS2 used FROZEN_DOCC, contrary to its; definition) and ACTIVE which are passed along to; CheMPS2 keywords NOCC and NACT. A translation table; is available. Installation¶; Binary. CheMPS2 is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell). If using the PSI4 binary, CheMPS2 has already been installed alongside. If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; CheMPS2 can be obtained through conda install chemps2.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect CheMPS2 and activate dependent code. To remove a conda installation, conda remove chemps2. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want CheMPS2 built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code.

Role — In PSI4, CheMPS2 is a library that provides additional; quantum chemical capabilities (DMRG).; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) CheMPS2; Upstream Dependencies — CheMPS2 \(\Leftarrow\) HDF5 \(\Leftarrow\) zlib. CMake Variables. ENABLE_CheMPS2 — CMake variable toggling whether Psi4 builds with CheMPS2; CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For CheMPS2, set to an installation directory containing include/chemps2/DMRG.h; CheMPS2_DIR — CMake variable to specify where pre-built CheMPS2 can be found. Set to installation directory containing share/cmake/CheMPS2/CheMPS2Config.cmake; CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_CheMPS2 — CMake variable to force internal build of CheMPS2 instead of detecting pre-built.

In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The activate command only works in bash, so csh/tcsh will need corresponding adjustments.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> source activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4. The output for either of the installation commands above looks like the following. It checks what packages are needed, gets your approval for downloading them, fetches and installs them, prints out some useful information, and runs a PSI4 test case to check that all’s well.; >>> conda install psi4; Using Anaconda Cloud api site https://api.anaconda.org; Fetching package metadata: ......; Solving package specifications: .........

Similarly, the scratch directory (see Scratch Files and Elementary Restart) must be specified through:. defining PSI_SCRATCH in shell, ~/.bashrc, ~/.tcshrc, or PBS cmd file. Suitable values for these variables have been printed to screen during installation (see last codeblock in step 6). Useful Commands¶. Update to latest PSI4 version; 1>>> conda update psi4. Install into a conda environment “p4env” instead of “root”. Second command only works on bash; for csh/tsch, setenv PATH /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin:$PATH instead. This creates a sandbox with just PSI4 and python (loaded as dependency).; 1; 2>>> conda create -y -n p4env psi4; >>> source activate p4env.

If the target computer doesn’t have libc >= 2.7 (released c.2007; for reference, 2.10 is newer than 2.7; unlike most libraries, libc generally not available in multiple versions on a computer), the PSI4 conda package won’t work.; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6# unsuitable computer; >>> ldd --version; ldd (GNU libc) 2.5; # suitable computer; >>> ldd --version; ldd (GNU libc) 2.17.

Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The activate command only works in bash, so csh/tcsh will need corresponding adjustments.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> source activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4. The output for either of the installation commands above looks like the following. It checks what packages are needed, gets your approval for downloading them, fetches and installs them, prints out some useful information, and runs a PSI4 test case to chec",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/conda-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/conda-1.html

Installation and Runtime Configuration. Conda Binary Distribution¶; PSI4 is available as a pre-compiled binary for Mac and Linux (and; Windows, through the Ubuntu shell) architectures; through Continuum Analytics, the company that produces; Anaconda Python (a; full-fledged scientific python environment with package manager conda) and, more particularly, Miniconda (a lightweight python; distribution with same package manager conda). Some nice features for us:. cross-platform; no root, administrator, or sudo access required; built with high-performance math libraries; lightweight software stack (<100 MB w/o PSI4; ~1 GB including PSI4, numpy, and MKL); updated nightly so new features accessible; standardizes python distribution so no need to find/install libpython packages; add-ons (plugins, extra features requiring Fortran compiler, etc.) can be made available as conda packages; develop PSI4 through plugins without a pre-existing development environment, see Creating a New Plugin Using a Conda Pre-compiled Binary.

Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda.

If your main conda is not python=2.7, then PSI4 must be installed into a conda environment. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH.

Hence the creation of the environment; above, but the environment name (p4env above) can be; substituted.; Only reason for psi4-rt package is to get the QC runtime; add-ons; could say dftd3 gcp v2rdm_casscf instead of psi4-rt;; or leave them out if you don’t want them. How to update a Psi4 binary¶; Conda command to update an existing PSI4 conda installation to the; newest stable release (roughly annually).

This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. If your main conda is not python=2.7, then PSI4 must be installed into a conda environment.

By default the script will search for cube files in the directory in which it is called.; In addition to individual image files for each orbital, vmd_cube will also generate an image containing all surfaces in an array; (very useful for hand-picking orbital spaces). As an example, take the cube files generated from the water calculation from the above input file.; Using vmd_cube the alpha molecular orbitals can be rendered and output in one image with:. python vmd_cube.py /path/to/cube/files/ –opacity=0.5 –rx=90 –ry=60; The desired image in this case is called “AlphaMOs.tga”, and looks like this:.

Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the; AO_BASIS DISK option is recommended (set by default).; In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the AO_BASIS DISK option; is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm fo",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft-1.html

While in the DC-06 and ODC-06 methods \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\) is derived from the density cumulant; in an approximate way (labelled by ‘06’), the DC-12 and ODC-12 methods derive this contribution exactly, and; take full advantage of the N-representability conditions (which is denoted by ‘12’). The corresponding DC and ODC methods; have similar description of the \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) N-representability, but differ in describing the orbital relaxation:; the former methods account for the relaxation only partially, while the latter fully relax the orbitals.; Both DC-06 and DC-12 methods have similar computational cost, same is true when comparing ODC-06 and ODC-12.; Meanwhile, the DC methods are generally more efficient than their ODC analogs, due to a more expensive orbital update step; needed for the full orbital optimization.

Making the energy stationary requires solution of two sets of coupled; equations for orbitals and density cumulant, respectively (also known as; residual equations). At the present moment, three different algorithms for the; solution of the system of coupled equations are available (see; Iterative Algorithms for details).; Publications resulting from the use of the DCFT code should cite contributions; listed here. Methods¶; Currently five DCFT methods (functionals) are available: DC-06, DC-12, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13.

The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive \({\cal O}(N^5)\) integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive \({\cal O}(N^6)\); cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis. In order to do that one needs to set the AO_BASIS option to; DISK (currently used by default). For more recommendations on the choice of the algorithm see; Recommendations. Analytic Gradients¶; Analytic gradients are available for the DC-06, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13 methods.; For DC-06, the evaluation of the analytic gradients requires the solution of the; coupled response equations.

If highly accurate results are desired, a; combination of the ODC-13 method with a three-particle energy correction; [\(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)] can be used (see below).; For the detailed comparison of the quality of these methods we refer; users to our publications.; The DCFT functional can be specified by the DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option. The; default choice is the ODC-12 functional. In addition to five methods listed; above, DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option can be set to CEPA0 (coupled electron; pair approximation zero, equivalent to linearized coupled cluster doubles; method, LCCD). CEPA0 can be considered as a particular case of the DC-06 and DC-12; methods in the limit of zero non-idempotency of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\). This option has a limited; functionality and should only be used for test purposes. For the production-level CEPA0 code, see the; OCC module.

The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCFT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent.

This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm fo",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft.html

A; combination of the ODC-13 functional with the \((\lambda_3)\) correction; [denoted as \(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)] has been shown to provide highly; accurate results for open-shell molecules near equilibrium geometries.; At the present moment, all of the DCFT methods support unrestricted reference; orbitals (REFERENCE UHF), which can be used to perform energy and; gradient computations for both closed- and open-shell molecules. In addition,; the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods support restricted reference orbitals; (REFERENCE RHF) for the energy and gradient computations of; closed-shell molecules. Note that in this case restricted reference orbitals; are only available for ALGORITHM SIMULTANEOUS. Iterative Algorithms¶; As explained in the Theory section, in order to obtain the DCFT energy one; needs to solve a system of coupled equations for orbitals and density; cumulant. At the present moment three iterative algorithms for the solution of the; equations are available. The choice of the algorithm is controlled using the; ALGORITHM option. SIMULTANEOUS [Default]; In the simultaneous algorithm the DCFT equations are solved in macroiterations.; Each macroiteration consists of a single iteration of the cumulant update; followed by a single iteration of the orbital update and orbital transformation; of the integrals. The macroiterations are repeated until the simultaneous; convergence of the cumulant and orbitals is achieved.; Convergence of the simultaneous algorithm is accelerated using the; DIIS extrapolation technique.; TWOSTEP; In the two-step algorithm each macroiteration consists of two sets of; microiterations. In the first set, the density cumulant equations are solved; iteratively, while the orbitals are kept fixed. After the density cumulant is; converged, t",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft.html
https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft.html:11110,Energy Efficiency,energy,energy,11110,"od, where only the; product of the electronic Hessian with the step vector is computed for; efficiency. By default, the electronic Hessian is build for both the cumulant and orbital; updates and both updates are performed simultaneously. Setting the QC_TYPE; option to TWOSTEP will perform the Newton-Raphson update only for the orbitals,; while the equations for the cumulant will be solved using a standard Jacobi update.; If requested by the user (set QC_COUPLING to TRUE), the electronic Hessian can include; matrix elements that couple the orbitals and the density cumulant.; The computation of these coupling elements increases; the cost of the macroiteration, but usually leads to faster convergence and is; recommended for open-shell systems.; It is important to note that the quadratically-convergent algorithm is not yet fully; optimized and often converges slowly when the RMS of the cumulant or; the orbital gradient is below \(10^{-7}\). The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive \({\cal O}(N^5)\) integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive \({\cal O}(N^6)\); cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis. In order to do that one needs to set the AO_BASIS option to; DISK (currently used by default). For more recommendations on the choice of the algorithm see; Recommendations.

The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive \({\cal O}(N^5)\) integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive \({\cal O}(N^6)\); cumulant updates. As a result, for small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for larger systems and molecules with; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm.; Efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; \((vv|vv)\) and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis. In order to do that one needs to set the AO_BASIS option to; DISK (currently used by default). For more recommendations on the choice of the algorithm see; Recommendations. Analytic Gradients¶; Analytic gradients are available for the DC-06, ODC-06, ODC-12, and ODC-13 methods.; For DC-06, the evaluation of the analytic gradients requires the solution of the; coupled response equations. Two algorithms are available for their iterative; solution: TWOSTEP (default) and SIMULTANEOUS. These algorithms are similar to those; described for the orbital and cumulant updates in the Iterative Algorithms; section and usually exhibit similar efficiency. The choice of the algorithm can; be made using the RESPONSE_ALGORITHM option. For the DC-12 method the; analytic gradients are not yet available, one has to use numerical gradients to; perform the geometry optimizations. For the ODC-06",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft.html

If highly accurate results are desired, a; combination of the ODC-13 method with a three-particle energy correction; [\(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)] can be used (see below).; For the detailed comparison of the quality of these methods we refer; users to our publications.; The DCFT functional can be specified by the DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option. The; default choice is the ODC-12 functional. In addition to five methods listed; above, DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option can be set to CEPA0 (coupled electron; pair approximation zero, equivalent to linearized coupled cluster doubles; method, LCCD). CEPA0 can be considered as a particular case of the DC-06 and DC-12; methods in the limit of zero non-idempotency of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\). This option has a limited; functionality and should only be used for test purposes. For the production-level CEPA0 code, see the; OCC module. The DCFT code can also be used to; compute the \((\lambda_3)\) energy correction that perturbatively accounts; for three-particle correlation effects, similarly to the (T) correction in coupled; cluster theory.

A; combination of the ODC-13 functional with the \((\lambda_3)\) correction; [denoted as \(\mbox{ODC-13$(\lambda_3)$}\)] has been shown to provide highly; accurate results for open-shell molecules near equilibrium geometries.; At the present moment, all of the DCFT methods support unrestricted reference; orbitals (REFERENCE UHF), which can be used to perform energy and; gradient computations for both closed- and open-shell molecules.

Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements \(\gamma_p^q\) and; \(\gamma_{pq}^{rs}\) cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCFT, one takes a different route and; replaces \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\) in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. \[\lambda_{pq}^{rs} = \gamma_{pq}^{rs} - \gamma_p^r \gamma_q^s + \gamma_p^s \gamma_q^r\]; The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; \(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\) and a correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\):. \[\gamma_p^q = \kappa_p^q + \tau_p^q\]; The idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) corresponds to a mean-field Hartree–Fock-like density,; while the non-idempotent correction \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\); depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.; Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:. \[E_{DCFT} = \frac{1}{2} \left( h_p^q + f_p^q \right) \gamma_q^p + \frac{1}{4} \ba",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/dcft.html

First,; the energy is now a function of two sets of independent parameters, the; idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) (\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\)) and the density cumulant; (\(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\)). As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,; which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCFT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability; problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) is; N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_2}\).; In order to obtain the DCFT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:. The energy must be stationary with respect to a set of orbitals. This can be done by; diagonalizing the generalized Fock operator (as in the DC-06 and DC-12 methods, see below),; which introduces partial orbital relaxation, or by fully relaxing the orbitals and minimizing the entire energy expression; (as in the ODC-06 and ODC-12 methods).; The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density; cumulant \(\boldsymbol{\lambda_2}\), constrained to N-representability conditions. Making the energy stationary requires solution of two sets of coupled; equations for orbitals and density cumulant, respectively (also known as; residual equations).

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/detci-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/detci-1.html

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/detci-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/detci-1.html

For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations. Instead, emphasis; has been placed on developing a very efficient program to handle more; general CI wavefunctions which may be helpful in more challenging cases; such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions.

Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:.

However, please; note that these computations are essentially doing high-order CI (up to; full CI) computations to obtain these results, and hence they will only; be possible for very small systems (generally a dozen electrons or less).; The simplest way to run high-order perturbation theory computations is to; call, e.g., energy('mp10') to invoke a MP10 computation or; energy('zapt25') to invoke a ZAPT25 computation. This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values.

Arbitrary Order Coupled-Cluster Theory¶; This DETCI-based version of this feature is not yet released. However,; the current version of the code does include an interface to; Kallay’s MRCC code.; The DETCI module is also capable of computing arbitrary-order; coupled-cluster energies, using an approach similar to that of Hirata; and Bartlett [Hirata:2000:216], or of Olsen [Olsen:2000:7140].; Notably, the approach in DETCI also allows arbitrary-order; active space coupled-cluster procedures. The general algorithm; for doing this in DETCI is inefficient compared to optimized; lower-order coupled-cluster codes and should not be used for CCSD,; where the CCENERGY module is much more efficient. For higher-order; CC (like CCSDT and beyond), the code is also not as efficient as the; MRCC code by Kállay, to which PSI4 can interface (see Section; Interface to MRCC by M. Kállay); however, it may allow certain truncations of the model; space that might not be available presently in MRCC. For very small; systems, the code can be useful for testing of, for example, CCSDTQ or; its active-space CCSDtq analog [Piecuch:1999:6103].; To perform arbitrary-order coupled-cluster, set the DETCI; option CC to TRUE, and set; CC_EX_LEVEL (note: not EX_LEVEL); to the desired coupled-cluster excitation level, and invoke; energy('detci'). Various other DETCI options have a similar; option for coupled-cluster, usually named beginning with CC. The full; list of options is given in Appendix DETCI. table of contents.

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/detci.html

For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations. Instead, emphasis; has been placed on developing a very efficient program to handle more; general CI wavefunctions which may be helpful in more challenging cases; such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions.

Instead, emphasis; has been placed on developing a very efficient program to handle more; general CI wavefunctions which may be helpful in more challenging cases; such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions. The CI; code is based on the fast, determinant-based string formalism; of Handy [Handy:1980]. It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI’s. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than \(n\) holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than \(m\) electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III).

The general algorithm; for doing this in DETCI is inefficient compared to optimized; lower-order coupled-cluster codes and should not be used for CCSD,; where the CCENERGY module is much more efficient. For higher-order; CC (like CCSDT and beyond), the code is also not as efficient as the; MRCC code by Kállay, to which PSI4 can interface (see Section; Interface to MRCC by M. Kállay); however, it may allow certain truncations of the model; space that might not be available presently in MRCC. For very small; systems, the code can be useful for testing of, for example, CCSDTQ or; its active-space CCSDtq analog [Piecuch:1999:6103].; To perform arbitrary-order coupled-cluster, set the DETCI; option CC to TRUE, and set; CC_EX_LEVEL (note: not EX_LEVEL); to the desired coupled-cluster excitation level, and invoke; energy('detci'). Various other DETCI options have a similar; option for coupled-cluster, usually named beginning with CC. The full; list of options is given in Appendix DETCI. table of contents.

Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\), we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1)¶\[| \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab}; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots\]; The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly \(| \Phi_i^a \rangle\) and doubly; \(| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle\); substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; \(| \Phi_0 \rangle\). The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI]. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations. Instead, emphasis; has been placed on de",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/detci.html

A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than \(n\) holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than \(m\) electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. It can also perform approximate; CASSCF computations in which one uses RAS restrictions on the CI excitations,; rather than doing a full CI in the active space. This is called a; RASSCF. CASSCF and RASSCF computations are types of multi-configurational; self-consistent-field procedures, and are described in sec:mcscf.; As mentioned above, the DETCI module is designed for challenging; chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable. Because; CI wavefunctions which go beyond CISD (such as RAS CI) are fairly complex,; typically the DETCI code will be used in cases where the; tradeoffs between computational expense and completeness of the; model space are nontrivial.

Arbitrary Order Perturbation Theory¶; The DETCI module is capable of computing energies for arbitrary; order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MPn, for closed-shell; systems with an RHF reference) and for Z-averaged perturbation theory; (ZAPTn, open-shell systems with a ROHF reference). However, please; note that these computations are essentially doing high-order CI (up to; full CI) computations to obtain these results, and hence they will only; be possible for very small systems (generally a dozen electrons or less).; The simplest way to run high-order perturbation theory computations is to; call, e.g., energy('mp10') to invoke a MP10 computation or; energy('zapt25') to invoke a ZAPT25 computation. This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy. The program then; sets MAX_NUM_VECS to the required order in the; wavefunction.; By default, the requested n-th order energy is saved as the current; energy to the process environment.

The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial points; are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_POINTS option, which is any positive; integer (typically 50-100). The radial grids are “centered” on the Bragg-Slater; radius of each atom, as described in Becke’s 1988 paper. If inaccurate; integration is suspected in systems with anions or very diffuse basis functions,; the DFT_BS_RADIUS_ALPHA option may be increased from 1.0 to a larger value to; force the radial grid to span a larger extent in space.; The atomic weighting scheme is controlled by the DFT_NUCLEAR_SCHEME; option, which may be one of TREUTLER, BECKE, or NAIVE.; Once the molecular quadrature grid is built, the points are partitioned into; blocks of points which are spatially close to each other. We use an octree; algorithm for this procedure, which produces a good balance between spatial; compactness of each block (which helps achieve linear scaling due to the; exponential decay of the basis functions), and retaining a large number of; points in each block (which helps keep the FLOP rate up by allowing for a; reasonably large amount of BLAS3/BLAS2 work to form the densities and potentials; in each block). For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (a",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/dft.html

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled. We hope to have a patch for this deficit soon. Please let us; know if you have a strong need for this capability, and we will move the; priority up. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes. Pruned grids are; not yet available, but we have plans.; The default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled.

This enormous potential speed gain over Hartree–Fock; with potentially exact treatment of electron correlation for “free” was one of; the primary motivations for KS-DFT’s adoption by chemists in the late 1980s and; early 1990s.; Unfortunately, local KS-DFT exhibits several spectacular failures, most of which; stem from the exponential decay of the local Kohn–Sham potential, which cannot; encapsulate long-range information in the exchange and correlation holes.

We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds.

On the correlation; side, this is primarily observed in the inability of KS-DFT to treat dispersion; interactions.; Generalized Kohn–Sham (GKS) functionals incorporate long-range information into; the functional through orbital-dependent contributions, and are designed to; combat the failures of local KS-DFT, particularly the MSIE on the exchange side.; Note that these functionals are often referred to as “implicit” density; functionals, as the orbitals are themselves functionals of the Kohn–Sham; potential.; The simplest form of an exchange-side GKS is the global hybrid ansatz, in which; some fraction of the exact Hartree–Fock exchange of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is added to the functional, with the local part of the exchange; functional decreased by the corresponding amount. Note that the term; “exact-exchange” refers to the Hartree–Fock being the exact exchange energy of; the noninteracting quasiparticles, not the true electrons. Therefore, adding; 100% exact exchange is not physically reasonable, and will often lead to; extremely poor results. The fraction of exact-exchange, denoted \(\alpha\),; is often determined by adiabatic or heuristic arguments and is typically around; 25%. The addition of exact exchange borrows another piece from an existing; Hartree–Fock code, with the caveat that Hartree–Fock exchange is often much more; costly to obtain than the Coulomb matrix.

Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the \(\omega\) is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between \(N-1\)-electron and \(N\)-electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz. This guarantees the asymptotics of; the exchange potential,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{tuned-LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r} + I_{\mathrm{IP}} +; \epsilon_{\mathrm{HOMO}}\]; Note that LRC functionals with default \(\omega\) only capture the; \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{LRC}} (r) = -; \frac{1}{r},\]; hybrid functionals only capture part of the \(-1/r\) dependence,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Hybrid}} (r) = -; \frac{\alpha}{r},\]; and local functionals decay exponentially, resulting in completely incorrect; asymptotics,. \[\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} v_{\ma",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/dft.html

This; often cleans up the MSIE problem for a surprisingly large number of high-lying; occupied orbitals, as determined by fractional particle curves. Other gap; fitting techniques involving the electron affinity or band gap are sometimes; also used. IP-fitting is found to be particularly critical for the qualitative; determination of excited state ordering in many low band-gap systems.; For dispersion-bound complexes, a very simple additive empirical dispersion; potential, based on a damped Lennard-Jones potential can often produce; remarkably accurate results with KS-DFT. This approach was championed by Grimme,; whose “-D2” and more modern “-D3” approaches are a de facto industry standards. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a KS-DFT computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('b3lyp') (or other valid functional name):; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('b3lyp'). This will run a B3LYP Restricted Kohn–Sham (RKS) on neutral singlet Helium in; \(D_{2h}\) spatial symmetry with a minimal STO-3G basis, 1.0E-6 energy; and density convergence criteria, a DF ERI algorithm, symmetric; orthogonalization, DIIS, and a core Hamiltonian guess (because single atom). For more information on; any of these options, see the relevant section below, or in the preceding; Hartree–Fock section. Spin/Symmetry Treatment¶; PSI4 implements the most popular spin specializations of KS-DFT, including:. Restricted Kohn–Sham (RKS) [Defa",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/dft.html

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS. This; is because ROHF is implicitly assumed to be followed by a correlated method; which can break the positive definiteness of the spin polarization. KS-DFT with; the true functional is expected to be the final step, thus restricting the; solution to positive definite spin polarization is not physical. See the; section in [Szabo:1982] on methyl radical for an example. Functional Selection¶; PSI4 features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call:; 1energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; REFERENCE option before the call to energy:; 1; 2set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by the DFT_FUNCTIONAL; option:; 1; 2set dft_functional b3lyp; energy('scf'). For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; DFT_ALPHA option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree–Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the DFT_OMEGA option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional.; A brief summary of some of the more notable functionals in PSI4, and links; to the complete listing of all functionals of each class are presented below:.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to; those for Hartree–Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn–Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled. We hope to have a patch for this deficit soon. Please let us; know if you have a strong need for this capability, and we will move the; priority up. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20memory 512 MB; from frac import *. molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c1 # IP fitting must be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; dft_functional wb97; }. # Arguments are molecule object, minimum omega, maximum omega; ip_fitting(h2o, 0.4, 2.0). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of \(\omega\), though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; \(\omega\). The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of \(\omega\).

If you would like to publish; results using this code, please contact Rob Parrish to make arrangements for; collaboration. Dispersion Corrections¶; Dispersion corrections are discussed here.; HF-3c and PBEh-3c dispersion and BSSE corrections are discussed here. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use.

The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; \(C_6^{ij}\), obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, \(R_{ij}\), modulated; by a damping function, \(f_{damp}(R_{ij})\), that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by \(\alpha_6\)); over a distance characterized by the sum of the two atomic vdW radii,; \(R_{vdW}\), while an overall scaling term, \(s_6\), is optimized; to be unique to each \(E_{xc}\) functional.
