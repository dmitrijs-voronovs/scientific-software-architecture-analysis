In fact, this has already been done before in the case of; ranged fits, so the change in this commit is actually a simplification; of the code because it removes a code branch.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9212

The relevant part of `mmapsup.c` is:; ```c; #if defined(R__LINUX) && !defined(R__GLIBC) && !defined(__CYGWIN__) \; || (defined(__CYGWIN__) && (CYGWIN_VERSION_API_MAJOR > 0 || CYGWIN_VERSION_API_MINOR < 213)); extern size_t getpagesize PARAMS ((void));; #else; extern int getpagesize PARAMS ((void));; #endif; ```. My understanding is that as musl doesn't define `R__GLIBC`, the condition resolves in favor of declaring `getpagesize` return value as `size_t`. However, this conflicts with the declaration present in `unistd.h` (which is included several lines above this), which declares it as `int` (in accordance with the POSIX standard). The same code snippet also causes error during `core/clib/src/mvalloc.c` compilation. It's not entirely clear to me why should `getpagesize` be declared in the first place, as it is declared in the included `unistd.h` file - my guess is for some kind of compatibility, although POSIX dropped it twenty years ago and Cygwin seems to have implemented it at least four years ago, likely more, I am not sure how this works on Windows - let alone as `size_t`.

Somehow, in one of my computers (not in the other, not sure if it is related with an update I did in ROOT or something similar), I get a compilation error. This error didn't appear before. ```; error: no matching function for call to ‘TLockGuard::TLockGuard(TMutex&)’; R__LOCKGUARD(fGuiMutex) // scoped mutex; ^; /opt/root_src/core/base/inc/TVirtualMutex.h:76:4: note: candidate: TLockGuard::TLockGuard(TVirtualMutex*); TLockGuard(TVirtualMutex *mutex); ^~~~~~~~~~; /opt/root_src/core/base/inc/TVirtualMutex.h:76:4: note: no known conversion for argument 1 from ‘TMutex’ to ‘TVirtualMutex*’; error: expected ‘,’ or ‘;’ before. 72:4: note: candidate constructor not viable: no known conversion from 'TMutex' to 'const TLockGuard' for 1st argument. ```. ### Expected behavior; No error is produced as before. Or why are the others compiling well ?. Should I change instead to R__LOCKGUARD(&myMutex); ?; If yes, could this be added into the documentation ?

That prevents model from being changed after they are linked to on-disk data; - Links `REntry` instances to `RNTupleModel` instances through a new model ID, so that one cannot fill an ntuple with an entry of the wrong model; - Introduce ""bare models"" and ""bare entries"": for use within frameworks, allows creation of models without a default entry. The model can then create bare entries, and those bare entries can use `CaptureValueUnsafe` to link the fields to `void *` addresses. See ntpl003 tutorial for an example how to use it. Fixes #9069.

The `evaluate()` function on the `RooFit::TestStatistics::RooRealL` class was not functional. This PR fixes it by adding a `RooArgSet` member to `RooRealL` called `vars_obs_` which initially contains the same variables as the `RooArgProxy` and ensures that the proxy variables are properly transferred to the internal variables of the likelihood (contained in the `RooArgSet` `vars_obs_`) before evaluation. This change was made with the help of @wverkerke. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary).

I have observed in multiple circumstances that the fits of very small datasets (< 50 events) occasionally terminate if the arguments `BatchMode(1)` and `NumCPU(X)` are used, especially if X is a sufficiently large number. This also happens in simultaneous fits where at least one dataset is very small. . A minimal reproducible example is the following:. ```; void test_crash(){; using namespace RooFit;; Int_t to_gen = 10;; RooRealVar m(""m"",""m"",5000,5500);; RooRealVar slope(""slope"", ""slope"", -0.001, -1., 1.);; RooExponential* exp_pdf = new RooExponential(""exp"", ""exp"", m, slope);; RooDataSet* ds = (RooDataSet*) exp_pdf->generate(RooArgSet(m), to_gen);; exp_pdf->fitTo(*ds, BatchMode(1), NumCPU(20));; }; ```.

I believe this can be handled by RooFit in a more careful manner to avoid such terminates.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9406

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9486:5,Safety,avoid,avoids,5,"This avoids the remaining uses of the global write lock in typical RDataFrame event loops. There are two parts to this. 1) A bug fix in the hashing of streamer info when opening files. (The hash was including the TKey timestamp and therefore ended up being unique even for files with identical streamer info). 2) Since TTreeProcessorMT can carefully manage its TChains and corresponding TFile and TTree objects, global lists/cleanup and thread safety features can be bypassed or disabled. Together these changes are enough to almost completely eliminate the use of the global write lock in typical event loops.

I am trying to build ROOT project as well as tests, but there is an error occurred when building, and it maybe related to pytest version. When I use same build steps but different pytest version, ROOT project build success with pytest version 6.1.1, but SofieCompileModels_PyTorch.vcxproj fails to compile with pytest version 6.2.5, the error as belows.

I am trying to build ROOT project as well as tests, but there is an error occurred when building, and it maybe related to pytest version.

First reported in the forum [here](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/cannot-access-roomcstudy-genpardataset/46724), `keepGenData` is not sufficient to save generated parameters, despite the claims of the [documentation](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v624/classRooMCStudy.html#aa8654b8fcb5983d834c02489a35c9981). One must *also* specify an *internal* constraint. ### Expected behavior; <!--; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.; -->. `genParDataSet` should contain the values of the parameters used in dataset generation if `keepGenData=True` in `RooMCStudy::generate` (or `::run` or `::generateAndFit`). ### To Reproduce; <!--; Steps to reproduce the behavior:; 1.

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9518:1472,Deployability,patch,patch,1472,"# This Pull request:. ## Changes or fixes:; This change allows developers to specify ""line break candidate characters"" and options to process them when defining the sub-classes through member `TVirtualPS::CRCandidates` and `TVirtualPS::CRCandidateTypes`. When a line break is needed, `PrintFast` goes through `fSizBuffer` number of characters, trying to match the candidate of index 0 in `TVirtualPS::CRCandidates` and fallback to the ones with larger index. Searching will get terminated once the index 0 candidate is found (as it did before this change). The default value is. ```c++; fCRCandidates = "" "";; fCRCandidateTypes = new ECRCandidateType[1]{kBeforeChar};; ```. which resembles the behavior of TVirtualPS prior to this change to keep backward compatibility. The value specified for the SVG file is; ```c++; fCRCandidates = "" <>"";; fCRCandidateTypes = new ECRCandidateType[3]{kDropChar, kBeforeChar, kAfterChar};; ```. The `kDropChar` option is implemented to be useful for breaking line at space characters where line breaks and spaces are interchangeable. Note that `fSizBuffer` is now used instead of `kMaxBuffer` in methods of `TVirtualPS`, as it enables the sub-classes to specify the buffer size. This is compatible to all the current sub-classes implemented in the source tree, but may potentially change the behavior of self-defined document-printing sub-classes by users should `fSizBuffer` be modified before the original `PrintFast` be executed. This patch also include miscellaneous work such as updating the SVG introduction inside the TSVG doc and adding comments to the code. ## Checklist:. - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9581:285,Modifiability,config,config,285,"This fixes issue #9543. In the issue #9543, the unusual situation is the combination of:. * there is (intentionally) no dictionary for `std::map<int,std::vector<int>>`; * consequently we use an ""emulated collection proxy"" for that collection; * there is (unintentional due to external config) interpreter information/ClassInfo for `std::map<int,std::vector<int>>`. The crux of the issue #9543 is:. * TClass::fSizeof info prefers the information from the CollectionProxy; * TStreamerInfo::fSize is set to the value of TClass::fSizeOf; * TClass:New prefers the constructor from the interpreter; * TStreamerInfo::New was using TClass::New for that case; * On the failing platform, the `sizeof(std::map<int,std::vector<int>>)` is larger than the size of the emulated collection. Since the I/O and TStreamerInfo uses the TCollection proxy and all of TStreamerInfo needs to prefer the information from the collection proxy (including the 'sizeof'). To fix #9543 the solution is for; * TStremearInfo::New to prefer/use TCollectionProxy::New over TClass::New (i.e. the interpreted constructor in this particular case).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9581

The conda nightly builds started segfaulting late last year while generating `hsimple.root`. I think I've isolated the problem to the addition of `-O1` to the default cling arguments.

However, when generating the documentation, doxygen seems not to be able to detect its presence, and gives thousands of warnings, see e.g. https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/view/ROOT/job/root-makedoc-v624/96/consoleFull. . of the type:; ```; geom/geom/src/TGeoArb8.cxx:1280: warning: no uniquely matching class member found for ; void TGeoArb8::Streamer(TBuffer &R__b); ```. ### Expected behavior; - Maybe the ClassDef macro can be tweaked so that doxygen finds correctly the link.; - Or if it is a bug in doxygen, I could file a report to them. ; - If none of the above solutions work, maybe hide this functions from doxygen?. ### To Reproduce; https://root.cern/for_developers/doxygen/. ### Setup; ```; ------------------------------------------------------------------; | Welcome to ROOT 6.27/01 https://root.cern |; | (c) 1995-2021, The ROOT Team; conception: R.

To fix #9543 the solution is for; * TStremearInfo::New to prefer/use TCollectionProxy::New over TClass::New (i.e. the interpreted constructor in this particular case).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9620

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9646:384,Usability,simpl,simplicity,384,"I discovered a numerically stable calculation of the invariant mass for a two-body decay. It should be trivial to generalize this to N-body decay. The problem and the solution is documented here:; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70758079/numerically-stable-calculation-of-invariant-mass-in-particle-physics/70775687#70775687. Briefly, when one computes (1D and two-body decay for simplicity); `m_squared = (sqrt(m1 ** 2 + p1 ** 2) + sqrt(m2 ** 2 + p2 ** 2)) ** 2 - (p1 + p2) ** 2`; one gets catastrophic cancellation from the subtraction, when p_i >> m_i. I found an equivalent formula which is perfectly numerically stable and works accurately even in single precision. ROOT seems to use the equivalent of this naive formula:; https://root.cern/root/html522/src/ROOT__Math__PxPyPzE4D_double_.h.html#D1mppD; The fundamental issue of catastrophic cancellation is partially mitigated by computing this in double precision. This increases the range of values where the problem appears, but the problem is even there in double precision. This is evident from the fact that there is a check for negative values of M2() in the implementation of the method M(). The numerically stable formula is guarantees to never produce a negative value for M2().

With 6.24/06 vanilla and v6-24-00-patches e9d29ae8eb, the test `runtime_cxxmodules_addr` in the provided reproducer ; passes regardless of the presence or absence of the feature `runtime_cxxmodules`. With 6.25/02—and master, per @pcanal—it fails with a segmentation violation trying to autoparse `art::detail::are_cv_compatible<const int, const int*>`. ### Expected behavior. * `runtime_cxxmodules_9583_good` should pass in all cases.; * `runtime_cxxmodules_9583_bad` should pass when `runtime_cxxmodules=OFF` or #9583 has been fixed.; * `runtime_cxxmodules_addr` should pass in all cases. ### To Reproduce. - Ensure you are using ROOT 6.25/02 (or see below); - Ensure you are using CMake >= 3.22.0; - Execute the provided runit script to configure, build, and execute the tests. ### Setup. * SLF7; * CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17. ### Additional context. Preliminary investigation by @pcanal (to ensure that I hadn't messed up something basic in the configuration or XML) indicates that the problem was introduced by PR #7488 and not fixed by its partial reversion in 2d304cf4888a8cf24aa84b7fae086a91eefa31c4.

Specifically, `TRint::ProcessLineNr()` used the output parameter `error` to tell if the collected input was incomplete (i.e., it contains unbalanced braces or the last line was terminated by a `\` character). While this works most of the time, it fails if there is a nested call to `ProcessLine()` that provides incomplete input, e.g.:; ```c++; $ root -l -b; root [0] gROOT->ProcessLine(""fprintf(stdout,\""the inner is printing\""\n""); (long) 0; root [1] 12; root (cont'ed, cancel with .@) [2].@; root [3] .q; ```. In this case, there are two nested `ProcessLine()` calls; the inner-most has incomplete input (missing a `)`), but the `error` output parameter is ignored. The outer-most call, however, has complete input, which is what was seen by TRint. This created inconsistency between the collected input in cling's InputValidator (which was incomplete) and the ROOT prompt string, that was not showing `root (cont'ed, cancel with .@) []`. Thus, the correct behavior would have been:; ```c++; root [0] gROOT->ProcessLine(""fprintf(stdout,\""the inner is printing\""\n"");; root (cont'ed, cancel with .@) [0]);; the inner is printing; ```. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `InputValidator::getLastResult()` and `MetaProcessor::waitingMoreInput()` which allow to query whether the collected input is incomplete, either because it contains unbalanced braces or we found a backslash-newline (the last seen token is a `\`).; - Properly implement the `TInterpreter::GetMore()` function based on `MetaProcessor::waitingMoreInput()`.

This issue report follows my post in the ROOT forums https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/gdml-multiple-files-error-with-define/48581. Please refer to the forum post for additional details. In summary, when using the GDML modules feature as described on the manual (or so I think), the `<define/>` section of the child file is not being accessed correctly when the volume is a tessellated solid. This does not happen with a simple volume such as a box. On top of that I have managed to load the problematic GDML into Geant4 without problems, so that lead me to believe it is a ROOT bug. ### Expected behavior. Geometry should load without throwing an exception. ### To Reproduce.
