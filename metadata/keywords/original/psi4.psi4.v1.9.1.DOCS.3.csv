The optking program takes as input nuclear gradients and,; optionally, nuclear second derivatives |w---w| both in Cartesian coordinates.; The default minimization algorithm employs an empirical model Hessian,; redundant internal coordinates, an RFO step with trust radius scaling, and the BFGS Hessian update. The principal literature references include the introduction of redundant; internal coordinates by Peng et al.

However, for separated; fragments, we have chosen not to employ their ""extra-redundant"" coordinates. The internal coordinates are generated automatically based on an assumed bond; connectivity. The connectivity is determined by testing if the interatomic; distance is less than the sum of atomic radii times the value of; |optking__covalent_connect|.

Creating New Plugins; ====================. Modular Approach to Development; -------------------------------. It is slightly cumbersome to the development cycle to recompile |PSIfour|; every time a change is made to the C++ code.; It's also daunting to new developers if they're required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with Psi3 due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, |PSIfour| now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi's vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. .. _`sec:newplugins`:. Creating a New Plugin; ---------------------. |PSIfour| can create basic plugins for you and automatically tailor them; to your compilation environment. To create a basic plugin, run the; following while replacing ``myplugin`` with the name of your great code.; If the name you provide is not valid, |PSIfour| will complain. >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin. |PSIfour| will create a new directory with the name you specify for the; plugin. In this example, a directory named myplugin will be created.; All you need to do is ``cd`` into the directory, use |PSIfour| to generate; a Makefile, and type make. Then execute ``psi4`` in the directory on the; default input file. .. code-block:: bash. >>> cd myplugin; >>> `psi4 --plugin-compile`; >>> make; >>> psi4. |PSIfour| comes with a few templates that provide an excellent starting; point.

Creating New Plugins; ====================. Modular Approach to Development; -------------------------------. It is slightly cumbersome to the development cycle to recompile |PSIfour|; every time a change is made to the C++ code.; It's also daunting to new developers if they're required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with Psi3 due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, |PSIfour| now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi's vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. .. _`sec:newplugins`:. Creating a New Plugin; ---------------------. |PSIfour| can create basic plugins for you and automatically tailor them; to your compilation environment. To create a basic plugin, run the; following while replacing ``myplugin`` with the name of your great code.; If the name you provide is not valid, |PSIfour| will complain. >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin. |PSIfour| will create a new directory with the name you specify for the; plugin. In this example, a directory named myplugin will be created.; All you need to do is ``cd`` into the dir",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/plugins.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/plugins.rst

The function should start with a declaration, as below. ``methodname`` is; never seen by users, so it's good to be specific to method or module.; The function must always take as arguments ``(name, **kwargs)``. ::. # energy method; def run_methodname(name, **kwargs):. # gradient method; def run_methodname_gradient(name, **kwargs):. If the function needs to test the identity of ``name`` several times, it; can be convenient to predefine the lowercase version of the variable. The; case of all other py-side options (in kwargs) has already been handled by; :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy()`, etc. in driver.py and need not be repeated here. ::. # include if convenient; lowername = name.lower(). # never include; kwargs = kwargs_lower(kwargs). The function often needs to set options for the; c-side modules it calls. In order that the state of the options set by the; user remains when control is returned to the user, an; :py:class:`~psi4.driver.p4util.OptionsState` object is set up. See; :ref:`sec:handlingOptions_py` for details. *All* options set by the; function need to be included here, and *only* options set by the function; should be included. Most options should be associated with a particular; module, but a few (see below) are given without module. ::. # include if any options set; optstash = OptionsState(; # these and other basis options should have no associated module; ['BASIS'],; ['DF_BASIS_SCF'],; ['DF_BASIS_MP2'],; ['PUREAM'],; ['FREEZE_CORE'],; # all others should have an associated module; ['SCF', 'SCF_TYPE'],; ['SCF', 'GUESS'],; ['DFMP2', 'MP2_OS_SCALE'],; )",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/proc_py.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/proc_py.rst

LAPACK Wrappers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. All standard LAPACK 3.2 double precision routines are provided. LAPACK commands remain in Fortran's ""column-major"" indexing, so all the; results will be transposed, and leading dimensions may have to be fiddled; with (using ``lda = n`` in both directions for square matrices is highly; recommended). An example of the former problem is a Cholesky; Decomposition: you expect to get back a lower triangular matrix L such; that ``L L^T = A``, but this is returned in column-major order, so the actual; recovery of the matrix A with the row-major BLAS wrappers effectively; involves ``L^T L = A``. On of the biggest consequences is in linear equations:; The input/output forcing/solution vector must be explicitly formed in; column-major indexing (each vector is placed in a C++ row, with its; entries along the C++ column). This is visualized in C++ as the transpose; of the forcing/solution vector. All routines are declared in qt.h. Each; routine is prefixed with a ``C_``, followed by the standard Fortran name of; the routine, in capital letters. Input parameters of single primitives; (int, double, unsigned long int, char, ...) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous memory; (as provided by block_matrix, for example), and are passed by providing a; pointer to the first double or int element of the data (this is array[0]; if array is ``double**``).

In cases where there is no batching performed, bra-ket symmetry can be; trivially enforced by ensuring that one of the block indices is greater than or; equal to the other. When batching is used, the situation is trickier; some ket; batches may contain a mixture of integrals that are bra-ket unique and those; that are not. To handle this we must do a coarse check at the top of the loop; to see if *any* integrals in the batch are needed, which is implemented by; asking the integral engine where to start looping in the ket via the call to; ``eri->first_RS_shell_block(PQpair_idx)``. This is followed by a more fine; grained check within the loops to filter individual integrals in the case where; bra and ket have the same angular momentum and there's a possibility of a; handful of integrals coming from the ket that are redundant. Note that the bra; is not batched in any of our engines currently: only the ket is. For this; reason, density fitting integrals should be written as (A0|PQ) rather than; (PQ|A0) where possible, because we want the ket to contain more functions than; the bra for efficient blocking. Instantiating integral objects; .............................. With sieving being introduced in the new integral objects, the cost of their; construction has increased.

To avoid unnecessary copies, the new code instead uses the integrals; directly from the underlying integral engine's memory, which may change with; each call to compute integrals. The integral engine provides a; ``std::vector<const double*>`` containing the pointers to the start of each; ""chunk"" of integrals. For first derivatives there are 12 such ""chunks"", which; are ordered Px,Py,Pz,Qx,Qy,Qz,Rx,Ry,Rz,Sx,Sy,Sz, where the Px refers to the x; derivative with respect to the basis functions in shell P. Note that all; integral derivatives are provided by the new integral code, unlike the previous; version where only 9 of 12 were provided and the user was responsible for using; translation invariance relationships to fill in the rest. The addresses for; each chunk are updated in the vector after each call to compute integrals, so; the user should keep a const reference to that object, and query that for the; address of interest. Density Screening; ................. The old code looked only at the integral to determine whether terms can be; avoided *a priori*. However, if the integral is to be contracted with a; density or a density-like quantity, the screening can be performed on the; product, which yields more sparsity.

Shell blocking; .............. Each underlying integral engine knows whether it will use blocks, and will set up; the metadata automatically. Instead of looping over individual shells, the; user should loop over blocks supplied by the integral object; these blocks will; be just a single shell quartet combination for the case where blocking is not; used. It is simple to loop over pairs within each block using C++11 syntax, as; demonstrated in the code snippet above. Only shell pairs with significant; overlap are included in the shell block information, making this an efficient; way to loop over non-negligible terms. Permutational symmetry; ...................... The pairs within each block are optimized for efficiency. First, they are; screened during the integral object's creation to ensure that only terms with; appreciable overlap are stored. Second, only P,Q combinations that are; permutationally unique are stored, ordered with the higher angular momentum; first. Therefore care must be taken to ensure that the missing permutations; are correctly accounted for when processing the integrals within the loop.

One Electron Integrals in |PSIfour|; -----------------------------------. After version 1.5, we started transitioning the one electron integral code over to; use Libint2 instead of the old handwritten Obara-Saika code. There are a; number of reasons motivating this switch. For methods requiring; potentials and fields evaluated at many external sites, such as PCM and; polarizable embedding, the efficiency of the one electron integrals can be rate; limiting. We also started to introduce integral screening, and it is important; to balance the screening used for one- and two-electron terms carefully, so this; is a good opportunity to re-evaluate the code. Finally, given the complexity; of the OS recursion code, the switch to an external library leaves a more; compact codebase to maintain.

It is simple to loop over pairs within each block using C++11 syntax, as; demonstrated in the code snippet above. Only shell pairs with significant; overlap are included in the shell block information, making this an efficient; way to loop over non-negligible terms. Permutational symmetry; ...................... The pairs within each block are optimized for efficiency. First, they are; screened during the integral object's creation to ensure that only terms with; appreciable overlap are stored. Second, only P,Q combinations that are; permutationally unique are stored, ordered with the higher angular momentum; first. Therefore care must be taken to ensure that the missing permutations; are correctly accounted for when processing the integrals within the loop. See; the DirectJK code in libfock for an example of using this scheme for a Fock; matrix build. Using bra-ket symmetry; ...................... In cases where there is no batching performed, bra-ket symmetry can be; trivially enforced by ensuring that one of the block indices is greater than or; equal to the other. When batching is used, the situation is trickier; some ket; batches may contain a mixture of integrals that are bra-ket unique and those; that are not. To handle this we must do a coarse check at the top of the loop; to see if *any* integrals in the batch are needed, which is implemented by; asking the integral engine where to start looping in the ket via the call to; ``eri->first_RS_shell_block(PQpair_idx)``. This is followed by a more fine; grained check within the loops to filter individual integrals in the case where; bra and ket have the same angular momentum and there's a possibility of a; handful of integrals coming from the ket that are redundant. Note that the bra; is not batched in any of our engines currently: only the ket is. For this; reason, density fitting integrals should be written as (A0|PQ) rather than; (PQ|A0) where possible, because we want the ket to contain more functions than;",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/prog_integrals.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/prog_integrals.rst

Although significantly cheaper than computing; integrals themselves, construction of integral objects can be non-negligible,; especially if many threads are used. For example, this pattern can be found in; old versions of the code:. .. code-block:: cpp. std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; }. This builds many objects and the cost can add up. With the new scheme,; integral objects are forced to implement a `clone()` member that can be used as; follows:. .. code-block:: cpp. std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(ints[0]->clone()));; }. This method only incurs the cost of creating a single integral object, and; performs much cheaper cloning operations to create the other objects for each; thread. Moreover, if integral objects are created only in the initialization; of each code that uses them, and stored persistently, the cost of integral; object creation is further reduced. One Electron Integrals in |PSIfour|; -----------------------------------. After version 1.5, we started transitioning the one electron integral code over to; use Libint2 instead of the old handwritten Obara-Saika code. There are a; number of reasons motivating this switch. For methods requiring; potentials and fields evaluated at many external sites, such as PCM and; polarizable embedding, the efficiency of the one electron integrals can be rate; limiting. We also started to introduce integral screening, and it is important; to balance the screening used for one- and two-electron terms carefully, so this; is a good opportunity to re-evaluate the code.

However,; the |PSIfour| ecosystem provides a path for easier and more rapid development; of new features. The earliest versions of |PSIfour| were written by merging; individual executables that performed specific tasks into a unified C++; executable. By linking this C++ executable against the Python interpreter, the; individual modules could be called in any sequence, enabling a very diverse; range of tasks to be accomplished within a given input. Although Python-driven; model allowed for great flexibility from a user's perspective, programming was; still relatively difficult because it required modifications to be made in C++; code. Since those early days, the code has undergone some important structural; changes that have greatly simplified the development workflow. These changes; were motivated by the realization that only a few bottlenecks exist in a typical; calculation; by focusing on optimized C++ implementations of these bottlenecks; and making these C++ functions available in Python, most of the code to implement; the overall calculation can be written in simpler Python code. Python is far; better suited to management tasks such as directory navigation and retrieval,; making it a natural choice for overall calculation layout than C++. With the; emergence of `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ as a standard tool for executing almost any; mathematical technique efficiently in Python, the transitioning of code from; C++ to Python has facilitated a much simpler work flow for prototyping and; developing methods: this is detailed in the next section. .. _`sec:prog_psi4numpy`:.

The `Psi4NumPy <https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy>`_ project [Smith:2018:3504]_ is the recommended; mechanism for developing and prototyping new methods in Psi4. Because; `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ provides such a rich set of features for efficient linear; algebra, Fourier transforms, and general tensor manipulations, a massive number; of methods can be easily implemented very easily using that library. To; facilitate this workflow, |PSIfour| exports key quantities such as integrals,; densities and molecular orbitals in NumPy format. From this point, the; programmer can simply call the appropriate |PSIfour| functions to compute the; desired input quantities, retrieve them in NumPy format, and then write the; remaining code using standard Python and/or NumPy syntax. This approach does; not require any recompilation of code, resulting in a particularly facile; development workflow. Detailed examples and tutorials are available in the; `Psi4NumPy <https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy>`_ repository. .. _`sec:prog_plugins`:. Avoiding the need to modify Psi4, using plugins; -----------------------------------------------. In the early days when |PSIfour| was still primarily a C++ code, development; was very cumbersome due to a lengthy build process. To expedite development, a; plugin system was developed. This plugin machinery allows developers to access; the classes defined in the innards of |PSIfour|, with only the small plugin; code requiring recompilation during development. The resulting lightweight; code can be maintained and distributed independently of |PSIfour|, making this; a good strategy for development, especially in cases where tighter integration; of the new code with existing |PSIfour| machinery is required than that; afforded by the Numpy based strategy outlined in the :ref:`sec:prog_psi4numpy`; section.

However, the programmer should think very; carefully about the most appropriate language for the task in hand. Let's; consider a new feature that downloads some data from an external source and; then performs some kind of expensive matrix operation on those data. Because; Python has a rich set of tools for obtaining data from external sources,; writing this tool in the Python layer is a natural choice.

In the case where the matrix operation; is non-standard and requires some specialized code to handle disk-based; storage, the decision to write in Python is less clear cut. It is certainly; possible to write these out-of-core routines using Numpy primitives, but there; are a number of tools in |PSIfour| already to perform tasks like these that are; required, *e.g.*, for cluster.

The Python layer could then be; responsible for obtaining the input data and calling this C++ code to do the; manipulations, allowing each language layer to handle the subset of the work; that caters to their individual strengths. A number of concrete examples of this workflow exist in the code already. For; finite difference computations of energy derivatives, the logic to determine; the type of stencil and which displacements are needed is not going to be rate; limiting for any reasonable quantum mechanical energy function. Therefore,; doing that work in the Python layer is a good idea, as it allows the many; Python tools for farming out *embarrassingly parallel* workloads to be used,; while the C++ layer can be used to implement the energy function to be; differentiated.

A companion perturbation; method (Mk-MRPT2) has been developed based on the Mukherjee formalisim; as shown in [Evangelista:2009:4728]_. The current version of the code is limited to reference active spaces; in which all determinants are connected to each other by no more than two; excitations. In practice, this usually means that the active space can have; at most two particles, or at most two holes. Examples would include ; CAS(2,2), CAS(2,8), CAS(4,3), etc., where CAS(n,m) refers to a; complete-active-space configuration interaction (CASCI) reference with n; electrons in m orbitals. If the user specifies active spaces that do not fit; these limitations, then the code will still run, but some relevant; determinants will be missing, and the answer obtained will be an approximation; to the true Mk-MRCC procedure. The PSIMRCC code itself does not perform orbital optimization. Hence, the; references used might be considered CASCI references, but not CASSCF; references (CASSCF implies that the orbitals have been optimized specifically; to minimize the energy of the CASCI reference).

The |psimrcc__corr_wfn| allows you to select one of three methods; Mk-MRPT2 [``PT2``], Mk-MRCCSD [``CCSD``], or Mk-MRCCSD(T) [``CCSD_T``].; The |psimrcc__corr_multp| option allows you to select the Slater; determinants with a particular :math:`M_s` value. The |psimrcc__wfn_sym|; keyword is neccesary if you do not want to compute the energy of the; totally-symmetric state. The |psimrcc__follow_root| option may be used; to follow different roots of the effective Hamiltonian.

Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the ``set`` keyword.

Job Control Keywords; ====================. |PSIfour| comprises a number of C++ modules that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix :ref:`apdx:options_c_module`.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified::. # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }; ; set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }; ; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around ``cc-pVDZ``, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in ``set`` commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords::. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, *viz.*::. set {; docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]; }. List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening ``[`` is; on the same line as the name of the keyword. Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the ``set`` keyword. Omitting the module; name, or using the name ``global`` or ``globals`` will result in the keyword being; applied to all modules. For example, in the following input ::. molecule{; o; h 1 roh; h 1 roh 2 ahoh; ; roh = 0.957; ahoh = 104.5; }; ; set basis cc-pVDZ; set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1; energy('ccsd'). the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print; level of 1 and the ccene",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/psithoninput.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/psithoninput.rst

Loops; =====. Python provides many control structures, any of which can be used within |PSIfour|; input files.

The declaration of ``basis_sets`` is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that ``basis_set`` is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign. . The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water::. molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }; ; Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2); ; set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of ``Rvals`` and ``Avals`` are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule ``h2o`` we can then set the values of ``R`` and ``A`` within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the ``set`` keyword.

Many users need only deal with the simple return; form for the computation functions. ::. # E is total energy float; # G is gradient array; # H is hessian array; # wfn is class instance with many computational details. # simple returns; E = energy(...); E = optimize(...); E = frequency(...); G = gradient(...) # used by optimize(); H = hessian(...) # used by frequency().

Another very useful and powerful feature of |PSIfour| is the ability; to compute results on entire databases of molecules at a time,; as provided by the :py:func:`~psi4.driver.wrapper_database.database` wrapper.

By default, |PSIfour| performs a ""sanity check"" when parsing Psithon input files, enforcing a minimum memory requirement of 250 MiB.

The :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy` function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation. Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; :ref:`apdx:psivariables_module` lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and :ref:`apdx:psivariables_alpha` defines them.

For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block::. molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/psithonmol.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/psithonmol.rst

If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; :math:`C_s` (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as::. SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The :math:`^2A_1` state can be obtained with; the ::. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become ::.

For example when; running a computation on a molecule with :math:`D_{2h}` symmetry in :math:`C_{2v}`, the; :math:`C_2` axis can be chosen as either the :math:`x`, the :math:`y`, or the :math:`z`; these can; be specified by requesting the symmetry as ``c2vx``, ``c2vy``, or ``c2vz``, respectively.; Likewise the ``c2x``, ``c2y``, ``c2z``, ``c2hx``, ``c2hy``, and ``c2hz``; labels are valid. For :math:`C_s` symmetry the labels ``csx``, ``csy``, and; ``csz`` request the :math:`yz`, :math:`xz`, and :math:`xy` planes be used as the mirror plane,; respectively. If no unique axis is specified, |PSIfour| will choose an appropriate; subgroup. Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational; frequencies, might lower the symmetry of the molecule. When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as |globals__socc|, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the :math:`^2B_1`; state of water cation, we can specify ::. SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; :math:`C_s` (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as::. SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The :math:`^2A_1` state can be obtained with; the ::. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become ::. SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The :math:`^2B_2` state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are ::. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to ::. SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the :math:`^2A_1` state. In this case, the; :math:`^2A_1` state is lower in energy, and is not problematic.

For; example, the geometry for H\ :sub:`2` can be specified a number of ways, using the; :samp:`molecule {optional_molecule_name} \\{...\\}` block. ::. molecule {; H; H 1 0.9; }; ; or ::; ; molecule {; H; H 1 r; r = 0.9; }; ; or ::; ; molecule {; H1; H2 H1 0.9; }; ; or ::; ; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 0.9; }; ; or ::; ; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.9; }; ; or ::; ; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 -r; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.45; }. Blank lines are ignored and, unlike regular Python syntax, indentation within; the molecule block does not matter, although the ``molecule`` keyword itself must; be aligned within the input according to standard Python syntax. For more; examples of geometry specification, see the :srcsample:`mints1` input file in the samples; folder. It is also possible to mix Cartesian and Z-matrix geometry; specifications, as demonstrated in the :srcsample:`mints4` and; :srcsample:`mints6` sample input files. For example, consider",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/psithonmol.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/psithonmol.rst

SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become ::. SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The :math:`^2B_2` state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are ::. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to ::. SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the :math:`^2A_1` state. In this case, the; :math:`^2A_1` state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the :math:`^2B_2` state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it's easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. .. index:: molecule; multiple fragments; .. _`sec:fragments`:. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments; ========================================. |PSIfour| has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. |PSIfour| provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex's geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block::. molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }.

Obtaining rough starting guess geometries can be burdensome. The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, |PSIfour| can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem]_ database. For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification::. molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; |PSIfour| to search PubChem for a starting structure. The search is actually; performed for compounds whose name *contains* ""benzene"", so multiple; entries will be returned. If the name provided (""benzene"" in the above; example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used. If no; exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier; (CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more; specific name. For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a; compound whose name(s) contain ""benzene"", but we're not sure of the exact IUPAC; name, the following input can be used::. molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene*; }. Appending the ""*"" prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time; of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file::.

Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry.

It is; possible to further specify that the overall complex is neutral and spin-singlet; by inserting another :samp:`{charge} {multiplicity}` line, separated from the first; molecule block by a `--` line. If any information is missing, |PSIfour| will set the; unprovided charges and multiplicities to be consistent with those that are given.; For example, the overall charge must be simply the sum of all fragment charges.; |PSIfour| further assumes that any unpaired electrons are coupled to yield the highest; possible :math:`M_s` value. Psi will also favor neutral, spin-singlet fragments.; For anything complicated, we strongly suggest explicitly providing the charge; and multiplicity of each fragment as well as the total molecular charge and multiplicity. For details and examples, see https://github.com/MolSSI/QCElemental/blob/master/qcelemental/molparse/chgmult.py#L105-L136 . Having defined a molecule containing fragments like ``eneyne`` above, it; is a simple matter to perform calculations on only a subset of the; fragments. For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene; fragment alone (``extract_subsets(1)`` pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms; and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the; ethyne fragment ghosted (``extract_subsets(1,2)`` pulls out fragment 1 as; Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. ``extract_subsets(2,[1,3])``::. mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'); ; clean(); ; mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf').

For example when; running a computation on a molecule with :math:`D_{2h}` symmetry in :math:`C_{2v}`, the; :math:`C_2` axis can be chosen as either the :math:`x`, the :math:`y`, or the :math:`z`; these can; be specified by requesting the symmetry as ``c2vx``, ``c2vy``, or ``c2vz``, respectively.; Likewise the ``c2x``, ``c2y``, ``c2z``, ``c2hx``, ``c2hy``, and ``c2hz``; labels are valid. For :math:`C_s` symmetry the labels ``csx``, ``csy``, and; ``csz`` request the :math:`yz`, :math:`xz`, and :math:`xy` ",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/psithonmol.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/psithonmol.rst

For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene; fragment alone (``extract_subsets(1)`` pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms; and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the; ethyne fragment ghosted (``extract_subsets(1,2)`` pulls out fragment 1 as; Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. ``extract_subsets(2,[1,3])``::. mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'); ; clean(); ; mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf'). If the molecule contains fragments but is not conveniently ordered for the; ``--`` marker, the :py:func:`~psi4.driver.wrapper_autofrag.auto_fragments` function can be applied, as shown in; :srcsample:`pywrap-basis`, to return as active molecule the previous; active molecule, only fragmented.

The role of the; database.py file is to collect arrays and dictionaries that define the; geometries of reagents (GEOS), their combination into reactions (RXNM &; ACTV), available reference values for reactions (BIND), and brief comments; for reagents and reactions (TAGL). The journey from reagent geometries to; functional database.py file is largely automated, in a process described; below. * Prepare geometry files; Assemble xyz files for all intended reagent systems in a directory.; Follow the rules below for best results. The filename for each xyz; file should be the name of the system. lowercase or MixedCase is; preferable (according to Sherrill lab convention). Avoid dashes and; dots in the name as python won't allow them.

For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]_).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106]_, whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors. Thanks to; natural orbital methods [Parrish:2013:174102]_, the SAPT code; is able to include CCD dispersion with only a modest additional cost.; Computations employing CCD dispersion should cite [Parrish:2013:174102]_. ; To request CCD dispersion treatment in a SAPT computation, simply append; ``(ccd)`` to the name of the method, as in the following examples ::. 	energy('sapt2+(ccd)'); 	energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)'); 	energy('sapt2+3(ccd)'). The :math:`\delta_{MP2}` corrections can also be computed automatically; by appending ``dmp2`` to the name of the method, with or without CCD dispersion ::. 	energy('sapt2+dmp2'); 	energy('sapt2+(3)dmp2'); 	energy('sapt2+3dmp2'); 	energy('sapt2+(ccd)dmp2'); 	energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)dmp2'); 	energy('sapt2+3(ccd)dmp2').

Charge-Transfer in SAPT; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is possible to obtain the stabilization energy of a complex due to; charge-transfer effects from a SAPT computation. The charge-transfer energy ; can be computed with the SAPT module as described by Stone; and Misquitta [Misquitta:2009:201]_. Charge-transfer energies can be obtained from the following calls to the; energy function. ::. energy('sapt0-ct'); energy('sapt2-ct'); energy('sapt2+-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3-ct'); energy('sapt2+(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)-ct'); energy('sapt2+3(ccd)-ct'). For now, charge transfer computations are not available with open-shell SAPT0. A SAPT charge-transfer analysis will perform 5 HF computations: the dimer; in the dimer basis, monomer A in the dimer basis, monomer B in the dimer; basis, monomer A in the monomer A basis, and monomer B in the monomer B; basis. Next, it performs two SAPT computations, one in the dimer basis and; one in the monomer basis. Finally, it will print a summary of the; charge-transfer results::.

To do this, simply add; ``sapt_basis='monomer'`` to the energy function, such as ::. energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set. Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example ::. molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation. Note that an error will be thrown if each atom in the; third monomer is not a ghost to prevent confusion with three-body SAPT which is; not currently supported by Psi4.

SAPT0; ^^^^^. Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ'). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT ; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in ; [Parker:2014:094106]_. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically ; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions. Publications resulting from the use of the SAPT0 code ; should cite the following publications: [Hohenstein:2010:184111]_ and ; [Hohenstein:2011:174107]_.

One can avoid this bottleneck by replacing these; dispersion terms with the empirical D3 corrections developed by Grimme.; ; :ref:`Grimme's dispersion corrections are discussed here. <sec:dftd3>`. The corresponding method, termed SAPT0-D, thus relies on empirically fit parameters; specific to SAPT0/jun-cc-pVDZ. While SAPT0-D can be used with any of the -D ; variants using default parameters optimized for Hartee--Fock interaction energies, ; we recommend using the refit parameters with Becke-Johnson damping, as described in; [Schriber:2021:234107]_. Again, use of SAPT0-D with a basis set other than; jun-cc-pVDZ is not tested and not guaranteed to give meaningful results without; refitting the dispersion parameters. ; A simple water dimer computation using SAPT0-D may look like::. 	molecule water_dimer {; 	 0 1; 	 O -1.551007 -0.114520 0.000000; 	 H -1.934259 0.762503 0.000000; 	 H -0.599677 0.040712 0.000000; 	 --; 	 0 1; 	 O 1.350625 0.111469 0.000000; 	 H 1.680398 -0.373741 -0.758561; 	 H 1.680398 -0.373741 0.758561; 	; 	 units angstrom; 	 no_reorient; 	 symmetry c1; 	}; 	; 	set basis jun-cc-pvdz. 	energy('sapt0-d3mbj') # runs the recommended dispersion correction; energy('sapt0-d3') # tests an alternative damping scheme/parameterization.

SAPT(DFT); ^^^^^^^^^. In general, SAPT(DFT) should provide more accurate interaction energy ; components, and overall interaction energies, than SAPT0. The drawback ; is SAPT(DFT) method is more computationally demanding than SAPT0, ; SAPT(DFT) can still be applied to medium-sized or large systems. The ; SAPT(DFT) module was employed successfully in computations of systems ; with up to 2000 basis functions, and the code should be scalable to ; 3000 basis functions. Like higher-order SAPT, SAPT(DFT) requires ; sufficient memory to hold :math:`2ovN_aux` doubles. SAPT(DFT) requires a few special treatments to obtain accurate; result. The DFT functionals used in SAPT(DFT) need to be asymptotically; corrected with Gradient Regulated Asymptotic Correction scheme (GRAC),; in order to recover the correct long-range asymptotic behavior; (approaching :math:`-1/r` as :math:`r` approaches infinity). The program; requires manual input of GRAC shift parameter for each monomer through; keywords |sapt__sapt_dft_grac_shift_a| and |sapt__sapt_dft_grac_shift_b|,; which should be equal to the difference of the actual ionization; potential and the corresponding Kohn-Sham HOMO energy. The dispersion; term needs to be computed with orbital response for good accuracy,; and it is recommended to enable |sapt__sapt_dft_do_hybrid| (set to; ``True`` by default). The coupled exchange-dispersion energy is usually; estimated by scaling from the uncoupled value either by a fitted fixed; value (suggested initially by [Hesselmann:2014:094107]_ for a local Hartree--Fock (LHF) formulation and then revised; by [Xie:2022:024801]_ for non-LHF) or; by the ratio of; coupled and uncoupled dispersion energy (suggested by [Podeszwa:2006:400]_ ). ; This can be controlled by keyword |s",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/sapt.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/sapt.rst

The total component energies (*i.e.*,; electrostatics, exchange, induction, and dispersion) represent what we; regard as the best estimate available at a given level of SAPT computed; from a subset of the terms of that grouping. The groupings shown above are; not unique and are certainly not rigorously defined. We regard the groupings ; used in |PSIfour| as a ""chemist's grouping"" as opposed to a more; mathematically based grouping, which would group all exchange terms ; (*i.e.* :math:`E_{exch-ind,resp}^{(20)}`, :math:`E_{exch-disp}^{(20)}`, *etc.*) in; the exchange component. A final note is that both ``Disp22(T)``; and ``Est.Disp22(T)`` results appear if MP2 natural orbitals are ; used to evaluate the triples correction to dispersion. The ``Disp22(T)`` ; result is the triples correction as computed in the truncated NO basis; ; ``Est.Disp22(T)`` is a scaled result that attempts to recover; the effect of the truncated virtual space and is our best estimate. The ``Est.Disp22(T)``; value is used in the SAPT energy and dispersion component (see [Hohenstein:2010:104107]_ ; for details).

All exchange terms in SAPT arise from the antisymmetrization; of the wavefunctions of monomers A and B. Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the :math:`S^{2}`; approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron ; pair between monomers. The :math:`S^{2}` approximation is usually pretty good, but may ; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate for these deviations, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]_ ; recommended to scale all :math:`S^{2}` approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. .. math:: p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}. and recommended using the ratio with exponent :math:`\alpha = 1`. To obtain SAPT energies with this scaling,; simply set the keyword ``exch_scale_alpha true``. Alternatively, another value for :math:`\alpha`; can be specified by setting |sapt__exch_scale_alpha| to a value. For example, ::. set exch_scale_alpha 1.0. will set :math:`\alpha = 1.0` and scale exchange energies with :math:`p_{EX}(1.0)`. However, as pointed out by Schaffer and Jansen [Schaffer:2013:2570]_; in the context of DFT-based SAPT, the ratios :math:`E_{exch}^{(1)}(S^{2})/E_{exch}^{(1)}`,; :math:`E_{\rm exch-ind}^{(2)}(S^2)/E_{\rm exch-ind}^{(2)}`, and ; :math:`E_{\rm exch-disp}^{(2)}(S^2)/E_{\rm exch-disp}^{(2)}` are not very similar to; each other. Hence, in 2016 universal scaling of all :math:`S^{2}` approximated terms; was turned off by default. Finally, in 2014 Parker et al.

It is also possible to run a closed-shell SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; ``sapt_basis='monomer'`` to the energy function, such as ::. energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set.

The Resolution of the Identity (RI) can be used to decompose the normally 4-center ERI tensor into a combination of 3-center and 2-center components.; By reducing the dimensionality of the ERI tensor, application of the RI (often referred to as density-fitting, or DF) can be used to greatly speed up; SCF calculations. The reduction in ERI tensor rank also makes DF an appealing option for conventional SCF calculations, where the ERIs are stored ; in core or on disk. However, even when using DF, I/O becomes a significant bottleneck for systems of a sufficient size when performing conventional SCF; calculations. In principle, though, DF approaches can be utilized in an integral-direct context, gaining the benefits of DF methods without suffering the; I/O bottlenecks that conventional DF methods will eventually run into. One such approach, outlined by Weigend in [Weigend:2002:4285]_,; is available for use in Psi4 for the separate construction of the Coulomb contribution to the Fock matrix. This implementation can be used alongside ; Psi4's separate Exchange construction algorithms for composite Fock matrix construction by using the keyword DFDIRJ as the Coulomb construction ; algorithm when specifying |globals__scf_type| to use a composite algorithm combination (``DFDIRJ+K_alg`` in general, ; or ``DFDIRJ`` for DFT with non-hybrid functionals). . DFDIRJ supports multiple capabilities to improve performance. Specifically, DFDIRJ allows for a combination of density-matrix based ERI ; screening (set |globals__screening| to ``DENSITY``) and incremental Fock matrix construction (set |scf__incfock| to ``TRUE``). These two, when combined,; enable more aggressive screening of ERI contributions to the Coulomb matrix and thus greatly improve performance. .. _`sec:scfcosx`:. COSX Exchange; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

In COSX, numerical integration is performed on standard; DFT quadrature grids, which are described in :ref:`sec:dft`.; Both the accuracy of the COSX algorithm and also the computational; cost are directly determined by the size of the integration grid, so selection; of the grid is important. This COSX implementation uses two separate grids.; By default, the SCF algorithm is first converged on a smaller grid, followed by a; number of SCF iterations up to a maximum value (controlled by the |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| keyword); on a larger grid. By default, |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| is set to 1, a single; SCF iteration, which results in numerical errors comparable to; performing the entire SCF on the expensive larger grid at a computational cost; much closer to the smaller grid. Setting |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| to 0 disables the; larger grid entirely. Setting |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| to -1 allows; for the SCF to fully converge on the larger grid, useful for the study of wavefunction; properties such as gradients. The size of the initial grid is controlled by the keywords; |scf__cosx_radial_points_initial| and |scf__cosx_spherical_points_initial|.; The final grid is controlled by |scf__cosx_radial_points_final| and; |scf__cosx_spherical_points_final|.

Note that while the total number of macroiterations will be; less for SOSCF than gradient-based convergence acceleration, the cost of solving; the microiterations typically results in the overall cost being greater for; SOSCF than for gradient-based methods. Therefore, SOSCF should only be used if; it is difficult to locate a stable minimum. SOSCF is available for all HF and DFT references with the exception of meta-; GGA functionals.

In total, 284 molecular orbitals are chosen from; 287 AOs/USOs. .. _`sec:scfguess`:. Initial Guess; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~. In each step of the SCF procedure, a new Fock or Kohn--Sham potential is built; according to the previous density, following which the potential is diagonalized; to produce new molecular orbitals, from which a new density is computed. This; procedure is continued until either convergence is reached or a preset maximum; number of iterations is exceeded. Convergence is determined by both change in; energy and root-mean-square change in density matrix values, which must be below; the user-specified |scf__e_convergence| and |scf__d_convergence|, respectively.; The maximum number of iterations is specified by the |scf__maxiter| option. It; should be noted that SCF is a chaotic process, and, as such, often requires; careful selection of initial orbitals and damping during iterations to ensure; convergence. This is particularly likely for large systems, metallic systems,; multireference systems, open-shell systems, anions, and systems with diffuse; basis sets. For initial orbital selection, several options are available. These include:. CORE; Diagonalization of the core Hamiltonian, removing even mean-field electron; repulsion.

Builds the initial density as the; spin-averaged sum of atomic UHF computations in the current basis. If an; open-shell system, uniform scaling of the spin-averaged density matrices is; performed. If orbitals are needed (*e.g.*, in density fitting), a partial; Cholesky factorization of the density matrices is used. Often extremely; accurate, particularly for closed-shell systems. This is the default for; systems of more than one atom.; SADNO; Natural orbitals from Superposition of Atomic Densities.

Also, an automatic Python; procedure has been developed for converging the SCF in a small basis, and then; casting up to the true basis. This can be done by adding; |scf__basis_guess| = SMALL_BASIS to the options list. We recommend the; 3-21G or pcseg-0 basis for the small basis due to its efficient mix of flexibility and; compactness.

Convergence Stabilization; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. A summary of Psi's supported convergence stabilization techniques is presented below:. DIIS [On by Default]; DIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock matrix together; with an error criterion based on the orbital gradient to produce an informed; estimate of the next Fock Matrix. DIIS is almost always necessary to converge; the SCF procedure and is therefore turned on by default. In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via :term:`options <DIIS (SCF)>`.; ADIIS [On by Default]; ADIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock and density matrices to produce an; informed estimate of the next Fock matrix. ADIIS estimates are based on minimizing; an energy estimate rather than zeroing the residual, so this performs best in the early; iterations. By default, Psi will start using ADIIS before blending the ADIIS step with; the DIIS step, eventually using the pure DIIS step. The closely-related EDIIS procedure; may be used instead by setting |scf__scf_initial_accelerator|.

Integral-Direct Density-Fitted Coulomb Construction; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The Resolution of the Identity (RI) can be used to decompose the normally 4-center ERI tensor into a combination of 3-center and 2-center components.; By reducing the dimensionality of the ERI tensor, application of the RI (often referred to as density-fitting, or DF) can be used to greatly speed up; SCF calculations. The reduction in ERI tensor rank also makes DF an appealing option for conventional SCF calculations, where the ERIs are stored ; in core or on disk.

One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In |PSIfour|, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs. When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102]_ and [Lehtola:2020:032504]_.

The following snippet, extracted from the; :srcsample:`extern1` test case, demonstrates its use for a TIP3P external potential::. import numpy as np; external_potentials = [; [-0.834, np.array([1.649232019048,0.0,-2.356023604706]) / psi_bohr2angstroms],; [ 0.417, np.array([0.544757019107,0.0,-3.799961446760]) / psi_bohr2angstroms],; [ 0.417, np.array([0.544757019107,0.0,-0.912085762652]) / psi_bohr2angstroms]]. gradient('scf', external_potentials=external_potentials). The ``external_potentials`` array has three rows for three separate; particles, and it is passed to the SCF code on the last line. The; rows are composed of the atomic charge, x coordinate, y coordinate,; and z coordinate in that order. The atomic charge and coordinates are; specified in atomic units, [e] and [a0]. Add as many particle rows as; needed to describe the full MM region. .. caution:: In |PSIfour| previous to Spring 2022 and v1.6, setting an; external potential like the above looked like ::.

After the iterations are completed, a number of one-electron properties are; printed, and some bookkeeping is performed to set up possible correlated; computations. Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; |globals__print| option. Also printed are the occupied and virtual orbital energies,; which are useful in elucidating the stability and reactivity of the system. .. index::; pair: SCF; theory. .. _`sec:scftheory`:. Theory; ~~~~~~. The objective of Hartree--Fock (HF) Theory is to produce the optimized Molecular; Orbitals (MOs) :math:`\{\psi_i\}`,. .. math:: \psi_i(\vec x_1) = C_{\mu i} \phi_{\mu} (\vec x_1). Here, :math:`\{\phi_{\mu}\}` are the basis functions, which, in |PSIfour| are; contracted Cartesian Gaussian functions often referred to as Atomic Orbitals; (AOs). The matrix :math:`C_{\mu i}` contains the MO coefficients, which are the; constrained variational parameters in Hartree--Fock. The molecular orbitals are; used to build the simplest possible antisymmetric wavefunction, a single Slater; determinant,. .. math:: | \Psi_0 \rangle =; \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left | \begin{array}{cccc}; \psi_1 (\vec x_1) & \psi_2(\vec x_1) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_1) \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_2) & \psi_2(\vec x_2) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_2) \\; \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\; \psi_1 (\vec x_N) & \psi_2(\vec x_N) & \ldots & \psi_N (\vec x_N) \\; \end{array}\right |. This form for the Hartree--Fock wavefunction is actually entirely equivalent to; treating the electron correlation as a mean field repulsion in; :math:`\mathbb{R}^6` instead of a more complicated effect in; :math:`\mathbb{R}^N`\ .

In case convergence problems are encountered during the Davidson procedure, file a bug report.; If the solver seems to converge on the wrong eigenvalue, try increasing |scf__solver_n_guess|.; Otherwise, if the solver is almost converged but reaches the maximum number of iterations, try increasing; |scf__solver_maxiter|. .. _`sec:scf-ecps`:. Effective core potentials (ECPs); ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. |PSIfour| supports the use of effective core potentials to describe the; innermost electrons in heavy elements.; ECPs are only available if |PSIfour| is compiled with the :ref:`LibECPInt <cmake:ecpint>` library.; If a basis set is designed to use an; effective core potential, the ECP definition should be simply placed alongside; the orbital basis set definition, *c.f.* :ref:`sec:basissets-ecps`. All; information related to the definition and number of core electrons will; automatically be detected and no further input is required to use the; ECP-containing basis set. See :srcsample:`scf-ecp` and :srcsample:`dfmp2-ecp`; for examples of computations with ECP-containing basis sets. .. warning:: Prior to May 2022, v1.6, Psi4 used a built-in ECP code. Analytic derivatives of ECPs were not available. The HF and DFT derivatives were implemented in a semi-numerical scheme, where numerical ECP gradients were added to analytic SCF gradients. For post-SCF methods, the entire gradient computation needed to be run as finite difference of energies. .. warning:: As of May 2022, v1.6, Psi4 uses the LibECPInt library, and analytic derivatives and Hessians of ECPs are available.

Recommendations; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The SCF code is quite flexible and powerful.; We have tried as much as possible to keep the number of options to; a minimum and to allow all options to be used in the presence of all other; options. Below are some rough words of advice about using the SCF code for; practical calculations:. * For |scf__guess|, the ``SAD`` guess is usually your; friend, even for open-shell systems (at the very least, it gets the right; number of electrons, unlike some other programs). For instance, we have found; that a simple SAD guess is often as good as doing a full SCF in a 3-21G basis; and then performing a cast-up, at a fraction of the cost. However, SAD and; DOCC/SOCC arrays do not play very well together at the moment.; * For wall time, ``DF`` may be a factor of ten or more faster than the exact; integral technologies available in |PSIfour|.; Use ``DF`` unless you need absolute accuracy or do not; have a -JKFIT auxiliary set for your orbital basis/atom type. Then use; ``DIRECT``.; * Don't mess with the DIIS convergence options unless convergence is a problem.; We have optimized the parameters for efficiency over a wide array of system; types.; * Buy a developer a beer!.

Many of the tasks automated by Python wrappers consist of a number of; independent |PSIfour| calculations and are thus suited to an embarrassingly; parallel mode of operation. In Psithon, these have been dubbed sow/reap; procedures and have the following general structure. - Prepare an input file, simply adding ``mode='sow'`` to the; argument list of an available Python function. Run this quick job to; produce input files for lengthier calculations. - According to the instructions in the output file of the above step,; run the generated input files in any order on any variety of computers; and architectures. This is the time-intensive portion of the; calculation. - The 'sow' stage also produces a *master* input file (with a; ``mode='reap'`` directive). When all the jobs in the above step are; completed, place their output files in the same location as the; *master* input, and run this last, quick job to collect the results. - Sow/reap procedures are governed by the **mode** keyword, choices being; ``'continuous'``, ``'sow'``, and ``'reap'``. Only ``'sow'`` is likely to; be used by the user, as ``'continuous'`` is always the default, and; input files with ``'reap'`` are autogenerated. - Embarrassingly parallel algorithm available at present for:. - :ref:`sec:db()` ; - finite difference operation of :ref:`sec",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/sowreap.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/sowreap.rst

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis; ========================================================. The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy` function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy` with :py:func:`~psi4.driver.optimize` or :py:func:`~psi4.driver.frequency`, respectively. Here's an example of optimizing the H\ :sub:`2`\ O molecule using Hartree--Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; :srcsample:`tu3-h2o-opt`). .. literalinclude:: @SFNX_INCLUDE@samples/tu3-h2o-opt/input.dat. This should perform a series of gradient computations. The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After a few cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like ``Optimization is complete!``. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation and grep-able with ``~``), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not). ::. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; Step Total Energy Delta E MAX Force RMS Force MAX Disp RMS Disp ~; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; 1 -76.026632734857 -76.026632734857 0.01523505 0.01245744 0.02742199 0.02277500 ~; 2 -76.027022668419 -0.000389933562 0.00178749 0.00142923 0.01007985 0.00594840 ~; 3 -76.027032729361 -0.000010060942 0.00014016 0.00008485 0",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/tutorial.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/tutorial.rst

This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there's a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over. So, it's easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; :srcsample:`tu4-h2o-freq`):. .. literalinclude:: @SFNX_INCLUDE@samples/tu4-h2o-freq/input.dat. The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements. From this, it can obtain the harmonic vibrational; frequencies, given below (roundoff errors of around 0.1 cm\ :sup:`-1`; may exist)::.

The vibrational; frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to; enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the; molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are; then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G. .. _`sec:tutorial_tu5`:. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions; =======================================. Now let's consider something a little more interesting. |PSIfour|; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]_. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and |PSIfour|; makes these computations easier than ever. For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

Before, we have been setting keywords individually with commands like; ``set basis cc-pVDZ``. Because we have a few more options now, it's; convenient to place them together into the ``set``; block, bounded by ``{...}``. This; will set all of these options as ""global"" options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common |PSIfour| options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (*e.g.*, we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (*e.g.*, ``set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8``). Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (*i.e.*, SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs]_ with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse :math:`d` functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10]_. So,; we'll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to; use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors; while providing much faster computations [Hohenstein:2010:184111]_ ; [Hohenstein:2010:014101]_. Since we're using density fitting for the SAPT,; we might as well also use it for the Hartree--Fock computations that are; performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that with ; ``scf_type DF``. Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that; pair with the primary basis set. Fortunately, |PSIfour| is usually smart; enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given; computation. In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set; (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set); that |PSIfour| correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT; a",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/sphinxman/source/tutorial.rst,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/tutorial.rst
