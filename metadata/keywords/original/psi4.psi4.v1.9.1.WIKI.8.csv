How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/{prefix}/lib/psi4/core.so ../psi4/core.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. How to set PSIDATADIR and why¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4. Or in the shell; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSIDATADIR {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profi",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html

Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies; PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source. Examples. Build with detected compiler from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific (Intel) compiler from PATH. >>> cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort. What Fortran compilers are approved¶; On Linux and Mac, the following work nicely. GNU: gfortran; Intel: ifort. Packages to install for specific OS or package managers:; Ubuntu gfortran; conda gcc or gcc-5 to get gfortran. How to obtain a Fortran compiler for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; Xcode does not provide a Fortran compiler. A way to get one is to download; the gcc conda package. This provides gcc, g++, and; gfortran compilers for Mac. The two former are 4.8.5 and so are too; old to compile PSI4, but the Fortran compiler will work. How to configure BLAS/LAPACK for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, BLAS and LAPACK control much of the speed; and efficiency of the code since computational chemistry is essentially; linear algebra on molecular systems.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) LAPACK Libraries. CMake Variables. BLAS_TYPE — CMake variable to specify which BLAS libraries to look for among MKL|OPENBLAS|ESSL|ATLAS|ACML|SYSTEM_NATIVE.; LAPACK_TYPE — CMake variable to specify which LAPACK libraries to look for among MKL|OPENBLAS|ESSL|ATLAS|ACML|SYSTEM_NATIVE.; MKL_ROOT — Environment variable set by Intel compilervars scripts.

Build with explicit non-MKL LAPACK. >>> cmake -DLAPACK_LIBRARIES=""/path/to/lib/liblapack.so;/path/to/lib/libblas.a"". Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:; It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013). On Mac, the; native Accelerate libraries are also recommended.; For open-source LAPACK distributions, OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); is known to work, while ATLAS is known; (https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/391) to have stability issues; with the DFOCC module.; ACML libraries are known to work with PSI4 v1.1 at ACML 6. The BLAS/LAPACK detected for PSI4 are also linked into any; Add-Ons (e.g., libefp) that require them, rather than relying on; those packages’ native math detection.; The separation between BLAS and LAPACK seen in detection printing; and CMake variables is purely formal. In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so).

How to set PSIDATADIR and why¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

What C and C++ compilers and versions are approved¶; On Linux, the following work nicely. GNU: gcc, g++; Intel: icc, icpc; Clang: clang, clang++. On Mac, the following work nicely. Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS¶; # See if GCC too old (in this case, yes); >>> gcc --version; gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4). Even if you’re not using GCC as a compiler, your Intel compiler seeks; gcc to generate code compatible with your current GCC version. If your; GCC is too old (like above), you can update your system GCC through your; package manager or install an acceptable version elsewhere on your; system. The latter route, tested on Linux with Intel compilers, is below.; # Install GCC 5.2 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n gcc52 -c psi4 gcc-5-mp. # To Build, either:. # (A) activate environment (prepends PATH); >>> source activate gcc52. # (B) tell CMake to tell the compiler which GCC to use; >>> vi do",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html

How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies; PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source. Examples. Build with detected compiler from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific (Intel) compiler from PATH. >>> cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort. What Fortran compilers are approved¶; On Linux and Mac, the following work nicely. GNU: gfortran; Intel: ifort. Packages to install for specific OS or package managers:; Ubuntu gfortran; conda gcc or gcc-5 to get gfortran. How to obtain a Fortran compiler for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; Xcode does not provide a Fortran compiler. A way to get one is to download; the gcc conda package. This provides gcc, g++, and; gfortran compilers for Mac. The two former are 4.8.5 and so are too; old to compile PSI4, but the Fortran compiler will work. How to configure BLAS/LAPACK for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, BLAS and LAPACK control much of the speed; and efficiency of the code since computational chemistry is essentially; linear algebra on molecular systems.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) LAPACK Libraries.

Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/{prefix}/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/{prefix}/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner.

Hitting the F7; key will toggle highlighting of git’s conflict markers.; >>> cat ~/.vimrc; set hlsearch; map <F7> :/\(<<<<<<<\\|=======\\|>>>>>>>\)<CR>.

How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a limited number of “smoke” tests are available to be; run via pytest. From the executable:; psi4 –test. From the library (PSI4 must be detectable as a Python; module. See the setup note at How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation; if needed.):; python -c “import psi4; psi4.test()”.

Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:; It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013). On Mac, the; native Accelerate libraries are also recommended.; For open-source LAPACK distributions, OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); is known to work, while ATLAS is known; (https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/391) to have stability issues; with the DFOCC module.; ACML libraries are known to work with PSI4 v1.1 at ACML 6. The BLAS/LAPACK detected for PSI4 are also linked into any; Add-Ons (e.g., libefp) that require them, rather than relying on; those packages’ native math detection.; The separation between BLAS and LAPACK seen in detection printing; and CMake variables is purely formal. In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so).

Installation and Runtime Configuration. Compiling and Installing from Source¶. Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. Prior to 1.1, PSI4 had a Python; script setup as a frontend to CMake, but this is no more, and; cmake is now invoked directly. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -H.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer.

How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS¶; # See if GCC too old (in this case, yes); >>> gcc --version; gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4). Even if you’re not using GCC as a compiler, your Intel compiler seeks; gcc to generate code compatible with your current GCC version. If your; GCC is too old (like above), you can update your system GCC through your; package manager or install an acceptable version elsewhere on your; system. The latter route, tested on Linux with Intel compilers, is below.; # Install GCC 5.2 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n gcc52 -c psi4 gcc-5-mp. # To Build, either:. # (A) activate environment (prepends PATH); >>> source activate gcc52. # (B) tell CMake to tell the compiler which GCC to use; >>> vi do-configure; GCC5=/path/to/miniconda/envs/gcc52; cmake -H. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc \; -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-gcc-name=${GCC5}/bin/gcc"" \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-gcc-name=${GCC5}/bin/gcc -gxx-name=${GCC5}/bin/g++"" \; ...; # if Fortran active ...; -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=icpc \; -DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS=""-gcc-name=${GCC5}/bin/gcc -gxx-name=${GCC5}/bin/g++"" \. # Configure and build. # To Run:; >>> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${GCC5}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:; It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013). On Mac, the; native Accelerate libraries are also recommended.; For open-source LAPACK distributions, OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); is known to work, while ATLAS is known; (https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/391) to have stability issues; with the DFOCC module.; ACML libraries are known to work with PSI4 v1.1 at ACML 6. The BLAS/LAPACK detected for PSI4 are also linked into any; Add-Ons (e.g., libefp) that require them, rather than",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html

The BLAS/LAPACK detected for PSI4 are also linked into any; Add-Ons (e.g., libefp) that require them, rather than relying on; those packages’ native math detection.; The separation between BLAS and LAPACK seen in detection printing; and CMake variables is purely formal. In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter.

See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invokes the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make, whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; 1>>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. If you have pytest installed, very similar coverage is obtained through:; 1>>> make pytest. How to run a subset of tests¶; CTest allows flexibly partitioned running of the test suite. In; the examples below, testname are regex of test names,; and testlabel are regex of labels (e.g., cc, mints,; libefp). Run tests in parallel with -j flag. For maximum parallelism: ctest -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; Run full test suite: ctest; Run about a third of the tests in 10–20 minutes, the so-called quicktests: ctest -L quick; Run the minimal number of tests to ensure Psi4 and any add-ons in working order: ctest -L smoke; Run tests matching by",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html

When ctest reports that some (or all) tests have failed, look in your; build directory for file; objdir/tests/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log. It may have a; .tmp extension, depending on whether the last test was interrupted and; a few other factors. Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a limited number of “smoke” tests are available to be; run via pytest. From the executable:; psi4 –test. From the library (PSI4 must be detectable as a Python; module. See the setup note at How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation; if needed.):; python -c “import psi4; psi4.test()”.

GNU: gcc, g++; Intel: icc, icpc; Clang: clang, clang++. On Mac, the following work nicely. Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS¶; # See if GCC too old (in this case, yes); >>> gcc --version; gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4). Even if you’re not using GCC as a compiler, your Intel compiler seeks; gcc to generate code compatible with your current GCC version. If your; GCC is too old (like above), you can update your system GCC through your; package manager or install an acceptable version elsewhere on your; system. The latter route, tested on Linux with Intel compilers, is below.; # Install GCC 5.2 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n gcc52 -c psi4 gcc-5-mp. # To Build, either:. # (A) activate environment (prepends PATH); >>> source activate gcc52. # (B) tell CMake to tell the compiler which GCC to use; >>> vi do-configure; GCC5=/path/to/miniconda/envs/gcc52; cmake -H. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc \; -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-gcc-name=${GCC5}/bin/gcc"" \; -",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; shebang line. To use a different Python with PSI4 in the long term,; edit the shebang line.; If you’re using PSI4 as a Python module, then PSI4 is running; the Python of which python. How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct“¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/{prefix}/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/{prefix}/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner. Issue make VERBOSE=1 to display the full; compilation commands and errors. How to highlight git merge conflicts in vi¶; Edit your ~/.vimrc file to include the lines below. Hitting the F7; key will toggle highlighting of git’s conflict markers.; >>> ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html

How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invokes the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make, whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; 1>>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. If you have pytest installed, very similar coverage is obtained through:; 1>>> make pytest.

How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation).

Installation and Runtime Configuration. Compiling and Installing from Source¶. Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. Prior to 1.1, PSI4 had a Python; script setup as a frontend to CMake, but this is no more, and; cmake is now invoked directly. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -H.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation; How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation. What are the tools and dependencies strictly required for building Psi4¶; The core PSI4 build requires the software below. Note that Python,; CMake, NumPy, and Libint (and even C++ compilers on Linux) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it. C++ and C Compilers (C++11 compliant); Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard; Linux distribution); Python interpreter and headers (2.7, 3.5, or 3.6) https://www.python.org/; CMake (3.3+) http://www.cmake.org/download/; NumPy (needed at runtime, not buildtime) http://www.numpy.org/; System utilities: GNU make, GNU install, POSIX threads (Pthreads) library. The following are also required for PSI4, but if not detected, the; build system will automatically download and build. Libint — [what is this?] [min version]; pybind11 — [what is this?] [min version]. What are the add-on capabilities for Psi4 and what are their dependencies¶; Each of the items below is an independent additional capability that can; be built with PSI4. Sub-items below are the respective additional; dependencies of the add-on. Select which, if any, you want, and examine; the links for appropriate enabling arguments to cmake. Note that many; are available pre-built from conda.

How to configure code to use high angular momentum basis sets¶; The Libint integral code handles arbitrary order; angular momentum, but compiling that is prohibitive. The default of 5; is generally good. 6 has met all of a research group’s needs for; years. 4 is handy for quickly testing other parts of the build. Build with Higher Angular Momentum; >>> cmake -DMAX_AM_ERI=6. Relevant CMake Options:; MAX_AM_ERI=N # The maximum angular momentum level (1=p, 2=d, 3=f,; # etc.) for the libint integrals and derivative; # integrals. A value of N implies a maximum first; # derivative of N-1, and maximum second derivative of; # N-2, so for an atom such as Neon, the default 5 gets; # you conventional cc-pV5Z for energies, cc-pVQZ for; # gradients, cc-pVTZ for frequencies and density-fitted; # cc-pVQZ for energies, cc-pVTZ for gradients, cc-pVDZ; # for frequencies. [default: 5]. Note that since PSI4 1.1, it is possible to build Libint; independently (or install just the libint conda package), then have; any/all PSI4 builds detect that installation at compile-time. How to configure Libint for building Psi4. How to get high angular momentum integrals from conda¶; To switch from the default libint package to the really large high AM; package, do the below. The channel/subchannel(s) containing the am8; metapackage and the high-AM libint package must be supplied (or in; .condarc).; 1conda install am8 -c psi4. To go back to the default libint package, do the below. The; channel/subchannel containing the default libint package must be supplied; (or in .condarc); otherwise, it’ll just remove libint and every package; depending on libint.; 1conda remove --features am8 -c psi4. The default package is AM6 because of its manageable file size (on Linux,; 10MB for libint and 40MB for libderiv). The AM7 are 20/100, respectively,; and the AM8 is 50/210.

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables. PYTHON_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; PYTHON_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python2.7.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code.

How to set PSIDATADIR and why¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set w",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning-1.html

Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS.

It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; 1>>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. If you have pytest installed, very similar coverage is obtained through:; 1>>> make pytest. How to run a subset of tests¶; CTest allows flexibly partitioned running of the test suite. In; the examples below, testname are regex of test names,; and testlabel are regex of labels (e.g., cc, mints,; libefp). Run tests in parallel with -j flag. For maximum parallelism: ctest -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; Run full test suite: ctest; Run about a third of the tests in 10–20 minutes, the so-called quicktests: ctest -L quick; Run the minimal number of tests to ensure Psi4 and any add-ons in working order: ctest -L smoke; Run tests matching by name: ctest -R testname; Run tests excluding those by name: ctest -E testname; Run tests matching by label: ctest -L testlabel; Run tests excluding those by label: ctest -LE testlabel.

Installation and Runtime Configuration. Compiling and Installing from Source¶. Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. Prior to 1.1, PSI4 had a Python; script setup as a frontend to CMake, but this is no more, and; cmake is now invoked directly. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -H.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4. More detail is given here.; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5>>> cd {top-level-psi4-dir}; >>> cmake -H. -Bobjdir [your configuration options]; >>> cd objdir; >>> make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; >>> make install.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/{prefix}/lib/psi4/core.so ../psi4/core.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. How to set PSIDATADIR and why¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to configure a Psi4 build on Cray¶; Cray systems strongly prefer to build static libraries, but PSI4; needs to be dynamic to function as a Python module. Courtesy of @misha; at the forum and various supercomputer guides, building PSI4 on; Cray requires setting environment variables CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE; and CRAY_ADD_RPATH before running cmake.; 1CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes cmake ...

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/{prefix}/lib/psi4/core.so ../psi4/core.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. How to set PSIDATADIR and why¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4. Or in the shell; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSIDATADIR {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profi",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning.html

Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies; PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source. Examples. Build with detected compiler from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific (Intel) compiler from PATH. >>> cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort. What Fortran compilers are approved¶; On Linux and Mac, the following work nicely. GNU: gfortran; Intel: ifort. Packages to install for specific OS or package managers:; Ubuntu gfortran; conda gcc or gcc-5 to get gfortran. How to obtain a Fortran compiler for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; Xcode does not provide a Fortran compiler. A way to get one is to download; the gcc conda package. This provides gcc, g++, and; gfortran compilers for Mac. The two former are 4.8.5 and so are too; old to compile PSI4, but the Fortran compiler will work. How to configure BLAS/LAPACK for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, BLAS and LAPACK control much of the speed; and efficiency of the code since computational chemistry is essentially; linear algebra on molecular systems.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) LAPACK Libraries. CMake Variables. BLAS_TYPE — CMake variable to specify which BLAS libraries to look for among MKL|OPENBLAS|ESSL|ATLAS|ACML|SYSTEM_NATIVE.; LAPACK_TYPE — CMake variable to specify which LAPACK libraries to look for among MKL|OPENBLAS|ESSL|ATLAS|ACML|SYSTEM_NATIVE.; MKL_ROOT — Environment variable set by Intel compilervars scripts.

Build with explicit non-MKL LAPACK. >>> cmake -DLAPACK_LIBRARIES=""/path/to/lib/liblapack.so;/path/to/lib/libblas.a"". Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:; It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013). On Mac, the; native Accelerate libraries are also recommended.; For open-source LAPACK distributions, OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); is known to work, while ATLAS is known; (https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/391) to have stability issues; with the DFOCC module.; ACML libraries are known to work with PSI4 v1.1 at ACML 6. The BLAS/LAPACK detected for PSI4 are also linked into any; Add-Ons (e.g., libefp) that require them, rather than relying on; those packages’ native math detection.; The separation between BLAS and LAPACK seen in detection printing; and CMake variables is purely formal. In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so).

How to set PSIDATADIR and why¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode.

What Fortran compilers are approved¶; On Linux and Mac, the following work nicely. GNU: gfortran; Intel: ifort. Packages to install for specific OS or package managers:; Ubuntu gfortran; conda gcc or gcc-5 to get gfortran. How to obtain a Fortran compiler for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; Xcode does not provide a Fortran compiler. A way to get one is to download; the gcc conda package. This provides gcc, g++, and; gfortran compilers for Mac. The two former are 4.8.5 and so are too; old to compile PSI4, but the Fortran compiler will work.

Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/{prefix}/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/{prefix}/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner.

Hitting the F7; key will toggle highlighting of git’s conflict markers.; >>> cat ~/.vimrc; set hlsearch; map <F7> :/\(<<<<<<<\\|=======\\|>>>>>>>\)<CR>. How to handle “runtime library may be hidden” when building with Anaconda Python¶; When building against Ana/Miniconda python (e.g., cmake; -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/conda/bin/python), the warning below often; appears. It is harmless, proceed.; CMake Warning at src/bin/psi4/CMakeLists.txt:58 (add_executable):; Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target psi4 because files in; some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:. runtime library [libm.so.6] in /usr/lib64 may be hidden by files in:; /theoryfs2/common/software/anaconda/lib.

See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invokes the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make, whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; 1>>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. If you have pytest installed, very similar coverage is obtained through:; 1>>> make pytest. How to run a subset of tests¶; CTest allows flexibly partitioned running of the test suite.

Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:; It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013). On Mac, the; native Accelerate libraries are also recommended.; For open-source LAPACK distributions, OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); is known to work, while ATLAS is known; (https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/391) to have stability issues; with the DFOCC module.; ACML libraries are known to work with PSI4 v1.1 at ACML 6. The BLAS/LAPACK detected for PSI4 are also linked into any; Add-Ons (e.g., libefp) that require them, rather than relying on; those packages’ native math detection.; The separation between BLAS and LAPACK seen in detection printing; and CMake variables is purely formal. In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so).

Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:; It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013). On Mac, the; native Accelerate libraries are also recommended.; For open-source LAPACK distributions, OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); is known to work, while ATLAS is known; (https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/391) to have stability issues; with the DFOCC module.; ACML libraries are known to work with PSI4 v1.1 at ACML 6.

The BLAS/LAPACK detected for PSI4 are also linked into any; Add-Ons (e.g., libefp) that require them, rather than relying on; those packages’ native math detection.; The separation between BLAS and LAPACK seen in detection printing; and CMake variables is purely formal. In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies.

See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invokes the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make, whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; 1>>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. If you have pytest installed, very similar coverage is obtained through:; 1>>> make pytest. How to run a subset of tests¶; CTest allows flexibly partitioned running of the test suite. In; the examples below, testname are regex of test names,; and testlabel are regex of labels (e.g., cc, mints,; libefp). Run tests in parallel with -j flag. For maximum parallelism: ctest -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; Run full test suite: ctest; Run about a third of the tests in 10–20 minutes, the so-called quicktests: ctest -L quick; Run the minimal number of tests to ensure Psi4 and any add-ons in working order: ctest -L smoke; Run tests matching by",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning.html

When ctest reports that some (or all) tests have failed, look in your; build directory for file; objdir/tests/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log. It may have a; .tmp extension, depending on whether the last test was interrupted and; a few other factors. Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a limited number of “smoke” tests are available to be; run via pytest. From the executable:; psi4 –test. From the library (PSI4 must be detectable as a Python; module. See the setup note at How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation; if needed.):; python -c “import psi4; psi4.test()”.

On Mac, the; native Accelerate libraries are also recommended.; For open-source LAPACK distributions, OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); is known to work, while ATLAS is known; (https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/391) to have stability issues; with the DFOCC module.; ACML libraries are known to work with PSI4 v1.1 at ACML 6. The BLAS/LAPACK detected for PSI4 are also linked into any; Add-Ons (e.g., libefp) that require them, rather than relying on; those packages’ native math detection.; The separation between BLAS and LAPACK seen in detection printing; and CMake variables is purely formal. In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so).

How to handle “runtime library may be hidden” when building with Anaconda Python¶; When building against Ana/Miniconda python (e.g., cmake; -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/conda/bin/python), the warning below often; appears. It is harmless, proceed.; CMake Warning at src/bin/psi4/CMakeLists.txt:58 (add_executable):; Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target psi4 because files in; some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:. runtime library [libm.so.6] in /usr/lib64 may be hidden by files in:; /theoryfs2/common/software/anaconda/lib. Some of these libraries may not be found correctly. How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invokes the executable.

GNU: gcc, g++; Intel: icc, icpc; Clang: clang, clang++. On Mac, the following work nicely. Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS¶; # See if GCC too old (in this case, yes); >>> gcc --version; gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4). Even if you’re not using GCC as a compiler, your Intel compiler seeks; gcc to generate code compatible with your current GCC version. If your; GCC is too old (like above), you can update your system GCC through your; package manager or install an acceptable version elsewhere on your; system. The latter route, tested on Linux with Intel compilers, is below.; # Install GCC 5.2 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n gcc52 -c psi4 gcc-5-mp. # To Build, either:. # (A) activate environment (prepends PATH); >>> source activate gcc52. # (B) tell CMake to tell the compiler which GCC to use; >>> vi do-configure; GCC5=/path/to/miniconda/envs/gcc52; cmake -H. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc \; -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-gcc-name=${GCC5}/bin/gcc"" \; -",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning.html

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; shebang line. To use a different Python with PSI4 in the long term,; edit the shebang line.; If you’re using PSI4 as a Python module, then PSI4 is running; the Python of which python. How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct“¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/{prefix}/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/{prefix}/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner. Issue make VERBOSE=1 to display the full; compilation commands and errors. How to highlight git merge conflicts in vi¶; Edit your ~/.vimrc file to include the lines below. Hitting the F7; key will toggle highlighting of git’s conflict markers.; >>> ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning.html

How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invokes the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make, whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; 1>>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a limited number of “smoke” tests are available to be; run via pytest. From the executable:; psi4 –test.

Installation and Runtime Configuration. Compiling and Installing from Source¶. Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. Prior to 1.1, PSI4 had a Python; script setup as a frontend to CMake, but this is no more, and; cmake is now invoked directly. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -H.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4.

Note that since PSI4 1.1, it is possible to build Libint; independently (or install just the libint conda package), then have; any/all PSI4 builds detect that installation at compile-time. How to configure Libint for building Psi4. How to get high angular momentum integrals from conda¶; To switch from the default libint package to the really large high AM; package, do the below. The channel/subchannel(s) containing the am8; metapackage and the high-AM libint package must be supplied (or in; .condarc).; 1conda install am8 -c psi4. To go back to the default libint package, do the below. The; channel/subchannel containing the default libint package must be supplied; (or in .condarc); otherwise, it’ll just remove libint and every package; depending on libint.; 1conda remove --features am8 -c psi4. The default package is AM6 because of its manageable file size (on Linux,; 10MB for libint and 40MB for libderiv). The AM7 are 20/100, respectively,; and the AM8 is 50/210.

How to handle “runtime library may be hidden” when building with Anaconda Python¶; When building against Ana/Miniconda python (e.g., cmake; -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/conda/bin/python), the warning below often; appears. It is harmless, proceed.; CMake Warning at src/bin/psi4/CMakeLists.txt:58 (add_executable):; Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target psi4 because files in; some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:. runtime library [libm.so.6] in /usr/lib64 may be hidden by files in:; /theoryfs2/common/software/anaconda/lib.

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code.

How to set PSIDATADIR and why¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set w",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/build_planning.html

Installation and Runtime Configuration. Compiling and Installing from Source¶. Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. Prior to 1.1, PSI4 had a Python; script setup as a frontend to CMake, but this is no more, and; cmake is now invoked directly. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -H.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4. More detail is given here.; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5>>> cd {top-level-psi4-dir}; >>> cmake -H. -Bobjdir [your configuration options]; >>> cd objdir; >>> make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; >>> make install. How to build, test, and install Psi4, in detail¶; 1. Plan Directories. Get ahold of the PSI4 codebase, and navigate to the top level source; directory, hereafter top-level-psi4-dir. How to obtain Psi4: start with find-the-code quiz, end in {top-level-psi4-dir}. 1>>> cd {top-level-psi4-dir}. Choose a compilation directory, hereafter objdir.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/{prefix}/lib/psi4/core.so ../psi4/core.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. How to set PSIDATADIR and why¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to configure a Psi4 build on Cray¶; Cray systems strongly prefer to build static libraries, but PSI4; needs to be dynamic to function as a Python module. Courtesy of @misha; at the forum and various supercomputer guides, building PSI4 on; Cray requires setting environment variables CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE; and CRAY_ADD_RPATH before running cmake.; 1CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes cmake ... How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies; PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source. Examples. Build with detected compiler from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific (Intel) compiler from PATH. >>> cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort.

Basic Keywords¶; A complete list of keywords related to coupled-cluster computations is; provided in the appendices, with the majority of the relevant; keywords appearing in Appendix CCENERGY. For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems.

Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd codes. A value of LOW selects a “low priority” scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities. A value of LRU selects a “least recently used” scheme in which the oldest item in the cache will be the first one deleted. Type: string; Possible Values: LOW, LRU; Default: LOW. NUM_AMPS_PRINT¶. Number of important \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes to print. Type: integer; Default: 10. MP2_AMPS_PRINT¶. Do print the MP2 amplitudes which are the starting guesses for RHF and UHF reference functions?. Type: boolean; Default: false. Larger Calculations¶; Here are a few recommendations for carrying out large-basis-set coupled; cluster calculations with PSI4:. In most cases it is reasonable to set the memory keyword to 90% of; the available physical memory, at most. There is a small amount of overhead; associated with the; coupled cluster modules that is not accounted for by the internal CC memory; handling routines. Thus, the user should not specify the entire; physical memory of the system, or swapping is likely. However, for especially large; calculations, it is better to set the memory keyword to a value less than 16 GB.; Set the CACHELEVEL keyword to 0.; This will turn off cacheing, which, for very large calculations, can; lead to heap fragmentation and memory faults, even when sufficient; physical memory exists.; Set the PRINT keyword to 2. This; will help narrow where memory bottlenecks or other errors exist in the; event of a crash. Excited State Coupled Cluster Calculations¶; A complete list of keywords related to; coupled cluster linear response is provided in Appendix CCEOM.; The most important keywords associated with EOM-CC calculations are:.

Acceptable values are POLARIZABILITY (default) for dipole polarizabilities, ROTATION for specific rotations, ROA for Raman Optical Activity (ROA_TENSOR for each displacement), and ALL for all of the above. Type: string; Possible Values: POLARIZABILITY, ROTATION, ROA, ROA_TENSOR, ALL; Default: POLARIZABILITY. OMEGA¶. Array that specifies the desired frequencies of the incident radiation field in CCLR calculations. If only one element is given, the units will be assumed to be atomic units. If more than one element is given, then the units must be specified as the final element of the array. Acceptable units are HZ, NM, EV, and AU. Type: array; Default: No Default. GAUGE¶. Specifies the choice of representation of the electric dipole operator. Acceptable values are LENGTH for the usual length-gauge representation, VELOCITY for the modified velocity-gauge representation in which the static-limit optical rotation tensor is subtracted from the frequency- dependent tensor, or BOTH. Note that, for optical rotation calculations, only the choices of VELOCITY or BOTH will yield origin-independent results.

The above example also shows the total memory for the computation being; set in PSI4 format. See Memory Specification for details. When; specified, the memory value is passed on to Cfour by setting keywords; CFOUR_MEMORY_SIZE and CFOUR_MEM_UNIT=MB.; PSI4 has an extensive basis set library in; Gaussian94 format. See Basis Sets for details. Contrasts to; Cfour basis handling include identifying basis sets by standard name; (aug-cc-pVDZ instead of AUG-PVDZ), direct handles for; diffuse-function-pruned sets (e.g., jun-cc-pVDZ), case insensitivity,; appropriate setting of spherical/Cartesian depending on basis set design,; and syntax to set different basis sets to different classes of atoms; without listing each atom. All of these features are available to Cfour by; using the BASIS keyword instead of CFOUR_BASIS; (accompanied, of course, by specifying the molecule PSI4-style).; Internally, PSI4 processes the basis set as usual, then translates; the basis set format and writes out a GENBAS file with an entry for; each atom. The P4C4 interface sets keyword CFOUR_BASIS=SPECIAL; and CFOUR_SPHERICAL as appropriate, then writes the basis section; necessary for SPECIAL below the *CFOUR(...) block.

Instead of the; generic 'cfour', the computational method is specified as the first; argument to the optimize() call.

Specifying anything in PSI4 format (molecule, basis, options,; method call) starts building a *CFOUR(...) directive for the; ZMAT file. Since the contents of the cfour {...} block are; blindly appended to any input interpreted from PSI4 format, mixing; of PSI4 and Cfour input formats likely will give rise to multiple; *CFOUR(...) directives in the prospective ZMAT, execution of; which will be trapped and halted. Proper uses for the cfour {...}; block are for the sandwich mode, where the entire ZMAT is enclosed,; or for extra directives like %excite*, which presently have no other; specification route. Specifying the basis is perhaps the regulated piece of input. Since; basis set names differ between PSI4 and Cfour and it’s not; practical to compare exponent-to-exponent, any input file with both; BASIS and CFOUR_BASIS keywords present will halt. Once; a basis set has been requested through BASIS, overriding the; default spherical/Cartesian setting must be done through; PUREAM (as opposed to CFOUR_SPHERICAL). Specifying keywords that control geometry optimization is; straightforward. Unless the optimization is invoked in sandwich mode,; all Cfour optimization keywords (e.g., CFOUR_GEO_MAXCYC) are; ineffective, as the Cfour optimizer is never invoked. PSI4; optimization keywords (e.g., GEOM_MAXITER) instead fill; these roles.

Specifying certain keywords that are nominally applicable for pure-PSI4 modules directs them to fulfil analogous roles; in the Cfour program (e.g., MAXITER is used to set; CFOUR_SCF_MAXCYC).

Mainz),; which is available after a license agreement from; http://www.cfour.de/. Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH. If PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error; will be reported. Caution; The p4c4 interface hasn’t been fully adapted for the new March 2014 version. Cfour for PSI4 Users¶. Set memory as usual; Set molecule as usual; Set basis set as usual (Cfour only cares about orbital basis, no fitting; bases); Set the task as usual, indicating Cfour as the intended code by; prepending “c4-” to the method argument.

Warning; Because p4c4 does not inspect the contents of the cfour {...}; block, once the user specifies a PSI4-style molecule, the; interface cannot judge whether a sandwich mode (drop the PSI4 molecule; and use the cfour block as the entirety of the ZMAT) or a standard mode; (translate the PSI4 molecule and append additional input from the; cfour block) is intended. The latter is what actually occurs. If; there is both a PSI4 molecule and a molecule in the cfour block,; ZMAT will end up with multiple molecules and multiple *CFOUR(...); blocks, and it will not run. Therefore, if mixing sandwich and; standard or pure-PSI4 computations in an input file, place all; the sandwich jobs at the beginning before declaring PSI4; molecules.

So energy('scf') becomes; energy('c4-scf') and optimize('ccsd(t)') becomes; optimize('c4-ccsd(t)'). Find available methods for; energy() at Energy (CFOUR); and for optimize() at Gradient (CFOUR).; Generally, the p4c4 interface will handle best practices for path of; execution: vcc/ecc, derivative type, etc. The user is still; responsible for setting convergence, frozen core, guess, diis, etc.; For the moment, so-called “best-practices” keywords are summarized at; Best Practices.; For the type of computation intended, find appropriate options at; Keywords. These keyword summaries contain the same; information as the proper CFOUR options list; plus notes on keyword relevance when run through PSI4. Information; at the CFOUR manual may; also be useful, as may the many samples at psi4/samples/cfour.; Set Cfour keywords just like PSI4 keywords. The names of keywords; are unchanged beyond a prepended “cfour_”. (Though be aware that common; abbreviations like CALC and REF must be fully spelled out as; CFOUR_CALC_LEVEL and CFOUR_REFERENCE when used in; PSI4.); In limited trial cases, keywords nominally directed at non-Cfour modules; are t",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.1.0/cfour.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1.0/cfour.html

Here, the contents of the cfour {...} block are written directly to a; ZMAT file. This is joined by a default GENBAS file; (psi4/share/basis/GENBAS). To preferentially use your own GENBAS,; place it in PATH or PSIPATH. The line calling; energy() with argument 'cfour' invokes; xcfour.; After execution of the energy('cfour') line completes, Cfour results; are read back into PSI4 format and are thereafter accessible for; further processing in the input file. See Output for; details. This storage of results in variables and arrays in memory for; the duration of the PSI4 instance (as opposed to solely in files); is the only advantage thus far incurred by the P4C4 interface. We’ll call; this mode of basic utility the “sandwich” mode.; Molecule specification in PSI4 allows Cartesians, Z-matrices, mixed; Cartesian/Z-matrix, negation of variables, delayed specification of; variables, specification of fragments, etc., all in a whitespace-tolerant; format. See Molecule and Geometry Specification for details and; cfour/mints5 for examples. When a PSI4-style molecule is; supplied, its geometry is written to ZMAT in Cartesian form and the; CFOUR_COORDINATES=CARTESIAN, CFOUR_UNITS=ANGSTROM,; CFOUR_CHARGE, and CFOUR_MULTIPLICITY keywords are set; appropriately in the *CFOUR(...) directive. Warning; There exist molecules (e.g., allene) where the; inertial frame is not unique (planes along atoms or between; atoms). The orientation reconciling machinery currently does not; handle these cases and will fail with “Axis unreconcilable between; QC programs”. I will get to this soon. Whenever the molecule is supplied in PSI4 format, the job control; keywords must be too. All Cfour keywords are the usual; ones, prepended by cfour_ to avoid any possible name conflicts. As; detailed in Job Control Keywords, setting keywords is flexible in; format.

The above example also shows the total memory for the computation being; set in PSI4 format. See Memory Specification for details. When; specified, the memory value is passed on to Cfour by setting keywords; CFOUR_MEMORY_SIZE and CFOUR_MEM_UNIT=MB.; PSI4 has an extensive basis set library in; Gaussian94 format. See Basis Sets for details. Contrasts to; Cfour basis handling include identifying basis sets by standard name; (aug-cc-pVDZ instead of AUG-PVDZ), direct handles for; diffuse-function-pruned sets (e.g., jun-cc-pVDZ), case insensitivity,; appropriate setting of spherical/Cartesian depending on basis set design,; and syntax to set different basis sets to different classes of atoms; without listing each atom. All of these features are available to Cfour by; using the BASIS keyword instead of CFOUR_BASIS; (accompanied, of course, by specifying the molecule PSI4-style).; Internally, PSI4 processes the basis set as usual, then translates; the basis set format and writes out a GENBAS file with an entry for; each atom. The P4C4 interface sets keyword CFOUR_BASIS=SPECIAL; and CFOUR_SPHERICAL as appropriate, then writes the basis section; necessary for SPECIAL below the *CFOUR(...) block.

This storage of results in variables and arrays in memory for; the duration of the PSI4 instance (as opposed to solely in files); is the only advantage thus far incurred by the P4C4 interface. We’ll call; this mode of basic utility the “sandwich” mode.; Molecule specification in PSI4 allows Cartesians, Z-matrices, mixed; Cartesian/Z-matrix, negation of variables, delayed specification of; variables, specification of fragments, etc., all in a whitespace-tolerant; format. See Molecule and Geometry Specification for details and; cfour/mints5 for examples. When a PSI4-style molecule is; supplied, its geometry is written to ZMAT in Cartesian form and the; CFOUR_COORDINATES=CARTESIAN, CFOUR_UNITS=ANGSTROM,; CFOUR_CHARGE, and CFOUR_MULTIPLICITY keywords are set; appropriately in the *CFOUR(...) directive. Warning; There exist molecules (e.g., allene) where the; inertial frame is not unique (planes along atoms or between; atoms).

Proper uses for the cfour {...}; block are for the sandwich mode, where the entire ZMAT is enclosed,; or for extra directives like %excite*, which presently have no other; specification route.

Once; a basis set has been requested through BASIS, overriding the; default spherical/Cartesian setting must be done through; PUREAM (as opposed to CFOUR_SPHERICAL). Specifying keywords that control geometry optimization is; straightforward. Unless the optimization is invoked in sandwich mode,; all Cfour optimization keywords (e.g., CFOUR_GEO_MAXCYC) are; ineffective, as the Cfour optimizer is never invoked. PSI4; optimization keywords (e.g., GEOM_MAXITER) instead fill; these roles.

Interfaces: Enhancing PSI4 Capabilities. Interface to CFOUR by J. Stanton & J. Gauss¶; Code author: Lori A. Burns; Section author: Lori A.

Mainz),; which is available after a license agreement from; http://www.cfour.de/. Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH. If PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error; will be reported. Caution; The p4c4 interface hasn’t been fully adapted for the new March 2014 version. Cfour for PSI4 Users¶. Set memory as usual; Set molecule as usual; Set basis set as usual (Cfour only cares about orbital basis, no fitting; bases); Set the task as usual, indicating Cfour as the intended code by; prepending “c4-” to the method argument.

Warning; Because p4c4 does not inspect the contents of the cfour {...}; block, once the user specifies a PSI4-style molecule, the; interface cannot judge whether a sandwich mode (drop the PSI4 molecule; and use the cfour block as the entirety of the ZMAT) or a standard mode; (translate the PSI4 molecule and append additional input from the; cfour block) is intended.

How to fix “plugin needed to handle lto object” when building CheMPS2¶; For building with GCC, errors involving unresolved symbols or a message; “plugin needed to handle lto object” may indicate a failure of the; interprocedural optimization. This can be resolved by passing full; locations to gcc toolchain utilities to setup or cmake:; -DCMAKE_RANLIB=/path/to/gcc-ranlib -DCMAKE_AR=/path/to/gcc-ar .; Details at https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/414. table of contents.
