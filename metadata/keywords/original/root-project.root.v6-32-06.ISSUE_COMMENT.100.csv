I understand that it's *better* than what we have now; but I think it's not good enough. Why can you not:. * pass Python integers as `int`, then `long`, then... (i.e. keep re-trying)?; * pass strings as `const char*`s; * pass collections as `begin(). end()`; *... i.e. have a mapping into C++ expressions, instead of wanting to do (a C++ feature-restricted version of) overload resolution inside cppyy? Can you expand on ""I can do a much better job finding my own match than can do Sema, b/c the rules to apply aren't exactly the C++ ones (the only ones that Sema knows)"". Why can you not model type conversion options into C++ argument types, instead of doing that conversion model yourself from C++ function argument types?

The introduction of modules, not disabled by minimal, broke mac-debug and Windows builds. In the core libraries, new code appeared that casted pointer types to long, causing more Win64 breakage. Not that ROOT runs on Win64 at all and requires the exact same compiler on the user's end on Win32. Users can also not trivially switch C++ versions unless they rebuild from source, this on any platform. Several of these issues were also reported on the ROOT forum. What you are showing is that *you* are able to build ROOT on some carefully prepared machines with your carefully selected set of compilers. In that list of nightlies, you are not even building binaries on one machine and running them on others.

For example, on Windows, MSVC likes to change header guards, so unless you use the _exact_ same compiler as ROOT was built with, you'll get a crash because of redefinitions. There are a couple of similar issues on Linux, which you ""fix"" by shipping Linux system headers (wchar.h, stat.h, time.h). But woe onto the poor bugger that has such headers significantly different from Scientific Linux on their system (e.g. Python's manylinux docker image ...). An no, Windows does _not_ have a system compiler. *You* selected one that works for you. Windows applications are quite binary compatible (more so than e.g. Mac, and certainly easier than Linux varietals), so that's a choice. Neither has Mac for that matter: folks are free to update Xcode or not. Of course, you're saved here b/c even older Clang on Mac is pretty up-to-date with C++, but no such luck on Windows. On the other hand, modern MSVC is fine, but then Clang5 underpinning Cling can not parse the C++ library headers of MSVC 19 with C++17 enabled. So catch-22. Shipped PCMs also prevent developers from using OpenMP with Cling, but at least that can still be done in libraries, which can be linked without otherwise exposing OpenMP. However, the baked-in choice for _not_ having AVX means not only that Cling can not use it, but also causes binary incompatability with libraries that were compiled with AVX enabled (e.g. many/most Eigen-based codes). Then there is the version of C++ being fixed by the PCMs (and worse, in RConfig.h and the ""backported"" stringview classes, so it's not a simple matter of wiping the local PCMs and rebuilding), meaning C++11 is the only supported version unless you do a full recompile (and see the forum for how much fun that is).

Neither has Mac for that matter: folks are free to update Xcode or not. Of course, you're saved here b/c even older Clang on Mac is pretty up-to-date with C++, but no such luck on Windows. On the other hand, modern MSVC is fine, but then Clang5 underpinning Cling can not parse the C++ library headers of MSVC 19 with C++17 enabled. So catch-22. Shipped PCMs also prevent developers from using OpenMP with Cling, but at least that can still be done in libraries, which can be linked without otherwise exposing OpenMP. However, the baked-in choice for _not_ having AVX means not only that Cling can not use it, but also causes binary incompatability with libraries that were compiled with AVX enabled (e.g. many/most Eigen-based codes). Then there is the version of C++ being fixed by the PCMs (and worse, in RConfig.h and the ""backported"" stringview classes, so it's not a simple matter of wiping the local PCMs and rebuilding), meaning C++11 is the only supported version unless you do a full recompile (and see the forum for how much fun that is). And if you look at the whole list of nightlies of the past couple of weeks, and not only at the carefully selected all-green one out of a sea of red that you posted above, you'll see that non-Linux platforms fail disproportionally often.

I understand that this ""feature"" is quite time consuming to implement. But this is actually crucial for Mac. While for the other platforms one can have a reproduciable or common build with debug information (e.g. using on Linux the root-debug packages from EPEL) for Mac it is not possible. Some packages on Mac could come from homebrew, others from system, macports or from elsewhere.; As a result, if someone sees a problem in the official release for Mac, it is not possible to debug it -- the attempts to have a build that ""same as the official, but with debug info"" are futile. Can something be done concerning this at least for a single Mac version?.

For example, instead of building `Y.pcm` once we are done with building `X.pcm` we wait for the linker to link `X.so`.; * rootcling is unnecessary slow -- the tool has grown organically and in many cases we make many iterations over the AST where we don't need them. Some of the larger scale ideas have been outlined here since years: https://github.com/root-project/root-evolution/pull/5 In fact, we don't need to get so much into the refactoring rootcling, attaching a profiler and seeing the bottlenecks should be easy. For example, iirc, we make several passes over the AST to harvest the selection rules instead of making a single pass.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6432#issuecomment-2001956688

Since for `B` and `C` `fun1` is overridden in Python, `Dispatcher1` and `Dispatcher2` define a `fun1` implementation that redirects the call to the Python `fun1` of `B` and `C`, respectively. That is not the case of `D`, whose `Dispatcher3` defines no `fun1`. What I described above explains the behaviour reported in this ticket. When calling `d.fun2()`, which in turn calls `fun1`, the latter will be resolved to `A::fun1`, whereas one would expect that it is the `fun1` defined in Python by `B` that is called instead. This issue does not exist in upstream cppyy: `Dispatcher3` inherits from `Dispatcher1` (`B`'s dispatcher) and not from `A` directly, which means that the call to `fun1` from `fun2` will be resolved to `Dispatcher1::fun1`, which will redirect the call to Python (`B`'s `fun1`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166

Since for `B` and `C` `fun1` is overridden in Python, `Dispatcher1` and `Dispatcher2` define a `fun1` implementation that redirects the call to the Python `fun1` of `B` and `C`, respectively. That is not the case of `D`, whose `Dispatcher3` defines no `fun1`. What I described above explains the behaviour reported in this ticket. When calling `d.fun2()`, which in turn calls `fun1`, the latter will be resolved to `A::fun1`, whereas one would expect that it is the `fun1` defined in Python by `B` that is called instead. This issue does not exist in upstream cppyy: `Dispatcher3` inherits from `Dispatcher1` (`B`'s dispatcher) and not from `A` directly, which means that the call to `fun1` from `fun2` will be resolved to `Dispatcher1::fun1`, which will redirect the call to Python (`B`'s `fun1`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166
