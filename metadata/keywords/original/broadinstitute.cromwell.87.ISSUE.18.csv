https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7333:377,Modifiability,extend,extending,377,"Restart tests are those that command Centaur to restart Cromwell partway through. They [run sequentially](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/d60b2a225a32960970890d1253374c7e057db3b7/centaur/src/main/scala/centaur/test/standard/CentaurTestFormat.scala#L43), meaning they don't start until after all the other tests have finished. Some of them also run really long, extending completion times a lot. Technically this change means that the restart test will no longer be in a horicromtal-style suite, but the main point of those suites is to verify that workflows get distributed across runners anyway.

Callcaching fails on GCPBATCH but not on PAPIv2 when using a private docker image in gcr.io. ; Is this a missing feature or a bug? The documentation on the subject could go either way, depending on whether GCPBATCH is part of the other backends or a subset of the pipelines backend (https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cromwell_features/CallCaching/). ; I do not think this is a configuration error, since the same config works with PAPIv2 backend, but if it is, what configuration options would be necessary for configuring gcr.io authentication when using GCPBATCH?.

Callcaching fails on GCPBATCH but not on PAPIv2 when using a private docker image in gcr.io. ; Is this a missing feature or a bug? The documentation on the subject could go either way, depending on whether GCPBATCH is part of the other backends or a subset of the pipelines backend (https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cromwell_features/CallCaching/). ; I do not think this is a configuration error, since the same config works with PAPIv2 backend, but if it is, what configuration options would be necessary for configuring gcr.io authentication when using GCPBATCH?.

Now we encapsulate possible exceptions in an `ErrorOr` so they can be safely evaluated in the `case Left(f) =>`. As a stylistic point, I changed `WomMap()` to `WomMap.apply()` to make it more obvious that we're really doing a lot of custom stuff and it's not just a regular old constructor. As a bonus, the new code detects all previous stuck-aborting workflows and fails them.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7412:3994,Performance,QUEUE,QUEUED,3994,"` also increases the worker's delay to pull work, for example, setting this value to `100` or above causes would cause the delay to become ~18m which seems insane (see [BatchApiRequestManager.scala](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/cee36d98755d2163f279600786bd60d6226835f0/supportedBackends/google/batch/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/batch/api/BatchApiRequestManager.scala#L67)), putting an upper limit on the delay seems worth it, any thoughts?; 5.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7412:975,Safety,abort,abort,975,"WARNING: This PR is huge and needs to be reviewed carefully, we have already performed many manual tests + ported many other tests from PAPI. ## Intro. The main goal is to refactor Batch backend to include [PipelinesApiRequestManager](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/5448b85bf334e0970665a69549e796199acc8bd7/supportedBackends/google/pipelines/common/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/pipelines/common/api/PipelinesApiRequestManager.scala) and [PipelinesApiRequestWorker](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/5448b85bf334e0970665a69549e796199acc8bd7/supportedBackends/google/pipelines/common/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/pipelines/common/api/PipelinesApiRequestWorker.scala). This also fixes a few missing details from the initial Batch integration (#7177), for example:; 1. Missing metrics are now published.; 2. The job status is queried before deleting it to try preventing the deletion of jobs that are in a final state (PAPI can abort jobs but Batch deletes them instead). I have been trying to split this into multiple smaller PRs, please let me know if you can find any piece that can be submitted independently, previous PRs:. - #7413; - #7394 ; - #7411; - #7410 ; - #7393; - #7421; - #7428. <details>; <summary>Questions (already resolved)</summary>. ## Questions. 1.

When running a workflow with `google_project` and/or `google_compute_service_account` workflow options defined, those two options don't take/have any effect on the workflow. The workflow executes in the project defined in the Batch backend config, using the service account defined in the Batch backend config. This breaks the ability to run workflows cross-project from a single cromwell instance with a single gcp backend (which was supported in PAPI). Workarounds like defining multiple backends (each for a separate project/compute sa) are not ideal. Looking through the Batch [backend code](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/4cddc6163b0b1d73e02f3723a82634df852b754b/supportedBackends/google/batch/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/batch/api/GcpBatchRequestFactoryImpl.scala#L168-L169), it seems the issue is the `parent` and `gcpSa` are populated from `batchAttributes` and `gcpBatchParameters` rather than `createParameters` where the workflow options would override the values defined in the backend config. The fix for this seems trivial, so I will submit a PR.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7459

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7480:354,Availability,avail,avail,354,"I'm having trouble getting call caching to work with Singularity and SGE, and I'm wondering if anyone has a working example config or some pointers. My config is below, minus passwords and specific paths/urls, which I've replaced with a label encased in <>. I've tried switching to slower hashing strategies finagling with the command construction to no avail. If there's not an obvious solution, is there an easy way to debug this? There are no network issues preventing connections to dockerhub - pulling images and converting to .sif works fine. It's only call caching that's broken. Even when I see, in the metadata, identical hashes for the docker image and all inputs and outputs, I see a ""Cache Miss"" as the result, every time. . The call caching stanza in my metadata looks like this, for example.

My expectation is that when run, the first ls will print out the current directory contents (which will not include anything matching `this_file_should_only_exist_for_second_ls.*` ) and then the second ls will have the same directory contents except also with a `this_file_should_only_exist_for_second_ls.{current_date_and_time}` included, and then the workflow will fail due to the non existent output file. This is indeed the behavior when run with PAPIv2 backend, based on looking at the stdout in the execution bucket.
