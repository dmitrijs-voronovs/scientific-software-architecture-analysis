Thy python functions shall always have final argument **kwargs, that they may take in and pass on keywords meant for other functions. Yea, even the run_mcscf(), and run_ccsd() -type functions that have no use for kwargs. The exceptions are python functions that are only helpers called by a driver function. Python functions should read the kwargs dictionary and (possibly) add to it. Functions should not pop or remove keywords from kwargs, even those keywords meaningful only to itself. This will ensure that the complete kwargs is available for pickling and sow/reap procedures. The exception is the molecule argument, which is read by the first function that gets ahold of it. This first function activates the molecule and pops it out of kwargs, effectively setting molecule for all subsequent functions. The code below should suffice.; # Make sure the molecule the user provided is the active one; if 'molecule' in kwargs:; activate(kwargs['molecule']); del kwargs['molecule']; molecule = PsiMod.get_active_molecule(); molecule.update_geometry(). Preferrably, the python function signature (for functions intended to be called in input files) is function(name, **kwargs). For functions that have other positional keywords, please bundle them into kwargs at earliest convenience (see Database argument db_name for example). After the docstring, the first two lines of your function should be the ones below. The first provides a case insensitive handle to the name argument value. The second converts all the kwargs dictionary keys to lowercase versions of themselves, so that input files can be case insensitive.; lowername = name.lower(); kwargs = kwargs_lower(kwargs). Case sensitivity for kwargs dictionary values still needs to be handled. The first line ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/bestpractices_py-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/bestpractices_py-1.html

Match boolean keywords (db_cp in the example below) with expressions like the following, which allow case insensitive yes/true/on/1/no/false/off/0 user input. If your argument’s value is a derivative level, similarly, use input.der0th, input.der1st, and input.der2nd.; if input.yes.match(str(db_cp)):; elif input.no.match(str(db_cp)):. For keywords that might be used in other functions as well as your own, prepend the argument name with a short representation of your function name. For example, there are keywords cp_func, db_func, and opt_func to request what python function, if not energy(), is called by cp(), database(), and optimize(). Upon checking in a new python file, edit the file psi4/doc/userman/source/index.rst and follow the instructions therein that your file may be autodocumented here. Write docstrings!

The net result of this code is that if the user specifies no *_func arguments, then energy() gets called. If the user defines xx_func, then its value gets called. If the user defines func, then its value gets reassigned to xx_func, func itself is deleted, and xx_func() gets called. Whatever is getting called is stored in func within the function.; # Establish function to call; if not('xx_func' in kwargs):; if ('func' in kwargs):; kwargs['xx_func'] = kwargs['func']; del kwargs['func']; else:; kwargs['xx_func'] = energy; func = kwargs['xx_func']; if not func:; raise ValidationError('Function \'%s\' does not exist to be called by wrapper counterpoise_correct.' % (func.__name__)); if (func is db):; raise ValidationError('Wrapper xx is unhappy to be calling function \'%s\'.' % (func.__name__)). If specific interoperabilities are known, code them in. For example, if xx shouldn’t call db, add the last two lines above to the xx function. If db shouldn’t call xx, add the following two lines below to the db function.; if (func is xx):; raise ValidationError('Wrapper database is unhappy to be calling function \'%s\'.' % (func.__name__)). Create a multipart test case that runs some intercalls between your function and others (akin to pywrap_all). In trials, permute the order of calls a few times to expose any calls that don’t clean up after themselves and need further attention. When all is validated, add your findings to the great Permitted nesting of Psithon functions table in the documentation.

Thy python functions shall always have final argument **kwargs, that they may take in and pass on keywords meant for other functions. Yea, even the run_mcscf(), and run_ccsd() -type functions that have no use for kwargs. The exceptions are python functions that are only helpers called by a driver function. Python functions should read the kwargs dictionary and (possibly) add to it. Functions should not pop or remove keywords from kwargs, even those keywords meaningful only to itself. This will ensure that the complete kwargs is available for pickling and sow/reap procedures. The exception is the molecule argument, which is read by the first function that gets ahold of it. This first function activates the molecule and pops it out of kwargs, effectively setting molecule for all subsequent functions. The code below should suffice.; # Make sure the molecule the user provided is the active one; if 'molecule' in kwargs:; activate(kwargs['molecule']); del kwargs['molecule']; molecule = PsiMod.get_active_molecule(); molecule.update_geometry(). Preferrably, the python function signature (for functions intended to be called in input files) is function(name, **kwargs). For functions that have other positional keywords, please bundle them into kwargs at earliest convenience (see Database argument db_name for example). After the docstring, the first two lines of your function should be the ones below. The first provides a case insensitive handle to the name argument value. The second converts all the kwargs dictionary keys to lowercase versions of themselves, so that input files can be case insensitive.; lowername = name.lower(); kwargs = kwargs_lower(kwargs).

This model has the same number of parameters as; configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) but improves upon; it by approximately accounting for higher-order terms using products; of lower-order terms (e.g., the term approximately; accounts for quadruple excitations). The inclusion of such products; makes coupled-cluster methods size extensive, meaning that the; quality of the computation should not degrade for larger molecules.; The computational cost for CCSD scales as , where; is the number of occupied orbitals and is the number of virtual; orbitals.; Improving upon CCSD, the CCSD(T) method [Raghavachari:1989] includes; a perturbative estimate of the energy contributed by the ; operator.

A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache.

Basic Keywords¶; A complete list of keywords related to coupled-cluster computations is; provided in the appendices, with the majority of the relevant; keywords appearing in Appendix CCENERGY. For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Breuckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest amplitude. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old and amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Cacheing level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantites with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., integrals) may be held in the cache. Type: integer; Default: 2. CACHETYPE¶.

If only one element is given, the units will be assumed to be atomic units. If more than one element is given, then the units must be specified as the final element of the array. Acceptable units are HZ, NM, EV, and AU. Type: array; Default: No Default. GAUGE¶. Specifies the choice of representation of the electric dipole operator. Acceptable values are LENGTH for the usual length-gauge representation, VELOCITY for the modified velocity-gauge representation in which the static-limit optical rotation tensor is subtracted from the frequency- dependent tensor, or BOTH. Note that, for optical rotation calculations, only the choices of VELOCITY or BOTH will yield origin-independent results. Type: string; Possible Values: LENGTH, VELOCITY, BOTH; Default: LENGTH.

Eugene DePrince; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, CEPA; Coupled-pair methods can be viewed as approximations to coupled-cluster (CC) theory or as size-extensive modifications; of truncated configuration interaction (CI) theory. The methods have the same complexity as CI; with single and double excitations (CISD), and solving the CISD or coupled-pair equations requires; fewer floating point operations than solving the CC with singles and doubles (CCSD) equations. CISD,; CCSD, and the coupled-pair methods discussed below all scale formally with the sixth power of system size. For a; detailed discussion of the properties of various coupled-pair methods, see Ref. [Wennmohs:2008].; What follows is a very basic description of the practical differences in the equations that define each of the; coupled-pair methods implemented in PSI4. We begin with the CISD wave function. (1); where we have chosen the intermediate normalization, .; The CISD correlation energy is given by.

The methods have the same complexity as CI; with single and double excitations (CISD), and solving the CISD or coupled-pair equations requires; fewer floating point operations than solving the CC with singles and doubles (CCSD) equations. CISD,; CCSD, and the coupled-pair methods discussed below all scale formally with the sixth power of system size. For a; detailed discussion of the properties of various coupled-pair methods, see Ref. [Wennmohs:2008].; What follows is a very basic description of the practical differences in the equations that define each of the; coupled-pair methods implemented in PSI4. We begin with the CISD wave function. (1); where we have chosen the intermediate normalization, .; The CISD correlation energy is given by. (2); and the amplitudes can be determined by the solution to the coupled set of eqations:.

Burns. database(name, db_name[, func, mode, cp, rlxd, symm, zpe, benchmark, tabulate, subset])[source]¶; Function to access the molecule objects and reference energies of; popular chemical databases. Aliases :db(). Returns:(float) Mean absolute deviation of the database in kcal/mol. Psi variables:. db_name DATABASE MEAN SIGNED DEVIATION; db_name DATABASE MEAN ABSOLUTE DEVIATION; db_name DATABASE ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE DEVIATION; Python dictionaries of results accessible as DB_RGT and DB_RXN. Note; It is very easy to make a database from a collection of xyz files; using the script psi4/lib/scripts/ixyz2database.pl.; See Creating a Database for details. Caution; Some features are not yet implemented. Buy a developer some coffee. In sow/reap mode, use only global options (e.g., the local option set by set scf scf_type df will not be respected). Note; To access a database that is not embedded in a PSI4 ; distribution, add the path to the directory containing the database ; to the environment variable PYTHONPATH. Parameters:; name (string) – 'scf' || 'sapt0' || 'ccsd(t)' || etc.; First argument, usually unlabeled. Indicates the computational method; to be applied to the database. May be any valid argument to; energy(). db_name (string) – 'BASIC' || 'S22' || 'HTBH' || etc.; Second argument, usually unlabeled. Indicates the requested database; name, matching (case insensitive) the name of a python file in ; psi4/lib/databases or PYTHONPATH. Consult that ; directory for available databases and literature citations. func (function) – energy || optimize || cbs; Indicates the type of calculation to be performed on each database; member.

Option available; (See Available Databases) only for databases of bimolecular complexes. rlxd (boolean) – 'on' || 'off' ; Indicates whether correction for deformation energy is; employed in computing interaction energies. Option available; (See Available Databases) only for databases of bimolecular complexes; with non-frozen monomers, e.g., HBC6. symm (boolean) – 'on' || 'off'; Indicates whether the native symmetry of the database reagents is; employed ('on') or whether it is forced to symmetry; ('off'). Some computational methods (e.g., SAPT) require no; symmetry, and this will be set by database(). zpe (boolean) – 'on' || 'off' ; Indicates whether zero-point-energy corrections are appended to; single-point energy values. Option valid only for certain; thermochemical databases. Disabled until Hessians ready. benchmark (string) – 'default' || 'S22A' || etc.; Indicates whether a non-default set of reference energies, if; available (See Available Databases), are employed for the; calculation of error statistics. tabulate (array of strings) – [] || ['scf total energy', 'natom'] || etc.; Indicates whether to form tables of variables other than the; primary requested energy. Available for any PSI variable. subset (string or array of strings) – Indicates a subset of the full database to run. This is a very; flexible option and can be used in three distinct ways, outlined; below. Note that two take a string and the last takes an array.; See Available Databases for available values.

Use of DETCI for CASSCF; wavefunctions is described in another section of this manual.; As just mentioned, the DETCI module is designed for challenging; chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable. Because; CI wavefunctions which go beyond CISD (such as RAS CI) are fairly complex,; typically the DETCI code will be used in cases where the; tradeoffs between computational expense and completeness of the; model space are nontrivial. Hence, the user is advised to develop; a good working knowledge of multi-reference and RAS CI methods before; attempting to use the program for a production-level project. This user’s; manual will provide only an elementary introduction to the most; important keywords. Additional information is available in the complete; list of keywords for DETCI provided in Appendix DETCI.; The division of the molecular orbitals into various subspaces such as; RAS spaces, or frozen vs. active orbitals, etc., needs to be clear not; only to detci, but also at least to the transformation program; (and in the case of MCSCF, to other programs as well). Thus, orbital; subspace keywords such as RAS1,; RAS2, RAS3, FROZEN_DOCC, FROZEN_UOCC,; ACTIVE, etc., should be set; in the global section of input so they may also be read by other modules.; For single-reference CI computations, the easiest way to invoke a CI; computation with DETCI is simply to call energy(), optimize(), etc.,; with the common name for that CI wavefunction, like energy('cisd'); for a CISD single-point energy.

A value of 0 makes the program perform I/O one RAS subblock at a time; 1 uses entire CI vectors at a time; and 2 uses one irrep block at a time.

Type: integer; Default: 1. DIAG_METHOD¶. This specifies which method is to be used in diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. The valid options are: RSP, to form the entire H matrix and diagonalize using libciomr to obtain all eigenvalues (n.b. requires HUGE memory); OLSEN, to use Olsen’s preconditioned inverse subspace method (1990); MITRUSHENKOV, to use a 2x2 Olsen/Davidson method; and DAVIDSON (or SEM) to use Liu’s Simultaneous Expansion Method, which is identical to the Davidson method if only one root is to be found. There also exists a SEM debugging mode, SEMTEST. The SEM method is the most robust, but it also requires CI vectors on disk, where is the maximum number of iterations and is the number of roots.

Arbitrary Order Coupled-Cluster Theory¶; This DETCI-based version of this feature is not yet released. However,; the current version of the code does include an interface to; Kallay’s MRCC code.; The DETCI module is also capable of computing arbitrary-order; coupled-cluster energies, using an approach similar to that of Hirata; and Bartlett [Hirata:2000:216], or of Olsen [Olsen:2000:7140].; Notably, the approach in DETCI also allows arbitrary-order; active space coupled-cluster procedures. The general algorithm; for doing this in DETCI is inefficient compared to optimized; lower-order coupled-cluster codes and should not be used for CCSD,; where the CCENERGY module is much more efficient. For higher-order; CC (like CCSDT and beyond), the code is also not as efficient as the; MRCC code by Kállay, to which PSI4 can interface (see Section; Interface to MRCC by M. Kállay); however, it may allow certain truncations of the model; space that might not be available presently in MRCC. For very small; systems, the code can be useful for testing of, for example, CCSDTQ or; its active-space CCSDtq analog [Piecuch:1999:6103].; To perform arbitrary-order coupled-cluster, set the DETCI; option CC to TRUE, and set; CC_EX_LEVEL (note: not EX_LEVEL); to the desired coupled-cluster excitation level, and invoke; energy('detci'). Various other DETCI options have a similar; option for coupled-cluster, usually named beginning with CC. The full; list of options is given in Appendix DETCI. Table Of Contents.

Leininger; Section author: C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function , we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1); The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly and doubly. substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; . The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI].

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function , we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1); The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly and doubly. substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; .

Leininger; Section author: C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function , we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1); The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly and doubly. substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; . The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI]. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations. Instead, emphasis; has been placed on developing a very efficient program to handle more; general CI wavefunctions which may be helpful in more challenging cases; such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions. The CI; code is based on the ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/detci-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/detci-1.html

It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI’s. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. Use of DETCI for CASSCF; wavefunctions is described in another section of this manual.; As just mentioned, the DETCI module is designed for challenging; chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable. Because; CI wavefunctions which go beyond CISD (such as RAS CI) are fairly complex,; typically the DETCI code will be used in cases where the; tradeoffs between computational expense and completeness of the; model space are nontrivial.

However, please; note that these computations are essentially doing high-order CI (up to; full CI) computations to obtain these results, and hence they will only; be possible for very small systems (generally a dozen electrons or less).; The simplest way to run high-order perturbation theory computations is to; call, e.g., energy('mp10') to invoke a MP10 computation or; energy('zapt25') to invoke a ZAPT25 computation. This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy. The program then; sets MAX_NUM_VECS to the required order in the; wavefunction.; By default, the requested n-th order energy is saved as the current; energy to the process environment.

The default is 1e-4 for energies and 1e-7 for gradients. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-4. EX_LEVEL¶. The CI excitation level. Type: integer; Default: 2. FCI¶. Do a full CI (FCI)? If TRUE, overrides the value of EX_LEVEL. Type: boolean; Default: false. FROZEN_DOCC¶. An array containing the number of frozen doubly-occupied orbitals per irrep (these are not excited in a correlated wavefunction, nor can they be optimized in MCSCF. Type: array; Default: No Default. FROZEN_UOCC¶. An array containing the number of frozen unoccupied orbitals per irrep (these are not populated in a correlated wavefunction, nor can they be optimized in MCSCF. Type: array; Default: No Default. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. Type: integer; Default: 12. NUM_ROOTS¶. number of CI roots to find. Type: integer; Default: 1.

A value of 0 makes the program perform I/O one RAS subblock at a time; 1 uses entire CI vectors at a time; and 2 uses one irrep block at a time. Values of 0 or 2 cause some inefficiency in the I/O (requiring multiple reads of the C vector when constructing H in the iterative subspace if DIAG_METHOD = SEM), but require less core memory. Type: integer; Default: 1. DIAG_METHOD¶. This specifies which method is to be used in diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. The valid options are: RSP, to form the entire H matrix and diagonalize using libciomr to obtain all eigenvalues (n.b. requires HUGE memory); OLSEN, to use Olsen’s preconditioned inverse subspace method (1990); MITRUSHENKOV, to use a 2x2 Olsen/Davidson method; and DAVIDSON (or SEM) to use Liu’s Simultaneous Expansion Method, which is identical to the Davidson method if only one root is to be found. There also exists a SEM debugging mode, SEMTEST. The SEM method is the most robust, but it also requires CI vectors on disk, where is the maximum number of iterations and is the number of roots. Type: string; Possible Values: RSP, OLSEN, MITRUSHENKOV, DAVIDSON, SEM, SEMTEST; Default: SEM. OPDM¶. Do compute one-particle density matrix if not otherwise required?. Type: boolean; Default: false. TDM¶. Do compute the transition density? Note: only transition densities between roots of the same symmetry will be evaluated. DETCI does not compute states of different irreps within the same computation; to do this, lower the symmetry of the computation. Type: boolean; Default: false. DIPMOM¶. Do compute the dipole moment?. Type: boolean; Default: false. MPN¶. Do compute the MPn series out to kth order where k is determined by MAX_NUM_VECS ? For open-shell systems REFERENCE is ROHF, WFN is ZAPTN), DETCI will compute the ZAPTn series.

Leininger; Section author: C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function , we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1); The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly and doubly. substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; . The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI]. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations. Instead, emphasis; has been placed on developing a very efficient program to handle more; general CI wavefunctions which may be helpful in more challenging cases; such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions. The CI; code is based on the ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/detci.html

It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI’s. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. Use of DETCI for CASSCF; wavefunctions is described in another section of this manual.; As just mentioned, the DETCI module is designed for challenging; chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable. Because; CI wavefunctions which go beyond CISD (such as RAS CI) are fairly complex,; typically the DETCI code will be used in cases where the; tradeoffs between computational expense and completeness of the; model space are nontrivial. Hence, the user is advised to develop; a good working knowledge of multi-reference and RAS CI methods before; attempting to use the program for a production-level project. This user’s; manual will provide only an elementary introduction to the most; important keywords. Additional information is available in the complete; list of keywords for DETCI provided in Appendix DETCI.; The division of the molecular orbitals into various subspaces such as; RAS spaces, or frozen vs. active orbitals, etc., needs to be clear not; only to detci, but also at least to the transformation program; (and in the case of MCSCF, to other programs as well).

For larger computations, additional keywords may be required, as; described in the DETCI section of the Appendix DETCI. Arbitrary Order Perturbation Theory¶; The DETCI module is capable of computing energies for arbitrary; order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MPn, for closed-shell; systems with an RHF reference) and for Z-averaged perturbation theory; (ZAPTn, open-shell systems with an ROHF reference). However, please; note that these computations are essentially doing high-order CI (up to; full CI) computations to obtain these results, and hence they will only; be possible for very small systems (generally a dozen electrons or less).; The simplest way to run high-order perturbation theory computations is to; call, e.g., energy('mp10') to invoke a MP10 computation or; energy('zapt25') to invoke a ZAPT25 computation. This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy. The program then; sets MAX_NUM_VECS to the required order in the; wavefunction.; By default, the requested n-th order energy is saved as the current; energy to the process environment. ZAPTN works essentially the same; way for an ROHF reference.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes. Pruned grids are; not yet available, but will be implemented by RC1 (in final debugging). The; default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131. The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems. A complete grid orientation; rule set will be available in RC1.; Radial grid types are controlled by the DFT_RADIAL_SCHEME option, which; at the moment may be either TREUTLER or BECKE, while the number of radial points; are controll",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/dft-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/dft-1.html

For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-12. We are still exploring optimizations of the octree algorithm; and the basis cutoffs, but it is likely that significant speed gains may be; realized by relaxing the basis cutoff tolerance, with negligible decrease in; accuracy.; An example of a fully specified grid is as follows:; molecule {; H; H 1 0.7; }. set {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; dft_spherical_points 590 # Often needed; dft_radial_points 99 # Often needed; dft_radial_scheme treutler # Rarely needed; dft_nuclear_scheme treutler # Rarely needed; dft_basis_tolerance 1.0E-11 # Can speed things up, but benchmark the error; }. energy('b3lyp'). ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to those; listed above for Hartree-Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn-Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation.

LRC; recognizes that the local DFA is potentially exact at short range in the; exchange hole, and that the hybrid-exchange energy of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is also exact for true electrons at long range in the exchange; hole.

This approach was championed by Grimme,; whose “-D2” approach is a de facto industry standard. The more modern “-D3”; approach is gaining popularity, and may supersede -D2 in the next few years. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a KS-DFT computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('b3lyp') (or other valid functional name):; molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('b3lyp'). This will run a B3LYP Restricted Kohn-Sham (RKS) on neutral singlet Helium in; spatial symmetry with a minimal STO-3G basis, 1.0E-8 energy; and density convergence criteria, a PK ERI algorithm, symmetric; orthogonalization, DIIS, and a core Hamiltonian guess.

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS. This; is because ROHF is implicitly assumed to be followed by a correlated method; which can break the positive definiteness of the spin polarization. KS-DFT with; the true functional is expected to be the final step, thus restricting the; solution to positive definite spin polarization is not physical. See the; section in Szabo on methyl radical for an example. Functional Selection¶; PSI4 features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call:; energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; REFERENCE option before the call to energy:; set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by the DFT_FUNCTIONAL; option:; set dft_functional b3lyp; energy('scf'). For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; DFT_ALPHA option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree-Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the DFT_OMEGA option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional.; A brief summary of some of the more notable functionals in PSI4, and links; to the complete listing of all functionals of each class are presented below:.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to those; listed above for Hartree-Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn-Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c1 # IP fitting must be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; dft_functional wb97; }. # Arguments are molecule object, minimum omega, maximum omega; ip_fitting(h2o, 0.4, 2.0). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of , though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; . The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of . This small test case has a tuned; of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0.

Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes. Pruned grids are; not yet available, but will be implemented by RC1 (in final debugging). The; default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131. The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1. At the moment, the rules for tetrahedral,; octohedral, and icosohedral systems are not complete, so there may be some; ambiguity in the grid orientation for these systems.

For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-12. We are still exploring optimizations of the octree algorithm; and the basis cutoffs, but it is likely that significant speed gains may be; realized by relaxing the basis cutoff tolerance, with negligible decrease in; accuracy.; An example of a fully specified grid is as follows:; molecule {; H; H 1 0.7; }. set {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; dft_spherical_points 590 # Often needed; dft_radial_points 99 # Often needed; dft_radial_scheme treutler # Rarely needed; dft_nuclear_scheme treutler # Rarely needed; dft_basis_tolerance 1.0E-11 # Can speed things up, but benchmark the error; }. energy('b3lyp'). ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to those; listed above for Hartree-Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn-Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method.

LRC; recognizes that the local DFA is potentially exact at short range in the; exchange hole, and that the hybrid-exchange energy of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is also exact for true electrons at long range in the exchange; hole.

On the correlation; side, this is primarily observed in the inability of KS-DFT to treat dispersion; interactions.; Generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) functionals incorporate long-range information into; the functional through orbital-dependent contributions, and are designed to; combat the failures of local KS-DFT, particularly the MSIE on the exchange side.; Note that these functionals are often referred to as “implicit” density; functionals, as the orbitals are themselves functionals of the Kohn-Sham; potential.; The simplest form of an exchange-side GKS is the global hybrid ansatz, in which; some fraction of the exact Hartree-Fock exchange of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is added to the functional, with the local part of the exchange; functional decreased by the corresponding amount. Note that the term; “exact-exchange” refers to the Hartree-Fock being the exact exchange energy of; the noninteracting quasiparticles, not the true electrons. Therefore, adding; 100% exact exchange is not physically reasonable, and will often lead to; extremely poor results. The fraction of exact-exchange, denoted ,; is often determined by adiabatic or heuristic arguments, and is typically around; 25%. The addition of exact exchange borrows another piece from an existing; Hartree-Fock code, with the caveat that Hartree-Fock exchange is often much more; costly to obtain than the Coulomb matrix.

LRC; recognizes that the local DFA is potentially exact at short range in the; exchange hole, and that the hybrid-exchange energy of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is also exact for true electrons at long range in the exchange; hole. Therefore LRC switches from DFA at short range to hybrid exchange at long; range, typically using the function as a; partition function.; Tying all these pieces together, a full LRC-hybrid GKS functional has the; generic form,. For LRC functionals, the choice of range-separtion parameter has; been the subject of considerable activity since the inception of LRC; functionals. Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between -electron and -electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz.

This approach was championed by Grimme,; whose “-D2” approach is a de facto industry standard. The more modern “-D3”; approach is gaining popularity, and may supersede -D2 in the next few years. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a KS-DFT computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('b3lyp') (or other valid functional name):; molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('b3lyp'). This will run a B3LYP Restricted Kohn-Sham (RKS) on neutral singlet Helium in; spatial symmetry with a minimal STO-3G basis, 1.0E-8 energy; and density convergence criteria, a PK ERI algorithm, symmetric; orthogonalization, DIIS, and a core Hamiltonian guess.

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS. This; is because ROHF is implicitly assumed to be followed by a correlated method; which can break the positive definiteness of the spin polarization. KS-DFT with; the true functional is expected to be the final step, thus restricting the; solution to positive definite spin polarization is not physical. See the; section in Szabo on methyl radical for an example. Functional Selection¶; PSI4 features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call:; energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; REFERENCE option before the call to energy:; set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by the DFT_FUNCTIONAL; option:; set dft_functional b3lyp; energy('scf'). For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; DFT_ALPHA option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree-Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the DFT_OMEGA option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional.; A brief summary of some of the more notable functionals in PSI4, and links; to the complete listing of all functionals of each class are presented below:.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to those; listed above for Hartree-Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn-Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c1 # IP fitting must be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; dft_functional wb97; }. # Arguments are molecule object, minimum omega, maximum omega; ip_fitting(h2o, 0.4, 2.0). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of , though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; . The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of . This small test case has a tuned; of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0.

Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use.

The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; , obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, , modulated; by a damping function, , that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by ); over a distance characterized by the sum of the two atomic vdW radii,; , while an overall scaling term, , is optimized; to be unique to each functional. ( is; sometimes allowed to vary as well.). (1). Grimme recently presented a refined method, DFT-D3, [Grimme:2010:154104]; which incorporates an additional term in the dispersion; series and adjusts the combination formula and damping; function. The individual atomic are interpolated from; several reference values based upon coordination numbers extracted from; the molecular structure, rather than assigned solely by atomic identity as; in DFT-D2, and thereby incorporate some awareness of the chemical; environment into an otherwise largely heuristic correction.

Documentation¶; PSI4’s documentation is generated by Sphinx; and lives in psi4/doc/sphinxman. It is available online at; http://sirius.chem.vt.edu/psi4manual/latest/index.html; for the latest public release and at; http://sirius.chem.vt.edu/psi4manual/master/index.html; for the latest development branch (not all links may be publically; accessible). Installing Sphinx¶; Installing Sphinx is only necessary to build the documentation; yourself, locally. The docs are served from; from trac and psicode, so most users/developers won’t need Sphinx; installed. Nevertheless, installation is easy.; On Mac:; >>> easy_install sphinx. On Linux:. Download; >>> curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/S/Sphinx/Sphinx-1.1.3.tar.gz. Unpack, etc. Build and Install; >>> python setup.py build; >>> sudo python setup.py install. Check the path; >>> which sphinx-build; >>> which latex; >>> which dvipng. LaTeX and dvipng are needed to render math. If the latter is missing,; the following may work.; >>> sudo yum install dvipng-1.14-1.fc15.x86_64. Documentation Structure¶; Sphinx has nice capabilities for extracting docstrings from python files,; presenting both auto-generated and narrative documentation in; the same format, hyperlinking within and to trac/external websites, and; generating documentation in different formats from the same source.; PSI4’s documentation is a unified document covering information for; both users and programmers, with different portions served up depending on; the target audience.

The Map of the Sphinx¶. Adding a new Appendix or First-TOC-Level page; Create your reST file and fill it with information.

Finally, add your; file to the STATICDOC variable in the Makefile at; psi4/doc/sphinxman/Makefile.in. Sphinx will now build with your new; page. Adding a new module to “Theoretical Methods”; Copy the file of a well-established module, like; psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/sapt.rst. Change the title, author, sec; label, ref, and source labels at the top of the file to point instead to; your code. Edit psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/methods.rst to add the; name of your file so that it will appear in the TOC tree. Add your file; to the STATICDOC variable in the Makefile at; psi4/doc/sphinxman/Makefile.in. Sphinx will now build with your new; file. Follow the models in existing methods pages to write your; documentation. If you don’t get all the keyword links, bibliography; links, sample inputs, math, tables, etc. working in Sphinx, don’t worry; about it.

Documentation¶; PSI4’s documentation is generated by Sphinx; and lives in psi4/doc/sphinxman. It is available online at; http://sirius.chem.vt.edu/psi4manual/latest/index.html; for the latest public release and at; http://sirius.chem.vt.edu/psi4manual/master/index.html; for the latest development branch (not all links may be publically; accessible). Installing Sphinx¶; Installing Sphinx is only necessary to build the documentation; yourself, locally. The docs are served from; from trac and psicode, so most users/developers won’t need Sphinx; installed. Nevertheless, installation is easy.; On Mac:; >>> easy_install sphinx. On Linux:. Download; >>> curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/S/Sphinx/Sphinx-1.1.3.tar.gz. Unpack, etc. Build and Install; >>> python setup.py build; >>> sudo python setup.py install. Check the path; >>> which sphinx-build; >>> which latex; >>> which dvipng. LaTeX and dvipng are needed to render math. If the latter is missing,; the following may work.; >>> sudo yum install dvipng-1.14-1.fc15.x86_64. Documentation Structure¶; Sphinx has nice capabilities for extracting docstrings from python files,; presenting both auto-generated and narrative documentation in; the same format, hyperlinking within and to trac/external websites, and; generating documentation in different formats from the same source.; PSI4’s documentation is a unified document covering information for; both users and programmers, with different portions served up depending on; the target audience.

The ~/.psi4rc file can also be used to define constants that are accessible; in input files or to place any Python statements that should be executed; with every PSI4 instance. Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to e",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/external-1.html

These environment; variables are typically defined in a .tcshrc or .bashrc.; (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() Psithon function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. set scf {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1,5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy('scf'). (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables; The easiest/least visible way to thread PSI4 is to set the standard OpenMP/MKL; environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS.; For instance, in tcsh:; setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 4; setenv MKL_NUM_THREADS 4.

To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to the ~/.psi4rc; file.:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user').

It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; phsyically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or, more flexibly, through; a resource file, ~/.psi4rc (example psi4/samples/example_psi4rc_file).; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. The primary use of the ~/.psi4rc file is to control the; handling of scratch files. PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are sequentially; numbered and are written to /tmp, then deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to e",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/external.html

These environment; variables are typically defined in a .tcshrc or .bashrc.; (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() Psithon function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. set scf {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1,5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy('scf'). (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; The set of three commands below are completely equivalent, while the fourth",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/external.html

It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; phsyically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or, more flexibly, through; a resource file, ~/.psi4rc (example psi4/samples/example_psi4rc_file).; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. The primary use of the ~/.psi4rc file is to control the; handling of scratch files. PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are sequentially; numbered and are written to /tmp, then deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io.

Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process (details here); is to tell PSI4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like PSI4 can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; phsyically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or, more flexibly, through; a resource file, ~/.psi4rc (",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/external.html

To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to the ~/.psi4rc; file.:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/').

Make frequency look analogous to gradient, especially in matching derivative levels. Make dertype actually a dertype type. Parameters:; name (string) – 'scf' || 'df-mp2' || 'ci5' || etc.; First argument, usually unlabeled. Indicates the computational method; to be applied to the system. dertype (dertype) – 'hessian' || 'gradient' || 'energy'; Indicates whether analytic (if available- they’re not), finite; difference of gradients (if available) or finite difference of; energies is to be performed. irrep (int or string) – -1 || 1 || 'b2' || 'App' || etc.; Indicates which symmetry block (Cotton ordering) of vibrational; frequencies to be computed. 1, '1', or 'a1' represents; , requesting only the totally symmetric modes.; -1 indicates a full frequency calculation. molecule (molecule) – h2o || etc.; The target molecule, if not the last molecule defined. Examples :. >>> # [1] <example description>; >>> <example python command>. >>> # [2] Frequency calculation for b2 modes through finite difference of gradients; >>> frequencies('scf', dertype=1, irrep=4).
