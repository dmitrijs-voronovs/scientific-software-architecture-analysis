How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a limited number of “smoke” tests are available to be; run via pytest. From the executable; psi4 --test. From the library (PSI4 must be detectable as a Python; module. See setup at How to configure paths for PsiAPI; if needed.); python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test()"". From pytest directly. If package pytest-xdist is installed,. can run in parallel, though final file cleanup may not exit cleanly. pytest {prefix}/lib/{PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/psi4/tests/ -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`. Output looks something like the below.

For pre-built binaries again well-tested,; performance-tuned, and available for all common operating systems,; see psicode.org/installs/latest (select “conda”). Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself.; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -H.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation; How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation. What are the tools and dependencies strictly required for building Psi4¶; The core PSI4 build requires the software below. Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it. C++ and C Compilers (C++14 compliant); Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard; Linux distribution); Python interpreter and headers (3.6 or 3.7) https://www.python.org/; CMake (3.8+) http://www.cmake.org/download/; NumPy (needed at runtime and buildtime) http://www.numpy.org/; System utilities: GNU make, GNU install, POSIX threads (Pthreads) library. The following are also required for PSI4, but if not detected, the; build system will automatically download and build. gau2grid <cmake:gau2grid — [what is this?] [min version]; Libint — [what is this?] [min version]; Libxc — [what is this?] [min version]; pybind11 — [what is this?] [min version]; QCElemental — [what is this?].

NumPy http://www.numpy.org/; networkx https://github.com/networkx/networkx; deepdiff https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff; pint https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/; pydantic (depending on your QCElemental version) https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/#. What are the add-on capabilities for Psi4 and what are their dependencies¶; Each of the items below is an independent additional capability that can; be built with PSI4.

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables. PYTHON_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; PYTHON_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.6.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable.

How to configure code to use high angular momentum basis sets¶; The Libint integral code handles arbitrary order; angular momentum, but compiling that is prohibitive. The default of 5; is generally good. 7 has met all of a research group’s needs for; years. 4 is handy for quickly testing other parts of the build. Build with Higher Angular Momentum; >>> cmake -DMAX_AM_ERI=6. Relevant CMake Options:; MAX_AM_ERI=N # The maximum angular momentum level (1=p, 2=d, 3=f,; # etc.) for the libint integrals and derivative; # integrals. A value of N implies a maximum first; # derivative of N-1, and maximum second derivative of; # N-2, so for an atom such as Neon, the default 5 gets; # you conventional cc-pV5Z for energies, cc-pVQZ for; # gradients, cc-pVTZ for frequencies and density-fitted; # cc-pVQZ for energies, cc-pVTZ for gradients, cc-pVDZ; # for frequencies. [default: 5]. Note that since PSI4 1.1, it is possible to build Libint; independently (or install just the libint conda package), then have; any/all PSI4 builds detect that installation at compile-time.; To switch a finished build to a larger Libint, enter <objdir>,; remove the result of make install (if ever invoked), remove; external/upstream/libint/.

How to configure Libint for building Psi4. How to get high angular momentum integrals from conda¶; Since February 2019, the PSI4 conda package on Linux has been the; large AM8. Likewise, this is the package you get upon; 1conda install libint -c psi4. There is no need for the extra am8 argument previously documented here.; On Mac, the Libint conda package itself and the Libint compiled into; the PSI4 conda package remain AM6.; Beware this issue: https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1533. How to see what build configuration options are available¶; CMake doesn’t provide a summary for this (unless you want to try the CMake; GUI, which the developers have never looked at).

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it a",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning-1.html

What C and C++ compilers and versions are approved¶; On Linux, the following work nicely. GNU: gcc, g++; Intel: icc, icpc; Clang: clang, clang++. On Mac, the following work nicely. Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers on Linux also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_osx-64 clang_osx-64 llvm-openmp intel-openmp. # To Build, activate environment ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning-1.html

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code.

Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to configure a Psi4 build on Cray¶; Cray systems strongly prefer to build static libraries, but PSI4; needs to be dynamic to function as a Python module.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code.

This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4. Or in the shell; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSIDATADIR {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSIDATADIR={top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

What C and C++ compilers and versions are approved¶; On Linux, the following work nicely. GNU: gcc, g++; Intel: icc, icpc; Clang: clang, clang++. On Mac, the following work nicely. Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers on Linux also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_osx-64 clang_osx-64 llvm-openmp intel-openmp. # To Build, activate environment (prepends PATH and defines environment variables CLANG, CLANGXX, HOST, etc):; >>> conda activate clang401; >>> echo ${CLANGXX}; /path/to/miniconda/envs/clang401/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-clang++; >>> echo ${HOST}; x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0. # build with Clang; >>> cmake -H. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${CLANG} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CLANGXX} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-stdlib=libc++"" \; -DOp",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html

Notes. Much of PSI4’s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:; It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works. Use it at your own risk and after testing your; particular distribution, including tests run multithreaded,; if you intend to run PSI4 so. Use at least 0.2.15, and; pay attention to how it was compiled - unthreaded seems safe,; openmp-threaded is mostly safe, default pthreaded is not safe.

Notes. Much of PSI4’s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:; It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works.

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html:43400,Integrability,interface,interface,43400,"ussions.; Choose your NumPy and PSI4 compile conditions to use the same; BLAS distribution.; The BLAS/LAPACK detected for PSI4 are also linked into any; Add-Ons (e.g., libefp) that require them, rather than relying on; those packages’ native math detection.; The separation between BLAS and LAPACK seen in detection printing; and CMake variables is purely formal. In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies.

See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invokes the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make, whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir. How to run a minute’s worth of tests¶; When you want to do a very minimal test of the build and have; CTest installed, the following command can be useful.; 1>>> ctest -L smoke -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a limited number of “smoke” tests are available to be; run via pytest. From the executable; psi4 --test.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation; How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation. What are the tools and dependencies strictly required for building Psi4¶; The core PSI4 build requires the software below. Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it.

How to configure code to use high angular momentum basis sets¶; The Libint integral code handles arbitrary order; angular momentum, but compiling that is prohibitive. The default of 5; is generally good. 7 has met all of a research group’s needs for; years. 4 is handy for quickly testing other parts of the build.

How to configure Libint for building Psi4. How to get high angular momentum integrals from conda¶; Since February 2019, the PSI4 conda package on Linux has been the; large AM8.

How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_osx-64 clang_osx-64 llvm-openmp intel-openmp. # To Build, activate environment (prepends PATH and defines environment variables CLANG, CLANGXX, HOST, etc):; >>> conda activate clang401; >>> echo ${CLANGXX}; /path/to/miniconda/envs/clang401/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-clang++; >>> echo ${HOST}; x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0. # build with Clang; >>> cmake -H. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${CLANG} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CLANGXX} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-stdlib=libc++"" \; -DOpenMP_CXX_FLAG=""-fopenmp=libiomp5"". # build with Intel; >>> cmake -H. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc \; -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-clang-name=${CLANG}"" \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-clang-name=${CLANG} -clangxx-name=${CLANGXX} -stdlib=libc++ -I${CONDA_PREFIX}/include/c++/v1"". # Configure and build.

PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers on Linux also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_osx-64 clang_osx-64 llvm-openmp intel-openmp. # To Build, activate environment (prepends PATH and defines environment variables CLANG, CLANGXX, HOST, etc):; >>> conda activate clang401; >>> echo ${CLANGXX}; /path/to/miniconda/envs/clang401/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-clang++; >>> echo ${HOST}; x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0. # build with Clang; >>> cmake -H. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${CLANG} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CLANGXX} \; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-stdlib=libc++"" \; -DOpenMP_CXX_FLAG=""-fopenmp=libiomp5"". # build with Intel; >>> cmake -H. -Bbuild \; -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc \; -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc \; -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-clang-name=${CLANG}",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html

How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module.

How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invokes the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make, whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir.

Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a limited number of “smoke” tests are available to be; run via pytest. From the executable; psi4 --test.

So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -H.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation; How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation. What are the tools and dependencies strictly required for building Psi4¶; The core PSI4 build requires the software below. Note that; practically everything (including Python, CMake, NumPy, BLAS/LAPACK,; Libint, and even C++ compilers on Linux and Mac) can be; satisfied through conda. The links below give examples of how to configure; that software for PSI4 and any notes and warnings pertaining to it. C++ and C Compilers (C++14 compliant); Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries (preferably NOT one supplied by a standard; Linux distribution); Python interpreter and headers (3.6 or 3.7) https://www.python.org/; CMake (3.8+) http://www.cmake.org/download/; NumPy (needed at runtime and buildtime) http://www.numpy.org/; System utilities: GNU make, GNU install, POSIX threads (Pthreads) library. The following are also required for PSI4, but if not detected, the; build system will automatically download and build. gau2grid <cmake:gau2grid — [what is this?] [min version]; Libint — [what is this?] [min version]; Libxc — [what is this?] [min version]; pybind11 — [what is this?] [min version]; QCElemental — [what is this?]. Additionally, there are runtime-only dependencies:. NumPy http://www.numpy.org/; networkx https://github.com/networkx/networkx; deepdiff https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff; pint https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/; pydantic (depending on your QCElemental version) https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/#. What are the add-on capabilities for Psi4 and what are their dependencies¶; Each of the items below is an independent additional capability that can; be built with PSI4. Sub-items below are the respective additional; dependencies of the add-on. Select which, if any, you want, and examine; the links for appropriate enabling arguments to cmake.

How to handle “runtime library may be hidden” when building with Anaconda Python¶; When building against Ana/Miniconda python (e.g., cmake; -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/conda/bin/python), the warning below often; appears.

If you’re changing the PSI4 repo codebase between compiles, there’s; nothing more to do as CMake will handle the code rebuild deps for you.; If you’re changing the local Add-On repo codebase between compiles,; CMake does not know when libaddon.[a|so|dylib] needs rebuilding.

And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn. This should; re-clone the Add-On, rebuild and install it, rebuild any parts of; PSI4 that interface to it, and relink the main core.so.; If you’re modifying the Add-On’s file or directory structure, be; smart and rm all traces of it within {objdir}/stage/,; especially any *.pyc files.; Alternatively to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the PSI4 repository.

What is the directory layout of the installed or staged Psi4¶; After compilation (cd objdir && make), a directory structure like the; below will exist at objdir/stage. This may be tested and used; just like a full installation.; After installation (cd objdir && make && make install), a directory; structure like the below will exist at /prefix. This is a full; installation.; /; bin/ (executables for psi4 + any external proj); bin/psi4 (psi4 executable, actually just a py script); include/ (installed headers for psi4 + any external proj); include/psi4/ (header files for #include-ing); include/psi4/psi4-dec.h (primary psi4 header); include/psi4/masses.h (a project-wide psi4 header); include/psi4/libmints/ (psi4 library headers); include/psi4/libfock/ (ditto); share/ (read-only arch-indep files for psi4 + any external proj); share/cmake/psi4/ (files for detecting installed targets); share/cmake/psi4/psi4Config.cmake (psi4 build/install info); share/cmake/psi4/psi4ConfigVersion.cmake (psi4 cmake version info); share/doc/psi4/html/ (sphinx html documentation); share/psi4/ (text files needed by psi4); share/psi4/basis (basis sets); share/psi4/plugins (plugin template files); share/psi4",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code. PSI4 can be run “inplace” through the; following procedure. To be clear, this is running compiled C++ from the; build directory and python from the source directory. This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; 1; 2; 3>>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it a",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html

What C and C++ compilers and versions are approved¶; On Linux, the following work nicely. GNU: gcc, g++; Intel: icc, icpc; Clang: clang, clang++. On Mac, the following work nicely. Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers on Linux also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode. Some old versions; of XCode can’t handle some of the advanced C++ language features, but this; is a software not hardware limitation. Checks for version compliance; performed at build-time. Note that this “AppleClang” will not be compatible; with conda Mac packages using C++11, nor can it make use of OpenMP directives.; Another route to obtaining clang compilers without the above limitations; is through conda.; # Install Clang 4.0.1 into a non-primary conda environment; >>> conda create -n clang401 clangxx_osx-64 clang_osx-64 llvm-openmp intel-openmp. # To Build, activate environment ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/build_planning.html

Sometimes, you’re the one; doing that development, and you need the CMake superbuild to pull source; from a local path rather than the approved codeset.; Find the CMakeLists.txt governing the target Add-On in; psi4/external and make changes analogous to the below:; 1; 2; 3; 4#GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/jturney/ambit; #GIT_TAG 1.0; DOWNLOAD_COMMAND """"; SOURCE_DIR ""/path/to/ambit-directclone"".

Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

For most common; calculations, a shorthand can be accessed directly though; psi4.energy(), psi4.gradient(), etc. For example,; a MP2 single-point DT extrapolation can be accessed through the first item; below more conveniently than the equivalent second or third items. energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'); energy(cbs, corl_wfn='mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z'); energy(cbs, cbs_metadata=[{""wfn"": ""hf"", ""basis"": ""cc-pvtz""}, {""wfn"": ""mp2"", ""basis"": ""cc-pv[dt]z""}]). A CCSD(T) DT coupled-cluster correction atop a TQ MP2 extrapolation; geometry optimization can also be accessed through the first item below more; conveniently than the equivalent second and third items. optimize('mp2/cc-pv[tq]z + D:ccsd(t)/cc-pvdz'); optimize(cbs, corl_wfn='mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[tq]z', delta_wfn='ccsd(t)', delta_basis='cc-pvdz'); optimize(cbs, cbs_metadata=[{""wfn"": ""hf"", ""basis"": ""cc-pvqz""}, {""wfn"": ""mp2"", ""basis"": ""cc-pv[tq]z""}, {""wfn"": ""ccsd(t)"", ""basis"": ""cc-pvdz""}]). Many examples can be found at cbs-xtpl-energy,; cbs-xtpl-gradient, cbs-xtpl-opt,; cbs-xtpl-freq, cbs-xtpl-func,; cbs-xtpl-wrapper, cbs-xtpl-dict. psi4.cbs(name[, scf_basis, scf_scheme, corl_wfn, corl_basis, corl_scheme, delta_wfn, delta_wfn_lesser, delta_basis, delta_scheme, delta2_wfn, delta2_wfn_lesser, delta2_basis, delta2_scheme, cbs_metadata])[source]¶; Function to define a multistage energy method from combinations of; basis set extrapolations and delta corrections and condense the; components into a minimum number of calculations.

RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantities with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., \(\langle ij | ab \rangle\) integrals) may be held in the cache. Type: integer; Default: 2. CACHETYPE¶. Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd codes. A value of LOW selects a “low priority” scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities. A value of LRU selects a “least recently used” scheme in which the oldest item in the cache will be the first one deleted.

Basic Keywords¶; A complete list of keywords related to coupled-cluster computations is; provided in the appendices, with the majority of the relevant; keywords appearing in Appendix CCENERGY. For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantities with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., \(\langle ij | ab \rangle\) integrals) may be held in the cache. Type: integer; Default: 2.

There is a small amount of overhead; associated with the; coupled cluster modules that is not accounted for by the internal CC memory; handling routines. Thus, the user should not specify the entire; physical memory of the system, or swapping is likely. However, for especially large; calculations, it is better to set the memory keyword to a value less than 16 GB.; Set the CACHELEVEL keyword to 0.; This will turn off cacheing, which, for very large calculations, can; lead to heap fragmentation and memory faults, even when sufficient; physical memory exists.; Set the PRINT keyword to 2. This; will help narrow where memory bottlenecks or other errors exist in the; event of a crash. Excited State Coupled Cluster Calculations¶; A complete list of keywords related to; coupled cluster linear response is provided in Appendix CCEOM.; The most important keywords associated with EOM-CC calculations are:. ROOTS_PER_IRREP¶. Number of excited states per irreducible representation for EOM-CC and CC-LR calculations. Irreps denote the final state symmetry, not the symmetry of the transition. Type: array; Default: No Default. E_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for excitation energy (change) in the Davidson algorithm for CC-EOM.

For a standard ground-state; CCSD or CCSD(T) computation, the following keywords are common:. REFERENCE¶. Reference wavefunction type. Type: string; Possible Values: RHF, ROHF, UHF; Default: RHF. R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for wavefunction (change) in CC amplitude equations. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-7. MAXITER¶. Maximum number of iterations to solve the CC equations. Type: integer; Default: 50. BRUECKNER_ORBS_R_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for Brueckner orbitals. The convergence is determined based on the largest \(T_1\) amplitude. Default adjusts depending on E_CONVERGENCE. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-5. RESTART¶. Do restart the coupled-cluster iterations from old \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes? For geometry optimizations, Brueckner calculations, etc. the iterative solution of the CC amplitude equations may benefit considerably by reusing old vectors as initial guesses. Assuming that the MO phases remain the same between updates, the CC codes will, by default, re-use old vectors, unless the user sets RESTART = false. Type: boolean; Default: true. CACHELEVEL¶. Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantities with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., \(\langle ij | ab \rangle\) integrals) may be held in t",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/cc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/cc.html

Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the libdpd codes. A value of LOW selects a “low priority” scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities. A value of LRU selects a “least recently used” scheme in which the oldest item in the cache will be the first one deleted. Type: string; Possible Values: LOW, LRU; Default: LOW. NUM_AMPS_PRINT¶. Number of important \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) amplitudes to print. Type: integer; Default: 10. MP2_AMPS_PRINT¶. Do print the MP2 amplitudes which are the starting guesses for RHF and UHF reference functions?. Type: boolean; Default: false. Larger Calculations¶; Here are a few recommendations for carrying out large-basis-set coupled; cluster calculations with PSI4:. In most cases it is reasonable to set the memory keyword to 90% of; the available physical memory, at most. There is a small amount of overhead; associated with the; coupled cluster modules that is not accounted for by the internal CC memory; handling routines. Thus, the user should not specify the entire; physical memory of the system, or swapping is likely. However, for especially large; calculations, it is better to set the memory keyword to a value less than 16 GB.; Set the CACHELEVEL keyword to 0.; This will turn off cacheing, which, for very large calculations, can; lead to heap fragmentation and memory faults, even when sufficient; physical memory exists.; Set the PRINT keyword to 2. This; will help narrow where memory bottlenecks or other errors exist in the; event of a crash. Excited State Coupled Cluster Calculations¶; A complete list of keywords related to; coupled cluster linear response is provided in Appendix CCEOM.; The most important keywords associated with EOM-CC calculations are:.

Type: string; Possible Values: POLARIZABILITY, ROTATION, ROA, ROA_TENSOR, ALL; Default: POLARIZABILITY. OMEGA¶. Array that specifies the desired frequencies of the incident radiation field in CCLR calculations. If only one element is given, the units will be assumed to be atomic units. If more than one element is given, then the units must be specified as the final element of the array. Acceptable units are HZ, NM, EV, and AU. Type: array; Default: No Default. GAUGE¶. Specifies the choice of representation of the electric dipole operator. For polarizability, this keyword is ignored and LENGTH gauge is computed. For optical rotation and raman optical activity, this keyword is active, and acceptable values are LENGTH for the usual length-gauge representation, VELOCITY``(default) for the modified velocity-gauge representation in which the static-limit optical rotation tensor is subtracted from the frequency- dependent tensor, or ``BOTH.

This; will help narrow where memory bottlenecks or other errors exist in the; event of a crash. Excited State Coupled Cluster Calculations¶; A complete list of keywords related to; coupled cluster linear response is provided in Appendix CCEOM.; The most important keywords associated with EOM-CC calculations are:. ROOTS_PER_IRREP¶. Number of excited states per irreducible representation for EOM-CC and CC-LR calculations. Irreps denote the final state symmetry, not the symmetry of the transition. Type: array; Default: No Default. E_CONVERGENCE¶. Convergence criterion for excitation energy (change) in the Davidson algorithm for CC-EOM. See Table Post-SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria for different calculation types. Type: conv double; Default: 1e-6. SINGLES_PRINT¶. Do print information on the iterative solution to the single-excitation EOM-CC problem used as a guess to full EOM-CC?. Type: boolean; Default: false. SCHMIDT_ADD_RESIDUAL_TOLERANCE¶.

To preferentially use your own GENBAS,; place it in PATH or PSIPATH. The line calling; energy() with argument 'cfour' invokes; xcfour.; After execution of the energy('cfour') line completes, Cfour results; are read back into PSI4 format and are thereafter accessible for; further processing in the input file. See Output for; details. This storage of results in variables and arrays in memory for; the duration of the PSI4 instance (as opposed to solely in files); is the only advantage thus far incurred by the P4C4 interface. We’ll call; this mode of basic utility the “sandwich” mode.; Molecule specification in PSI4 allows Cartesians, Z-matrices, mixed; Cartesian/Z-matrix, negation of variables, delayed specification of; variables, specification of fragments, etc., all in a whitespace-tolerant; format.

The above example also shows the total memory for the computation being; set in PSI4 format. See Memory Specification for details. When; specified, the memory value is passed on to Cfour by setting keywords; CFOUR_MEMORY_SIZE and CFOUR_MEM_UNIT=MB.; PSI4 has an extensive basis set library in; Gaussian94 format. See Basis Sets for details. Contrasts to; Cfour basis handling include identifying basis sets by standard name; (aug-cc-pVDZ instead of AUG-PVDZ), direct handles for; diffuse-function-pruned sets (e.g., jun-cc-pVDZ), case insensitivity,; appropriate setting of spherical/Cartesian depending on basis set design,; and syntax to set different basis sets to different classes of atoms; without listing each atom. All of these features are available to Cfour by; using the BASIS keyword instead of CFOUR_BASIS; (accompanied, of course, by specifying the molecule PSI4-style).; Internally, PSI4 processes the basis set as usual, then translates; the basis set format and writes out a GENBAS file with an entry for; each atom.

R=1.008; A=105.0. *ACES2(CALC=HF,BASIS=qz2p; MULT=2,REF=UHF; OCCUPATION=3-1-1-0/3-0-1-0; SCF_CONV=12; MEMORY=20000000); }. energy('cfour'). Here, the contents of the cfour {...} block are written directly to a; ZMAT file. This is joined by a default GENBAS file; (psi4/share/basis/GENBAS). To preferentially use your own GENBAS,; place it in PATH or PSIPATH. The line calling; energy() with argument 'cfour' invokes; xcfour.; After execution of the energy('cfour') line completes, Cfour results; are read back into PSI4 format and are thereafter accessible for; further processing in the input file. See Output for; details. This storage of results in variables and arrays in memory for; the duration of the PSI4 instance (as opposed to solely in files); is the only advantage thus far incurred by the P4C4 interface. We’ll call; this mode of basic utility the “sandwich” mode.; Molecule specification in PSI4 allows Cartesians, Z-matrices, mixed; Cartesian/Z-matrix, negation of variables, delayed specification of; variables, specification of fragments, etc., all in a whitespace-tolerant; format. See Molecule and Geometry Specification for details and; cfour/mints5 for examples. When a PSI4-style molecule is; supplied, its geometry is written to ZMAT in Cartesian form and the; CFOUR_COORDINATES=CARTESIAN, CFOUR_UNITS=ANGSTROM,; CFOUR_CHARGE, and CFOUR_MULTIPLICITY keywords are set; appropriately in the *CFOUR(...) directive.

Once; a basis set has been requested through BASIS, overriding the; default spherical/Cartesian setting must be done through; PUREAM (as opposed to CFOUR_SPHERICAL). Specifying keywords that control geometry optimization is; straightforward. Unless the optimization is invoked in sandwich mode,; all Cfour optimization keywords (e.g., CFOUR_GEO_MAXCYC) are; ineffective, as the Cfour optimizer is never invoked. PSI4; optimization keywords (e.g., GEOM_MAXITER) instead fill; these roles.

Specifying anything in PSI4 format (molecule, basis, options,; method call) starts building a *CFOUR(...) directive for the; ZMAT file. Since the contents of the cfour {...} block are; blindly appended to any input interpreted from PSI4 format, mixing; of PSI4 and Cfour input formats likely will give rise to multiple; *CFOUR(...) directives in the prospective ZMAT, execution of; which will be trapped and halted. Proper uses for the cfour {...}; block are for the sandwich mode, where the entire ZMAT is enclosed,; or for extra directives like %excite*, which presently have no other; specification route. Specifying the basis is perhaps the regulated piece of input. Since; basis set names differ between PSI4 and Cfour and it’s not; practical to compare exponent-to-exponent, any input file with both; BASIS and CFOUR_BASIS keywords present will halt. Once; a basis set has been requested through BASIS, overriding the; default spherical/Cartesian setting must be done through; PUREAM (as opposed to CFOUR_SPHERICAL). Specifying keywords that control geometry optimization is; straightforward. Unless the optimization is invoked in sandwich mode,; all Cfour optimization keywords (e.g., CFOUR_GEO_MAXCYC) are; ineffective, as the Cfour optimizer is never invoked. PSI4; optimization keywords (e.g., GEOM_MAXITER) instead fill; these roles.

Specifying certain keywords that are nominally applicable for pure-PSI4 modules directs them to fulfil analogous roles; in the Cfour program (e.g., MAXITER is used to set; CFOUR_SCF_MAXCYC). This keyword translation only takes place; if the keywords are explicitly set in the input file (part of that; contract that you mean it), meaning that PSI4’s defaults don’t; get imposed on Cfour.

Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH.

Much can be gleaned by just running; inputs and inspecting the ZMAT passed to Cfour, but when questions; arise, here are the specifics, the governing laws. Specifying a piece of input in PSI4 format is entering into; a contract that you mean it.

The line calling; energy() with argument 'cfour' invokes; xcfour.; After execution of the energy('cfour') line completes, Cfour results; are read back into PSI4 format and are thereafter accessible for; further processing in the input file.

This storage of results in variables and arrays in memory for; the duration of the PSI4 instance (as opposed to solely in files); is the only advantage thus far incurred by the P4C4 interface.

When; specified, the memory value is passed on to Cfour by setting keywords; CFOUR_MEMORY_SIZE and CFOUR_MEM_UNIT=MB.; PSI4 has an extensive basis set library in; Gaussian94 format.

All of these features are available to Cfour by; using the BASIS keyword instead of CFOUR_BASIS; (accompanied, of course, by specifying the molecule PSI4-style).; Internally, PSI4 processes the basis set as usual, then translates; the basis set format and writes out a GENBAS file with an entry for; each atom.

Much can be gleaned by just running; inputs and inspecting the ZMAT passed to Cfour, but when questions; arise, here are the specifics, the governing laws.

Specifying anything in PSI4 format (molecule, basis, options,; method call) starts building a *CFOUR(...) directive for the; ZMAT file. Since the contents of the cfour {...} block are; blindly appended to any input interpreted from PSI4 format, mixing; of PSI4 and Cfour input formats likely will give rise to multiple; *CFOUR(...) directives in the prospective ZMAT, execution of; which will be trapped and halted. Proper uses for the cfour {...}; block are for the sandwich mode, where the entire ZMAT is enclosed,; or for extra directives like %excite*, which presently have no other; specification route. Specifying the basis is perhaps the regulated piece of input. Since; basis set names differ between PSI4 and Cfour and it’s not; practical to compare exponent-to-exponent, any input file with both; BASIS and CFOUR_BASIS keywords present will halt. Once; a basis set has been requested through BASIS, overriding the; default spherical/Cartesian setting must be done through; PUREAM (as opposed to CFOUR_SPHERICAL). Specifying keywords that control geometry optimization is; straightforward. Unless the optimization is invoked in sandwich mode,; all Cfour optimization keywords (e.g., CFOUR_GEO_MAXCYC) are; ineffective, as the Cfour optimizer is never invoked. PSI4; optimization keywords (e.g., GEOM_MAXITER) instead fill; these roles. Specifying the computational method (through, for instance,; energy('c4-ccsd') instead of energy('cfour')) often; sets additional keywords consistent with best practices (e.g.,; CFOU",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.3.2/cfour.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.3.2/cfour.html

Specifying certain keywords that are nominally applicable for pure-PSI4 modules directs them to fulfil analogous roles; in the Cfour program (e.g., MAXITER is used to set; CFOUR_SCF_MAXCYC). This keyword translation only takes place; if the keywords are explicitly set in the input file (part of that; contract that you mean it), meaning that PSI4’s defaults don’t; get imposed on Cfour. Also, in the case where a translatable pure-PSI4 keyword and its translation Cfour keyword are both set,; the value attached to the latter is always used.

Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH.

The names of keywords; are unchanged beyond a prepended “cfour_”. (Though be aware that common; abbreviations like CALC and REF must be fully spelled out as; CFOUR_CALC_LEVEL and CFOUR_REFERENCE when used in; PSI4.); In limited trial cases, keywords nominally directed at non-Cfour modules; are translated into their Cfour counterparts. For example, setting; REFERENCE will appropriately set CFOUR_REFERENCE. For a; list of applicable keywords, see source of; qcdb.cfour.muster_psi4options().; Consult Functionality for information on what Cfour; functionality is accessible through PSI4. PSI4 for Cfour Users¶; In the simplest use of the Psi4/Cfour interface, a PSI4 input file; can simply “wrap” a ZMAT file and execute xcfour. This is; illustrated in the following example:; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17cfour {; UHF-SCF energy calculation; N; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A.

Here, the contents of the cfour {...} block are written directly to a; ZMAT file. This is joined by a default GENBAS file; (psi4/share/basis/GENBAS).

Wouters¶; Code author: Sebastian Wouters; Section author: Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples. Note; As of late June 2016, DMRG keywords in PSI4 have been; realigned with those of the chemps2 executable, plus a; “dmrg_” prefix. The only exceptions are the orbital space; PSI4 keywords RESTRICTED_DOCC (formerly; CheMPS2 used FROZEN_DOCC, contrary to its; definition) and ACTIVE which are passed along to; CheMPS2 keywords NOCC and NACT. A translation table; is available. Installation¶; Binary. CheMPS2 is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell). If using the PSI4 binary, CheMPS2 has already been installed alongside. If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; CheMPS2 can be obtained through conda install chemps2.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect CheMPS2 and activate dependent code. Previous bullet had details. To build PSI4 from source and use; Libint from conda without thinking, consult sec:condapsi4dev. To remove a conda installation, conda remove chemps2. Source.

Wouters¶; Code author: Sebastian Wouters; Section author: Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples. Note; As of late June 2016, DMRG keywords in PSI4 have been; realigned with those of the chemps2 executable, plus a; “dmrg_” prefix. The only exceptions are the orbital space; PSI4 keywords RESTRICTED_DOCC (formerly; CheMPS2 used FROZEN_DOCC, contrary to its; definition) and ACTIVE which are passed along to; CheMPS2 keywords NOCC and NACT. A translation table; is available. Installation¶; Binary. CheMPS2 is available as a conda package for Linux and macOS (and Windows, through the Ubuntu shell). If using the PSI4 binary, CheMPS2 has already been installed alongside. If using PSI4 built from source, and anaconda or miniconda has; already been installed (instructions at Quick Installation),; CheMPS2 can be obtained through conda install chemps2.; Then enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; hint its location with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,; and rebuild PSI4 to detect CheMPS2 and activate dependent code. Previous bullet had details. To build PSI4 from source and use; Libint from conda without thinking, consult sec:condapsi4dev. To remove a conda installation, conda remove chemps2. Source. If using PSI4 built from source and you want CheMPS2 built from; from source also,; enable it as a feature with ENABLE_CheMPS2,; and let the build system fetch and build it and activate dependent code.

If the target computer doesn’t have libc >= 2.7 (released c.2007; for reference, 2.10 is newer than 2.7; unlike most libraries, libc generally not available in multiple versions on a computer), the PSI4 conda package won’t work.; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6# unsuitable computer; >>> ldd --version; ldd (GNU libc) 2.5; # suitable computer; >>> ldd --version; ldd (GNU libc) 2.17. It is of greatest importance that the PSI4 executable be linked against conda libpython.so not against any system libpython.so. This is arranged by setting RPATH to seek libraries relative to executable (thanks, conda binary relocation routine!). The conda PSI4 executable is not vulnerable to interference from your LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings.
