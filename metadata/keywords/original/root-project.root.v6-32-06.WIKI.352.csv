A kd-tree uses only splitting planes that are perpendicular to one of the coordinate system axes.; This differs from BSP trees, in which arbitrary splitting planes can be used.; In addition, in the typical definition every node of a kd-tree, from the root to the leaves, stores a point.; This differs from BSP trees, in which leaves are typically the only nodes that contain points; (or other geometric primitives). As a consequence, each splitting plane must go through one of; the points in the kd-tree. kd-trees are a variant that store data only in leaf nodes. 2. Constructing a classical kd-tree ( Pseudo code). Since there are many possible ways to choose axis-aligned splitting planes, there are many different ways; to construct kd-trees. The canonical method of kd-tree construction has the following constraints:. * As one moves down the tree, one cycles through the axes used to select the splitting planes.; (For example, the root would have an x-aligned plane, the root's children would both have y-aligned; planes, the root's grandchildren would all have z-aligned planes, and so on.); * At each step, the point selected to create the splitting plane is the median of the points being; put into the kd-tree, with respect to their coordinates in the axis being used. (Note the assumption; that we feed the entire set of points into the algorithm up-front.). This method leads to a balanced kd-tree, in which each leaf node is about the same distance from the root.; However, balanced trees are not necessarily optimal for all applications.; The following pseudo-code illustrates this canonical construction procedure (NOTE, that the procedure used; by the TKDTree class is a bit different, the following pseudo-code is given as a simple illustration of the; concept):. function kdtree (list of points pointList, int depth); {; if pointList is empty; return n",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html532/TKDTree_int_double_.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html532/TKDTree_int_double_.html

The cut is made on the axis with the biggest spread, and the value on the axis,; on which the cut is performed, is chosen based on the following formula:; Suppose, we want to divide n nodes into 2 groups, left and right. Then the left and right; will have the following number of nodes:. n=2^k+rest. Left = 2^k-1 + ((rest>2^k-2) ? 2^k-2 : rest); Right = 2^k-1 + ((rest>2^k-2) ? rest-2^k-2 : 0). For example, let n_nodes=67. Then, the closest 2^k=64, 2^k-1=32, 2^k-2=16.; Left node gets 32+3=35 sub-nodes, and the right node gets 32 sub-nodes. The division process continues until all the nodes contain not more than a predefined number; of points. 3c. The order of nodes in boundary-related arrays. Some kd-tree based algorithms need to know the boundaries of each node. This information can; be computed by calling the TKDTree::MakeBoundaries() function. It fills the following arrays:. fRange : array containing the boundaries of the domain:; | 1st dimension (min + max) | 2nd dimension (min + max) | ...; fBoundaries : nodes boundaries; | 1st node {1st dim * 2 elements | 2nd dim * 2 elements | ...} | 2nd n",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html532/TKDTree_int_double_.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html532/TKDTree_int_double_.html

Additionally, for terminal nodes,; there is a function GetPointsIndexes(Index inode) that returns a pointer to the relevant; part of the index array. To find the number of point in the node; (not only terminal), call TKDTree::GetNpointsNode(Index inode). 4. TKDtree implementation details - internal information, not needed to use the kd-tree.; 4a. Order of nodes in the node information arrays:. TKDtree is optimized to minimize memory consumption.; Nodes of the TKDTree do not store pointers to the left and right children or to the parent node,; but instead there are several 1-d arrays of size fNNodes with information about the nodes.; The order of the nodes information in the arrays is described below. It's important to understand; it, if one's class needs to store some kind of additional information on the per node basis, for; example, the fit function parameters. Drawback: Insertion to the TKDtree is not supported.; Advantage: Random access is supported. As noted above, the construction of the kd-tree involves choosing the axis and the point on; that axis to divide the remaining points approximately in half. The exact algorithm for choosing; the division point is described in the next section. The sequence of divisions is; recorded in the following arrays:; fAxix[fNNodes] - Division axis (0,1,2,3 ...); fValue[fNNodes] - Division value. Given the index of a node in those arrays, it's easy to find the indices, corresponding to; children nodes or the parent node:; Suppose, the parent node is stored under the index inode. Then:; Left child index = inode*2+1; Right child index = (inode+1)*2; Suppose, that the child node is stored under the index inode. Then:; Parent index = inode/2. Number of division nodes and number of terminals :; fNNodes = (fNPoints/fBucketSize). The nodes are filled always from left side to the right side:; Let inode be the index of a node, and irow - the index of a row; The TKDTree looks the follo",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html532/TKDTree_int_double_.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html532/TKDTree_int_double_.html

The following section gives more details about our implementation. 3. Using TKDTree. 3a. Creating the tree and setting the data; The interface of the TKDTree, that allows to set input data, has been developped to simplify using it; together with TTree::Draw() functions. That's why the data has to be provided column-wise. For example:; {; TTree *datatree = ... datatree->Draw(""x:y:z"", ""selection"", ""goff"");; //now make a kd-tree on the drawn variables; TKDTreeID *kdtree = new TKDTreeID(npoints, 3, 1);; kdtree->SetData(0, datatree->GetV1());; kdtree->SetData(1, datatree->GetV2());; kdtree->SetData(2, datatree->GetV3());; kdtree->Build();; }; NOTE, that this implementation of kd-tree doesn't support adding new points after the tree has been built; Of course, it's not necessary to use TTree::Draw(). What is important, is to have data columnwise.; An example with regular arrays:; {; Int_t npoints = 100000;; Int_t ndim = 3;; Int_t bsize = 1;; Double_t xmin = -0.5;; Double_t xmax = 0.5;; Double_t *data0 = new Double_t[npoints];; Double_t *data1 = new Double_t[npoints];; Double_t *data2 = new Double_t[npoints];; Double_t *y = new Double_t[npoints];; for (Int_t i=0; i<npo",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html532/TKDTree_int_double_.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html532/TKDTree_int_double_.html

A kd-tree uses only splitting planes that are perpendicular to one of the coordinate system axes.; This differs from BSP trees, in which arbitrary splitting planes can be used.; In addition, in the typical definition every node of a kd-tree, from the root to the leaves, stores a point.; This differs from BSP trees, in which leaves are typically the only nodes that contain points; (or other geometric primitives). As a consequence, each splitting plane must go through one of; the points in the kd-tree. kd-trees are a variant that store data only in leaf nodes. 2.

Check the functions documentation for more details. 3b. Navigating the kd-tree. Nodes of the tree are indexed top to bottom, left to right. The root node has index 0. Functions; TKDTree::GetLeft(Index inode), TKDTree::GetRight(Index inode) and TKDTree::GetParent(Index inode); allow to find the children and the parent of a given node. For a given node, one can find the indexes of the original points, contained in this node,; by calling the GetNodePointsIndexes(Index inode) function. Additionally, for terminal nodes,; there is a function GetPointsIndexes(Index inode) that returns a pointer to the relevant; part of the index array. To find the number of point in the node; (not only terminal), call TKDTree::GetNpointsNode(Index inode). 4. TKDtree implementation details - internal information, not needed to use the kd-tree.; 4a. Order of nodes in the node information arrays:. TKDtree is optimized to minimize memory consumption.; Nodes of the TKDTree do not store pointers to the left and right children or to the parent node,; but instead there are several 1-d arrays of size fNNodes with information about the nodes.; The order of the nodes information in the arrays is described below. It's important to understand; it, if one's class needs to store some kind of additional information on the per node basis, for; example, the fit function parameters. Drawback: Insertion to the TKDtree is not supported.; Advantage: Random access is supported. As noted above, the construction of the kd-tree involves choosing the axis and the point on; that axis to divide the remaining points approximately in half. The exact algorithm for choosing; the division point is described in the next section. The sequence of divisions is; recorded in the following arrays:; fAxix[fNNodes] - Division axis (0,1,2,3 ...); fValue[fNNodes] - Division value. Given the index of a node in those arrays, it's easy to find the ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html532/TKDTree_int_float_.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html532/TKDTree_int_float_.html

Our construction method is optimized to save memory, and differs a bit from the constraints above.; In particular, the division axis is chosen as the one with the biggest spread, and the point to create the; splitting plane is chosen so, that one of the two subtrees contains exactly 2^k terminal nodes and is a; perfectly balanced binary tree, and, while at the same time, trying to keep the number of terminal nodes; in the 2 subtrees as close as possible. The following section gives more details about our implementation. 3. Using TKDTree. 3a. Creating the tree and setting the data; The interface of the TKDTree, that allows to set input data, has been developped to simplify using it; together with TTree::Draw() functions. That's why the data has to be provided column-wise. For example:; {; TTree *datatree = ... datatree->Draw(""x:y:z"", ""selection"", ""goff"");; //now make a kd-tree on the drawn variables; TKDTreeID *kdtree = new TKDTreeID(npoints, 3, 1);; kdtree->SetData(0, datatree->GetV1());; kdtree->SetData(1, datatree->GetV2());; kdtree->SetData(2, datatree->GetV3());; kdtree->Build();; }; NOTE, that this implementation of kd-tree doesn't support adding new points after the tree has been built; Of course, it's not necessary to use TTree::Draw().

Check the functions documentation for more details. 3b. Navigating the kd-tree. Nodes of the tree are indexed top to bottom, left to right. The root node has index 0. Functions; TKDTree::GetLeft(Index inode), TKDTree::GetRight(Index inode) and TKDTree::GetParent(Index inode); allow to find the children and the parent of a given node. For a given node, one can find the indexes of the original points, contained in this node,; by calling the GetNodePointsIndexes(Index inode) function. Additionally, for terminal nodes,; there is a function GetPointsIndexes(Index inode) that returns a pointer to the relevant; part of the index array. To find the number of point in the node; (not only terminal), call TKDTree::GetNpointsNode(Index inode). 4. TKDtree implementation details - internal information, not needed to use the kd-tree.; 4a.

As described above, the kd-tree is built by repeatingly dividing the given set of points into; 2 smaller sets. The cut is made on the axis with the biggest spread, and the value on the axis,; on which the cut is performed, is chosen based on the following formula:; Suppose, we want to divide n nodes into 2 groups, left and right. Then the left and right; will have the following number of nodes:. n=2^k+rest. Left = 2^k-1 + ((rest>2^k-2) ? 2^k-2 : rest); Right = 2^k-1 + ((rest>2^k-2) ? rest-2^k-2 : 0). For example, let n_nodes=67. Then, the closest 2^k=64, 2^k-1=32, 2^k-2=16.; Left node gets 32+3=35 sub-nodes, and the right node gets 32 sub-nodes. The division process continues until all the nodes contain not more than a predefined number; of points. 3c. The order of nodes in boundary-related arrays.

The canonical method of kd-tree construction has the following constraints:. * As one moves down the tree, one cycles through the axes used to select the splitting planes.; (For example, the root would have an x-aligned plane, the root's children would both have y-aligned; planes, the root's grandchildren would all have z-aligned planes, and so on.); * At each step, the point selected to create the splitting plane is the median of the points being; put into the kd-tree, with respect to their coordinates in the axis being used. (Note the assumption; that we feed the entire set of points into the algorithm up-front.). This method leads to a balanced kd-tree, in which each leaf node is about the same distance from the root.; However, balanced trees are not necessarily optimal for all applications.; The following pseudo-code illustrates this canonical construction procedure (NOTE, that the procedure used; by the TKDTree class is a bit different, the following pseudo-code is given as a simple illustration of the; concept):. function kdtree (list of points pointList, int depth); {; if pointList is empty; return nil;; else; {; // Select axis based on depth so that axis cycles through all valid values; var int axis := depth mod k;. // Sort point list and choose median as pivot element; select median from pointList;. // Create node and construct subtrees; var tree_node node;; node.location := median;; node.leftChild := kdtree(points in pointList before median, depth+1);; node.rightChild := kdtree(points in pointList after median, depth+1);; return node;; }; }.

Legend class; This class displays a legend box (TPaveText) containing several legend entries.; Each legend entry is made of a reference to a ROOT object, a text label and an; option specifying which graphical attributes (marker/line/fill) should be; displayed. The following example shows how to create a legend. In this example the legend; contains a histogram, a function and a graph. The histogram is put in the legend; using its reference pointer whereas the graph and the function are added; using their names. Note that, because TGraph contructors do not have the; TGraph name as parameter, the graph name should be specified using the; SetName method. When an object is added by name, a scan is performed on the list of objects; contained in the current pad (gPad) and also in the possible; TMultiGraph and THStack present in the pad. If a matching; name is found, the coresponding object is added in the legend using its pointer. Picture; Source. {; TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas(""c1"",""c1"",600,500);; gStyle->SetOptStat(0);.

ROOT; » MATH; » MINUIT; » TLinearFitter. class TLinearFitter: public TVirtualFitter. The Linear Fitter - fitting functions that are LINEAR IN PARAMETERS. Linear fitter is used to fit a set of data points with a linear; combination of specified functions. Note, that ""linear"" in the name; stands only for the model dependency on parameters, the specified; functions can be nonlinear.; The general form of this kind of model is. y(x) = a[0] + a[1]*f[1](x)+...a[n]*f[n](x). Functions f are fixed functions of x. For example, fitting with a; polynomial is linear fitting in this sense. The fitting method. The fit is performed using the Normal Equations method with Cholesky; decomposition. Why should it be used?. The linear fitter is considerably faster than general non-linear; fitters and doesn't require to set the initial values of parameters. Using the fitter:. 1.Adding the data points:; 1.1 To store or not to store the input data?; - There are 2 options in the constructor - to store or not; store the input data. The advantages of storing the data; are that you'll be able to reset the fitting model without; adding all the points again, and that for very large sets; of points the chisquare is calculated more precisely.; The obvious disadvantage is the amount of memory used to; keep all the points.; - Before you start adding the points, you can change the; store/not store option by StoreData() method.; 1.2 The data can be added:; - simply point by point - AddPoint() method; - an array of points at once:; If the data is already stored in some arrays, this data; can be assigned to the linear fitter without physically; coping bytes, thanks to the Use() method of; TVector and TMatrix classes - AssignData() method. 2.Setting the formula; 2.1 The linear formula sy",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html532/TLinearFitter.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html532/TLinearFitter.html

Linear fitter is used to fit a set of data points with a linear; combination of specified functions. Note, that ""linear"" in the name; stands only for the model dependency on parameters, the specified; functions can be nonlinear.; The general form of this kind of model is. y(x) = a[0] + a[1]*f[1](x)+...a[n]*f[n](x). Functions f are fixed functions of x. For example, fitting with a; polynomial is linear fitting in this sense. The fitting method. The fit is performed using the Normal Equations method with Cholesky; decomposition. Why should it be used?. The linear fitter is considerably faster than general non-linear; fitters and doesn't require to set the initial values of parameters.

ROOT; » CORE; » BASE; » TMacro. class TMacro: public TNamed. TMacro. Class supporting a collection of lines with C++ code.; A TMacro can be executed, saved to a ROOT file, edited, etc. A macro can be built line by line by calling the AddLine function.; or it can be created directly from a file via the special constructor; when the first argument is a file name. A macro can be executed via the Exec function.; Arguments can be specified when calling Exec. A macro can be drawn in a pad. When the pad is updated, the macro is; automatically executed. The code in the macro can be saved via the SaveSource function.; If the macro is in the list of primitives of a pad/canvas, the macro; will be saved in the script generated by TCanvas::SaveSource. A macro can be written to a ROOT file via TObject::Write. Examples:; TMacro m(""Peaks.C""); //macro m with name ""Peaks"" is created; from file Peaks.C; m.Exec(); //macro executed with default arguments; m.Exec(""4""); //macro executed with argument; m.SaveSource(""newPeaks.C"");; TFile f(""mymacros.root"",""recreate"");; m.Write(); //macro saved to file with name ""Peaks"".

ROOT; » IO; » IO; » TMapFile. class TMapFile: public TObject. TMapFile. This class implements a shared memory region mapped to a file.; Objects can be placed into this shared memory area using the Add(); member function. To actually place a copy of the object is shared; memory call Update() also whenever the mapped object(s) change(s); call Update() to put a fresh copy in the shared memory. This extra; step is necessary since it is not possible to share objects with; virtual pointers between processes (the vtbl ptr points to the; originators unique address space and can not be used by the; consumer process(es)). Consumer processes can map the memory region; from this file and access the objects stored in it via the Get(); method (which returns a copy of the object stored in the shared; memory with correct vtbl ptr set). Only objects of classes with a; Streamer() member function defined can be shared.

This class implements a shared memory region mapped to a file.; Objects can be placed into this shared memory area using the Add(); member function. To actually place a copy of the object is shared; memory call Update() also whenever the mapped object(s) change(s); call Update() to put a fresh copy in the shared memory. This extra; step is necessary since it is not possible to share objects with; virtual pointers between processes (the vtbl ptr points to the; originators unique address space and can not be used by the; consumer process(es)). Consumer processes can map the memory region; from this file and access the objects stored in it via the Get(); method (which returns a copy of the object stored in the shared; memory with correct vtbl ptr set).

ROOT; » IO; » IO; » TMapFile. class TMapFile: public TObject. TMapFile. This class implements a shared memory region mapped to a file.; Objects can be placed into this shared memory area using the Add(); member function. To actually place a copy of the object is shared; memory call Update() also whenever the mapped object(s) change(s); call Update() to put a fresh copy in the shared memory. This extra; step is necessary since it is not possible to share objects with; virtual pointers between processes (the vtbl ptr points to the; originators unique address space and can not be used by the; consumer process(es)). Consumer processes can map the memory region; from this file and access the objects stored in it via the Get(); method (which returns a copy of the object stored in the shared; memory with correct vtbl ptr set). Only objects of classes with a; Streamer() member function defined can be shared. I know the current implementation is not ideal (you need to copy to; and from the shared memory file) but the main problem is with the; class' virtual_table pointer. This pointer points to a table unique; for every process. Therefore, different options are:; 1) One could allocate an object directly in shared memory in the; producer, but the consumer still has to copy the object from; shared memory into a local object which has the correct vtbl; pointer for that process (copy ctor's can be used for creating; the local copy).; 2) Another possibility is to only allow objects without virtual; functions in shared memory (like simple C structs), or to; forbid (how?) the consumer from calling any virtual functions; of the objects in shared memory.; 3) A last option is to copy the object internals to shared memory; and copy them again from there.
