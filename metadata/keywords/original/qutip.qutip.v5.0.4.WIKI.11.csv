There are accessible through the methods; in this module. Both the algorithms use the scipy.optimize methods; to minimise the fidelity error with respect to to variables that define; the pulse. GRAPE¶; The default algorithm (as it was implemented here first) is GRAPE; GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering [1][2]. It uses a gradient based method such; as BFGS to minimise the fidelity error. This makes convergence very quick; when an exact gradient can be calculated, but this limits the factors that can; taken into account in the fidelity. CRAB¶; The CRAB [3][4] algorithm was developed at the University of Ulm.; In full it is the Chopped RAndom Basis algorithm.; The main difference is that it reduces the number of optimisation variables; by defining the control pulses by expansions of basis functions,; where the variables are the coefficients. Typically a Fourier series is chosen,; i.e. the variables are the Fourier coefficients.; Therefore it does not need to compute an explicit gradient.; By default it uses the Nelder-Mead method for fidelity error minimisation.; References.

Optimal control¶; Wrapper functions that will manage the creation of the objects,; build the configuration, and execute the algorithm required to optimise; a set of ctrl pulses for a given (quantum) system.; The fidelity error is some measure of distance of the system evolution; from the given target evolution in the time allowed for the evolution.; The functions minimise this fidelity error wrt the piecewise control; amplitudes in the timeslots; There are currently two quantum control pulse optmisations algorithms; implemented in this library. There are accessible through the methods; in this module. Both the algorithms use the scipy.optimize methods; to minimise the fidelity error with respect to to variables that define; the pulse. GRAPE¶; The default algorithm (as it was implemented here first) is GRAPE; GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering [1][2]. It uses a gradient based method such; as BFGS to minimise the fidelity error. This makes convergence very quick; when an exact gradient can be calculated, but this limits the factors that can; taken into account in the fidelity. CRAB¶; The CRAB [3][4] algorithm was developed at the University of Ulm.; In full it is the Chopped RAndom Basis algorithm.; The main difference is that it reduces the number of optimisation variables; by defining the control pulses by expansions of basis functions,; where the variables are the coefficients. Typically a Fourier series is chosen,; i.e. the variables are the Fourier coefficients.; Therefore it does not need to compute an explicit gradient.; By default it uses the Nelder-Mead method for fidelity error minimisation.; References.

Softw.; 38, no. 2, (2011). weighted_bipartite_matching(A, perm_type='row')[source]¶; Returns an array of row permutations that attempts to maximize; the product of the ABS values of the diagonal elements in; a nonsingular square CSC sparse matrix. Such a permutation is; always possible provided that the matrix is nonsingular.; This function looks at both the structure and ABS values of the; underlying matrix. Parameters:A : csc_matrix. Input matrix. perm_type : str {‘row’, ‘column’}. Type of permutation to generate. Returns:perm : array. Array of row or column permutations. Notes; This function uses a weighted maximum cardinality bipartite matching; algorithm based on breadth-first search (BFS). The columns are weighted; according to the element of max ABS value in the associated rows and; are traversed in descending order by weight. When performing the BFS; traversal, the row associated to a given column is the one with maximum; weight. Unlike other techniques[1]_, this algorithm does not guarantee the; product of the diagonal is maximized. However, this limitation is offset; by the substantially faster runtime of this method.; References; I. S. Duff and J.

Optimal control¶; Wrapper functions that will manage the creation of the objects,; build the configuration, and execute the algorithm required to optimise; a set of ctrl pulses for a given (quantum) system.; The fidelity error is some measure of distance of the system evolution; from the given target evolution in the time allowed for the evolution.; The functions minimise this fidelity error wrt the piecewise control; amplitudes in the timeslots; There are currently two quantum control pulse optmisations algorithms; implemented in this library. There are accessible through the methods; in this module. Both the algorithms use the scipy.optimize methods; to minimise the fidelity error with respect to to variables that define; the pulse. GRAPE¶; The default algorithm (as it was implemented here first) is GRAPE; GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering [1][2]. It uses a gradient based method such; as BFGS to minimise the fidelity error. This makes convergence very quick; when an exact gradient can be calculated, but this limits the factors that can; taken into account in the fidelity. CRAB¶; The CRAB [3][4] algorithm was developed at the University of Ulm.; In full it is the Chopped RAndom Basis algorithm.; The main difference is that it reduces the number of optimisation variables; by defining the control pulses by expansions of basis functions,; where the variables are the coefficients. Typically a Fourier series is chosen,; i.e. the variables are the Fourier coefficients.; Therefore it does not need to compute an explicit gradient.; By default it uses the Nelde",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/apidoc/functions.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/apidoc/functions.html

The quantum object class, qutip.Qobj, accomplishes this using matrix representation.; To begin, let us create a blank Qobj:; In [4]: Qobj(); Out[4]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[1], [1]], shape = (1, 1), type = bra; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]]. where we see the blank Qobj object with dimensions, shape, and data. Here the data corresponds to a 1x1-dimensional matrix consisting of a single zero entry. Hint; By convention, Class objects in Python such as Qobj() differ from functions in the use of a beginning capital letter. We can create a Qobj with a user defined data set by passing a list or array of data into the Qobj:; In [5]: Qobj([[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]); Out[5]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 1.]; [ 2.]; [ 3.]; [ 4.]; [ 5.]]. Notice how both the dims and shape change according to the input data. Although dims and shape appear to have the same function, the difference will become quite clear in the section on tensor products and partial traces. Note; If you are running QuTiP from a python script you must use the print function to view the Qobj attributes. States and operators¶; Manually specifying the data for each quantum object is inefficient. Even more so when most objects correspond to commonly used types such as the ladder operators of a harmonic oscillator, the Pauli spin operators for a two-level system, or state vectors such as Fock states. Therefore, QuTiP includes predefined objects for a variety of states:. States; Command (# means optional); Inputs.

Notice how the color and point markers change for each set of data. Again, we have had to call add_points twice because adding more than one set of multiple data points is not supported by the add_points function.; What if we want to vary the color of our points. We can tell the qutip.Bloch class to vary the color of each point according to the colors listed in the b.point_color list (see Configuring the Bloch sphere below). Again after clear():; In [39]: xp = [np.cos(th) for th in np.linspace(0, 2*pi, 20)]. In [40]: yp = [sin(th) for th in np.linspace(0, 2*pi, 20)]. In [41]: zp = np.zeros(20). In [42]: pnts = [xp, yp, zp]. In [43]: b.add_points(pnts,'m') # <-- add a 'm' string to signify 'multi' colored points. In [44]: b.show(). Now, the data points cycle through a variety of predefined colors. Now lets add another set of points, but this time we want the set to be a single color, representing say a qubit going from the \(\left|\rm up\right>\) state to the \(\left|\rm down\right>\) state in the y-z plane:; In [45]: xz = np.zeros(20). In [46]: yz = [np.sin(th) for th in np.linspace(0, pi ,20)]. In [47]: zz = [np.cos(th) for th in np.linspace(0, pi, 20)]. In [48]: b.add_points([xz, yz, zz]) # no 'm'. In [49]: b.show(). Again, the same plot can be generated using the qutip.Bloch3d class by replacing Bloch with Bloch3d:. A more slick way of using this ‘multi’ color feature is also given in the example, where we set the color of the markers as a function of time. Differences Between Bloch and Bloch3d¶; While in general the Bloch and Bloch3d classes are interchangeable, there are some important differences to consider when choosing between them.

Animating with the Bloch sphere¶; The Bloch class was designed from the outset to generate animations. To animate a set of vectors or data points the basic idea is: plot the data at time t1, save the sphere, clear the sphere, plot data at t2,... The Bloch sphere will automatically number the output file based on how many times the object has been saved (this is stored in b.savenum). The easiest way to animate data on the Bloch sphere is to use the save() method and generate a series of images to convert into an animation. However, as of Matplotlib version 1.1, creating animations is built-in. We will demonstrate both methods by looking at the decay of a qubit on the bloch sphere. Example: Qubit Decay¶; The code for calculating the expectation values for the Pauli spin operators of a qubit decay is given below. This code is common to both animation examples.; from qutip import *; from scipy import *; def qubit_integrate(w, theta, gamma1, gamma2, psi0, tlist):; # operators and the hamiltonian; sx = sigmax(); sy = sigmay(); sz = sigmaz(); sm = sigmam(); H = w * (cos(theta) * sz + sin(theta) * sx); # collapse operators; c_op_list = []; n_th = 0.5 # temperatur",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/guide-bloch.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/guide-bloch.html

Typically the fidelity error (or infidelity) is more useful, in this case defined as \(\varepsilon = 1 - f_{PSU}\). There are many other possible objectives, and hence figures of merit.; As there are now \(N \times M\) variables (the \(u_{jk}\)) and one parameter to minimise \(\varepsilon\), then the problem becomes a finite multi-variable optimisation problem, for which there are many established methods, often referred to as ‘hill-climbing’ methods. The simplest of these to understand is that of steepest ascent (or descent). The gradient of the fidelity with respect to all the variables is calculated (or approximated) and a step is made in the variable space in the direction of steepest ascent (or descent). This method is a first order gradient method. In two dimensions this describes a method of climbing a hill by heading in the direction where the ground rises fastest. This analogy also clearly illustrates one of the main challenges in multi-variable optimisation, which is that all methods have a tendency to get stuck in local maxima.

Optimal Quantum Control in QuTiP¶; There are two separate implementations of optimal control inside QuTiP. The first is an implementation of first order GRAPE, and is not further described here, but there are the example notebooks. The second is referred to as Qtrl (when a distinction needs to be made) as this was its name before it was integrated into QuTiP. Qtrl uses the Scipy optimize functions to perform the multi-variable optimisation, typically the L-BFGS-B method for GRAPE and Nelder-Mead for CRAB. The GRAPE implementation in Qtrl was initially based on the open-source package DYNAMO, which is a MATLAB implementation, and is described in [DYNAMO]. It has since been restructured and extended for flexibility and compatibility within QuTiP.; The rest of this section describes the Qtrl implementation ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/guide-control.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/guide-control.html

It is hard to determine whether one has found a global maximum or not - a local peak is likely not to be the highest mountain in the region. In quantum optimal control we can typically define an infidelity that has a lower bound of zero. We can then look to minimise the infidelity (from here on we will only consider optimising for infidelity minima). This means that we can terminate any pulse optimisation when the infidelity reaches zero (to a sufficient precision). This is however only possible for fully controllable systems; otherwise it is hard (if not impossible) to know that the minimum possible infidelity has been achieved. In the hill walking analogy the step size is roughly fixed to a stride, however, in computations the step size must be chosen. Clearly there is a trade-off here between the number of steps (or iterations) required to reach the minima and the possibility that we might step over a minima. In practice it is difficult to determine an efficient and effective step size.; The second order differentials of the infidelity with respect to the variables can be used to approximate the local landscape to a parabola. This way a step (or jump) can be made to where the minima would be if it were parabolic. This typically vastly reduces the number of iterations, and removes the need to guess a step size.

You can think of this as the information content of the pulse (as being the only effective input) being very limited e.g. the pulse is compressible to a few bytes without loosing the target.; This is where the Chopped RAndom Basis (CRAB) algorithm [Doria11], [Caneva11] comes into play: Since the pulse complexity is usually very low, it is sufficient to transform the optimal control problem to a few parameter search by introducing a physically motivated function basis that builds up the pulse. Compared to the number of time slices needed to accurately simulate quantum dynamics (often equals basis dimension for Gradient based algorithms), this number is lower by orders of magnitude, allowing CRAB to efficiently optimize smooth pulses with realistic experimental constraints. It is important to point out, that CRAB does not make any suggestion on the basis function to be used. The basis must be chosen carefully considered, taking into account a priori knowledge of the system (such as symmetries, magnitudes of scales,...) and solution (e.g. sign, smoothness, bang-bang behavior, singularities, maximum excursion or rate of change,....). By doing so, this algorithm allows for native integration of experimental constraints such as maximum frequencies allowed, maximum amplitude, smooth ramping up and down of the pulse and many more. Moreover initial guesses, if they are available, can (however not have to) be included to speed up convergence.; As mentioned in the GRAPE paragraph, for CRAB local minima arising from algorithmic design can occur, too.

The latter of these is most important in quantum computation. The GRAPE algorithm¶; The GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering was first proposed in [2]. Solutions to Schrödinger’s equation for a time-dependent Hamiltonian are not generally possible to obtain analytically. Therefore, a piecewise constant approximation to the pulse amplitudes is made. Time allowed for the system to evolve \(T\) is split into \(M\) timeslots (typically these are of equal duration), during which the control amplitude is assumed to remain constant. The combined Hamiltonian can then be approximated as:. \[H(t) \approx H(t_k) = H_0 + \sum_{j=1}^N u_{jk} H_j\quad\]; where \(k\) is a timeslot index, \(j\) is the control index, and \(N\) is the number of controls.

In practice it is difficult to determine an efficient and effective step size.; The second order differentials of the infidelity with respect to the variables can be used to approximate the local landscape to a parabola. This way a step (or jump) can be made to where the minima would be if it were parabolic. This typically vastly reduces the number of iterations, and removes the need to guess a step size. The method where all the second differentials are calculated explicitly is called the Newton-Raphson method. However, calculating the second-order differentials (the Hessian matrix) can be computationally expensive, and so there are a class of methods known as quasi-Newton that approximate the Hessian based on successive iterations. The most popular of these (in quantum optimal control) is the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm (BFGS). The default method in the QuTiP Qtrl GRAPE implementation is the L-BFGS-B method in Scipy, which is a wrapper to the implementation described in [Byrd95]. This limited memory and bounded method does not need to store the entire Hessian, which reduces the computer memory required, and allows bounds to be set for variable values, which considering these are field amplitudes is often physical.; The pulse optimisation is typically far more efficient if the gradients can be calculated exactly, rather than approximated. For simple fidelity measures such as \(f_{PSU}\) this is possible. Firstly the propagator gradient for each timeslot with respect to the control amplitudes is calculated. For closed systems, with unitary dynamics, a method using the eigendecomposition is used, which is efficient as it is also used in the propagator calculation (to exponentiate the combined Hamiltonian). More generally (for example open systems and symplectic dynamics) the Frechet derivative (or augmented matrix) method is used, which is described in [Flo12].

Compared to the number of time slices needed to accurately simulate quantum dynamics (often equals basis dimension for Gradient based algorithms), this number is lower by orders of magnitude, allowing CRAB to efficiently optimize smooth pulses with realistic experimental constraints. It is important to point out, that CRAB does not make any suggestion on the basis function to be used. The basis must be chosen carefully considered, taking into account a priori knowledge of the system (such as symmetries, magnitudes of scales,...) and solution (e.g. sign, smoothness, bang-bang behavior, singularities, maximum excursion or rate of change,....). By doing so, this algorithm allows for native integration of experimental constraints such as maximum frequencies allowed, maximum amplitude, smooth ramping up and down of the pulse and many more. Moreover initial guesses, if they are available, can (however not have to) be included to speed up convergence.; As mentioned in the GRAPE paragraph, for CRAB local minima arising from algorithmic design can occur, too. However, for CRAB a ‘dressed’ version has recently been introduced [Rach15] that allows to escape local minima.; For some control objectives and/or dynamical quantum descriptions, it is either not possible to derive the gradient for the cost functional with respect to each time slice or it is computationally expensive to do so. The same can apply for the necessary (reverse) propagation of the co-state. All this trouble does not occur within CRAB as those elements are not in use here.

The latter of these is most important in quantum computation. The GRAPE algorithm¶; The GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering was first proposed in [2]. Solutions to Schrödinger’s equation for a time-dependent Hamiltonian are not generally possible to obtain analytically. Therefore, a piecewise constant approximation to the pulse amplitudes is made. Time allowed for the system to evolve \(T\) is split into \(M\) timeslots (typically these are of equal duration), during which the control amplitude is assumed to remain constant. The combined Hamiltonian can then be approximated as:. \[H(t) \approx H(t_k) = H_0 + \sum_{j=1}^N u_{jk} H_j\quad\]; where \(k\) is a timeslot index, \(j\) is the control index, and \(N\) is the number of controls. Hence \(t_k\) is the evolution time at the start of the timeslot, and \(u_{jk}\) is the amplitude of control \(j\) throughout timeslot \(k\).

The default method in the QuTiP Qtrl GRAPE implementation is the L-BFGS-B method in Scipy, which is a wrapper to the implementation described in [Byrd95]. This limited memory and bounded method does not need to store the entire Hessian, which reduces the computer memory required, and allows bounds to be set for variable values, which considering these are field amplitudes is often physical.; The pulse optimisation is typically far more efficient if the gradients can be calculated exactly, rather than approximated. For simple fidelity measures such as \(f_{PSU}\) this is possible. Firstly the propagator gradient for each timeslot with respect to the control amplitudes is calculated. For closed systems, with unitary dynamics, a method using the eigendecomposition is used, which is efficient as it is also used in the propagator calculation (to exponentiate the combined Hamiltonian). More generally (for example open systems and symplectic dynamics) the Frechet derivative (or augmented matrix) method is used, which is described in [Flo12]. For other optimisation goals it may not be possible to calculate analytic gradients. In these cases it is necessary to approximate the gradients, but this can be very expensive, and can lead to other algorithms out-performi",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/guide-control.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/guide-control.html

The basis must be chosen carefully considered, taking into account a priori knowledge of the system (such as symmetries, magnitudes of scales,...) and solution (e.g. sign, smoothness, bang-bang behavior, singularities, maximum excursion or rate of change,....).

In this figure of merit the absolute value is taken to ignore any differences in global phase, and \(0 \le f \le 1\). Typically the fidelity error (or infidelity) is more useful, in this case defined as \(\varepsilon = 1 - f_{PSU}\). There are many other possible objectives, and hence figures of merit.; As there are now \(N \times M\) variables (the \(u_{jk}\)) and one parameter to minimise \(\varepsilon\), then the problem becomes a finite multi-variable optimisation problem, for which there are many established methods, often referred to as ‘hill-climbing’ methods.

However, calculating the second-order differentials (the Hessian matrix) can be computationally expensive, and so there are a class of methods known as quasi-Newton that approximate the Hessian based on successive iterations. The most popular of these (in quantum optimal control) is the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm (BFGS). The default method in the QuTiP Qtrl GRAPE implementation is the L-BFGS-B method in Scipy, which is a wrapper to the implementation described in [Byrd95]. This limited memory and bounded method does not need to store the entire Hessian, which reduces the computer memory required, and allows bounds to be set for variable values, which considering these are field amplitudes is often physical.; The pulse optimisation is typically far more efficient if the gradients can be calculated exactly, rather than approximated. For simple fidelity measures such as \(f_{PSU}\) this is possible. Firstly the propagator gradient for each timeslot with respect to the control amplitudes is calculated. For closed systems, with unitary dynamics, a method using the eigendecomposition is used, which is efficient as it is also used in the propagator calculation (to exponentiate the combined Hamiltonian). More generally (for example open systems and symplectic dynamics) the Frechet derivative (or augmented matrix) method is used, which is described in [Flo12]. For other optimisation goals it may not be possible to calculate analytic gradients. In these cases it is necessary to approximate the gradients, but this can be very expensive, and can lead to other algorithms out-performing GRAPE.

Two-time correlation functions¶; With the QuTiP time-evolution functions (for example qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve), a state vector or density matrix can be evolved from an initial state at \(t_0\) to an arbitrary time \(t\), \(\rho(t)=V(t, t_0)\left\{\rho(t_0)\right\}\), where \(V(t, t_0)\) is the propagator defined by the equation of motion. The resulting density matrix can then be used to evaluate the expectation values of arbitrary combinations of same-time operators.; To calculate two-time correlation functions on the form \(\left<A(t+\tau)B(t)\right>\), we can use the quantum regression theorem (see, e.g., [Gar03]) to write. \[\left<A(t+\tau)B(t)\right> = {\rm Tr}\left[A V(t+\tau, t)\left\{B\rho(t)\right\}\right]; = {\rm Tr}\left[A V(t+\tau, t)\left\{BV(t, 0)\left\{\rho(0)\right\}\right\}\right]\]; We therefore first calculate \(\rho(t)=V(t, 0)\left\{\rho(0)\right\}\) using one of the QuTiP evolution solvers with \(\rho(0)\) as initial state, and then again use the same solver to calculate \(V(t+\tau, t)\left\{B\rho(t)\right\}\) using \(B\rho(t)\) as initial state.; Note that if the initial state is the steady state, then \(\rho(t)=V(t, 0)\left\{\rho_{\rm ss}\right\}=\rho_{\rm ss}\) and. \[\left<A(t+\",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/guide-correlation.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/guide-correlation.html

Note that all amplitude coefficients in an exponential series must be of the same dimensions and composition.; In QuTiP, an exponential series object is constructed by creating an instance of the class qutip.eseries:; In [1]: es1 = eseries(sigmax(), 1j). where the first argument is the amplitude coefficient (here, the sigma-X operator), and the second argument is the rate. The eseries in this example represents the time-dependent operator \(\sigma_x e^{i t}\).; To add more terms to an qutip.eseries object we simply add objects using the + operator:; In [2]: omega=1.0. In [3]: es2 = (eseries(0.5 * sigmax(), 1j * omega) +; ...: eseries(0.5 * sigmax",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/guide-eseries.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/guide-eseries.html

Alternatively, we can also specify a list of amplitudes and rates when the qutip.eseries is created:; In [4]: es2 = eseries([0.5 * sigmax(), 0.5 * sigmax()], [1j * omega, -1j * omega]).

The function qutip.fileio.qsave takes an arbitrary object as first parameter and an optional filename as second parameter (default filename is qutip_data.qu). The filename extension is always .qu. The function qutip.fileio.qload takes a mandatory filename as first argument and loads and returns the objects in the file.; To illustrate how these functions can be used, consider a simple calculation of the steadystate of the harmonic oscillator:; In [1]: a = destroy(10); H = a.dag() * a ; c_ops = [np.sqrt(0.5) * a, np.sqrt(0.25) * a.dag()].

We can use the product of \(c * a\) to also apply the number operator to the state vector vac:; In [11]: c * a * vac; Out[11]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. or on the \(\left| 1\right>\) state:; In [12]: c * a * (c * vac); Out[12]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0.]; [ 1.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]; [ 0.]]. or the \(\left| 2\right>\) state:; In [13]: c * a * (c**2 * vac); Out[13]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = (5, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[ 0. ]; [ 0. ]; [ 2.82842712]; [ 0. ]; [ 0. ]]. Notice how in this last example, application of the number operator does not give the expected value \(n=2\), but rather \(2\sqrt{2}\). This is because this last state is not normalized to unity as \(c\left| n\right> = \sqrt{n+1}\left| n+1\right>\).

Of course, displacing the vacuum gives a coherent state, which can also be generated using the built in qutip.states.coherent function. Density matrices¶; One of the main purpose of QuTiP is to explore the dynamics of open quantum systems, where the most general state of a system is not longer a state vector, but rather a density matrix. Since operations on density matrices operate identically to those of vectors, we will just briefly highlight creating and using these structures.; The simplest density matrix is created by forming the outer-product \(\left|\psi\right>\left<\psi\right|\) of a ket vector:; In [28]: ket = basis(5, 2).

We run into; problems, however, if we tensor \(\Lambda\) with the identity to get a partial; transpose map.; In [136]: rho = ket2dm(bell_state()). In [137]: rho_out = partial_transpose(rho, [0, 1]); .....: print(rho_out.eigenenergies()); .....: ; [-0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5]. Notice that even though we started with a positive map, we got an operator out; with negative eigenvalues. Complete positivity addresses this by requiring that; a map returns positive operators for all positive operators, and does so even; under tensoring with another map. The Choi matrix is very useful here, as it; can be shown that a map is completely positive if and only if its Choi matrix; is positive [Wat13]. QuTiP implements this check with the iscp; attribute. As an example, notice that the snippet above already calculates; the Choi matrix of the transpose map by acting it on half of an entangled; pair. We simply need to manually set the dims and superrep attributes to reflect the; structure of the underlying Hilbert space and the chosen representation.; In [139]: J = rho_out.

On the other hand,; the transpose map does satisfy a weaker condition, namely that it is hermicity preserving.; That is, \(\Lambda(\rho) = (\Lambda(\rho))^\dagger\) for all \(\rho\) such that; \(\rho = \rho^\dagger\). To see this, we note that \((\rho^{\mathrm{T}})^\dagger; = \rho^*\), the complex conjugate of \(\rho\). By assumption, \(\rho = \rho^\dagger; = (\rho^*)^{\mathrm{T}}\), though, such that \(\Lambda(\rho) = \Lambda(\rho^\dagger) = \rho^*\).; We can confirm this by checking the ishp attribute:; In [143]: print(J.ishp); True.

However, in most cases, the default fill-in reducing algorithm is nearly optimal. Additional parameters may be used by calling the steady-state solver as:; rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops, method='power', use_rcm=True). where method='power' indicates that we are using the inverse-power solution method, and use_rcm=True turns on a bandwidth minimization routine.; Although it is not obvious, the 'direct', eigen, and 'power' methods all use an LU decomposition internally and thus suffer from a large memory overhead. In contrast, iterative methods such as the 'iterative-gmres', 'iterative-lgmres', and 'iterative-bicgstab' methods do not factor the matrix and thus take less memory than these previous methods and allowing, in principle, for extremely large system sizes. The downside is that these methods can take much longer than the direct method as the condition number of the Liouvillian matrix is large, indicating that these iterative methods require a large number of iterations for convergence. To overcome this, one can use a preconditioner \(M\) that solves for an approximate inverse for the (modified) Liouvillian, thus better conditioning the problem, leading to faster convergence. The use of a preconditioner can actually make these iterative methods faster than the other solution methods. The problem with precondioning is that it is only well defined for Hermitian matrices. Since the Liouvillian is non-Hermitian, the ability to find a good preconditioner is not guaranteed. And moreover, if a preconditioner is found, it is not guaranteed to have a good condition number. QuTiP can make use of an incomplete LU preconditioner when using the iterative 'gmres', 'lgmres', and 'bicgstab' solvers by setting use_precond=True.

Introduction¶; For time-independent open quantum systems with decay rates larger than the corresponding excitation rates, the system will tend toward a steady state as \(t\rightarrow\infty\) that satisfies the equation. \[\frac{d\hat{\rho}_{ss}}{dt}=\mathcal{L}\hat{\rho}_{ss}=0.\]; Although the requirement for time-independence seems quite resitrictive, one can often employ a transformation to the interaction picture that yields a time-independent Hamiltonian. For many these systems, solving for the asymptotic density matrix \(\hat{\rho}_{ss}\) can be achieved using direct or iterative solution methods faster than using master equation or Monte Carlo simulations. Although the steady state equation has a simple mathematical form, the properties of the Liouvillian operator are such that the solutions to this equation are anything but straightforward to find. Steady State solvers in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, the steady-state solution for a system Hamiltonian or Liouvillian is given by qutip.steadystate.steadystate. This function implements a number of different methods for finding the steady state, each with their own pros and cons, where the method used can be chosen using the method keyword argument.

To create operators in a combined Hilbert space that only act only on a single component, we take the tensor product of the operator acting on the subspace of interest, with the identity operators corresponding to the components that are to be unchanged. For example, the operator that represents \(\sigma_z\) on the first qubit in a two-qubit system, while leaving the second qubit unaffected:; In [5]: tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2)); Out[5]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[2, 2], [2, 2]], shape = (4, 4), type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[ 1. 0. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 1",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/guide-tensor.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/guide-tensor.html

Quantum process tomography¶; Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a useful technique for characterizing experimental implementations of quantum gates involving a small number of qubits. It can also be a useful theoretical tool that can give insight in how a process transforms states, and it can be used for example to study how noise or other imperfections deteriorate a gate. Whereas a fidelity or distance measure can give a single number that indicates how far from ideal a gate is, a quantum process tomography analysis can give detailed information about exactly what kind of errors various imperfections introduce.; The idea is to construct a transformation matrix for a quantum process (for example a quantum gate) that describes how the density matrix of a system is transformed by the process. We can then decompose the transformation in some operator basis that represent well-defined and easily interpreted transformations of the input states.; To see how this works (see e.g. [Moh08] for more details), consider a process that is described by quantum map \(\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out}\), which can be written. (1)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix).

Visualization of quantum states and processes¶; Visualization is often an important complement to a simulation of a quantum; mechanical system. The first method of visualization that come to mind might be; to plot the expectation values of a few selected operators. But on top of that,; it can often be instructive to visualize for example the state vectors or; density matices that describe the state of the system, or how the state is; transformed as a function of time (see process tomography below). In this; section we demonstrate how QuTiP and matplotlib can be used to perform a few; types of visualizations that often can provide additional understanding of; quantum system. Fock-basis probability distribution¶; In quantum mechanics probability distributions plays an important role, and as; in statistics, the expectation values computed from a probability distribution; does not reveal the full story. For example, consider an quantum harmonic; oscillator mode with Hamiltonian \(H = \hbar\omega a^\dagger a\), which is; in a state described by its density matrix \(\rho\), and which on average; is occupied by two photons, \(\mathrm{Tr}[\rho a^\dagger a] = 2\). Given; this information we cannot say whether the oscillator is in a Fock state,; a thermal state, a coherent state, etc. By visualizing the photon distribution; in the Fock state basis important clues about the underlying state can be; obtained.; One convenient way to visualize a probability distribution is to use histograms.; Consider the following histogram visualization of the number-basis probability; distribut",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/guide-visualization.html

(1)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{i}^{N^2} A_i \rho_{\rm in} A_i^\dagger,\]; where \(N\) is the number of states of the system (that is, \(\rho\) is represented by an \([N\times N]\) matrix). Given an orthogonal operator basis of our choice \(\{B_i\}_i^{N^2}\), which satisfies \({\rm Tr}[B_i^\dagger B_j] = N\delta_{ij}\), we can write the map as. (2)¶\[\epsilon(\rho_{\rm in}) = \rho_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger.\]; where \(\chi_{mn} = \sum_{ij} b_{im}b_{jn}^*\) and \(A_i = \sum_{m} b_{im}B_{m}\). Here, matrix \(\chi\) is the transformation matrix we are after, since it describes how much \(B_m \rho_{\rm in} B_n^\dagger\) contributes to \(\rho_{\rm out}\).; In a numerical simulation of a quantum process we usually do not have access to the quantum map in the form Eq. (1). Instead, what we usually can do is to calculate the propagator \(U\) for the density matrix in superoperator form, using for example the QuTiP function qutip.propagator.propagator. We can then write. \[\epsilon(\tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}) = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = \tilde{\rho}_{\rm out}\]; where \(\tilde{\rho}\) is the vector representation of the density matrix \(\rho\). If we write Eq. (2) in superoperator form as well we obtain. \[\tilde{\rho}_{\rm out} = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in} = U \tilde{\rho}_{\rm in}.\]; so we can identify. \[U = \sum_{mn} \chi_{mn} \tilde{B}_m \tilde{B}_n^\dagger.\]; Now this is a linear equation systems for the \(N^2 \times N^2\) elements in \(\chi\). We can solve it by writing \(\chi\) and the superoperator propagator as \([N^4]\) vectors, and likewise write the superoperator product \(\tilde{B}_m\tilde{B}_n^\dagger\) as a \([N^4\times N^4]\) matrix \(",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/guide-visualization.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/guide-visualization.html

In the interaction picture the result is. (1)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hb",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html
https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html:5345,Deployability,integrat,integration,5345,"ho_B\). This assumption is known as the Born approximation, and it implies that there never is any entanglement between the system and the bath, neither in the initial state nor at any time during the evolution. It is justified for weak system-bath interaction.; The master equation (1) is non-Markovian, i.e., the change in the density matrix at a time \(t\) depends on states at all times \(\tau < t\), making it intractable to solve both theoretically and numerically. To make progress towards a manageable master equation, we now introduce the Markovian approximation, in which \(\rho(s)\) is replaced by \(\rho(t)\) in Eq. (1). The result is the Redfield equation. (2)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^t d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]],\]; which is local in time with respect the density matrix, but still not Markovian since it contains an implicit dependence on the initial state. By extending the integration to infinity and substituting \(\tau \rightarrow t-\tau\), a fully Markovian master equation is obtained:. (3)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^\infty d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(t-\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]].\]; The two Markovian approximations introduced above are valid if the time-scale with which the system dynamics changes is large compared to the time-scale with which correlations in the bath decays (corresponding to a “short-memory” bath, which results in Markovian system dynamics).; The master equation (3) is still on a too general form to be suitable for numerical implementation. We therefore assume that the system-bath interaction takes the form \(H_I = \sum_\alpha A_\alpha \otimes B_\alpha\) and where \(A_\alpha\) are system operators and \(B_\alpha\) are bath operators. This allows us to write master equation in terms of system operators and bath correlation functions:. \[\begin{split}\frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) =; -\hbar^{-2}; \sum_{\alpha\beta}; \int_0^\infty d\tau\;; \left\{; g_{\alpha\beta}(\",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html

In many situations the collapse operators and their corresponding rates have clear physical interpretation, such as dephasing and relaxation rates, and in those cases the Lindblad master equation is usually the method of choice.; However, in some cases, for example systems with varying energy biases and eigenstates and that couple to an environment in some well-defined manner (through a physically motivated system-environment interaction operator), it is often desirable to derive the master equation from more fundamental physical principles, and relate it to for example the noise-power spectrum of the environment.; The Bloch-Redfield formalism is one such approach to derive a master equation from a microscopic system. It starts from a combined system-environment perspective, and derives a perturbative master equation for the system alone, under the assumption of weak system-environment coupling. One advantage of this approach is that the dissipation processes and rates are obtained directly from the properties of the environment. On the downside, it does not intrinsically guarantee that the resulting master equation unconditionally preserves the physical properties of the density matrix (because it is a perturbative method). The Bloch-Redfield master equation must therefore be used with care, and the assumptions made in the derivation must be honored. (The Lindblad master equation is in a sense more robust – it always results in a physical density matrix – although some collapse operators might not be physically justified). For a full derivation of the Bloch Redfield master equation, see e.g. [Coh92] or [Bre02]. Here we present only a brief version of the derivation, with the intention of introducing the notation and how it relates to the implementation in QuTiP. Brief Derivation and Def",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html
https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html:5331,Modifiability,extend,extending,5331,"ho_B\). This assumption is known as the Born approximation, and it implies that there never is any entanglement between the system and the bath, neither in the initial state nor at any time during the evolution. It is justified for weak system-bath interaction.; The master equation (1) is non-Markovian, i.e., the change in the density matrix at a time \(t\) depends on states at all times \(\tau < t\), making it intractable to solve both theoretically and numerically. To make progress towards a manageable master equation, we now introduce the Markovian approximation, in which \(\rho(s)\) is replaced by \(\rho(t)\) in Eq. (1). The result is the Redfield equation. (2)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^t d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]],\]; which is local in time with respect the density matrix, but still not Markovian since it contains an implicit dependence on the initial state. By extending the integration to infinity and substituting \(\tau \rightarrow t-\tau\), a fully Markovian master equation is obtained:. (3)¶\[ \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = - \hbar^{-2}\int_0^\infty d\tau\; {\rm Tr}_B [H_I(t), [H_I(t-\tau), \rho_S(t)\otimes\rho_B]].\]; The two Markovian approximations introduced above are valid if the time-scale with which the system dynamics changes is large compared to the time-scale with which correlations in the bath decays (corresponding to a “short-memory” bath, which results in Markovian system dynamics).; The master equation (3) is still on a too general form to be suitable for numerical implementation. We therefore assume that the system-bath interaction takes the form \(H_I = \sum_\alpha A_\alpha \otimes B_\alpha\) and where \(A_\alpha\) are system operators and \(B_\alpha\) are bath operators. This allows us to write master equation in terms of system operators and bath correlation functions:. \[\begin{split}\frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) =; -\hbar^{-2}; \sum_{\alpha\beta}; \int_0^\infty d\tau\;; \left\{; g_{\alpha\beta}(\",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html

Bloch-Redfield master equation in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, the Bloch-Redfield tensor Eq. (7) can be calculated using the function qutip.bloch_redfield.bloch_redfield_tensor. It takes two mandatory arguments: The system Hamiltonian \(H\), a nested list of operator \(A_\alpha\), spectral density functions \(S_\alpha(\omega)\) pairs that characterize the coupling between system and bath. The spectral density functions are Python callback functions that takes the (angular) frequency as a single argument.; To illustrate how to calculate the Bloch-Redfield tensor, let’s consider a two-level atom. (8)¶\[ H = -\frac{1}{2}\Delta\sigma_x - \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\sigma_z\]; that couples to an Ohmic bath through the \(\sigma_x\) operator.

If you have not done so already, please read the section: Solving Problems with Time-dependent Hamiltonians.; As we have already discussed, the Bloch-Redfield master equation requires transforming into the eigenbasis of the system Hamiltonian. For time-independent systems, this transformation need only be done once. However, for time-dependent systems, one must move to the instantaneous eigenbasis at each time-step in the evolution, thus greatly increasing the computational complexity of the dynamics. In addition, the requirement for computing all the eigenvalues severely limits the scalability of the method. Fortunately, this eigen decomposition occurs at the Hamiltonian level, as opposed to the super-operator level, and thus, with efficient programming, one can tackle many systems that are commonly encountered.; The time-dependent Bloch-Redfield solver in QuTiP relies on the efficient numerical computations afforded by the string-based time-dependent format, and Cython compilation.

Bloch-Redfield master equation¶. Introduction¶; The Lindblad master equation introduced earlier is constructed so that it describes a physical evolution of the density matrix (i.e., trace and positivity preserving), but it does not provide a connection to any underlaying microscopic physical model. The Lindblad operators (collapse operators) describe phenomenological processes, such as for example dephasing and spin flips, and the rates of these processes are arbitrary parameters in the model. In many situations the collapse operators and their corresponding rates have clear physical interpretation, such as dephasing and relaxation rates, and in those cases the Lindblad master equation is usually the method of choice.; However, in some cases, for example systems with varying energy biases and eigenstates and that couple to an environment in some well-defined manner (through a physically motivated system-environment interaction operator), it is often desirable to derive the master equation from more fundamental physical principles, and relate it to for example the noise-power spectrum of the environment.; The Bloch-Redfield formalism is one such approach to derive a master equation from a microscopic system.

State vectors, or density matrices, as well as col_times and col_which, are accessed in a similar manner, although typically one does not need an index (i.e [0]) since there is only one list for each of these components. The one exception to this rule is if you choose to output state vectors from the Monte Carlo solver, in which case there are ntraj number of state vector arrays. Saving and Loading Result Objects¶; The main advantage in using the Result class as a data storage object comes from the simplicity in which simulation data can be stored and later retrieved. The qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload functions are designed for this task. To begin, let us save the data object from the previous section into a file called “cavity+qubit-data” in the current working directory by calling:; >>> qsave(result, 'cavity+qubit-data'). All of the data results are then stored in a single file of the same name with a ”.qu” extension. Therefore, everything needed to later this data is stored in a single file. Loading the file is just as easy as saving:; >>> stored_result = qload('cavity+qubit-data'); Loaded Result object:; Result object with mcsolve data.; ---------------------------------; expect = True; num_expect = 2, num_collapse = 2, ntraj = 500. where stored_result is the new name of the Result object.

For example:; >>> gamma1 = 0.1; >>> def noise_spectrum(omega):; >>> return 0.5 * gamma1 * omega/(2*pi). The other parameters are similar to the qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve, and the same format for the return value is used qutip.solver.Result. The following example extends the example studied above, and uses qutip.floquet.fmmesolve to introduce dissipation into the calculation; from qutip import *; from scipy import *. delta = 0.0 * 2*pi; eps0 = 1.0 * 2*pi; A = 0.25 * 2*pi; omega = 1.0 * 2*pi; T = (2*pi)/omega; tlist = linspace(0.0, 20 * T, 101); psi0 = basis(2,0).

(3)¶\[ \Psi(t) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha \Psi_\alpha(t) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t),\]; where the coefficients \(c_\alpha\) are determined by the initial wavefunction \(\Psi(0) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha \Psi_\alpha(0)\).; This formalism is useful for finding \(\Psi(t)\) for a given \(H(t)\) only if we can obtain the Floquet modes \(\Phi_a(t)\) and quasienergies \(\epsilon_\alpha\) more easily than directly solving (1). By substituting (2) into the Schrödinger equation (1) we obtain an eigenvalue equation for the Floquet modes and quasienergies. (4)¶\[ \mathcal{H}(t)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \epsilon_\alpha\Phi_\alpha(t),\]; where \(\mathcal{H}(t) = H(t) - i\hbar\partial_t\). This eigenvalue problem could be solved analytically or numerically, but in QuTiP we use an alternative approach for numerically finding the Floquet states and quasienergies [see e.g. Creffield et al., Phys. Rev. B 67, 165301 (2003)]. Consider the propagator for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (1), which by definition satisfies. \[U(T+t,t)\Psi(t) = \Psi(T+t).\]; Inserting the Floquet states from (2) into this expression results in. \[U(T+t,t)\exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha(T+t)/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(T+t),\]; or, since \(\Phi_\alpha(T+t)=\Phi_\alpha(t)\),. \[U(T+t,t)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha T/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \eta_\alpha \Phi_\alpha(t),\]; which shows that the Floquet modes are eigenstates of the one-period propagator. We can therefore find the Floquet modes and quasienergies \(\epsilon_\alpha = -\hbar\arg(\eta_\alpha)/T\) by numerically calculating \(U(T+t,t)\) and diagonalizing it. In particular this method is useful to find \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) by calculating and diagonalize \(U(T,0)\).; The Floquet modes at arbitrary time \(t\) can then be found by propagating \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) to \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\) using the wave function propagator \(U(t,0)\Psi_\alpha(0) = \Psi_\alpha(t)\), which for the Floquet mod",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html

In particular this method is useful to find \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) by calculating and diagonalize \(U(T,0)\).; The Floquet modes at arbitrary time \(t\) can then be found by propagating \(\Phi_\alpha(0)\) to \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\) using the wave function propagator \(U(t,0)\Psi_\alpha(0) = \Psi_\alpha(t)\), which for the Floquet modes yields. \[U(t,0)\Phi_\alpha(0) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t),\]; so that \(\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar) U(t,0)\Phi_\alpha(0)\). Since \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\) is periodic we only need to evaluate it for \(t \in [0, T]\), and from \(\Phi_\alpha(t \in [0,T])\) we can directly evaluate \(\Phi_\alpha(t)\), \(\Psi_\alpha(t)\) and \(\Psi(t)\) for arbitrary large \(t\). Floquet formalism in QuTiP¶; QuTiP provides a family of functions to calculate the Floquet modes and quasi energies, Floquet state decomposition, etc., given a time-dependent Hamiltonian on the callback format, list-string format and list-callback format (see, e.g., qutip.mesolve for details).; Consider for example the case of a strongly driven two-level atom, described by the Hamiltonian. (5)¶\[ H(t) = -\frac{1}{2}\Delta\sigma_x - \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\sigma_z + \frac{1}{2}A\sin(\omega t)\sigma_z.\]; In QuTiP we can define this Hamiltonian as follows:; In [1]: delta = 0.2 * 2*np.pi; eps0 = 1.0 * 2*np.pi; A = 2.5 * 2*np.pi; omega = 1.0 * 2*np.pi.

This matrix equation can, in principle, be solved by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix \(H\). In practice, however, it is difficult to perform this diagonalization unless the size of the Hilbert space (dimension of the matrix \(H\)) is small. Analytically, it is a formidable task to calculate the dynamics for systems with more than two states. If, in addition, we consider dissipation due to the inevitable interaction with a surrounding environment, the computational complexity grows even larger, and we have to resort to numerical calculations in all realistic situations. This illustrates the importance of numerical calculations in describing the dynamics of open quantum systems, and the need for efficient and accessible tools for this task.; The Schrödinger equation, which governs the time-evolution of closed quantum systems, is defined by its Hamiltonian and state vector. In the previous section, Using Tensor Products and Partial Traces, we showed how Hamiltonians and state vectors are constructed in QuTiP. Given a Hamiltonian, we can calculate the unitary (non-dissipative) time-evolution of an arbitrary state vector \(\left|\psi_0\right>\) (psi0) using the QuTiP function qutip.mesolve. It evolves the state vector and evaluates the expectation values for a set of operators expt_ops at the points in time in the list times, using an ordinary differential equation solver.

Non-unitary evolution¶; While the evolution of the state vector in a closed quantum system is deterministic, open quantum systems are stochastic in nature. The effect of an environment on the system of interest is to induce stochastic transitions between energy levels, and to introduce uncertainty in the phase difference between states of the system. The state of an open quantum system is therefore described in terms of ensemble averaged states using the density matrix formalism. A density matrix \(\rho\) describes a probability distribution of quantum states \(\left|\psi_n\right>\), in a matrix representation \(\rho = \sum_n p_n \left|\psi_n\right>\left<\psi_n\right|\), where \(p_n\) is the classical probability that the system is in the quantum state \(\left|\psi_n\right>\). The time evolution of a density matrix \(\rho\) is the topic of the remaining portions of this section. The Lindblad Master equation¶; The standard approach for deriving the equations of motion for a system interacting with its environment is to expand the scope of the system to include the environment. The combined quantum system is then closed, and its evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation.

The combined quantum system is then closed, and its evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation. (2)¶\[\dot \rho_{\rm tot}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H_{\rm tot}, \rho_{\rm tot}(t)],\]; the equivalent of the Schrödinger equation (1) in the density matrix formalism. Here, the total Hamiltonian. \[H_{\rm tot} = H_{\rm sys} + H_{\rm env} + H_{\rm int},\]; includes the original system Hamiltonian \(H_{\rm sys}\), the Hamiltonian for the environment \(H_{\rm env}\), and a term representing the interaction between the system and its environment \(H_{\rm int}\). Since we are only interested in the dynamics of the system, we can at this point perform a partial trace over the environmental degrees of freedom in Eq. (2), and thereby obtain a master equation for the motion of the original system density matrix. The most general trace-preserving and completely positive form of this evolution is the Lindblad master equation for the reduced density matrix \(\rho = {\rm Tr}_{\rm env}[\rho_{\rm tot}]\). (3)¶\[\dot\rho(t)=-\frac{i}{\hbar}[H(t),\rho(t)]+\sum_n \frac{1}{2} \left[2 C_n \rho(t) C_n^{+} - \rho(t) C_n^{+} C_n - C_n^{+} C_n \rho(t)\right]\]; where the \(C_n = \sqrt{\gamma_n} A_n\) are collapse operators, and \(A_n\) are the operators through which the environment couples to the system in \(H_{\rm int}\), and \(\gamma_n\) are the corresponding rates. The derivation of Eq. (3) may be found in several sources, and will not be reproduced here. Instead, we emphasize the approximations that are required to arrive at the master equation in the form of Eq. (3) from physical arguments, and hence perform a calculation in QuTiP:. Separability: At \(t=0\) there are no correlations between the system and its environment such that the total density matrix can be written as a tensor product \(\rho^I_{\rm tot}(0) = \rho^I(0) \otimes \rho^I_{\rm env}(0)\).; Born approximation: Requires: (1) that th",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html

This illustrates the importance of numerical calculations in describing the dynamics of open quantum systems, and the need for efficient and accessible tools for this task.; The Schrödinger equation, which governs the time-evolution of closed quantum systems, is defined by its Hamiltonian and state vector. In the previous section, Using Tensor Products and Partial Traces, we showed how Hamiltonians and state vectors are constructed in QuTiP. Given a Hamiltonian, we can calculate the unitary (non-dissipative) time-evolution of an arbitrary state vector \(\left|\psi_0\right>\) (psi0) using the QuTiP function qutip.mesolve.

The qutip.mesolve and qutip.essolve functions take the same arguments and it is therefore easy switch between the two solvers.; For example, the time evolution of a quantum spin-1/2 system with tunneling rate 0.1 that initially is in the up state is calculated, and the expectation values of the \(\sigma_z\) operator evaluated, with the following code; In [1]: H = 2 * np.pi * 0.1 * sigmax().

The Lindblad Master equation¶; The standard approach for deriving the equations of motion for a system interacting with its environment is to expand the scope of the system to include the environment. The combined quantum system is then closed, and its evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation. (2)¶\[\dot \rho_{\rm tot}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H_{\rm tot}, \rho_{\rm tot}(t)],\]; the equivalent of the Schrödinger equation (1) in the density matrix formalism.

Since we are only interested in the dynamics of the system, we can at this point perform a partial trace over the environmental degrees of freedom in Eq. (2), and thereby obtain a master equation for the motion of the original system density matrix. The most general trace-preserving and completely positive form of this evolution is the Lindblad master equation for the reduced density matrix \(\rho = {\rm Tr}_{\rm env}[\rho_{\rm tot}]\).

The advantage of the Monte Carlo method over the master equation approach is that only the state vector is required to be kept in the computers memory, as opposed to the entire density matrix. For large quantum system this becomes a significant advantage, and the Monte Carlo solver is therefore generally recommended for such systems. For example, simulating a Heisenberg spin-chain consisting of 10 spins with random parameters and initial states takes almost 7 times longer using the master equation rather than Monte Carlo approach with the default number of trajectories running on a quad-CPU machine. Furthermore, it takes about 7 times the memory as well. However, for small systems, the added overhead of averaging a large number of stochastic trajectories to obtain the open system dynamics, as well as starting the multiprocessing functionality, outweighs the benefit of the minor (in this case) memory saving. Master equation methods are therefore generally more efficient when Hilbert space sizes are on the order of a couple of hundred states or smaller.; Like the master equation solver qutip.mesolve, the Monte Carlo solver returns a qutip.solver.Result object consisting of expectation values, if the user has defined expectation value operators in the 5th argument to mcsolve, or state vectors if no expectation value operators are given. If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively. Changing the Number of Trajectories¶; As mentioned earlier, by default, the mcsolve function runs 500 trajectories.

IV: Using the renormalized state from step III as the new initial condition at time \(\tau\), draw a new random number, and repeat the above procedure until the final simulation time is reached. Monte Carlo in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, Monte Carlo evolution is implemented with the qutip.mcsolve function. It takes nearly the same arguments as the qutip.mesolve; function for master-equation evolution, except that the initial state must be a ket vector, as oppose to a density matrix, and there is an optional keyword parameter ntraj that defines the number of stochastic trajectories to be simulated. By default, ntraj=500 indicating that 500 Monte Carlo trajectories will be performed.; To illustrate the use of the Monte Carlo evolution of quantum systems in QuTiP, let’s again consider the case of a two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity. The only differences to the master-equation treatment is that in this case we invoke the qutip.mcsolve function instead of qutip.mesolve; In [1]: times = np.linspace(0.0, 10.0, 200).

If state vectors are returned, then the qutip.solver.Result returned by qutip.mcsolve will be an array of length ntraj, with each element containing an array of ket-type qobjs with the same number of elements as times. Furthermore, the output qutip.solver.Result object will also contain a list of times at which collapse occurred, and which collapse operators did the collapse, in the col_times and col_which properties, respectively. Changing the Number of Trajectories¶; As mentioned earlier, by default, the mcsolve function runs 500 trajectories. This value was chosen because it gives good accuracy, Monte Carlo errors scale as \(1/n\) where \(n\) is the number of trajectories, and simultaneously does not take an excessive amount of time to run. However, like many other options in QuTiP you are free to change the number of trajectories to fit your needs. If we want to run 1000 trajectories in the above example, we can simply modify the call to mcsolve like:; In [14]: data = mcsolve(H, psi0, times, [np.sqrt(0.1) * a], [a.dag() * a, sm.dag() * sm], ntraj=1000); 10.0%.

For our first example, this string would be '9 * exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2)'. The Hamiltonian in this format would take the form:; In [42]: H = [H0, [H1, '9 * exp(-(t / 5) ** 2)']]. Notice that this is a valid Hamiltonian for the string-based format as exp is included in the above list of suitable functions. Calling the solvers is the same as before:; In [43]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, [a.dag() * a]). We can also use the args variable in the same manner as before, however we must rewrite our string term to read: 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)'; In [44]: H = [H0, [H1, 'A * exp(-(t / sig) ** 2)']]. In [45]: args = {'A': 9, 'sig': 5}. In [46]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag()*a], args=args). Important; Naming your args variables e, j or pi will cause errors when using the string-based format. Collapse operators are handled in the exact same way. Modeling Non-Analytic and/or Experimental Time-Dependent Parameters using Interpolating Functions¶. Note; New in QuTiP 4.1. Sometimes it is necessary to model a system where the time-dependent parameters are non-analytic functions, or are derived from experimental data (i.e. a collection of data points). In these situations, one can use interpolating functions as an approximate functional form for input into a time-dependent solver. QuTiP includes it own custom cubic spline interpolation class qutip.interpolate.Cubic_Spline to provide this functionality. To see how this works, lets first generate some noisy data:; In [47]: t = np.linspace(-15, 15, 100). In [48]: func = lambda t: 9*np.exp(-(t / 5)** 2). In [49]: noisy_func = lambda t: func(t)+(0.05*func(t))*np.random.randn(t.shape[0]). In [50]: noisy_data = noisy_func(t).

Of course, we can always hardcode the values in the dictionary as well args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}, but there is much more flexibility by using variables in args. To let the solvers know that we have a set of args to pass we append the args to the end of the solver input:; In [39]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args={'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}). or to keep things looking pretty; In [40]: args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}. In [41]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args=args). Once again, the Monte Carlo solver qutip.mcsolve works in an identical manner. String Format Method¶. Note; You must have Cython installed on your computer to use this format. See Installation for instructions on installing Cython. The string-based time-dependent format works in a similar manner as the previously discussed Python function method. That being said, the underlying code does something completely different. When using this format, the strings used to represent the time-dependent coefficients, as well as Hamiltonian and collapse operators, are rewritten as Cython code using a code generator class and then compiled into C code. The details of this meta-programming will be published in due course. however, in short, this can lead to a substantial reduction in time for complex time-dependent problems, or when simulating over long intervals.; Like the previous method, the string-based format uses a list pair format [Op, str] where str is now a string representing the time-dependent coefficient.

In [81]: rhs_generate(H_td, c_ops, Hargs, name='lz_func'). Here, we have given the generated file a custom name lz_func, however this is not necessary as a generic name will automatically be given. Now we define the function task that is called by qutip.parallel.parfor with the m-index parallelized in loop over the elements of p_mat[m,n]:; In [82]: def task(args):; ....: m, eps = args; ....: p_mat_m = np.zeros(len(A_list)); ....: for n, A in enumerate(A_list):; ....: # change args sent to solver, w is really a constant though.; ....: Hargs = {'w': w, 'eps': eps,'A': A}; ....: U = propagator(H_td, T, c_ops, Hargs, opts) #<- IMPORTANT LINE; ....: rho_ss = propagator_steadystate(U); ....: p_mat_m[n] = expect(sn, rho_ss); ....: return [m, p_mat_m]; ....: . Notice the Options opts in the call to the qutip.propagator function. This is tells the qutip.mesolve function used in the propagator to call the pre-generated file lz_func.

Function based: Hamiltonian / collapse operators expressed using [qobj, func] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients of the Hamiltonian (or collapse operators) are expressed using Python functions.; String (Cython) based: The Hamiltonian and/or collapse operators are expressed as a list of [qobj, string] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients are represented as strings. The resulting Hamiltonian is then compiled into C code using Cython and executed.; Hamiltonian function (outdated): The Hamiltonian is itself a Python function with time-dependence. Collapse operators must be time independent using this input format. Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose? In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general, allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions. However, by automatically compiling your system into C++ code, the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster [This is also the only format that is supported in the qutip.brmesolve solver]. Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor. Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of, it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter. Time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions, or combinations thereof (including constants) can be compiled directly into C++-code:; 'abs', 'acos', 'acosh', 'arg', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atanh', 'conj',; 'cos', 'cosh','exp', 'erf', 'imag', 'log', 'log10', 'norm', 'proj', 'real', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt',; 'tan', 'tanh'.

This includes a wide range of functionality, but comes with a small overhead created by going from C++->Python->C++.; Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators. However, in contrast to options #1 and #2, this method can be used in implementing time-dependent Hamiltonians that cannot be expressed as a function of constant operators with time-dependent coefficients.; A collection of examples demonstrating the simulation of time-dependent problems can be found on the tutorials web page. Function Based Time Dependence¶; A very general way to write a time-dependent Hamiltonian or collapse operator is by using Python functions as the time-dependent coefficients. To accomplish this, we need to write a Python function that returns the time-dependent coefficient. Additionally, we need to tell QuTiP that a given Hamiltonian or collapse operator should be associated with a given Python function. To do this, one needs to specify operator-function pairs in list format: [Op, py_coeff], where Op is a given Hamiltonian or collapse operator and py_coeff is the name of the Python function ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

The output from the master equation solver is identical to that shown in the examples, the Monte Carlo however will be noticeably off, suggesting we should increase the number of trajectories for this example. In addition, we can also consider the decay of a simple Harmonic oscillator with time-varying decay rate; In [28]: kappa = 0.5.

In [36]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a]). Using the args variable¶; In the previous example we hardcoded all of the variables, driving amplitude \(A\) and width \(\sigma\), with their numerical values. This is fine for problems that are specialized, or that we only want to run once. However, in many cases, we would like to change the parameters of the problem in only one location (usually at the top of the script), and not have to worry about manually changing the values on each run. QuTiP allows you to accomplish this using the keyword args as an input to the solvers. For instance, instead of explicitly writing 9 for the amplitude and 5 for the width of the gaussian driving term, we can make us of the args variable; In [37]: def H1_coeff(t, args):; ....: return args['A'] * np.exp(-(t/args['sigma'])**2); ....: . or equivalently,; In [38]: def H1_coeff(t, args):; ....: A = args['A']; ....:",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html

Of course, we can always hardcode the values in the dictionary as well args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}, but there is much more flexibility by using variables in args. To let the solvers know that we have a set of args to pass we append the args to the end of the solver input:; In [39]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args={'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}). or to keep things looking pretty; In [40]: args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}.

Note that, at present, only equally spaced real or complex data sets can be accommodated. This cubic spline class S can now be pasted to any of the mesolve, mcsolve, or sesolve functions where one would normally input a time-dependent function or string-representation. Taking the problem from the previous section as an example. We would make the replacement:; H = [H0, [H1, '9 * exp(-(t / 5) ** 2)']]. to; H = [H0, [H1, S]]. When combining interpolating functions with other Python functions or strings, the interpolating class will automatically pick the appropriate method for calling the class. That is to say that, if for example, you have other time-dependent terms that are given in the string-format, then the cubic spline representation will also be passed in a string-compatible format. In the string-format, the interpolation function is compiled into c-code, and thus is quite fast. This is the default method if no other time-dependent terms are present. Reusing Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. When repeatedly simulating a system where only the time-dependent variables, or initial state change, it is possible to reuse the Hamiltonian data stored in QuTiP and there by avoid spending time needlessly preparing the Hamiltonian and collapse terms for simulation.

Taking the problem from the previous section as an example. We would make the replacement:; H = [H0, [H1, '9 * exp(-(t / 5) ** 2)']]. to; H = [H0, [H1, S]]. When combining interpolating functions with other Python functions or strings, the interpolating class will automatically pick the appropriate method for calling the class. That is to say that, if for example, you have other time-dependent terms that are given in the string-format, then the cubic spline representation will also be passed in a string-compatible format. In the string-format, the interpolation function is compiled into c-code, and thus is quite fast. This is the default method if no other time-dependent terms are present. Reusing Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Data¶. Note; This section covers a specialized topic and may be skipped if you are new to QuTiP. When repeatedly simulating a system where only the time-dependent variables, or initial state change, it is possible to reuse the Hamiltonian data stored in QuTiP and there by avoid spending time needlessly preparing the Hamiltonian and collapse terms for simulation.

Methods for Writing Time-Dependent Operators¶; In the previous examples of quantum evolution, we assumed that the systems under consideration were described by time-independent Hamiltonians. However, many systems have explicit time dependence in either the Hamiltonian, or the collapse operators describing coupling to the environment, and sometimes both components might depend on time. The time-evolutions solvers qutip.mesolve, qutip.mcsolve, qutip.sesolve, and qutip.brmesolve are all capable of handling time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse terms. There are, in general, three different ways to implement time-dependent problems in QuTiP:. Function based: Hamiltonian / collapse operators expressed using [qobj, func] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients of the Hamiltonian (or collapse operators) are expressed using Python functions.; String (Cython) based: The Hamiltonian and/or collapse operators are expressed as a list of [qobj, string] pairs, where the time-dependent coefficients are represented as strings. The resulting Hamiltonian is then compiled into C code using Cython and executed.; Hamiltonian function (outdated): The Hamiltonian is itself a Python function with time-dependence. Collapse operators must be time independent using this input format.

Using the args variable¶; In the previous example we hardcoded all of the variables, driving amplitude \(A\) and width \(\sigma\), with their numerical values. This is fine for problems that are specialized, or that we only want to run once. However, in many cases, we would like to change the parameters of the problem in only one location (usually at the top of the script), and not have to worry about manually changing the values on each run. QuTiP allows you to accomplish this using the keyword args as an input to the solvers. For instance, instead of explicitly writing 9 for the amplitude and 5 for the width of the gaussian driving term, we can make us of the args variable; In [37]: def H1_coeff(t, args):; ....: return args['A'] * np.exp(-(t/args['sigma'])**2); ....: . or equivalently,; In [38]: def H1_coeff(t, args):; ....: A = args['A']; ....: sig = args['sigma']; ....: return A * np.exp(-(t / sig) ** 2); ....: . where args is a Python dictionary of key: value pairs args = {'A': a, 'sigma': b} where a and b are the two parameters for the amplitude and width, respectively. Of course, we can always hardcode the values in the dictionary as well args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}, but there is much more flexibility by using variables in args. To let the solvers know that we have a set of args to pass we append the args to the end of the solver input:; In [39]: output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a], args={'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}). or to keep things looking pretty; In [40]: args = {'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}.

Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose? In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general, allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions. However, by automatically compiling your system into C++ code, the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster [This is also the only format that is supported in the qutip.brmesolve solver]. Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor. Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of, it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter. Time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions, or combinations thereof (including constants) can be compiled directly into C++-code:; 'abs', 'acos', 'acosh', 'arg', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atanh', 'conj',; 'cos', 'cosh','exp', 'erf', 'imag', 'log', 'log10', 'norm', 'proj', 'real', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt',; 'tan', 'tanh'. In addition, QuTiP supports cubic spline based interpolation functions [Modeling Non-Analytic and/or Experimental Time-Dependent Parameters using Interpolating Functions].; If you require mathematical functions other than those listed above, than it is possible to call any of the functions in the NumPy library using the prefix np. before the function name in the string, i.e 'np.sin(t)'. This includes a wide range of functionality, but comes with a small overhead created by going from C++->Python->C++.; Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators.

For instance, instead of explicitly writing 9 for the amplitude and 5 for the width of the gaussian driving term, we can make us of the args variable; In [37]: def H1_coeff(t, args):; ....: return args['A'] * np.exp(-(t/args['sigma'])**",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html
