I have produced some neural network output score, which I exported to ROOT histograms using uproot (as I am more familiar with that than pyROOT), so that I could set limits using the Higgs Combine tool. However in the Higgs Combine tool I encountered errors due to these histograms having nan integral. I presumed this problem may just have been caused by me outputting the histogram incorrectly, however when I investigated one of these histograms I found it had the property that hist.Integral(100, 100) gives nan, but hist.GetBinContent(100) gives 0.0, when I would assume these should always give the same result. What is the difference between these, please, and can anyone advise on where I might be going wrong?. Thank you.

This is a snapshot of how ROOT 6.20/08 used my system's resources during its build:. ![root-6 20 08-build](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30694331/94133565-1d97ec80-fe61-11ea-927d-94b8926cd41b.png). The build starts ""pretty much"" at the left hand side of the timeline, and lasts until ""pretty much"" the right hand side of it. As you can see, the build starts out very well. Building LLVM scales perfectly to 64 threads. And I believe it would scale well to even beyond that. But once the LLVM build is done, many bottlenecks show up. First there is a big bottleneck with building `libCling` and `rootcling`, but after that the build of `libRIO` is also taking a surprising amount of time. And the build is stuck waiting for all of these. Towards the end things improve a bit once more, as many libraries / source files can build in parallel once more. But even then, very rarely does the build manage to make use of all of the available cores. ## Optional: share how it could be improved. From a quick glance it seems that ROOT's CMake configuration sets up way too many unnecessary dependencies between its build targets. Most of the issues seem to arise from how the dictionary generation is set up as far as I can see. In ATLAS I use the following code to set up the generation of dictionary source files:. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/master/Build/AtlasCMake/modules/AtlasDictionaryFunctions.cmake.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6468:243,Availability,fault,faults,243,"## Describe the bug; I store a custom event class in a TTree. Some of the members of the class are arrays (c-style). Accessing the array members works for the first time the GetEntry() is called, but subsequent accesses result in segmentation faults. I am using the ""old"" way of reading the tree (with SetBranchAddress). . One possible workaround might be to use std::array instead of c-style arrays, although I have not fully tested if this works. . ## Expected behavior; Array members of objects in TTrees are accessible via PyROOT as was the case before 6.22. . ## To Reproduce. I attached a MWE (really a minimal failing example), including a script to build/generate a tree/run the offending python scripts (faiing.sh): [mwe.tar.gz](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/5286101/mwe.tar.gz). The gist is that the event here is a simple class: ; ```. #ifndef _mwe_event_h; #define _mwe_event_h. #include ""TObject.h"" ; #include <array>. class MWEEvent ; {. public: ; MWEEvent() { iev =-1; bar=-1; foo[0] =-1; foo[1]=-1; } . // workaround for not being able to access foo directly ; double get_foo(int i) const { return foo[i]; } . int iev; ; double bar; ; double foo[2]; ; virtual ~MWEEvent() { ; } . ClassDef(MWEEvent,1);; }; ; ```. A tree of these objects can be read with PyROOT fine if only the scalar members are touched, or the getter is used:. ```; import ROOT . ROOT.gSystem.Load(""build/libmwe.so"") . f = ROOT.TFile(""out.root""); ; t = f.Get(""tree""); . ev = ROOT.MWEEvent() . t.SetBranchAddress(""event"",ev) . for i in range(10): ; t.GetEntry(i); ; print (ev.iev) ; print (ev.bar) ; print (ev.get_foo(0)); print (ev.get_foo(1)); ```. But if you try to access the array member directly (as used to work), it does not work:; ```; import ROOT . ROOT.gSystem.Load(""build/libmwe.so"") . f = ROOT.TFile(""out.root""); ; t = f.Get(""tree""); . ev = ROOT.MWEEvent() . t.SetBranchAddress(""event"",ev) . for i in range(10): ; t.GetEntry(i); ; print (ev.iev) ; print (ev.bar) ; print (ev.foo[0]); print (",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6468

When using [DD4hep](https://dd4hep.web.cern.ch/dd4hep/) to try and describe the geometry of the upgraded LHCb detector geometry, we've noticed overlapping geometry that's not picked up by running `gGeoManager::CheckOverlaps`. The geometry is attached as ROOT files (Geometry.root and Geometry_ClampInModule.root). To view the geometry we run in a ROOT session (or as a macro); ```c++; TGeoManager::Import(""Geometry.root""); gGeoManager->GetMasterVolume()->Draw(""ogl""); ```; and then running `gGeoManager->CheckOverlaps(0.00001)` Does not find the overlap between the shapes `pvCoolingClamp` and `pvPipeBottom` (The list of shapes can be found by opening a `TBrowser` after importing the geometry and navigating the 'default' folder). The expected behavior here is that overlaps would be found between these shapes as one passes straight through the other. I have also tried moving the Cooling Clamp to the top of the shape and trying again there (see Geometry_ClampInModule.root) and here overlaps are only identified between the Cooling Clamp and simple shapes (e.g. Chips, glue) but not `lvDet` or `lvModule` itself. These 'simple shapes' refer to just cuboids/cylinders/etc rather than subtractions of shapes which is how the others are produced.

ROOT.TPyDispatcher is known to be broken in 6.22.00, but [it is supposed to be fixed for 6.22.02](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6065). ### To Reproduce. Run `python tutorials/pyroot/gui_ex.py`. ### Setup. 1. ROOT version: 6.22.02; 2. Operating system: Linux x86_64 (Arch Linux and Ubuntu 18.04); 3. Python version: Python3.8; 4. I tested this both for root from the Arch Linux repositories and from conda-forge, so I assume it is not the packagers fault.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6579

TTreeReaderValue<int> n{reader, ""n""};; std::cout << reader.GetTree()->GetBranch(""n"")->GetTitle() << std::endl;; std::cout << reader.GetEntries(true) << std::endl; // Gives warning; }; ```; Running this as `root -q -b -l test.C` in ROOT 6.20/04 or 6.22/02 gives the following warning:; ```; Warning in <TTreeReader::SetEntryBase()>: The current tree in the TChain tree has changed (e.g. by TTree::Process) even though TTreeReader::SetEntry() was called, which switched the tree again. Did you mean to call TTreeReader::SetLocalEntry()?; ```; I believe the code in the snippet is valid and hence the warning should not be printed. The warning disappears if the calls to `reader.GetTree` and `reader.GetEntries` are swapped or if another call to `reader.GetEntries` is inserted before `reader.GetTree`. This might be related to the issue reported [here](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/warning-in-ttreereader-with-tchain/34484), which has since been fixed.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6641

I've recently encountered some issues with using TMVA in JupyROOT ([here is an example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iml-wg/tmvatutorials/blob/master/TMVAinJupyter_FullTutorial.ipynb), I haven't found much documentation besides this). I'm basically able to follow the structure of this example, but I run into issues when calling `TMVA.DataLoader.AddSignalTree()`. Since I'm working with a Jupyter notebook, I'll provide a plaintext version of the code below, followed by the error, but I'm also including links to the relevant files for running this -- the input file, the notebook file, and Yaml and plaintext files detailing the `conda` setup used to create the environment. I can set up a Notebook Viewer if that would be helpful, though I think that requires hosting the notebook somewhere like in a GitHub repo. **Files:**; [Input file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-oDBQo4RlSvzS4Ved7oRWTpetGBzgF1/view?usp=sharing); [Notebook file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1se_HHE1YcwhwEsrihEeFq2llPNtEo9xc/view?usp=sharing); [YAML file for conda](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cFovrs1n3A3ap-n9TDjvcJCXtQvNkRSY/view?usp=sharing) (made via `conda env export --name ENVNAME > envname.yml`); [TXT file for conda](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vi96YXfesiLvO9lvm7fPix8CY3s4JDlS/view?usp=sharing) (made via `conda list --explicit > pkgs.txt`, so this is OS-specific). **Text version of code:**; ```; import ROOT as rt; # ipywidgets for nice visualizations, as per tutorial setup; !jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension; # now let's enable JsMVA; %jsmva on. outputFile = rt.TFile( ""TMVA.root"", 'RECREATE' ); rt.TMVA.Tools.Instance(); factory = rt.TMVA.Factory(""TMVAClassification"", TargetFile=outputFile,; V=False, Color=True, DrawProgressBar=True, Transformations=[""I"", ""D"", ""P"", ""G"", ""D""],; AnalysisType=""Classification""). dataset = ""tmva_class_example"" #the dataset name; loader ",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6657

I'm basically able to follow the structure of this example, but I run into issues when calling `TMVA.DataLoader.AddSignalTree()`. Since I'm working with a Jupyter notebook, I'll provide a plaintext version of the code below, followed by the error, but I'm also including links to the relevant files for running this -- the input file, the notebook file, and Yaml and plaintext files detailing the `conda` setup used to create the environment. I can set up a Notebook Viewer if that would be helpful, though I think that requires hosting the notebook somewhere like in a GitHub repo. **Files:**; [Input file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-oDBQo4RlSvzS4Ved7oRWTpetGBzgF1/view?usp=sharing); [Notebook file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1se_HHE1YcwhwEsrihEeFq2llPNtEo9xc/view?usp=sharing); [YAML file for conda](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cFovrs1n3A3ap-n9TDjvcJCXtQvNkRSY/view?usp=sharing) (made via `conda env export --name ENVNAME > envname.yml`); [TXT file for conda](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vi96YXfesiLvO9lvm7fPix8CY3s4JDlS/view?usp=sharing) (made via `conda list --explicit > pkgs.txt`, so this is OS-specific). **Text version of code:**; ```; import ROOT as rt; # ipywidgets for nice visualizations, as per tutorial setup; !jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension; # now let's enable JsMVA; %jsmva on. outputFile = rt.TFile( ""TMVA.root"", 'RECREATE' ); rt.TMVA.Tools.Instance(); factory = rt.TMVA.Factory(""TMVAClassification"", TargetFile=outputFile,; V=False, Color=True, DrawProgressBar=True, Transformations=[""I"", ""D"", ""P"", ""G"", ""D""],; AnalysisType=""Classification""). dataset = ""tmva_class_example"" #the dataset name; loader ",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6657

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6755:1146,Availability,fault,fault,1146," is set in the rootrc file. ### To Reproduce; 1. Set `OpenGL.CanvasPreferGL: 1` in rootrc file.; 2. In an interactive root session:. `(new TLatex(0.1, 0.3, ""#epsilon""))->Draw()`. leads to garbage being printed in the canvas. Other Greek letters, including #varepsilon, work fine, as does the problematic code when using `OpenGL.CanvasPreferGL: 0` instead. ### Setup; 1. ROOT version: 6.22/02; 2. Operating system Ubuntu 18.04.4; 3. How you obtained ROOT: built it myself. I find the same behaviour on an Arch Linux system. ### Additional context. The letter epsilon was found to be problematic before: [(ROOT-2048)](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-2048). As a workaround, using #varepsilon works fine, but according to the [TLatex](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTLatex.html) documentation, #epsilon is a valid symbol, so at the very least, the documentation should be changed. Sometimes, not always, modifying the canvas that contains the #epsilon symbol, e.g. by resizing it, leads to a segmentation fault:. ```; #5 0x00007ff3298dd7e9 in FTCharmap::GlyphListIndex(unsigned int) () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libftgl.so.2; #6 0x00007ff3298dfc9d in FTGlyphContainer::Glyph(unsigned int) const () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libftgl.so.2; #7 0x00007ff3298e494b in FTFontImpl::CheckGlyph(unsigned int) () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libftgl.so.2; #8 0x00007ff3298e5435 in FTFont::BBox(char const*, int, FTPoint, FTPoint) () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libftgl.so.2; #9 0x00007ff329eac7a4 in TGLFont::BBox(char const*, float&, float&, float&, float&, float&, float&) const () from /home/henning/Software/root-6.22.02/lib/libRGL.so; #10 0x00007ff329eacf36 in TGLFont::Render(char const*, double, double, double, double) const () from /home/henning/Software/root-6.22.02/lib/libRGL.so; #11 0x00007ff329ee2911 in void TGLPadPainter::DrawTextHelper<char>(double, double, char const*, TVirtualPadPainter::ETextMode) () from /home/henning/Software/root-6.22.02/lib/libRGL.so; #12 0",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6755

This is very inefficient, but still a feature that users regularly request and there has been an [open issue in iminuit about it for a long time, now closed](https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit/issues/104). Originally this was supposed to use MnScan from C++ Minuit2, but I found some severe problems with MnScan. I would like to discuss what we want MnScan to do, then I would be happy to work on a patch. ### What MnScan currently does. It does a 1D scan with 41 steps for each parameter in sequence, so it is not actually scanning the full hypercube. It first scans one parameter, then starts the scan of the second parameter from the best value of the first and so on. Instead of a full 2D scan, it does something like this:; ```; y; B; y; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx A xxxxxx; y; y; ```; where A and B are the minima along the x and y axis respectively. This approach has the advantage that the number of function evaluations scales like with k * n, where k is the number of dimensions and n the number of steps per dimension, while a full grid search scales like n ^ k. However, this approach will fail miserably when x and y are correlated, trying this on the Rosenbrock function for instance gives terrible results (basically no improvement with respect to the starting value). ### What to do?. The current behavior of MnScan is not what people usually consider a scan, which most people understand as a full grid search over the whole N-dimensional space. It seems that MnScan is not really used in ROOT, but I may be mistaken. If it is not really used, I would suggested to keep the name MnScan and change the implemenation to do a full hypercube scan.

If MnScan has a use case that I am not aware of, then I propose to add a new Minimizer, MnHyperScan (or similar name), which implements the full scan. ### Other issues with current MnScan. - One cannot configure the number of steps taken per dimension when MnScan is called through the minimizer interface (MnApplication). The maxcalls option should be used for this.; - A gradient and second derivatives are computed for the starting values, only to be discarded. This is wasteful.; - The scan returns EDM = 0, which is very misleading. It should either return inf or NaN, to indicate that the EDM is invalid.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6862:2267,Modifiability,config,configure,2267,"his:; ```; y; B; y; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx A xxxxxx; y; y; ```; where A and B are the minima along the x and y axis respectively. This approach has the advantage that the number of function evaluations scales like with k * n, where k is the number of dimensions and n the number of steps per dimension, while a full grid search scales like n ^ k. However, this approach will fail miserably when x and y are correlated, trying this on the Rosenbrock function for instance gives terrible results (basically no improvement with respect to the starting value). ### What to do?. The current behavior of MnScan is not what people usually consider a scan, which most people understand as a full grid search over the whole N-dimensional space. It seems that MnScan is not really used in ROOT, but I may be mistaken. If it is not really used, I would suggested to keep the name MnScan and change the implemenation to do a full hypercube scan. I am strongly convinced that MnScan should do a full grid search instead of what it currently does, because the current implementation is fairly pointless for most real-world functions which have correlations. If MnScan has a use case that I am not aware of, then I propose to add a new Minimizer, MnHyperScan (or similar name), which implements the full scan. ### Other issues with current MnScan. - One cannot configure the number of steps taken per dimension when MnScan is called through the minimizer interface (MnApplication). The maxcalls option should be used for this.; - A gradient and second derivatives are computed for the starting values, only to be discarded. This is wasteful.; - The scan returns EDM = 0, which is very misleading. It should either return inf or NaN, to indicate that the EDM is invalid. Ideally, a proper EDM should be calculated for the obtained minimum after the scan.; - MnScan always builds a vector of all the (parameter, function value) pairs obtained during the scan, but that vector is discarded after the run.

https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6889:425,Integrability,Interoperab,Interoperability,425,"Here is a suggestion for a class to input and output JSON data. It is _not_ meant for (`T`)object serialisation (there's `TBufferJSON` for that) - but for use cases where one wants to import or export JSON data into ROOT-based code. Examples could be . - Input and output of HEPData data. For example, one may want to read in some table via JSON and visualize, or one has produced a result one wants to upload to HEPData ; - Interoperability with Python. Python has support for many data format - not least JSON. . The attached class `TJSON` allows for this in a relatively straight forward manner. For example, one can do . ```c++; TJSON null;; TJSON b(true);; TJSON s(""RawString"");; TJSON s2(std::string(""C++String""));; TJSON i(42);; TJSON f(3.14);; TJSON a = TJSON::Array();; TJSON o = TJSON::Object();; ```; for null, boolean, string, numbers (int and float), arrays or objects (associative container). . A more complex object can be created like . ```c++ ; TJSON o2 = std::map<std::string,TJSON>{; {""key1"",""value""},; {""key2"",true},; {""key3"",; {""key4"", TJSON::Array(""This"",""is"",""an"",""array""),; ""key5"",; {""boolean"", true}; }; }; };; ```. and elements are accessed via `operator[]` . ```c++; assert o2[""key1""] == ""value"";; assert o2[""key3""][""key4""][1] == ""is""; ```. One can loop over arrays or objects via `TJSON::ArrayRange` or `TJSON::ObjectRange` respectively. . ```c++; TJSON a = TJSON::Array();; TJSON o = TJSON::Object();. for (size_t i = 0; i < 4; i++); a[i] = ""Test""+std::to_string(i);. o[""key0""] = ""value1"";; o[""key1""] = a;; o[""key2""] = 123;. std::cout << ""Array: "" << std::endl;; for (auto& e : a.ArrayRange()); std::cout << e << std::endl;. std::cout << ""Object: "" << std::endl;; for (auto& kv : o.ObjectRange()); std::cout << ""o["" << kv.first << ""] = "" << kv.second << std::endl;; ```. JSON can be read and written to streams . ```c++; std::cout << ""=== Loading ==="" << std::endl;; std::string s(""{\""key1\"":\""string\"",""; 		"" \""key2\"": true,""; 		"" \""key3\"": 1234,""; 		"" \""key4\"":null}"");.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6889

Although this fixes the problem for us, Philippe encouraged me to open up an issue to address this limitation. A slightly adjusted history of the relevant email correspondence is below. ----. Hi Kyle,. On the first user TFile destruction, the destructors is executed (in my case) on Thread 3 (see gdb output below) but the file is the current directory in Thread 1. The point where the file is opened and Thread 1's gDirectory is set is described in the stack trace below. It is likely that the problem is solved by adding:. TDirectory::TContext ctxt;. at the start of `art::RootIOPolicy::openAndReadMetaData`. This will insure that the new created file pointer is 'forgotten' by Thread 1's gDirectory and thus it should solve the problem. Cheers,; Philippe. ```; === gdb output.

RDataFrame has two tree friends.; Both tree friends have a branch with identical name.; Type of a branch in the 1st friend tree: XYZVector; Type of a branch in the 2nd friend tree: vector\<XYZTVector>. 1st friend tree is attached to RDataFrame before 2nd friend tree.; Access of 2nd friend tree branch results in error due to unexpected type of the branch assumed by RDataFrame as shown in the stand alone example bellow. ### To Reproduce. Run this stand alone example:. ```; import ROOT. vectors = '''; #include ""Math/Vector3D.h""; #include ""Math/Vector4D.h""; #include ""TFile.h""; #include ""TTree.h""; #include <vector>; using namespace ROOT::Math;; using namespace ROOT::VecOps;.

When testing the LLVM 9 PR for conda-forge and had a few issues with external LLVM/Clang/Cling so I temporarily switched to the builtins. This works from the build directory but it then has issues once `make install` is ran. More details are in the comment copied at the end of this issue. I think this is an issue with root's install commands rather than the conda-recipe, but you can reproduce what I'm doing it docker by running:. ```bash; git clone https://github.com/chrisburr/root-feedstock.git; cd root-feedstock; git checkout llvm90-install-error; # Adjust CPU_COUNT as required; CPU_COUNT=192 ./build-locally.py --debug --output-id '*root_base*' linux_64_numpy1.16python3.8.____cpython; # When the container launches, look at the output and run the suggested command; # which will be of the form:; cd xxxxx && source xxxxx/build_env_setup.sh; source $RECIPE_DIR/build_root-base.sh; # Anything with ROOT will now fail, e.g.; root; # Rather than waiting to build again, you can roll back to before; # ""make install"" was ran by running; cd ../..; rm -rf $PWD/*; cp -rp $PWD.bak/* $PWD/; cd -; ```. >The command I'm running was simply `root` to get the interactive prompt.

Your code that triggers the issue: at least a part; ideally something we can run ourselves.; 2. Don't forget to attach the required input files!; 3. How to run your code and / or build it, e.g. `root myMacro.C`, ...; -->; ROOT macro, save to graphvizMWE.C and run with `root graphvizMWE.C`:; ```; void graphvizMWE(void){; // Create a simple dependency tree; RooRealVar x{};; RooRealVar sigma{};; RooRealVar mu{};. RooGaussian Gaussian(""my_gaussian"", ""Gaussian"", x, mu, sigma);; RooGaussian GaussianWithSpace(""my gaussian"", ""Gaussian"", x, mu, sigma);. // Create GraphViz trees; Gaussian.graphVizTree(""tree_example.dot"");; GaussianWithSpace.graphVizTree(""tree_example2.dot""); // Produces invalid output; }; ```; Then attempt to convert the produced `.dot` files to images using; `dot -Tpng tree_example.dot -o example1.png # Produces an image`; `dot -Tpng tree_example2.dot -o example2.png # Error!`. The first of these will produce a .png image, the second will fail with a message like: `Error: tree_example2.dot: syntax error in line 1 near 'gaussian'`. Can be fixed by enclosing the graph title in quotes: i.e. changing line 1 of `tree_example2.dot` from; `digraph my gaussian{`; to; `digraph ""my gaussian""{`. ### Setup; <!--; 1. ROOT version; 2. Operating system; 3.

I have cross-checked this new functionality with the `fastjet::pseudojet::delta_R` implementation and an internal ATLAS one, which all give the same results when performing the rapidity-based calculation. Please let me know if I have violated any contribution guidelines, and I will update this PR accordingly!. 🍻 Matt",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7087

The purpose of this PR is to show which private members I had to make public to access RNTuple in a BulkIO style.

I hope this goes in the good direction. I still have to see how I can cover all the changes with tests, so this is a draft PR for now. The most controversial part is probably the `_offset` subtraction: https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooNLLVar.cxx#L454. It originally looked like this:. ```C++; Double_t y = -_offset - (carry + _offsetCarry);; Double_t t = result + y;; carry = (t - result) - y;; result = t;; ```. I'm not sure if that works. By definition, `_offset` is in the same order of magnitude as `result`, so the `carry + _offsetCarry` is lost when adding it with `_offset`, no? I think to subtract KahanSums of the same order of magnitude, one should better add the sums and carries individually and then make a dummy addition such that the carry can ""spill over"" into the sum if it got large enough after addition:. ```C++; KahanSum<T, N>& operator-=(KahanSum<T, N> const& other) {; fSum[0] -= other.Sum();; fCarry[0] -= other.Carry();; // add zero such that if the summed carry is large enough to be partly represented in the sum, it will happen; Add(T{});; return *this;; }; ```. @lmoneta",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7126
