(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded.

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14127:748,Energy Efficiency,schedul,scheduler,748,"Here's a diff of `hailctl dataproc start foo --dry-run` on main and on this branch. Notice that the properties and metadata arguments gain a leading and trailing single quote. This ensure that things like `sys_platform!=""win32""` are properly transmitted. In `start.py` we just use exec-style invocation, so there's no equivalent issue. ```; 7c7; < --properties=^|||^spark:spark.task.maxFailures=20|||spark:spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Xss4M|||spark:spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-Xss4M|||spark:spark.speculation=true|||hdfs:dfs.replication=1|||dataproc:dataproc.logging.stackdriver.enable=false|||dataproc:dataproc.monitoring.stackdriver.enable=false|||spark:spark.driver.memory=36g|||yarn:yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb=29184|||yarn:yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb=14592|||spark:spark.executor.cores=4|||spark:spark.executor.memory=5837m|||spark:spark.executor.memoryOverhead=8755m|||spark:spark.memory.storageFraction=0.2|||spark:spark.executorEnv.HAIL_WORKER_OFF_HEAP_MEMORY_PER_CORE_MB=3648 \; ---; > '--properties=^|||^spark:spark.task.maxFailures=20|||spark:spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Xss4M|||spark:spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-Xss4M|||spark:spark.speculation=true|||hdfs:dfs.replication=1|||dataproc:dataproc.logging.stackdriver.enable=false|||dataproc:dataproc.monitoring.stackdriver.enable=false|||spark:spark.driver.memory=36g|||yarn:yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb=29184|||yarn:yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb=14592|||spark:spark.executor.cores=4|||spark:spark.executor.memory=5837m|||spark:spark.executor.memoryOverhead=8755m|||spark:spark.memory.storageFraction=0.2|||spark:spark.executorEnv.HAIL_WORKER_OFF_HEAP_MEMORY_PER_CORE_MB=3648' \; 9c9; < --metadata=^|||^WHEEL=gs://hail-30-day/hailctl/dataproc/dking-dev/0.2.126-a51eabd65859/hail-0.2.126-py3-none-any.whl|||PKGS=aiodns==2.0.0|aiohttp==3.9.1|aiosignal==1.3.1|async-timeout==4.0.3|attrs==23.1.0|avro==1.11.3|azure-common==1.1.28|azure-core==1.29.5|azure-identity==1.15.0|azure-mgmt-core==1.4.0|azure",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14127

There should now be a bsp icon (two bars with two arrows between them) on the right, where the gradle elephant used to be. Just like before, sometimes you'll need to click the ""reload"" icon in there if things get wonky.; * if it says ""scalafmt configuration detected"", go ahead and enable the formatter. ## Metals setup. * delete any `.metals` directories; * open the hail repo in VSCode (even if you won't use VSCode, this seems to be the best way to get metals set up initially); * it should ask you to import a Mill build; * when that finishes, at the bottom it should say it's connected to a Bloop build server. In general, I think using Mill as the BSP directly will work best, but I don't have much experience to say for sure. To switch, run `Metals: switch build server` from the command palette. ## Debug and release builds. As before, debug mode adds some (fairly expensive) checking to our native memory system. But now there are a few other differences:; * treat warnings as errors only in release mode, so you can still compile, run tests, etc. during development without fixing all warnings; * enable optimization in scalac only in release mode. The intention is that we use debug mode during development, and release mode ony for published artifacts, or performance profiling. Mill will use debug mode by default. To enable release mode, define `HAIL_RELEASE_MODE` in your environment.

To switch, run `Metals: switch build server` from the command palette. ## Debug and release builds. As before, debug mode adds some (fairly expensive) checking to our native memory system. But now there are a few other differences:; * treat warnings as errors only in release mode, so you can still compile, run tests, etc. during development without fixing all warnings; * enable optimization in scalac only in release mode. The intention is that we use debug mode during development, and release mode ony for published artifacts, or performance profiling. Mill will use debug mode by default. To enable release mode, define `HAIL_RELEASE_MODE` in your environment.

Interesting thing is, when I tried to convert the exactly same data in local computer using singularity instead of docker, it worked. Also, for the the other chromosomes with less variants but same samples, such as chr13, it worked well in Terra.

Note, it is not possible yet to create jobs within the new job groups. The only non-straightforward part of how this turned out is the `batch_updates` table copies the previous `start_job_id` and `start_job_group_id` with `n_jobs = 0` or `n_job_groups = 0` if there are none in that update. I think it's fine to do this, but I did need to remove a unique constraint on `(batch_id, start_job_id)`. I tried to find any instances where we use that index, but couldn't find any.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded.

For example: https://batch.hail.is/batches/8115834/jobs/1. This should at least be visible on the job page and should perhaps also be visible on the batch page.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again.
