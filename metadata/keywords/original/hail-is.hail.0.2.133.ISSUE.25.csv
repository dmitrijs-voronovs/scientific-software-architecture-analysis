I suspect our average VM count in a month is closer to 10 which is within the free tier (340 MiB). I; might be wrong abou the connections per vm per aggregation interval, but this is straightforward to; monitor once we have the logs. For a sense of the cost landscape, these are all free:. 1. 1000 VMs.; 2. 500 VMs, with a sampling rate of 1.; 3. 200 VMs, with a sampling rate of 1, with an interval of 5 minutes.; 4. 10 VMs, with a sampling rate of 1, with an interval of 30 seconds. It's all linear, so if we need to halve the interval we can either change the sampling rate, reasses; our expected number of VM-hours, or adjust the service fee accordingly. We can also assess the landscape of fees necessary to cover costs (ignoring the free 50 GiB):. 1. 15 minute intervals, 0.5 sampling rate, 100 expected connections per vm per interval: 0.0000008; USD per core per hour. 2. 30 second intervals, 1.0 sampling rate, 100 expected connections per vm per interval: 0.00005 USD; per core per hour. 2. 5 second intervals, 1.0 sampling rate, 100 expected connections per vm per interval: 0.0003 USD; per core per hour. 2. 5 second intervals, 1.0 sampling rate, 1000 expected connections per vm per interval (1000 unique; connections per second honestly seems to me quite remarkable performance): 0.003 USD per core per; hour. ```; USD_per_core_per_hour = bytes_per_hour / vms / 1024. / 1024 / 1024 * 0.5 / 16. print(USD_per_core_per_hour); ```. ---. # Conclusion. I think we're safe to enable this with the parameters in this PR (15 minute intervals, 50%; sampling). We can assess unknown parameters, like connections per vm, and get comfortable looking at; these logs. Security constraints or observability demands may push us towards desiring more logs. If that; occurs, we can assess the need for a new fee. Regardless, this fee appears to be small relative to; the current cost of preemptible cores.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12883

There were a lot of issues in this file that I tried to clean up. The mypy errors are now just things that are poorly typed by Bokeh. I also changed how manhattan plot hides irrelevant tooltip information. I made it an explicit argument to the `_get_scatter_plot_elements`. I verified the plots in the GWAS Tutorial look the same by eye. I also verified the tooltips look the same with a few spot checks. I also built the docs to ensure those were fine.,MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12927

If you use the log4j1 programmatic reconfiguration system, you will break log4j2 for you and everyone else. The only way to recover from such a breakage is to use the log4j2 programmatic reconfiguration system. Changes in this PR:. 1. Include JVM output in error logs when the JVM crashes. This should help debugging of JVM crashing in production until the JVM logs are shown on a per-worker page. 2. JVMEntryway is now a real gradle project.

The `assert` keyword is an unfortunate language wart that makes it very easy for developers to write error-checking code that is itself incorrect. I'd encourage considering the alternate pattern `if error_condition: raise AssertionError(...)` and gradually migrating the codebase off of bare asserts.

AssertionError: ; ```. I'm a new Hail user and don't have the full context here, but it seems like there are at least three problems:. 1. An assert failed in production code, which indicates either the presence of a bug or an incorrect use of assert (e.g. using assert to check for value errors).; 2. The assert has no corresponding error message, so the user learns that something has gone wrong but can't easily tell what.; 3. The assert is bare. Bare asserts can get optimized out of code in ways that are difficult to foresee in advance, and are generally deprecated in favor of the `if error_condition: raise AssertionError(...)` pattern (see: https://discuss.python.org/t/stop-ignoring-asserts-when-running-in-optimized-mode/13132). **The Big Picture**. The bare assert pattern is used over 3k times in Hail. To be fair, many of these usages occur in test directories, where they're fine. But they also occur in application code, and often in the dangerous form `assert(expr1, expr2)` which will never fail (because a tuple with two falsy elements is truthy in python). These asserts are never actually getting checked. . Fixing all of them would be a heavy lift. One compromise solution might be to add a bare assert rule to the linter (e.g. https://pypi.org/project/flake8-assert-msg/). This would prevent the introduction of further bare asserts to the ",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12952

It also relaxes the restriction that both of the `GCPUserCredentials` and `AzureUserCredentials` need to conform to the same `cloudfuse_credentials` interface.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12962

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12983:470,Safety,safe,safe,470,"### What happened?. On the driver (but this could happen anywhere), a `read` call failed in GoogleStorageFS. In particular line 205:; ```; if (reader != null) {; reader.read(bb); } else {; ```; We don't retry transient errors here or below in the other call to `read`. We only retry on the initial creation of the stream. I think we are concerned that the stream is in a bad state, possible advanced a few bytes. If we were to read from it, we might drop some data. The safe thing to do is to `seek` to the correct position. This will likely initiate a new HTTP request to GCS, which is fine, because we almost certainly lost the old connection due to the transient error. I also think we need to remove `lazyPosition`. I think we can achieve the requester pays nonsense by just relying on the `pos` from the parent class (see FS.scala). ### Version. 0.2.115-71fc978b5c22. ### Relevant log output. ```shell; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/reanalysis/summarise_clinvar_entries.py"", line 531, in <module>; main(subs=args.s, date=processed_date, variants=args.v, out=args.o); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/reanalysis/summarise_clinvar_entries.py"", line 505, in main; parse_into_table(json_path=temp_output, out_path=out); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/reanalysis/summarise_clinvar_entries.py"", line 439, in parse_into_table; ht.write(out_path, overwrite=True); File ""<decorator-gen-1106>"", line 2, in write; File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/hail/typecheck/check.py"", line 584, in wrapper; return __original_func(*args_, **kwargs_); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/hail/table.py"", line 1392, in write; Env.backend().execute(ir.TableWrite(self._tir, ir.TableNativeWriter(output, overwrite, stage_locally, _codec_spec))); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/hail/backend/service_backend.py"", line 490, in execute; return self._cancel_on_ctrl_c(self._async_execute(ir, timed=timed)); File",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12983

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12983:886,Testability,log,log,886,"### What happened?. On the driver (but this could happen anywhere), a `read` call failed in GoogleStorageFS. In particular line 205:; ```; if (reader != null) {; reader.read(bb); } else {; ```; We don't retry transient errors here or below in the other call to `read`. We only retry on the initial creation of the stream. I think we are concerned that the stream is in a bad state, possible advanced a few bytes. If we were to read from it, we might drop some data. The safe thing to do is to `seek` to the correct position. This will likely initiate a new HTTP request to GCS, which is fine, because we almost certainly lost the old connection due to the transient error. I also think we need to remove `lazyPosition`. I think we can achieve the requester pays nonsense by just relying on the `pos` from the parent class (see FS.scala). ### Version. 0.2.115-71fc978b5c22. ### Relevant log output. ```shell; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/reanalysis/summarise_clinvar_entries.py"", line 531, in <module>; main(subs=args.s, date=processed_date, variants=args.v, out=args.o); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/reanalysis/summarise_clinvar_entries.py"", line 505, in main; parse_into_table(json_path=temp_output, out_path=out); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/reanalysis/summarise_clinvar_entries.py"", line 439, in parse_into_table; ht.write(out_path, overwrite=True); File ""<decorator-gen-1106>"", line 2, in write; File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/hail/typecheck/check.py"", line 584, in wrapper; return __original_func(*args_, **kwargs_); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/hail/table.py"", line 1392, in write; Env.backend().execute(ir.TableWrite(self._tir, ir.TableNativeWriter(output, overwrite, stage_locally, _codec_spec))); File ""/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/hail/backend/service_backend.py"", line 490, in execute; return self._cancel_on_ctrl_c(self._async_execute(ir, timed=timed)); File",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12983
