Any ideas on how that could happen?. ```; public static String encode(List<Integer> alleleValues) {; return String.join("","", alleleValues.stream().map(i -> i.toString()).collect(Collectors.toList()));; }. protected static String makeRawAnnotationString(final List<Allele> vcAlleles, final Map<Allele, List<Integer>> perAlleleValues) {; final List<String> alleleStrings = vcAlleles.stream(); // does not replace a null value with zero list - only if the key is not in the map; .map(a -> perAlleleValues.getOrDefault(a, ZERO_LIST)); .map(StrandBiasUtils::encode); .collect(Collectors.toList());; return String.join(AnnotationUtils.ALLELE_SPECIFIC_RAW_DELIM, alleleStrings);. }. public static Map<String, Object> computeSBAnnotation(VariantContext vc, AlleleLikelihoods<GATKRead, Allele> likelihoods, String key) {; // calculate the annotation from the likelihoods; // likelihoods can come from HaplotypeCaller or Mutect2 call to VariantAnnotatorEngine; final Map<String, Object> annotations = new HashMap<>();; final ReducibleAnnotationData<List<Integer>> myData = new AlleleSpecificAnnotationData<>(vc.getAlleles(),null);; getStrandCountsFromLikelihoodMap(vc, likelihoods, myData, MIN_COUNT);; Map<Allele, List<Integer>> perAlleleValues = new LinkedHashMap<>(myData.getAttributeMap());; perAlleleValues.values().removeIf(Ob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6766#issuecomment-697902360

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6768#issuecomment-685866421:237,Availability,error,errors,237,"@audrysgp It looks like your `samtools view` command removes reads from chr2 but leaves the record for chr2 in the bam header. Then, when you run using the chr1 reference fasta, the GATK sees the discrepancy in sequence dictionaries and errors. There is no need to use `samtools view` before running GATK tools. Just run on the original bams and use the `-L` argument to specify an interval, in this case `-L 1`. Also, I notice that the Mutect2 command you're using is incorrect in several ways. The tutorial on the GATK forum: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360047232772--Notebook-Intro-to-using-Mutect2-for-somatic-data shows how to run Mutect2 optimally.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6768#issuecomment-685866421

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6780#issuecomment-684934864:469,Testability,test,test,469,God that method is so much worse than i thought... We resort to hard coding common side outputs that are likely to show up and mark them for deletion in case we happen to produce one of them... I wonder if it is indeed possible to flag a directory for deletion and if we cant improve that method by secretly putting the file you ask for into a delete-on-exit folder so we don't have to guess about indexes and side outputs (that frankly don't look complete? What if my test has a tmp-fast dict/index those aren't included in the list of side outputs to flag for deletion).,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6780#issuecomment-684934864

The problem is that you've got AMD libraries on a PowerPC machine. I don't; know if GATK makes PowerPC libraries available natively, but you should be; able to get the source code and compile it yourself. Note that this will not fix the problem of your machine architecture; lacking the AVX instruction set. That's a hardware issue. But it should; (okay, *might*) get rid of the warnings about missing .so files. As an aside, I'm curious whether PowerPC architecture has an instruction; set similar to AVX.

But it should; (okay, *might*) get rid of the warnings about missing .so files. As an aside, I'm curious whether PowerPC architecture has an instruction; set similar to AVX. This is something I might actually be able to; contribute to the project so I'm excited by the prospect!. -Dan.

Both will affect sensitivity to microbe detection, but I would generally recommend only adjusting the latter.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6818#issuecomment-705021856

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6854#issuecomment-701446008:31,Performance,perform,performs,31,"@RWilton The `HaplotypeCaller` performs two separate filtering passes on the read mapping qualities:. The first is in the `MappingQualityReadFilter`, and occurs before the `HaplotypeCaller` even sees the reads. This filtering pass can be controlled via the `--minimum-mapping-quality` argument you're using (and I can confirm that this argument is hooked up and does work as intended). The second pass is in `HaplotypeCallerEngine.filterNonPassingReads()`. This happens later (just before genotyping), and is hardcoded to filter out reads with mapping quality < 20. There is no way to control the mapping quality threshold in this second pass, as allowing reads with low mapping qualities into the genotyper would result in large numbers of false positive variant calls. You can confirm that the `--minimum-mapping-quality` argument for `MappingQualityReadFilter` works as intended by setting it to a value higher than 20, and inspecting the differences in the output.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6854#issuecomment-701446008

May I suggest, however, that MAPQ values less than 20 might not necessarily lead to an increase in FP variant calls? My understanding is that HaplotypeCaller uses MAPQ values only in a nonparametric rank sum test, in which case MAPQ is treated as an ordinal. This seems appropriate since the magnitude of a MAPQ value depends both on the data and on the computational model the read aligner uses to calculate it. With this in mind, a set of mappings with MAPQ in a lower range (e.g., ```--minimum-mapping-quality 10``` and a correspondingly lower ```--maximum-mapping-quality``` as well) might very well be appropriate for variant calling. So changing the semantics of ```MappingQualityReadFilter``` or parameterizing the currently-hardwired MAPQ range would enable additional control without affecting performance. @jamesemery I will watch for the HaplotypeCaller update that implements that functionality.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6854#issuecomment-701629283:908,Availability,error,errors,908,@RWilton There is not particular code I can point to that specifically should fall over. We filter out low MQ reads in large part because they are very likely to cause false positives corresponding to sequence from other regions on the genome and the current behavior for adjusting genotyper confidences based on mapping quality (which is accomplished by lowering the Base Qualities based on the MQ prior to the HMM step) doesn't work well enough especially at sites where there are many low MQ reads piled-up. It should be noted that based on how many sequencers work low MQ reads appear piled up in the thousands at a some commonly repeated sites in the genome and can easily drown out all of the other evidence unless you are careful. Keep an eye out for #6634 as it will include the argument you are asking about as well as providing an explicit model in the genotyper for mapping quality as a source of errors which will likely better handle high coverage + low MQ sites explicitly.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6854#issuecomment-701629283

It looks like the issue might be with the cram file itself - do you know how the file was created (GATK, etc. ?). Also, it would be interesting to know if GATK is able to consume the file without specifying query intervals (without -L).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6865#issuecomment-704956160

I added a set of methods to `PythonScriptExecutor` mirroring existing ones that return booleans. I tried to extract as much common code as possible. Also, because now the entry point in `ScriptExecutor` that return `ProcessOutput` does not process and throw any exceptions, I extracted that processing code and manually call it from `GermlineCNVCaller`. Let me know if you have a better idea on a better way to handle it. If that looks good to you, could you also suggest what unit tests you would like me to add?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6866#issuecomment-719058249

Probably should fail earlier in CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals, but it looks like bad behavior is ultimately prevented. For multiple samples with completely uncovered intervals and the relevant filters disabled, an exception is thrown when the SVD fails (unless the SVD is skipped by requesting `--number-of-eigensamples 0`, in which case behavior reverts to the above). Probably could fail a bit earlier here as well.

Ideally, we'd want to test that the exposure was done correctly through the 3 affected tools: HaplotypeCaller, Mutect2, and FilterAlignmentArtifacts. I can certainly take the approach outlined above and 1) on master, pick one or more integration tests for each tool, then generate results by changing the original unexposed constants and running on the relevant test data, 2) on this branch, commit those new results, then add corresponding versions of the integration tests that change the exposed inputs and check against the results. However, not sure if we'll want to clutter the repo with more test files just for this sort of exposing of constants, and such tests don't really feel complete anyway. So alternatively, I could probably write a script to do essentially the same thing and just check consistency between the branches for a bunch of randomly generated SW parameter values, perhaps also running on more substantial test files for each tool. I can document this process and then we can move on without committing any new tests or test files once we're satisfied that the exposure was done correctly. Or if you guys have additional suggestions, would be glad to hear them!. Finally, it looks like FilterAlignmentArtifacts doesn't have any integration tests for correctness---let me know if there are auxiliary tests we'd want to run there. Anyway, probably overthinking things, but the exposure was enough of a headache that I want to make sure I did it right.

""A hardware issue that intermittently affects only AVX operations"" is theoretically possible I suppose, but seems unlikely.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6910#issuecomment-719623951:742,Availability,failure,failures,742,"So - the reason I asked for batch size and number of samples was to figure out the number of ""fragments"" within the contig folder (each fragment is associated with a folder starting with ""__"" and then a long uuid type string). Each batch is associated with a fragment, so number of fragments should be:. unknown + 250/50 + 200/50 + ceiling(461/30) + ceiling(101/21) = unknown + 30. Where unknown is the number of fragments for the first import. The total number of fragments in the contig folder was 49. So unless the batch size for the first import was 6, there would seem to be a few extraneous fragments in the contig folder. All of which leads me to wonder if there is some corner case being missed by the code that deals with append job failures. That could be one reason why the number of fragments is higher than expected (and some fragments are incomplete). . One last thing that might help a bit is if you could share the timestamps for the folders immediately under the contig folder.

I understand what it's saying about the expected files within each fragment directory. So I could (and in the process of) counting the set of files per fragment. For our workspace, we expect 39 files/fragment. Checking the presence of those files is in the same lines as testing if __coords.tdb exists. The current state of this workspace seems to be that some contigs have more fragment folders than expected. at least some of these fragment folders have the expected number of files. is there nothing in the workspace that reports what fragments should exist? . Looking at this another way: can I run a SelectVariants on this workspace, requesting every sample that should exist?

It’s possible that you could edit the files manually so that you don’t have to rerun all GermlineCNVCaller shards; for example, you could check that all dictionaries in the output of the good shards (i.e., those that contain intervals that are correctly ordered with respect to either dictionary) are the correct dictionary used to generate the count files, reshard/reorder the intervals in the failing shards and rerun GermlineCNVCaller, then stitch everything back together with PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls.

Otherwise, I'd be inclined to enforce using the sequence dictionary in the shards (and ensuring the consistency check across shards is performed) by changing the null check in getBestAvailableSequenceDictionary to a check that the dictionary has not been set via the command line. EDIT^2: I think I misremembered the details of how #6330 hooked up the sequence dictionary and how getBestAvailableSequenceDictionary in GATKTool works (which probably explains why that comment was deleted...). Now that I actually go back and look, the `--sequence-dictionary` is not hooked up at all, so there is no change to revert in point 4!. Note that after all of this, it will *still* be possible to get into trouble at the gCNV step if you make funky shards (e.g., you could have shard 1 contain intervals from chr1 and chr3, and shard 2 contain intervals from chr2). I don't think it is possible to check for this case early, but you would still fail at PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls as above. Of course, all of these possibilities can be avoided by simply using the WDL, but it will be good to harden checks for those still working at the command line. @ldgauthier @droazen @mwalker174 what do you think?

I believe your GermlineCNVCaller results should have inherited the correct dictionary from the count files. The issue is you created some GermlineCNVCaller shards (e.g., shard 4) with inappropriately ordered intervals (since these were instead ordered w.r.t. to the idiosyncratic dictionary you attached). However, I think if you just reshard and rerun GermlineCNVCaller for any such shards, you may be able to reuse most of your results. For example, you could take your shard 4 interval list, which contains intervals from chr18, chr19, and chr1, and reshard these intervals into two shards: 4a containing chr18-19 intervals, and 4b containing chr1 intervals. After rerunning 4a and 4b through GermlineCNVCaller, you should be able to use PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls to stitch together shards 4b, 1, 2, 3, and 4a, since these will be ordered w.r.t. the correct dictionary from the count files (i.e, they will contain intervals in the order chr1, chr10-19). Of course, you will want not want to perform this exact procedure; you'll want to generalize it to whatever will yield the correct order for all 10 of your shards across all contigs. Again, this may be error prone and I can't guarantee that it will be successful, since I haven't tried it myself. I would personally just rerun the pipeline. You might be able to cut down on runtime by using smaller shards (I believe we typically shard the entire genome into far more than 10 shards, which we usually run in parallel) and making sure you set parameters appropriately for WGS. @mwalker174 has the most experience running on WGS and should be able to provide you the latest recommendations, or you might be able to find them by searching GitHub or the GATK Forums.

The most simple solution might be to add a feature context side input for the annotation in question but looking at how that code is threaded in the variant callers it would take a little bit of work to add it to those tools and probably introduce some complicated questions, (like for example: what is the correct featurecontext to send to annotate a variant that only covers one base of the site in question where the feature context object exists?). Its possible to do something like that for variant annotator a little bit more easily but i guess the question comes down to this: How generalized do you think this annotation will be? Does it need to be annotatable with variant annotator or could you write a separate tool that does the variant -> variant association and calculates the annotation without using the plugin framework?

I think it is ready for a review. To some other questions you had above:. 1) The HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>> can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place. I realize that's non-optimal, but this isnt anything I introduced here. I would really like to keep this PR as limited as we can, and address some larger refactoring in a different PR, once we've migrated to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart. 2) I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me.

One way to make this work would be for VariantEvalEngine to save the StratificationManager (or some version of this) to disk, perhaps serialized to JSON with Jackson. There would need to be a separate tool that takes N serialized StratificationManager objects, loads then, merges, and then writes the actual report. It's not completely implemented, but there is already a concept of combineStrats() in StratificationManager.

Thanks for filing the issue---I'm actually working on this at the moment. The gCNV python code requires some updating, since the APIs for inference changed after the pymc3 version we use (which is the primary reason we stuck with it). Because the changes required go beyond those in the PR you opened, I'll go ahead and close it, but thanks for making the effort to help us keep things updated! We certainly appreciate it. I would be surprised if updating numpy led to drastic performance improvements (1.17.5 was only released in 1/2020), but it's possible there have been improvements in the pymc3 python code. However, we are planning to move much of the python inference code over to pyro, for which the numpy upgrade is also necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6978#issuecomment-733001543

However, in the output block, the parameter has to have type `File` for the reverse reason; if it were `String`, it wouldn't be delocalized. The transformation is admittedly non-intuitive when reading the WDL code. Maybe there is some better alternative ?. The reason the parameter doesn't appear in the command block (in this case anyway) is because there is no corresponding tool parameter. Any `companion` files like this, such as input reference dictionary, input file index, etc., that don't appear as named tool parameters still have to be included in the WDL parameters, but aren't passed directly to the tool. I generally tried to keep the companion parameters adjacent to their source parameter whenever they appear in the WDL or JSON files, so they always travelled together. But since outputIndex is an *optional* companion for a *required* output, this results in it being listed under ""required"" parameters. We could separate the optional args into a separate ""Optional"" header comment as we do for (non-companinon) optional tool args, or we could just add a line comment like:; ```; # Required Arguments; String output_arg; String? outputIndex // optional companion for output_arg; ```.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7001#issuecomment-746495396:300,Usability,simpl,simply,300,@U201412486 Unfortunately it will still try to call OpticalDuplicates in that case correct (unless the regex doesn't apply to the reads correctly). Optical duplicate marking does not change the regular duplicate marking behavior and primarily gets included in the metrics so it should be possible to simply ignore the outputs. If you really want no reported Optical Duplicates you could also set the optical duplicates pixel distance to 0 (or -1) which should prevent anything from being marked as such since nothing will be in range to be counted.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7001#issuecomment-746495396
