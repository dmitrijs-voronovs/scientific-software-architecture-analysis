Of course the Pressure-drop gradient should be 0 but there are prob some numerical gains to be made. The Pressure-drop gradient is O(1e-5) where the others are O(1 - 1e4) so I consider that to be ok; 2.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1536:1079,Testability,log,logic,1079,"round first:. When a massflow is prescribed for periodic flow (`KIND_STREAMWISE_PERIODIC= MASSFLOW`), then a pressure drop is iterated(/adapted in each iteration) to fulfill that massflow requirement. In the Volume Source term only this pressure drop is used. The initial value at solver start is the value given in `STREAMWISE_PERIODIC_PRESSURE_DROP= ??` and for restarted/adjoint simulations the `STREAMWISE_PERIODIC_PRESSURE_DROP` from `flow.meta` is taken. Now this PR:. Until now, the update of the pressure drop, based on the difference between current and prescribed massflow, was done in the Flow solver Preprocessing. That causes some trouble as that routine is called multiple times during normal starts, restarts and even twice(!) for every normal iteration. So do not put any iterated quantities in those like I did. I now did put the update right in front of where it is used -> in the Source_Residual. Like so there shoulnd't be that much trouble of correct taping in that one iteration for the adjoint and it makes the logic of `Inner_iter/outer_iter==0` etc unnecessary. I am not sure the changes up until now are necessary but I am not sure whether they are enough tbh. I will update this description accordingly:. Update: So to give you an idea of the current state of gradient validation. My setup is the good'ol 2D periodic Pin case (fluid-only) with the Design variables being FFD-parameters only around the middle pin (so no Periodic Interface shenanigans up to now) and I have 4 OF: Avg_Temp and Drag on the middle-Pin Surface as well as the Pressure-drop between In/outlet plus massflow through in- OR outlet (which is the same in value but maybe not for the gradient :thinking: ):; 1.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1550:849,Availability,error,error,849,"## Proposed Changes; change limiter to enum class. . Note: For some reason this fixes a problem for the species transport, where the discrete adjoint solver would stop in computelimiters.hpp with the message ""unknown limiter type"". This only happens when a computation is run over more than one node (more than one core is OK though). This is because in CSolver::SetSolution_Limiter, GetKind_SlopeLimit() does not return a valid value for an existing slope limiter. Kind_SlopeLimit is set in CConfig::SetKind_ConvNumScheme, called in CConfig::SetGlobalParam, but this looks OK to me. . I did just notice that in CConfig:: line 3454 we check for MUSCL_Flow, MUSCL_Turb and MUSCL_AdjFlow and MUSCL_AdjTurb, but not for MUSCL_Species or MUSCL_Adj_Species(does not even exist). It looks like there is still something missing here.

This issue is a follow-up of a discussion here: https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2/241889-rotating_frame-grid-velocity-correct-flow-physics-wrong.html. Summary: To calculate an aircraft during pitch-up as a steady Euler simulation, I use the dynamic / moving mesh module with GRID_MOVEMENT= STEADY_TRANSLATION and/or ROTATING_FRAME and set the farfield mach number = 0.0.

Using the FAN_FACE_MACH boundary condition, which is implemented in the `CEulerSolver.cpp`, the `Inflow_Mach_old` returned is 0.0, causing the computation of the updated pressure to be incorrect. In practice, this drives the pressure lower and lower until it becomes negative. To find this, I added debug statements to `SU2_CFD/src/solvers/CEulerSolver.cpp` where the FAN_FACE_MACH BC logic is to iterate on the outflow pressure. . // cout << endl << ""PRINTING DEBUG INFO FOR FAN_FACE_MACH"" << endl;; // cout << ""Rank = "" << rank << endl;; // cout << ""Kind_Engine_Inflow = "" << Kind_Engine_Inflow << endl;; // cout << ""Target_Inflow_Mach = "" << Target_Inflow_Mach << endl;; // cout << ""Inflow_Pressure_old = "" << Inflow_Pressure_old << endl;; // cout << ""Inflow_Mach_old = "" << Inflow_Mach_old << endl;; // cout << ""Inflow_Pressure_inc = "" << Inflow_Pressure_inc << endl;; // cout << ""Inflow_Pressure = "" << Inflow_Pressure << endl;. which resulted in the output:.

Unfortunately, I have yet to install a working parallel version to run this tutorial. A solution to avoiding some of these installation issues would be to set up this environment within a singularity container. I found a singularity container definition for an old version of SU2 in #738 and modified the su2.def file to read:. Bootstrap: docker; From: ubuntu:19.04; ; %post; apt-get -y update; apt-get -y install python3 git build-essential autoconf python-dev libopenmpi3 openmpi-common; git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/su2code/SU2; cd SU2; ./meson.py build -Denable-autodiff=true -Denable-directdiff=true --prefix=$PWD; ./ninja -C build install; ; %runscript; exec /SU2/bin/$1 $2 . This code raises the following error after running . FATAL: Unable to build from su2.def: while parsing definition: su2.def: invalid selection(s) specified:. I understand this is an issue stemming from singularity and how I defined the definition file, but I was wondering if there was any supported singularity container for running SU2 that supports AD and parallel computing?.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1669:230,Availability,down,downward,230,"**Describe the bug**; *Reference case and expectations*; After many, many tries, the Caradonna-Tung test case seems to ""converge"" towards a non-physical solution. The flow creates a vortex around the blade instead of generating a downward jet as one can expect (https://www.nas.nasa.gov/SC08/v22_2.html). The case simulates a propeller with a compressible Euler solver. *Main issue*; The outlet, pressure outlet, or farfield boundary conditions seems to destabilize after some iterations due to the high speed gradient on the outlet face. To get into more details, there is a vortex forming ring forming near of the outlet creating a inflow at the center. The BC seems to build on this inflow up to a point where the flow destabilizes the solution and diverges or pushes the flow to make a ring around the propeller. *Case setup and context*; To put some context the current case tries to simulate the flow-field generated by a blade/propeller in a hover state in order to compute the thrust. The blade is surrounded by a cylinder. The markers for each surfaces are:; -""inlet"" for the top of the cylinder; -""farfield"" for the sides of the cylinder; -""outlet"" for the bottom of the cylinder. The blade has been divided into 4 surfaces which have the following self explanatory marker names:; - ""propellerUpperSurface""; - ""propellerLowerSurface""; - ""propellerRightTip""; - ""propellerLeftTip"". Many combinations of the possible boundary conditions setup were tested for the ""inlet"", ""farfield"" and ""outlet"" markers. Furthermore the Inlet BC were tried with many different vertical speeds (vx=0/0.001/0.01/0.1/1/10). Simulations with the inlet, farfield and outlet as TOTAL_INLET, FARFIELD, OUTLET and EULER and some (not all) combination between these BC were tried. The mesh was generated with Salome-Meca. It is a tetrahedral mesh. I have a script that permits to change the domain size with ease.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1669:100,Testability,test,test,100,"**Describe the bug**; *Reference case and expectations*; After many, many tries, the Caradonna-Tung test case seems to ""converge"" towards a non-physical solution. The flow creates a vortex around the blade instead of generating a downward jet as one can expect (https://www.nas.nasa.gov/SC08/v22_2.html). The case simulates a propeller with a compressible Euler solver. *Main issue*; The outlet, pressure outlet, or farfield boundary conditions seems to destabilize after some iterations due to the high speed gradient on the outlet face. To get into more details, there is a vortex forming ring forming near of the outlet creating a inflow at the center. The BC seems to build on this inflow up to a point where the flow destabilizes the solution and diverges or pushes the flow to make a ring around the propeller. *Case setup and context*; To put some context the current case tries to simulate the flow-field generated by a blade/propeller in a hover state in order to compute the thrust. The blade is surrounded by a cylinder. The markers for each surfaces are:; -""inlet"" for the top of the cylinder; -""farfield"" for the sides of the cylinder; -""outlet"" for the bottom of the cylinder. The blade has been divided into 4 surfaces which have the following self explanatory marker names:; - ""propellerUpperSurface""; - ""propellerLowerSurface""; - ""propellerRightTip""; - ""propellerLeftTip"". Many combinations of the possible boundary conditions setup were tested for the ""inlet"", ""farfield"" and ""outlet"" markers. Furthermore the Inlet BC were tried with many different vertical speeds (vx=0/0.001/0.01/0.1/1/10). Simulations with the inlet, farfield and outlet as TOTAL_INLET, FARFIELD, OUTLET and EULER and some (not all) combination between these BC were tried. The mesh was generated with Salome-Meca. It is a tetrahedral mesh. I have a script that permits to change the domain size with ease.

The results did not match, which is not what I would have expected. . In SU2, I compute the drag force by multiplying CD with the non-dimensional factor written to the forces_breakdown file. For Paraview, I wrote a script which does the following to compute the drag force:; - Load surface flow solution for the wing surface; - Compute surface normals; - Compute Drag = -Pressure*(Normals_X * cos(AoA/180 * 3.1415) + Normals_Z * sin(AoA/180 * 3.1415)); - Integrate this over the whole wing surface to get the total drag force.

This seemed strange to me, so I investigated it and realized, that the CD in SU2 seems to be computed incorrectly in some cases. . During the investigation, I computed the drag force in Paraview based on the SU2 flow result and compared it to the drag force computed by SU2 both for the initial and the final optimization geometry. The results did not match, which is not what I would have expected. . In SU2, I compute the drag force by multiplying CD with the non-dimensional factor written to the forces_breakdown file. For Paraview, I wrote a script which does the following to compute the drag force:; - Load surface flow solution for the wing surface; - Compute surface normals; - Compute Drag = -Pressure*(Normals_X * cos(AoA/180 * 3.1415) + Normals_Z * sin(AoA/180 * 3.1415)); - Integrate this over the whole wing surface to get the total drag force. You can also find this Paraview script attached.; I validated the Paraview script for multiple simple testcases, for which SU2 and Paraview gave me exactly the same drag force. When I applied it to the initial optimization geometry, I however realized, that SU2 computes a drag force of 60.95 N while Paraview gets 143.6 N.

That is to say that after I followed the tutorial step by step without changing anything, I had the following terminal error : ""FGMRES orthogonalization failed, linear solver diverged"". I checked the source code and found a little contradiction between the configuration file of the tutorial and the implementation of the transitional model. As you can see in the configuration file, the turbulence intensity Tu is already specified in % so the factor 100 added to Tu in the code does not seem necessary. . ![configuration_file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109698292/180274079-ece0c6f6-4d64-4897-8e2d-abff41d30056.png); ![code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109698292/180274082-b2dbee2d-a0ea-4967-b33e-a698f61d7471.png). When I erased that factor 100 in the source code (SU2_CFD/include/numerics/turbulent/turb_sources.hpp) I was able to get the same results as displayed in the tutorial for the skin friction coefficient. .

Please describe.**; *A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]*. I would like to know if SU2 can run the discrete adjoint case for multizone problem of turbomachinery. I found; "" if (nZone != 1); SU2_MPI::Error(""The required solver doesn't support multizone simulations"", CURRENT_FUNCTION);"" in the code. I am currently working on the optimization of axial turbine stage. I have revised the code for ENTROPY_GENERATION and Total toal efficiency output in the history output file and run the tutorial case ""transonic_stator_2D"" using ""shape_optimization.py"" successfully. But I failed to run ""discrete_adjoint.py -f xxx.cfg"" for turbiens stage optimization, whist the flow simulation using ""SU2_CFD xxx.cfg"" runs successfully. Seem the currect develop version is not applicable to the problem. **Describe the solution you'd like**; *A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.*. May I ask for the implementation of multizone discrete adjoint solve for turbomachinery? Or if there is any solution for it.; I found the work from Vitale's paper in 2020 includes such capability in SU2 at https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/ feature_turbomachinery, yet I fail to run the multizone case. **Describe alternatives you've considered**; *A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.*.

At line 1135 in ""SU2_CFD/include/solvers/CFVMFlowSolverBase.inl"", the Normal vector has been negated for outward convention. While at line 1141, the UnitNormal vector is computed as:. UnitNormal [iDim]= -Normal[iDim] / Area,. where the UnitNormal vector is actually negated again, though the Normal vector is negated once and outward. And then this double-negated UnitNormal vector is employed to the whole computation of Symmetry BC, which will induce error to the ""ProjVelocity_i (line 1209)"" as well as ""V_reflected (1217)"" vector. In other BCs, the UnitNormal vector is negated only once.

These bottlenecks include a lack of flexibility, modularity, and robustness of the computational tools, as well as the potential startup development costs needed to implement and verify the MDAO features. The purpose of this work is to facilitate the coupling of SU2 with external structural codes (e.g. NASTRAN, TACS, Airbus structural suite Lagrange) for gradient-based aerodynamic shape and structural sizing optimization using dedicated frameworks (e.g. OpenMDAO). . Startup development costs include the creation of modular tools that are _designed to be driven_ by another framework like OpenMDAO, rather than _to drive execution_ themselves. However, leveraging those MDAO frameworks assumes that software codes and modules to be coupled exist, have appropriate data structures, execution and query APIs, and are wrapped in Python for flexibility and ease of use. The proposed changes were motivated with the goal of making SU2 more modular and flexible, particularly to facilitate its integration into large-scale MDAO frameworks.

The purpose of this work is to facilitate the coupling of SU2 with external structural codes (e.g. NASTRAN, TACS, Airbus structural suite Lagrange) for gradient-based aerodynamic shape and structural sizing optimization using dedicated frameworks (e.g. OpenMDAO). . Startup development costs include the creation of modular tools that are _designed to be driven_ by another framework like OpenMDAO, rather than _to drive execution_ themselves. However, leveraging those MDAO frameworks assumes that software codes and modules to be coupled exist, have appropriate data structures, execution and query APIs, and are wrapped in Python for flexibility and ease of use. The proposed changes were motivated with the goal of making SU2 more modular and flexible, particularly to facilitate its integration into large-scale MDAO frameworks.

Goder and Mark D. Maughmer ([10.2514/1.J052905](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.J052905)). This model incorporates a new transport equation to describe the growth of the maximum Tollmien-Schlichting instability amplitude in the presence of a boundary layer.; ; ## Related Work; This work will be set-up in the same way as the LM model is in https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1751 (which was also generally speaking how I had set up my own LM transition implementation) to make sure merging in a later stage will be easier. ## Roadmap; I am hoping to achieve a working implementation of the eN transition method. This work will be done as finishing part of my master thesis. We will have to see if I have time to completely finish the V&V phase due to time restrictions. I have already done quite some work on implementing and verifying the LM method on a private branch and results show mixed results, especially at higher Re numbers (mentioned also by Menter et all.). Thus the step is made to see how these LM results will compare to eN results. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply. You can fill this out after submitting the PR.

In one of the early commits (34b0464e898dd167d8a865f47aa630019a5978ac), a call to GetNodes() was added in `CFlowOutput::SetAnalyzeSurface` which calls the function `GetNodes()`. ```const auto flow_nodes = solver[FLOW_SOL]->GetNodes();```. There is an assertion in `GetNodes()` that further mandates the `CVariable` `base_nodes` to be set properly. However, in the FEM/DG solver, the `base_nodes` is defaulted to `nullptr` and we have workarounds in the FEM/DG sovler that does not require a call to `GetNodes()` in other parts of the code (we use elements instead of nodes, so the concept of nodes is not really well-defined in the FEM/DG solver). . At the moment, the develop branch will fail at this line if anyone attempts to use the FEM/DG solver. . E.g., Taking the `hom_euler/NACA0012_5thOrder` test case in the repo gives the following error message:; ```SU2_CFD: ../SU2_CFD/src/output/../../include/solvers/CSolver.hpp:230: const CVariable* CSolver::GetNodes() const: Assertion `base_nodes!=nullptr && ""CSolver::base_nodes was not set properly, see brief for CSolver::SetBaseClassPointerToNodes()""' failed.``` at the pre-processing stage before any computation is done.

Hence, a conditional operator is added to avoid this call for DG solvers. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*; @vdweide and I are working on a new version of the DG solver that needs this workaround anyway. This is just added for now in case anyone else wants to work on the current version of DG solver available. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

There are **two advantages:**. 1.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1806:1237,Usability,Guid,Guide,1237,"## Proposed Changes; This project aims to couple the free and open-source thermodynamics library CoolProp with SU2. There are **two advantages:**. 1. More accurate numerical results. ; CoolProp can provide accurate thermodynamics properties (P, T, rho, ect) of commone fluids by either extracting experiment data from published papers, or computing based on the state-of-the-art Helmholtz energy formulations. ; So, thermodynamics properties obtained from CoolProp should be more accurate than those obtained from Van der Waals or peng robinson gas model embedded in SU2. Also, the numerical results should be more accurate.; 2. More user-friendly; To use CoolProp feature, the ony input from the user is the name of fluid. Then all other thermodynamics can be provided by CoolProp.; %FLUID_MODEL = COOLPROP; %FLUID_NAME = nitrogen; ; ## Related Work; This project references the following work:; 1.the work of coupling 'Mutationpp' with SU2.; 4. the pull request of 'Feature nppr gas #1718'. ## PR Checklist. - [x] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [ ] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings.; - [x] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style (https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Style-Guide/).; - [x] Simulations with the following test fluids succeed: nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, MM.; - [x] Currently, this new feature is applied for only Euler flow.

https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1810:333,Modifiability,config,config,333,"## Proposed Changes; This branch implements the Langtry Menter transition model coupled to SA turbulence model (https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/sa_gamma_retheta_3eqn.html). It also includes the transition induced by crossflow effects through the LM2015 implementation (https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/langtrymenter_4eqn.html). The config options added are:. 1. KIND_TRANS_CORRELATION. It allows the selection among correlation models found in the literature for F_length and ReTheta_c variables. Values are MALAN, SULUKSNA, KRAUSE, MEDIDA_BAEDER, MEDIDA, MENTER_LANGTRY. It defaults to the MENTER_LANGTRY If the underlying turbulence model is SST or to MALAN in the case of SA. (Implemented); 2. HROUGHNESS. RMS value of roughness for LM2015 transition model. It defaults to 1e-6m. (Implemented); 3. CONVERTSA2SST.

The lower surface is represented on the left, whereas the upper surface is on the right. At the moment the wind tunnel walls have not been taken into account. This can explain the spanwise shift of the transition with respect to the experimental results. More results are incoming. . Please, any suggestions on how to clean up the code or on how to make it more efficient are very well accepted. . ## Related Work; Work is related to the PR #1751. It extends it to SA turbulence model and includes cross-flow effects (LM2015) and turbulence index computations. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

After I saw the example of the Adding Custom Source Terms to Euler Equations I modified the code like this:. ```; const auto dt = config->GetDelta_UnstTimeND();; su2double time = config->GetTime_Step() * dt;; su2double Alpha = config->GetAoA()*PI_NUMBER/180.0;; su2double Beta = config->GetAoS()*PI_NUMBER/180.0;; const su2double MachValue = config->GetMach();; su2double Mach = 2 * MachValue + 0.01 * sin(2 * PI_NUMBER * time);; ```. But during postprocessing I noticed that Mach becomes 2 * MachValue + 0 as the ""time"" could not be updated to the series of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4... So I'm wondering how I can build a mach that could change over time. I'm not sure what kind of syntax I should be using or how exactly to implement this mach term. . I am using SU2 7.3.1.
