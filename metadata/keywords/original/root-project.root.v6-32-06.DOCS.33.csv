Other significant feature improvements include:. Globally overloaded operators are now supported, and histogram unary; multiplication with scalar is mapped onto TH1.Scale.; Significant changes to equality and non-equality operators should make their; behavior more consistent across the board, and in particular globally overloaded; equality operators for STL iterators should work as expected (if a dictionary entry; is generated for them).; Global arrays of builtin types are now supported.; Added further mappings of operator converters for builtin types.; Individual methods can release the GIL, by setting the ""_threaded"" parameter; of the method to True.; Constructors need not be creators of new objects (controlled with their; ""_creates"" parameters).; Added access to TSelector protected data members in TPySelector.; Derivable Fitter base classes are added for use with ROOT::Fitter.; Special cases for RooFit are added to resolve a few specific overloading; problems.; A Python Warning is issued if a void* converter or executor is chosen out of; necessity (e.g. because dictionaries are missing).; A Python Warning is issued if keyword arguments are given (unsupported).

Other significant feature improvements include:. Globally overloaded operators are now supported, and histogram unary; multiplication with scalar is mapped onto TH1.Scale.; Significant changes to equality and non-equality operators should make their; behavior more consistent across the board, and in particular globally overloaded; equality operators for STL iterators should work as expected (if a dictionary entry; is generated for them).; Global arrays of builtin types are now supported.; Added further mappings of operator converters for builtin types.; Individual methods can release the GIL, by setting the ""_threaded"" parameter; of the method to True.; Constructors need not be creators of new objects (controlled with their; ""_creates"" parameters).; Added access to TSelector protected data members in TPySelector.; Derivable Fitter base classes are added for use with ROOT::Fitter.; Special cases for RooFit are added to resolve a few specific overloading; problems.; A Python Warning is issued if a void* converter or executor is chosen out of; necessity (e.g. because dictionaries are missing).; A Python Warning is issued if keyword arguments are given (unsupported).

In the mean time, knowing the; role TObject plays in collections can be helpful. In general you don't need to worry about TObject. Many ROOT; classes have TObject as an ancestor. In fact, collections themselves; are descendants of TObject. This makes it possible for collections to; contain other collections (subcollections) in a tree structure.

The build system has been extended to support out-of-source builds.; This means you can build different sets of binaries from one source tree, like:. mkdir root-debug; cd root-debug; ../root/configure --build=debug. The build system now supports cross compilation, where typically you need tools; like rootcint, rootmap, etc, to be compiled on the build platform to be able; to generate dictionaries for the target platform. ROOT has been ported to iOS. This port required the above mentioned; changes in the build system. To build ROOT for the iPhone/iPad sumilator do:. ./configure iossim; make. To build a native iOS armv7 version do:. ./configure ios; make. Both builds create a libRoot.a that can be used to create ROOT based iOS apps; (iOS does not allow apps to load non-system dynamic libraries at run time).; Some sample Xcode projects using ROOT will soon be made available.

In addition we added the linker option ""-Wl,--no-undefined"",; so you will get an error if symbols are unresolved.; Explicit linking is required by newer distributions, like Ubuntu 11.10,; that require all dependent shared libs to be specified when linking. They; also have default options set to dead strip shared libs that don't resolve; any symbols (equivalent to the MacOS X build changes described above). Core Libraries; TClonesArray. Introduce TClonesArray::ConstructedAt which; always returns an already constructed object. If the slot is being used for the; first time, it calls the default constructor otherwise it returns the object as; is (unless a string is passed as the 2nd argument to the function in which case,; it also calls Clear(second_argument) on the object).; This allows to replace code like:. for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) {; new(a[i]) TTrack(x,y,z,...);; ...; ...; }; ...; a.Delete(); // or a.Clear(""C""). with the simpler and more efficient:. for (int i = 0; i < ev->Ntracks; i++) {; TTrack *track = (TTrack*)a.ConstructedAt(i);; track->Set(x,y,z,....);; ...; ...; }; ...; a.Clear();. even in case where the TTrack class allocates memory. TClonesArray: update ExpandCreateFast to also reset the non-used slots; so that calling Clear (which does too much) is no longer necessary; when using ExpandCreateFast. New Thread Pool class. A first version of TThreadPool class has been introduced.; This class implements a Thread Pool pattern.; So far it supports only one type of queue - FIFO. Thread library. Reduces risk of internal dead lock by using a private internal lock to protect the internals of TThread, rather than using TThread::Lock. New header TThreadSlots.h to centralize and formalize the use of the TThread local memory slots amongst the ROOT packages. Global Variables. The global values gPad, gVirtualX, gInterpreter, gDirectory and gFile; are now all accessed via a static function of their respective class.

GLEW - The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library - has been added to; facilitate detection of OpenGL version and available extensions at; run-time. This will allow usage of advanced visualization techniques; while still allowing fall-back solutions to be used on systems not; supporting the required functionality. If GLEW and GLEW-devel packages; are detected during configure, the ROOT provided GLEW is not; built. See also:; http://glew.sourceforge.net/. Latest (1.3.3) version of gl2ps has been imported (we had 1.2.6; before). See http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/; for detailed change-log. New implementation of GL-in-TPad - instead of mixture of GL and; non-GL graphics in a pixmap all pad graphics (2D/3D) is now; done by OpenGL. To make this possible new TVirtualPadPainter,; TPadPainter, TGLPadPainter classes were introduced; and painting operations inside TPad class were modified to; use TVirtualPadPainter instead of TVirtualX.; TVirtualPadPainter is an abstract base class, interface for; drawing 2D primitives and pixmap management. TPadPainter is; a default, non-GL implementation, based on TVirtualX; (gVirtualX). TGLPadPainter is a GL; implementation. Currently, TGLPadPainter does not support; off-screen rendering (support for frame-buffer objects is planned). Current limitations:. The glpad can be saved only as PS now.; Several sub-pads with complex 3d geometry can be slow due to lack; of off-screen rendering which would allow for caching of resulting images. Future directions:. Use frame-buffer objects for off-screen rendering.; Support ""Save as"" png, jpg, pdf, etc.; With GLEW and GL-shading-language, use of hardware anti-aliasing and; shaders is possible. Prototype visualization of 5-dimensional distributions:. New option for TTree::Draw - ""gl5d"", for the case you have 5 and; more dimensional dataset.; Set of iso-surfaces created, 4-th dimension is used to select iso-level.; ""gl5d"" is now very similar to ""gliso"" option, but instead of; filling TH3 o",MatchSource.DOCS,graf3d/doc/v524/index.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/graf3d/doc/v524/index.html

After that it can be dragged around the screen, edited; or closed. TGLAxisPainter - reimplemented to completely separate; label and tick-mark positioning code from the rendering itself. TGLSAViewer - when exporting an image properly take into; account image extension if it was typed by the user. TGLFont now uses the same font-naming scheme as the rest; of ROOT (had to specify font-file names before). Overlay-object management has been improved. Allow clipping object to be fixed by user - until now it was updated; on every redraw. See TGLViewer::SetClipAutoUpdate(). Eve. TEveElement - add context-menu functions allowing the; source-object to be printed, dumped or exported to CINT. TEveTrack - added flag for locking of current; track-points - the track will not be re-extrapolated automatically; even when the extrapolation parameters are changed. TEveTrack - removed ALICE specific ImportXyzz(); functions for loading of kinematics, hits and clusters associated with; a track. These were calling macros that were not available in ROOT. Several improvements in rendering of coordinate axes; in TEveCaloLego and TEveProjectionAxes. New class TEveJetCone for display of circular and; elliptic jet-cones clipped to the calorimeter's inner surface. Add support for extraction of composite-shape tesselations. A new; class TEveGeoPolyShape has been introduced to make this; tesselation serializable. See example; in tutorials/eve/csgdemo.C. Generalize representation of EVE-window title-bar - it can be; modified to display user-provided icons, menus or buttons. TEveWindowPack now supports registration of sub-frames; with weights that determine relative sub-frame length along the pack's; major direction.

TGSplitFrame is a horizontally or vertically splittable composite frame. Once split, each part will contain a new TGSplitFrame, separated by a TGSplitter.; TGShapedFrame is a TGCompositeFrame on which a custom shape is applied, starting from a picture file, by taking its transparency mask, and then applying the picture as background.; TGEventHandler is a Base Event Handler class allowing to delegate event handling (a base class for GL event handlers). TGListTree. TGListTreeItem is now a base class and TGListTreeItemStd is the standard implementation (modification required by EVE).; Switched the icon and checkbox position in TGListTreeItem.; Added custom user control flags, with their getters and setters and three new signal methods (required by EVE).

Solves the bug #94028, TBrowser crash trying to browse sub-root-directories in memory. TGFSComboBox. Fix a problem when the current directory is similar to $ROOTSYS, for example with $ROOTSYS being /home/user/root and $PWD being /home/user/rootdev, only ""dev"" was displayed, stripping off $ROOTSYS; Properly handle backslashes as directory separators on Windows. TGFileDialog. Change the file name only if the selected entry is not a directory (as reported on the forum). TGMsgBox. Implemented ""Enter"" and ""Escape"" key handling in TGMsgBox (used as Ok and Cancel buttons, if they are there). TGTextEntry. Several issues with text selection and combination of cursor position and text alignment in text entries have been solved. TRootCanvas. A check has been added for the case where the canvas is embedded (e.g. in the browser), then the layout of the main frame has to be re-applied when showing/hiding the editor; Stay in the current (working) directory when using ""File -> Save as..."" from a canvas or from a text editor (as the file dialog changes the current directory). TFitParametersDialog. Implemented keyboard navigation (tab and shift+tab) between the different number entry fields of the dialog. TFitEditor. Layout improvements and removed useless text in message box. TTreeViewer. Fixed a problem with array names (e.g. fVertex[]) as reported on the forum). TGWin32. Fixed several resource leaks (including GDI & USER objects).

You can then use one of the constructors for fixed or; variable bin size and your desired dimension. These constructors append the; created TEfficiency object to the current directory. So it will be written; automatically to a file during the next TFile::Write; command.; Example 1: create a twodimensional TEfficiency object with 10; bins along X and 20 bins along Y:; ; TEfficiency* pEff = new TEfficiency(""eff"",""my efficiency;x;y;#epsilon"",10,0,10,20,-5,5);. You can fill the TEfficiency object by calling the Fill(Bool_t bPassed,Double_t x,Double_t y,Double_t z) method.; The boolean flag ""bPassed"" indicates whether the current event is a good; (both histograms are filled) or not (only fTotalHistogram is filled).; The variables x,y and z determine the bin which is filled. For lower; dimensions the z- or even the y-value may be omitted.; ; You can also set the number of passed or total events for a bin directly by using the SetPassedEvents or SetTotalEvents method.; If you already have two histograms filled with the number of passed and t",MatchSource.DOCS,hist/doc/v528/index.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/hist/doc/v528/index.html

The problem could be seen with a simple macro like the; following one:; ; {; TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas(""c1"", ""c1"",0,0,600,600);; c1->SetTheta(90.);; c1->SetPhi(0.0001);; gStyle->SetPalette(1);; TGraph2D *graph2d = new TGraph2D();; graph2d->SetPoint(0, 110, 110, 0.0);; graph2d->SetPoint(1, -80, 50, 1.0);; graph2d->SetPoint(2, -70, 40, 2.0);; graph2d->SetPoint(3,-110, -50, 3.0);; graph2d->SetNpx(9);; graph2d->SetNpy(9);; graph2d->Draw(""surf1"");; graph2d->SetLineWidth(2);; graph2d->Draw("" triw p0 same"");; }; . The X and Y vectors are normalized in order to compute the triangles.; The scale factor used was the same for the X and Y axis.; This generated problems (very long triangles instead of the obvious ones); in some cases when the X and Y axis had very different ranges. Having two; scale factors, one for the X axis and one for the Y axis, cures the problem. TGraph2D. In case all the points are in the same Z-plane Z0 (zmin = zmax), the graph; minimum is set to Z0-0.01*Z0 and the maximum to Z0+0.01*Z0. This; allow to make TGraph2D like:; ; {; double *x = new double[2];; double *y = new double[2];; double *z = new double[2];; x[0] = 6215.;; x[1] = 5542.;; y[0] = 3853.;; y[1] = 5270.;; z[0] = 2723.;; z[1] = 2723.;; TGraph2D * g = new TGraph2D(2, x, y, z);; g->Draw(""LINE"");; }; . TGraph2DPainter. When a TGraph2D was painted with the option TRI1 the; color distribution in case of log scale along the Z axis was wrong. THistPainter.

Implementing error recovery verifier - One of the most important parts in cling is the error recovery. The error recovery takes care of reverting clang's internal structures on error in the user input. For instance, user types int i; error_here;. int i should be reverted and the entire input should be invalidated. This is very complex because many implicit template instantiations could be triggered and so on. The idea of the future verifier is to serialize the AST with all the lookup structures (probably in pch or pcm), trigger an error causing a lot of things to happen in clang internally and serialize the new AST.

An ""idea"" can be a sketch of a development project, a functionality, a missing feature we would like to see in our tool.; A list that we propose is the following:. Ideas. Extending and improving the multiline input mode - The multiline mode has to figure out automatically whether the user's input is still incomplete. For example ""if (a < 0) {"" is not fully completed input. Cling should'n try to process the line but to be smart enough to understand that it should wait for continuation. Currently cling switches multiline mode only when there is trailing ""{"". It has to be extended to detect trailing +, unbalanced ',"" and so on. Implementing error recovery verifier - One of the most important parts in cling is the error recovery. The error recovery takes care of reverting clang's internal structures on error in the user input. For instance, user types int i; error_here;. int i should be reverted and the entire input should be invalidated. This is very complex because many implicit template instantiations could be triggered and so on. The idea of the future verifier is to serialize the AST with all the lookup structures (probably in pch or pcm), trigger an error causing a lot of things to happen in clang internally and serialize the new AST. The comparison with the old one must return perfect match. Enabling clang's static analyzer - coming soon. Enabling ObjectiveC/ObjectiveC++ support - coming soon.

Here are tasks that are on our todo lists since a while, but we still cannot manage to get them done. They are not difficult to implement and excellent for getting to know cling. If you find something interesting, please go ahead and get your hands dirty!; The list is prioritized in descending order:; Extending and improving the multiline input mode - The multiline mode has to figure out automatically whether the user's input is still incomplete. For example ""if (a < 0) {"" is not fully completed input. Cling should'n try to process the line but to be smart enough to understand that it should wait for continuation. Currently cling switches multiline mode only when there is trailing ""{"". It has to be extended to detect trailing +, unbalanced ',"" and so on.; Implementing auto completion - Clang has good interface for autocompletion which proposes possible completion options considering the current input.; Implementing error recovery verifier - One of the most important parts in cling is the error recovery. The error recovery takes care of reverting clang's internal structures on error in the user input. For instance, user types int i; error_here;. int i should be reverted and the entire input should be invalidated. This is very complex because many implicit template instantiations could be triggered and so on. The idea of the future verifier is to serialize the AST with all the lookup structures (probably in pch or pcm), trigger an error causing a lot of things to happen in clang internally and serialize the new AST.

Here are tasks that are on our todo lists since a while, but we still cannot manage to get them done. They are not difficult to implement and excellent for getting to know cling. If you find something interesting, please go ahead and get your hands dirty!; The list is prioritized in descending order:; Extending and improving the multiline input mode - The multiline mode has to figure out automatically whether the user's input is still incomplete. For example ""if (a < 0) {"" is not fully completed input. Cling should'n try to process the line but to be smart enough to understand that it should wait for continuation. Currently cling switches multiline mode only when there is trailing ""{"". It has to be extended to detect trailing +, unbalanced ',"" and so on.; Implementing auto completion - Clang has good interface for autocompletion which proposes possible completion options considering the current input.; Implementing error recovery verifier - One of the most important parts in cling is the error recovery. The error recovery takes care of reverting clang's internal structures on error in the user input. For instance, user types int i; error_here;. int i should be reverted and the entire input should be invalidated. This is very complex because many implicit template instantiations could be triggered and so on. The idea of the future verifier is to serialize the AST with all the lookup structures (probably in pch or pcm), trigger an error causing a lot of things to happen in clang internally and serialize the new AST.

Read more; Useful Links. CERN. Cling. Welcome to our interactive C++ interpreter, built on the top of LLVM and Clang libraries. Its advantages over the standard interpreters are that it has command line prompt and uses just-in-time (JIT) compiler for compilation. An interactive prompt is usually referred to as a read eval print loop or repl. Many of the developers (e.g. Mono in their project called CSharpRepl) of such kind of software applications name them interactive compilers.; . One of Cling's main goals is to provide contemporary, high-performance alternative of the current C++ interpreter in the ROOT project - CINT. The backward-compatibility with CINT is major priority during the development.; ; How to use it; You can start typing not only C++ top level declaratons but statements, too. ; **** Welcome to the cling prototype! ****; * Type C code and press enter to run it *; * Type .q, exit or ctrl+D to quit *; *****************************************; [cling]$.

Read more; Useful Links. CERN. Extensions. Cling has several additional features. The main reason for their implementation is to improve the interactivity of the prompt. We call them language extensions.; ; For instance, language extensions are:; Execution of statements and expressions on the fly - From user's point of view it would make much sense if functions could be called by typing the function name at the prompt. This is true for other handy operations like creation of objects. However, the operations that do it are classified as statements and expressions, entered on the global scope. Statements and expressions on the global scope are not allowed by the C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++ grammar. Cling's prompt allows entering statements and expression on the global scope as transforming them into proper language constructs. ; Easy print out of the execution results - The way of signaling that the user wants to see the result of the entered and executed code is done by omitting the semicolon in the end. The standard doesn't allow statements (except those that change the control flow - such as if, for, while) without semicolon (;) in the end. However, this appears to be really simple and useful language extension that improves the user-cling interplay. Imagine if you had to write printf every time that you want to see the result of a function call. .

The default mode of operation of AST Matchers visits all nodes in the AST,; even if they are not spelled in the source. This is; AsIs mode. This mode requires writing AST matchers; that explicitly traverse or ignore implicit nodes, such as parentheses; surrounding an expression or expressions with cleanups. These implicit; nodes are not always obvious from the syntax of the source code, and so this; mode requires careful consideration and testing to get the desired behavior; from an AST matcher. In addition, because template instantiations are matched in the default mode,; transformations can be accidentally made to template declarations. Finally,; because implicit nodes are matched by default, transformations can be made on; entirely incorrect places in the code.; For these reasons, it is possible to ignore AST nodes which are not spelled; in the source using the IgnoreUnlessSpelledInSource; mode.

No match found. Node Matchers. Node matchers are at the core of matcher expressions - they specify the type; of node that is expected. Every match expression starts with a node matcher,; which can then be further refined with a narrowing or traversal matcher. All; traversal matchers take node matchers as their arguments.; For convenience, all node matchers take an arbitrary number of arguments; and implicitly act as allOf matchers.; Node matchers are the only matchers that support the bind(""id"") call to; bind the matched node to the given string, to be later retrieved from the; match callback.; It is important to remember that the arguments to node matchers are; predicates on the same node, just with additional information about the type.; This is often useful to make matcher expression more readable by inlining bind; calls into redundant node matchers inside another node matcher:. // This binds the CXXRecordDecl to ""id"", as the decl() matcher will stay on; // the same node.; recordDecl(decl().bind(""id""), hasName(""::MyClass"")).

No match found. Node Matchers. Node matchers are at the core of matcher expressions - they specify the type; of node that is expected.

All; traversal matchers take node matchers as their arguments.; For convenience, all node matchers take an arbitrary number of arguments; and implicitly act as allOf matchers.; Node matchers are the only matchers that support the bind(""id"") call to; bind the matched node to the given string, to be later retrieved from the; match callback.; It is important to remember that the arguments to node matchers are; predicates on the same node, just with additional information about the type.; This is often useful to make matcher expression more readable by inlining bind; calls into redundant node matchers inside another node matcher:. // This binds the CXXRecordDecl to ""id"", as the decl() matcher will stay on; // the same node.; recordDecl(decl().bind(""id""), hasName(""::MyClass"")).
