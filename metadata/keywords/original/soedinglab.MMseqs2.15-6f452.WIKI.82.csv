We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);.

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/00247958878d09fde5b940c087115f3b14a42a7d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/00247958878d09fde5b940c087115f3b14a42a7d.html

It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html

It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ...

Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/13f4518da3238bc4f14104171122c3ed13fac0de.html

This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ...

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1a74e86d3ca93ed4d5e54192cda95d922dac2640.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1a74e86d3ca93ed4d5e54192cda95d922dac2640.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 -GXcode ..

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1d4f4c6e29fe02dc3022abe586afa1b14b75dd7e.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1d4f4c6e29fe02dc3022abe586afa1b14b75dd7e.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 -GXcode ..

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1d4f4c6e29fe02dc3022abe586afa1b14b75dd7e.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/1d4f4c6e29fe02dc3022abe586afa1b14b75dd7e.html

It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2471054ed6a5808be91439c24bed365cc2092918.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2471054ed6a5808be91439c24bed365cc2092918.html

It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ...

Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if it's clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typical",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2c452ce0be98ac75e49881808ce2fb4cecd8db5c.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2c452ce0be98ac75e49881808ce2fb4cecd8db5c.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2c452ce0be98ac75e49881808ce2fb4cecd8db5c.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/2c452ce0be98ac75e49881808ce2fb4cecd8db5c.html

The regression test passed, if the second image exits cleanly.; Please note, some users don't have permissions to access the unix socket to communicate with the Docker engine.; In such a case, run the commands above as ""sudo docker build ...""; The script that runs the regression test is found here:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/scripts/run_codeship_pipeline.sh; There is also a docker image that runs the regression test:; https://bitbucket.org/martin_steinegger/mmseqs-benchmark/raw/master/Dockerfile; Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan ... Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer. Add a custom footer; . . .

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/698889c7998a470b9ccea575d2a9442c28010142.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true. Add a custom footer; . . .

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/6a2b293a8d9bdefc6efc9e8007dc82e88f698e9d.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/6a2b293a8d9bdefc6efc9e8007dc82e88f698e9d.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true. Add a custom footer; . . .

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {.

C++ Standards; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes std::map (careful!).; However, weights any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they are extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(); s.clear();); smart pointer (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstreams littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful. std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""search"", search, &",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/703f873cf6a97442784033b0e00bd433a4a866d1.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/703f873cf6a97442784033b0e00bd433a4a866d1.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -GXcode ..

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/7a040ff8697de913594e9c7817c8740cb8a6ef11.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/7a040ff8697de913594e9c7817c8740cb8a6ef11.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -GXcode ..

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/7a040ff8697de913594e9c7817c8740cb8a6ef11.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/7a040ff8697de913594e9c7817c8740cb8a6ef11.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 -GXcode ..

Continuous integration runs with -Werror and will fail when it finds any warnings.; Since, the CI system runs on many compilers and compiler versions the kind of warnings reported might differ between your local environment and the CI>; Shellcheck; Shellcheck runs on all workflow shell scripts and will fail in the continuous integration if it finds any issues.; Make sure to not use Bash specific features. #!/bin/sh means that are POSIX shell compliant.; The MMseqs2 Windows builds run with the busybox ash shell, if you are a bit careful about your scripts, you will automatically gain Windows support.; Regression test; The regression test runs most workflows (search, profile search, profile-profile, target-profile, clustering, linclust, etc.) after every commit.; It compares their results against known good ones and fails if they don't match.; To run the regression test suite execute the following steps:; git submodule update --init; ./util/regression/run_regression.sh full-path-to-mmseqs-binary intermediate-files-scratch-directory. It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of ",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/aa8f052173c798ff637653955f645b3ac4295f0a.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/aa8f052173c798ff637653955f645b3ac4295f0a.html

It will print a report telling if it passed or failed each test.; Inspecting crashes on real data; MMseqs2 is designed for large-scale data analysis so if a crash occurs on real data it is often not possible to reproduce the run and debug it in a source-code editor (e.g., visual studio code). It is therefore recommended to compile MMseqs2 with; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo. Any post-crash core dump file can then be inspected by running:; gdb /path/to/mmseqs path/to/core/file. You can first inspect the stack trace with 'bt'. This should give you an idea of the mmseqs function and line of code that started the trouble. using 'frame number' can allow zooming in on a particular frame. Other useful options include re-running the code using gdb and setting breakpoints. For example, 'b abort' and 'b exit' will set breakpoints upon any exit of abort in the code.; To run gdb on mmseqs2 with its arguments type:; gdb --args /path/to/mmseqs mmseqs2-arg1 mmseqs2-arg2 mmseqs2-arg3 ... Sanitizers; MMseqs2 can be built with ASan/MSan/UBSan/TSan support by specifying calling:; cmake -DHAVE_SANITIZER=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASan .. Replace ASan with MSan, UBsan or TSan for the other sanitizers. CMake will error and abort if your compiler does not support the respective sanitizer.; Tests; Tests in the src/test folder are build if the HAVE_TESTS is set true; Create an Xcode project; It can happen that cmake can not detect the correct architecture automatically.; cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 -DREQUIRE_OPENMP=0 -GXcode ..

However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.; Example: computedValues or index; Local variable names; Local variable names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants,",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/aa8f052173c798ff637653955f645b3ac4295f0a.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/aa8f052173c798ff637653955f645b3ac4295f0a.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continuous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressively get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""s",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/aa8f052173c798ff637653955f645b3ac4295f0a.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/aa8f052173c798ff637653955f645b3ac4295f0a.html

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typicall",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html

Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/d5e220b73d95cf0051d2e88faaa633feef2ad58b.html

Code Style; Braces; Braces are also used where they would be optional; Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.; For example, a preprocessor macro that could go wrong when leaving out braces:; #define MACRO test1; \; test2;. if (true); MACRO. This would get expanded to the following:; if (true) {; test1;; }; test2;. Keep the beginning brace in the same line as control structures, functions, etc.:; if (true) {. Please avoid:; if (true); {. Naming guideline; Write your names as descriptive and long as necessary, but also as short as possible.; Example: Use weights instead of wg. Do not unnecessarily expand the name to sequenceWeights, if its clear from the context that you are dealing with a sequence. However, if you dealing with profileWeights and sequenceWeights in the same context, feel free to use longer names.; Only iterator variables are supposed to be one letter long (i, j, k).; Class names; Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.; Example: ClusterAlgorithm; Method names; Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.; Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.; Example: sendMessage, stop, clusterMethod; Constant names; Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore.; Example: CLUSTER_ALGORITHM; Non-constant field names; Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.; These names are typicall",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/ee65487aa8618065702f20b71df53f89f0a5e89b.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/ee65487aa8618065702f20b71df53f89f0a5e89b.html

EXIT handles cleaning up remaining MPI instances (if compiled with MPI).; size_t written = write(dataFilefd, buffer, bufferSize);; if (written != bufferSize) {; Debug(Debug::ERROR) << ""Could not write to data file "" << dataFileNames[0] << ""\n"";; EXIT(EXIT_FAILURE); ; }. 2) Warning which can be handled; Write to Debug(Debug::WARNING) and continue with the next loop iteration or whatever is appropriate.; if (std::remove(dataFileNames[i]) != 0) {; Debug(Debug::WARNING) << ""Could not remove file "" << dataFileNames[i] << ""\n"";; }.

C++ Standard; Try to avoid using too many C++ features. MMseqs2 is coded in a way where we do not use not too many concepts from modern C++.; Generally you have to support GCC 4.8, this is enforced by the Continous Integration system.; It is more like C style C++. We do use classes to organize code. Some STL functionality should be used std::string, std::vector, sometimes also std::map (careful!).; However, weight any new C++ concept heavily and try to avoid them as much as possible.; Especially, do not use:. auto; streams (they can be extremely slow, instead use std::string s; s.reserve(10000); outside a loop and inside s.append(...); s.clear();); smart pointers (try to use RAII for allocation as much as possible); functional programming; inheritance (think about it very carefully, its usually a lot less useful than it appears). You will still find some std::stringstream littered throughout our codebase, we are trying to progressivly get rid of those and not to add any new ones.; Some modern C++ features are very useful.; For example, std::vector::emplace_back can avoid memory allocations for example:; // two allocations; vector.push_back(Struct(1, 2, 3));; // one allocation; vector.emplace_back(1, 2, 3);. MMseqs2 specific advice; Code reuse; Take a look at all the classes in the src/common subfolder.; They contain a lot of useful stuff like Util, FileUtil, MathUtil, Itoa, etc.; Try not to reimplement stuff that exists already.; For bioinformatics, understand how to use the Sequence, QueryMatcher, Matcher, etc. classes.; Development of modules; To add a workflow or an util tool to MMseqs2 you need register your workflow or module in the src/mmseqs.cpp file.; A new command generally looks something like this:; {""se",MatchSource.WIKI,MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/f6c8236d89eb5db6b0bee7074b54bcbca12e68d4.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/MMseqs2-Developer-Guide/f6c8236d89eb5db6b0bee7074b54bcbca12e68d4.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy.; Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?; Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.; Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?; Assigning taxonomic labels; We already placed a FASTA file at pathogens/reads.fasta containing the; reads.[^1]; First, change to the exercise directory: cd pathogens. Here you will; see the previously mentioned reads.fasta file and a couple files; starting with uniprot_sprot.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels.

Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?; Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits.; Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?; Assigning taxonomic labels; We already placed a FASTA file at pathogens/reads.fasta containing the; reads.[^1]; First, change to the exercise directory: cd pathogens. Here you will; see the previously mentioned reads.fasta file and a couple files; starting with uniprot_sprot.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?.

His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease.

It recovers 2 to 10 times; more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other; state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets.; First we will load the dataset from the SRA with sra-tools:; prefetch ERR1384114; fasterq-dump ERR1384114. Alternatively, the reads can be downloaded directly from the European Nucleotide Archives's download server:; wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR138/004/ERR1384114/ERR1384114_1.fastq.gz; wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR138/004/ERR1384114/ERR1384114_2.fastq.gz; gunzip ERR1384114_1.fastq.gz; gunzip ERR1384114_2.fastq.gz.

Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi).

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/13cd48c24a34b91ff0e2dac865c1d3aa28fb829c.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/13cd48c24a34b91ff0e2dac865c1d3aa28fb829c.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region. Some of these paired reads overlap enough to be; merged into a single read with FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg 2011).; We will also need a reference database of proteins.

Use the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to find it, by searching for its name. What is the taxon identifier of the pathogen? Did you find one or; more?.

How many reads of the pathogen are in this resulting FASTA file?. Assembling reads to proteins; We want to try to recover the protein sequences of the pathogen. Which proteins do you expect to find in the pathogen you discovered?; Search the internet. We will use the protein assembly method Plass (Steinegger, Mirdita, and; Söding 2019) to find overlapping reads and generate whole proteins out; of the best matching ones.; plass assemble reads_pathogen.fasta pathogen_assembly.fasta tmp. Take a look at the generated FASTA file pathogen_assembly.fasta. How many sequences were assembled?; Do some of the sequences look similar to each other?. Clustering to find representative proteins; Plass will uncover a lot of variation in the reads and output many; similar proteins. We can use the sequence clustering module in MMseqs2; to get only representative sequences.; mmseqs easy-cluster pathogen_assembly.fasta assembly_clustered tmp.

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease ca",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/262f07a0af8d129c540760b398a0f1c43a89ab45.html

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery to early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta. The sequencing machine returns paired-end reads where sequencing; starts in opposite directions from two close-by points to cover the; same genomic region.

Re-create the linclust workflow...; Based on the explanation of the Linclust algorithm, try to code its; workflow using:. kmermatcher. rescorediagonal. clust. Take a look at the real Linclust workflow.; This version is slightly more involved as it integrates a redundancy; reduction step (the pre_clust prefiltering by high Hamming distance),; and uses a trick using filterdb with the flag –filter-file to apply; the workflow you just built only on the non-redundant entries. At; the end of the file, you can also spot a merging step to recover the; redundant part in the final clustering.; Conclusion; We hope that you are more familiar with the MMseqs2 environment, and; that you enjoy its modularity and flexibility for creating new; workflows. Due to time and virtual machine constraints we chose a rather; small metagenomic dataset, but using MMseqs2 on bigger datasets should; convince you of its scalability.; References; Eddy, Sean R. 2009.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0.

Analysis of a human gut metagenomics dataset; Getting a protein catalogue of a metagenome; We use Plass to assemble a catalogue of protein sequences directly from; the reads, without the nucleic assembly step.

The standard genomic assemblies prevent many reads to assemble due to; low coverage and micro-diversity. To run this protein-level; assembly, use the command; plass assemble ERR1384114_1.fastq ERR1384114_2.fastq plass_proteins.fasta tmp. or type plass assemble -h to see all available options.; As a matter of comparison, run the usual pipeline using MegaHit for; genomic assembly:; megahit -1 ERR1384114_1.fastq -2 ERR1384114_2.fastq -o megahit_assembly.

Take a look at the FASTA files produced by Plass and Prodigal. To check; the number of detected proteins, you can count the number of FASTA; headers (lines beginning with the > character):; grep -c ""^>"" file.faa. Redundancy reduction; Since Plass assembles with replacement of reads, the catalogue will; contain some redundancy. You can reduce this catalogue by clustering it,; for instance, to 90% of sequence identity, and asking for the; representative sequence that cover at least 95% of the members. For; this, you can either use the easy-cluster (sensitive clustering) or; easy-linclust (linear time fast clustering) modules of MMseqs2:; mmseqs easy-cluster plass_proteins.fasta clustered_proteins tmp --min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.95 --cov-mode 1.

This generates several files: a data file plass_proteins_db together; with an index file plass_proteins_db.index. The first file contains; all the sequences separated by a null byte \0.

Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8. It returned 14 million short nucleotide sequences; (reads).; The authors of the study removed all human reads using Kraken (Wood and; Salzberg 2014) and released a much smaller set of 226,908 reads on the; SRA (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi). Kraken; extracts short nucleotide subsequences of length k, also called; k-mers, and compares them to a reference database where k-mers point; to taxonomic labels. In case of exact matching it is able to assign; taxonomy. Why didn't the authors release the complete dataset?; Demanding exact k-mer matching in Kraken has benefits for removing; human reads. Why?; What is the SRA? How many samples are there in the SRA currently? How; many bases are publicly available on the SRA in total?. Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2; We will use the sequence search tool MMseqs2 (Steinegger and Soeding; 2017) to find the cause of this patient's disease. MMseqs2 translates; the nucleotide reads to putative protein fragments, searches against a; protein reference database and assigns taxonomic labels based on the; found reference database hits. Why might a protein-protein search be useful for finding bacterial or; viral pathogens? How does this compare with Kraken's approach?. Assigning taxonomic labels; To not spoil the mystery too early, we prepared a FASTA file containing the reads.; Download this file first:; wget http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/mmseqs2/tutorials/mystery_reads.fasta.

For; this, you can either use the easy-cluster (sensitive clustering) or; easy-linclust (linear time fast clustering) modules of MMseqs2:; mmseqs easy-cluster pla",MatchSource.WIKI,Tutorials/340fd55f92f0c8a1da9145d8d126ed441d107868.html,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki/Tutorials/340fd55f92f0c8a1da9145d8d126ed441d107868.html

Metagenomic pathogen detection; The Patient; A 61-year-old man was admitted in December 2016 with bilateral headache,; gait instability, lethargy, and confusion. Because of multiple tick; bites in the preceding 2 weeks, he was prescribed the antibiotic; doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease. Over the next 48 hours, he; developed worsening confusion, weakness, and ataxia. He returned to the; referring hospital and was admitted. He lived in a heavily wooded area; in New Hampshire, had frequent tick exposures, and worked as a; construction contractor in basements with uncertain rodent and bat; exposures. His symptoms were diagnosed as Encephalitis and the; causative agent --- not known. Your task will be to identify the pathogenic root cause of the; disease. This pathogen is usually confirmed by a screening antibody test,; followed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this takes; 5 weeks, which was too slow to affect the patient's care. As traditional; tests done in the first week of the patient's hospital stay did not; reveal any conclusive disease cause, the doctors were running out of; options. Therefore a novel metagenomic analysis was performed.; The Dataset; Metagenomic sequencing from cerebrospinal fluid was performed on; hospital day 8.
