This is the ROOT implementation of the Qt object communication; mechanism (see also http://www.troll.no/qt/metaobjects.html). Signals and slots are used for communication between objects.; When an object has changed in some way that might be interesting; for the outside world, it emits a signal to tell whoever is; listening. All slots that are connected to this signal will be; activated (called). It is even possible to connect a signal; directly to another signal (this will emit the second signal; immediately whenever the first is emitted.) There is no limitation; on the number of slots that can be connected to a signal.; The slots will be activated in the order they were connected; to the signal. This mechanism allows objects to be easily reused,; because the object that emits a signal does not need to know; to which objects the signals are connected.; Together, signals and slots make up a powerfull component; programming mechanism.

ROOT; » CORE; » BASE; » TQCommand. class TQCommand: public TList, public TQObject. The Command design pattern is based on the idea, that all editing; in an application is done by creating instances of command objects.; Command objects apply changes to the edited object and then are; stored on a command stack. Furthermore, each command knows how to; undo its changes to bring the edited object back to its previous; state. As long as the application only uses command objects to; change the state of the edited object, it is possible to undo; a sequence of commands by traversing the command stack downwards and; calling the ""undo"" method of each command in turn. It is also; possible to redo a sequence of commands by traversing the command; stack upwards and calling the ""redo"" method of each command. Examples:. 1. Create a new command. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)""; ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 1st parameter - the name of class; 2nd parameter - object; 3rd parameter - the name of do/redo method; 4th parameter - the name of undo method. Since redo,undo methods are the same, undo name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. For objects derived from TObject class name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 2. Setting undo, redo parameters. Color_t old_color = hpx->GetFillColor();; Color_t new_color = 4; // blue color. com->SetRedoArgs(1, new_color);; com->SetUndoArgs(1, old_color);. 1st argument - the number of undo, redo parameters; the other arguments - undo, redo values. Since the number of undo,redo parameters is the same one can use. com->SetArgs(1, new_color, old_color);. 3.

Furthermore, each command knows how to; undo its changes to bring the edited object back to its previous; state. As long as the application only uses command objects to; change the state of the edited object, it is possible to undo; a sequence of commands by traversing the command stack downwards and; calling the ""undo"" method of each command in turn. It is also; possible to redo a sequence of commands by traversing the command; stack upwards and calling the ""redo"" method of each command. Examples:. 1. Create a new command.

ROOT; » CORE; » BASE; » TQUndoManager. class TQUndoManager: public TQCommand. The Command design pattern is based on the idea, that all editing; in an application is done by creating instances of command objects.; Command objects apply changes to the edited object and then are; stored on a command stack. Furthermore, each command knows how to; undo its changes to bring the edited object back to its previous; state. As long as the application only uses command objects to; change the state of the edited object, it is possible to undo; a sequence of commands by traversing the command stack downwards and; calling the ""undo"" method of each command in turn. It is also; possible to redo a sequence of commands by traversing the command; stack upwards and calling the ""redo"" method of each command. Examples:. 1. Create a new command. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)""; ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 1st parameter - the name of class; 2nd parameter - object; 3rd parameter - the name of do/redo method; 4th parameter - the name of undo method. Since redo,undo methods are the same, undo name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. For objects derived from TObject class name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 2. Setting undo, redo parameters. Color_t old_color = hpx->GetFillColor();; Color_t new_color = 4; // blue color. com->SetRedoArgs(1, new_color);; com->SetUndoArgs(1, old_color);. 1st argument - the number of undo, redo parameters; the other arguments - undo, redo values. Since the number of undo,redo parameters is the same one can use. com->SetArgs(1, new_color, old_color);. 3.

TRandom. basic Random number generator class (periodicity = 10**9).; Note that this is a very simple generator (linear congruential); which is known to have defects (the lower random bits are correlated); and therefore should NOT be used in any statistical study.; One should use instead TRandom1, TRandom2 or TRandom3.; TRandom3, is based on the ""Mersenne Twister generator"", and is the recommended one,; since it has good random proprieties (period of about 10**6000 ) and it is fast.; TRandom1, based on the RANLUX algorithm, has mathematically proven random proprieties; and a period of about 10**171. It is however slower than the others.; TRandom2, is based on the Tausworthe generator of L'Ecuyer, and it has the advantage; of being fast and using only 3 words (of 32 bits) for the state. The period is 10**26. The following table shows some timings (in nanoseconds/call); for the random numbers obtained using an Intel Pentium 3.0 GHz running Linux; and using the gcc 3.2.3 compiler.

Note that the time to generate a number from an arbitrary TF1 function; using TF1::GetRandom or using TUnuran is independent of the complexity of the function. TH1::FillRandom(TH1 *) or TH1::FillRandom(const char *tf1name). can be used to fill an histogram (1-d, 2-d, 3-d from an existing histogram; or from an existing function. Note this interesting feature when working with objects. You can use several TRandom objects, each with their ""independent""; random sequence. For example, one can imagine; TRandom *eventGenerator = new TRandom();; TRandom *tracking = new TRandom();; eventGenerator can be used to generate the event kinematics.; tracking can be used to track the generated particles with random numbers; independent from eventGenerator.; This very interesting feature gives the possibility to work with simple; and very fast random number generators without worrying about; random number periodicity as it was the case with Fortran.; One can use TRandom::SetSeed to modify the seed of one generator. a TRandom object may be written to a Root file. -as part of another object; -or with its own key (example gRandom->Write(""Random"");.

WARNING2: A TRef cannot point to another TRef. ObjectNumber. When an object is referenced (see TRef assignement operator or TRefArray::Add); a unique identifier is computed and stored in both the fUniqueID of the; referenced and referencing object. This uniqueID is computed by incrementing; by one the static global in TProcessID::fgNumber. fUniqueID is some sort of; serial object number in the current session. One can retrieve at any time; the current value of fgNumber by calling the static function TProcessID::GetObjectCount; or set this number via TProcessID::SetObjectCount.; To avoid a growing table of fObjects in TProcessID, in case, for example,; one processes many events in a loop, it might be necessary to reset the; ObjectNumber at the end of processing of one event.

Special case of a TRef pointing to an object with a TUUID. If the referenced object has a TUUID, its bit kHasUUID has been set.; This case is detected by the TRef assignement operator.; (For example, TFile and TDirectory have a TUUID); The TRef fPID points directly to the single object TProcessUUID (deriving; from TProcessID) and managing the list of TUUIDs for a process.; The TRef kHasUUID bit is set and its fUniqueID is set to the fUniqueID; of the referenced object.; When the TRef is streamed to a buffer, the corresponding TUUID is also; streamed with the TRef.

The special class TRefArray should be used to store multiple references.; A TRefArray has one single pointer fPID for all objects in the array.; It has a dynamic compact table of fUniqueIDs.

ROOT; » MATH; » PHYSICS; » TRobustEstimator. class TRobustEstimator: public TObject. TRobustEstimator. Minimum Covariance Determinant Estimator - a Fast Algorithm; invented by Peter J.Rousseeuw and Katrien Van Dreissen; ""A Fast Algorithm for the Minimum covariance Determinant Estimator""; Technometrics, August 1999, Vol.41, NO.3. What are robust estimators?; ""An important property of an estimator is its robustness. An estimator; is called robust if it is insensitive to measurements that deviate; from the expected behaviour. There are 2 ways to treat such deviating; measurements: one may either try to recongize them and then remove; them from the data sample; or one may leave them in the sample, taking; care that they do not influence the estimate unduly. In both cases robust; estimators are needed...Robust procedures compensate for systematic errors; as much as possible, and indicate any situation in which a danger of not being; able to operate reliably is detected.""; R.Fruhwirth, M.Regler, R.K.Bock, H.Grote, D.Notz; ""Data Analysis Techniques for High-Energy Physics"", 2nd edition. What does this algorithm do?; It computes a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter.; Then, it takes those estimates to compute robust distances of all the; data vectors. Those with large robust distances are considered outliers.; Robust distances can then be plotted for better visualization of the data.

What does this algorithm do?; It computes a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter.; Then, it takes those estimates to compute robust distances of all the; data vectors. Those with large robust distances are considered outliers.; Robust distances can then be plotted for better visualization of the data. How does this algorithm do it?; The MCD objective is to find h observations(out of n) whose classical; covariance matrix has the lowest determinant. The MCD estimator of location; is then the average of those h points and the MCD estimate of scatter; is their covariance matrix. The minimum(and default) h = (n+nvariables+1)/2; so the algorithm is effective when less than (n+nvar+1)/2 variables are outliers.; The algorithm also allows for exact fit situations - that is, when h or more; observations lie on a hyperplane. Then the algorithm still yields the MCD location T; and scatter matrix S, the latter being singular as it should be. From (T,S) the; program then computes the equation of the hyperplane. How can this algorithm be used?; In any case, when contamination of data is suspected, that might influence; the classical estimates.; Also, robust estimation of location and scatter is a tool to robustify; other multivariate techniques such as, for example, principal-component analysis; and discriminant analysis. Technical details of the algorithm:; 0.The default h = (n+nvariables+1)/2, but the user may choose any interger h with; (n+nvariables+1)/2<=h<=n.

What are robust estimators?; ""An important property of an estimator is its robustness. An estimator; is called robust if it is insensitive to measurements that deviate; from the expected behaviour. There are 2 ways to treat such deviating; measurements: one may either try to recongize them and then remove; them from the data sample; or one may leave them in the sample, taking; care that they do not influence the estimate unduly.

Background: Known; Efficiency: Gaussian. when background is known and efficiency Gaussian. Parameters and further explanation. For all models:. x = number of observed events in the experiment. Efficiency (e or em) is the detection probability for signal.; A low efficiency hence generally means weaker limits.; If the efficiency of an experiment (with analysis cuts) is; dealt with elsewhere, em or e can be set to one. For Poisson background measurements (sideband or MC):. y = number of observed events in background region; tau =; Either: the ratio between signal and background region; in case background is observed.; Or: the ratio between observed and simulated live-time; in case background is determined from MC. For Gaussian efficiency or background:. bm = estimate of the background; sdb = corresponding standard deviation. em = estimate of the efficiency; sde = corresponding standard deviation. If the efficiency scale of dealt with elsewhere,; set em to 1 and sde to the relative uncertainty. For Binomial signal efficiency:. m = number of MC events generated; z = number of MC events observed. For the case of known background expectation or known efficiency:. e = true efficiency (considered known); b = back",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html530/TRolke.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html530/TRolke.html
