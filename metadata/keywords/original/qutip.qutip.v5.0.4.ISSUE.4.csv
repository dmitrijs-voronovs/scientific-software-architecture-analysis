https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1901:934,Deployability,Install,Installed,934,"### Bug Description. Time evolution based on the Lindblad master equation for a time-independent Hamiltonian is guaranteed to be completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP). However, the flag `iscptp` returns `False` for the Liouvillian when calling `propagator` for a time-independent Hamiltonian and including a collapse operator. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import sigmaz, qeye, propagator, tensor, sigmam. c_ops = [0.00001 * tensor(sigmam(), qeye(2))]; H0 = tensor(sigmaz(), qeye(2)) + tensor(qeye(2), sigmaz()); H = H0; prop = propagator(H, 1.0, c_ops); print(prop.iscptp); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; False; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. I expect `prop.iscptp` to be `True`. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.7.0; Numpy Version: 1.21.2; Scipy Version: 1.7.1; Cython Version: 0.29.23; Matplotlib Version: 3.4.2; Python Version: 3.7.7; Number of CPUs: 4; BLAS Info: INTEL MKL; OPENMP Installed: False; INTEL MKL Ext: True; Platform Info: Darwin (x86_64); ```. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1901

In v4, to use openmp, the user needs to compile from source locally with `python setup.py install --with-openmp` and then an option has to be passed to the solver at run time to use it. For v5, it would be great if openMP was part of the Data layer and used without much thought by the user. (No need to pass `Options(use_openmp=True)` to `mesolve`). We would probably keep a flag and threshold as an option in core or settings so we can run tests with and without. We should add support for cython's `prange`. Presently, using it breaks mac's tests.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1910:278,Availability,error,errors,278,"### Problem Description. There are a few issues with graphic capacities in Qutip. 1. Most are not tested. Only Bloch.py has some tests associated. While testing graphs is not evident, matplotlib has testing functions to compare graphs etc. and just running it to ensure that no errors are raised would be a nice start. Here are some files and their coverage:; - tomography.py 50%; - visualization.py 8%; - distribution.py 23%; - bloch.py 55%; - bloch3d.py 8%. 2. The interface is not uniform. Most functions take 'fig' and 'ax', but `hilton` only takes 'ax' but no 'fig'. Maybe one third of the function in visualization accepts 'title' and half a 'figsize'. The order of these options is also inconsistent, 'fig', 'ax' can be the first parameters or the last... As seen in #1573, some want more control so `matrix_histogram` accepts `options`. I am all for more control, but being available for only one function feels wrong.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1959:651,Availability,down,down,651,"### Bug Description. In the current documentation I cannot find anywhere how the underdamped spectral density for the HEOM module (i.e. `UnderDampedBath`) is defined. While for the `gamma` and `w0` parameters this is quite straightforward, different authors use very different conventions in the prefactors multiplying the spectral density (factors of two, pi, gamma, w0, etc.). This makes it very hard to understand how the `lam` parameter is exactly defined. Having a proper understanding of the `lam` parameter is quite essential to properly compare with the results obtained via other methods. I think it would be quite useful to explicitly write down the mathematical formula of the spectral density being used in the documentation. In the mean time, I would also appreciate if anyone with knowledge of the proper definition would be kind enough to share it here. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. _No response_. ### Code Output. _No response_. ### Expected Behaviour.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1959:1015,Usability,clear,clear,1015," current documentation I cannot find anywhere how the underdamped spectral density for the HEOM module (i.e. `UnderDampedBath`) is defined. While for the `gamma` and `w0` parameters this is quite straightforward, different authors use very different conventions in the prefactors multiplying the spectral density (factors of two, pi, gamma, w0, etc.). This makes it very hard to understand how the `lam` parameter is exactly defined. Having a proper understanding of the `lam` parameter is quite essential to properly compare with the results obtained via other methods. I think it would be quite useful to explicitly write down the mathematical formula of the spectral density being used in the documentation. In the mean time, I would also appreciate if anyone with knowledge of the proper definition would be kind enough to share it here. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. _No response_. ### Code Output. _No response_. ### Expected Behaviour. I would expect the documentation to make it clear what each parameter controls in the spectral density definition. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python; ================================; Copyright (c) QuTiP team 2011 and later.; Current admin team: Alexander Pitchford, Nathan Shammah, Shahnawaz Ahmed, Neill Lambert, Eric Giguère, Boxi Li, Jake Lishman and Simon Cross.; Board members: Daniel Burgarth, Robert Johansson, Anton F.

It either fails, does complete but has invalid output data (times and states data not the same sizes), or gives different simulation results entirely. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import *; import numpy as np. def psd(w):; return w * np.exp(-w). out = brmesolve(sigmax(), psi0=basis(2,0), tlist=np.arange(0, 1, 0.01), a_ops=[[sigmax(), psd]]). assert len(out.states) == len(out.times), f'{len(out.states)} vs {len(out.times)}'; ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------; AssertionError Traceback (most recent call last); Input In [11], in <cell line: 6>(); 2 return w * np.exp(-w); 4 out = brmesolve(sigmax(), psi0=basis(2,0), tlist=np.arange(0, 1, 0.01), a_ops=[[sigmax(), psd]]); ----> 6 assert len(out.states) == len(out.times), f'{len(out.states)} vs {len(out.times)}'. AssertionError: 10 vs 100; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. As we see, the above code does run and produces an output, but the states list is not the same as the times lists (these should be the same length as they have a 1-1 correspondence). It actually appears it has only given data for the first 10 time-steps in this case.; The same code works fine on Intel chip. ; We can increase the `nsteps` parameter to give the correct number of output states, but they do not agree with Intels output (also see below for related issue), and actually are not always even quantum states, so something in the solver went wrong. Another example, using the cython string formatting:. ```brmesolve([[sigmax(), 'cos(t)']], psi0=basis(2,0), tlist=np.arange(0, 1, 0.01), a_ops=[[sigmax(), '1']])``` works fine on Intel, but gives error ```Exception: ODE integration error: Try to increase the allowed number of substeps by increasing the nsteps parameter in the Options class.``` on M1. .

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1973:371,Availability,error,errors,371,"### Bug Description. The `plot_spin_distribution_2d` function allows to project a spin distribution function from the surface of a unit sphere to the unit disk. QuTiP uses `matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor` to perform this task and calculates a meshgrid `X, Y` to plot the function to. Due to some changes in `matplotlib` the current implementation is deprecated and will return errors in a few minor releases. We could quickly fix this by passing `shading='auto'` to the call of `ax.pcolor()` in the [visualization.py](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/82c6704c6fea8a2801492865ad1ef7c1d73c8840/qutip/visualization.py#L1313). However, this raises another UserWarning that the center points are not monotonically sorted. The cleanest way to fix this bug would be to pass the edges of the quadrilaterals to `pcolor()`. But we can not calculate them exactly from the given points in `theta, phi`. Hence, we would need to redesign the interface to this function and to related functions like `plot_spin_distribution_3d` and `spin_q_function`. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import qutip as qt; import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. j = 5; psi = qt.spin_coherent(j, np.random.rand() * np.pi, np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi); rho = qt.ket2dm(psi). theta = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 50); phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 50). Q, THETA, PHI = qt.spin_q_function(psi, theta, phi); fig, ax = qt.plot_spin_distribution_2d(Q, THETA, PHI); plt.show(); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: shading='flat' when X and Y have the same dimensions as C is deprecated since 3.3. Either specify the corners of the quadrilaterals with X and Y, or pass shading='auto', 'nearest' or 'gouraud', or set rcParams['pcolor.shading'].

With the PR for adding `hypothesis` #1957, we have the issue of how we should handle the `NaN` and `inf`. I see 3 main ways:; - Up to now, we mostly ignored them. They rarely caused any issues. We could continue like this. Maybe adding a `isfinite` function and fixing `iszero`; - Do as @hodgestar did in #1957, propagate the `NaN` as blas does. We could still add `isfinite`.; - Raise an error when a `Data` is not finite as soon as possible. I prefer raising an error as soon as a bad value is obtained. Otherwise computation can continue for a while, hiding the source of the issue and wasting time. Even when the `NaNs` are properly propagated, it's often not that helpful when debugging.; Failing as soon as the bad value is obtained will make debugging the easiest. I looked at all the places that would need to check for bad values:; Creation: `dense.pyx`'s, `csr.pyx`'s, `one_element`, `diag`.; Modification: `project`, `ptrace`, `kron`.; Operation: `add`, `mul`, `matmul`.; The other functions either don't create a `Data` object or use one of the previous function (`pow` use `matmul`, `eigen` uses `Dense.__init__`, etc.). I believe that we should check at creation, even if we otherwise mostly ignore bad values.; Adding check in `project`, `ptrace`, `kron` shouldn't be too costly. The issue is we want the operations `add`, `mul`, `matmul` to be fast, so checking after each call would not be great. But if we keep track of the largest element, it could only cost one extra addition or multiplication, which could be fast enough to make refusing `inf` and `NaN` in `Qobj` doable.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1977

In master equation solver, the case where **collapse operator = None** vs the case where **collapse operator = [0 * some matrix]** outputs different results. This behavior can be found [here](https://github.com/EeshGupta/Multimode-Conditional-Displacements/blob/main/hpc_runs/two_mode_ecd/Qutip%20Batch%20Optimizer%20Inconsistency/Qutip%20Collapse%20Operator%20Bug.ipynb). ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import *. initial = tensor(basis(2, 0)); target = tensor(basis(2,0)). c_ops1 = None; c_ops2 = [0*qeye(2)]. T = 10; times = [i for i in range(T)]; opts = Options(store_states=True, store_final_state=True,nsteps = 4000,max_step = 10). #collapse ops = None; output1 = mesolve(sigmax(), initial , times, c_ops1, [], options =opts); rho1 = output1.states[-1] #final state ; #collapse ops = 0*matrix; output2 = mesolve(H, initial , times, c_ops, [], options =opts); rho2 = output2.states[-1]. fid1 = rho1.overlap(target); fid2 = rho2.overlap(target). print('fid1: ' + str(fid1)); print('fid2: ' + str(fid2)); print('Is fid1 = fid2? ' + str(fid1==fid2)); ```. ### Code Output; `fid1: 0.911130904224875; fid2: 0.8301538149349885; Is fid1 = fid2? False`; ### Expected Behaviour. Both cases should give the same output, say x.; ```; fid1: x; fid2: x; Is fid1 = fid2? True; ```. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.6.2; Numpy Version: 1.18.5; Scipy Version: 1.4.1; Cython Version: 0.29.23; Matplotlib Version: 3.3.4; Python Version: 3.8.8; Number of CPUs: 2; BLAS Info: OPENBLAS; OPENMP Installed: False; INTEL MKL Ext: False; Platform Info: Windows (AMD64); ```. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1985

I believe `mesolve` is combining `Hd` and `Hp` into a 64x64 matrix, perhaps computing their tensor product. Why would this be the case? If not, how can I solve my problem using a density matrix as an input, such that the output states at each time step is an 8x8 density matrix?

The Hamiltonian evolves with time, $H(t) = \dfrac{t}{T}H_p + (1-\dfrac{t}{T})H_d,~ 0\leq t \leq T$, and I aim to solve the corresponding master equation using qutip, $\hat{\dot{\rho}} = i\left[\hat{H},\hat{\rho}\right]$. I have been doing this with a state vector approach, and the code works fine. With my knowledge of density matrices, I would assume that I can simply replace $\ket{\psi}$ with $\hat{\rho} = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$, and use this as my initial state in `mesolve`.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2003:147,Usability,guid,guide,147,"### Bug Description. Perhaps I am not understanding how a qutip device works. I have been following the example from https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/qip/qip-processor.html#qip-processor as I want to add noise to my quantum circuits. However, I saw that using ```processor.run_state(init_state)``` returns a different state compared to ```qc.run(init_state)``` for certain circuits. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import numpy as np. from qutip import basis, tensor; from qutip.qip.circuit import QubitCircuit; from qutip.qip.device import LinearSpinChain. num_qubits = 3; init_state = tensor([basis(2,1) for x in range(num_qubits)]); qc = QubitCircuit(num_qubits); qc.add_gate(""CNOT"", targets=1, controls=[0]). # Uses a LinearSpinChain processor to obtain the final state; processor = LinearSpinChain(num_qubits); processor.load_circuit(qc); processor_state = processor.run_state(init_state).states[-1].tidyup(1.0e-6). # Obtains state by running the circuit directly; circuit_state = qc.run(init_state). print(processor_state); print(); print(circuit_state); print(). # Calculates the fidelity between both states to show that states are not just differing by a phase; fidelity = np.abs((circuit_state.dag() * processor_state)[0]). print(""Fidelity:"", np.abs(fidelity[0])); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; Quantum object: dims = [[2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1]], shape = (8, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [1.]]. Quantum object: dims = [[2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1]], shape = (8, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [0.]; [1.]; [0.]; [0.]]. Fidelity: [0.]; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. By just adding an RY gate to the circuit, both methods of obtaining the state now returns the same state with unit fidelity. . ```; import numpy as np. from qutip import basis, tensor; from qutip.qip.circuit import QubitCircuit; from qutip.qip.device import LinearSpinChain. num_qubits = 3; init_state = tensor([basis(2,1) for x in range(num_qubits)]); qc = Qub",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2003

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2029:300,Testability,test,test,300,"### Bug Description. It seems that the measurement in `dev.major` does not truncate the probabilities correctly. It is probably caused by some changes in the last month and leads to [a test failing in `qutip-qip`](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-qip/actions/runs/3610116105/jobs/6083718885). The last test running was 24 days ago and was successful. I don't see any code in the measurement that manually tidies up the state. In `qutip-4.7` it is also directly compared to `0`.; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/5a47ee3b8dd817d4c6c36cc84a952c41305cdcb5/qutip/measurement.py#L101-L108. So my guess is that, in `dev.major`, the final states fail to be automatically truncated. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```python; from qutip.measurement import measurement_statistics; import qutip; measurement_ops = [qutip.basis(2,0), qutip.basis(2,1)]; state = qutip.Qobj([[1-1.e-12], [1.e-12]]); print(measurement_statistics(state, measurement_ops)); ```. ### Code Output; dev.major; --------; ```shell. ([Quantum object: dims=[[2], [1]], shape=(2, 1), type='ket'; Qobj data =; [[1.]; [0.]], Quantum object: dims=[[2], [1]], shape=(2, 1), type='ket'; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [1.]]], [0.999999999998, 1e-24]); ```. qutip4.7; -------; ```; ([Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[1.]; [0.]], None], [0.999999999998, 0.0]); ```. ### Expected Behaviour.

Should install `qutip` without errors. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTip Version: 4.7.0; Python version: 3.11.0; `packaging` version: 22.0; `pip` version: 22.3.1; ```. ### Additional Context. I explicitly mention Python 3.11 because I failed to replicate the issue on a fresh Python 3.10 environment. . EDIT: Looking deeper into the [qutip built distributions](https://pypi.org/project/qutip/#files), the reason why this is failing only for Python 3.11 is because earlier versions of Python have built distributions, unlike Python 3.11. . This indicates that building the wheel from source is generally broken, which I confirmed by forcing an installation from source on Python 3.10 with; ```bash; pip install qutip --no-cache-dir --no-binary :all:; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2036

The correct result of the output matrix should be $rho_i$, as the input matrix is already an eigenstate of $\hat{O}$.; The output of the measurement shoud be:; $\rho_e = |X\rangle \langle X| \otimes |X\rangle \langle X| =$ [[0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25], [0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25], [0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25], [0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25]]. Instead the measurement output is given by:; $\rho_e = |X\rangle \langle X| \otimes |Z\rangle \langle Z|$ and $\rho_e = |X\rangle \langle X| \otimes |-Z\rangle \langle -Z|$; which is the expected output if the measurement operator would be $\hat{O} = \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_z$, instead of $\hat{O} = \sigma_x \otimes \mathbb{I}$. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTip version: 4.7.0; ```. ### Additional Context.

Let `qobjevo` be a QobjEvo with array-based time dependence, like `QobjEvo([[qt.num(2), np.random.randn(100)]], tlist=np.arange(100))`. Calling `qobjevo(t)` returns a `Qobj` which is obtained by interpolating between the provided samples using `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline(tlist, samples, bc_type='not-a-knot')(t)`. When `qobjevo` is passed to a solver like `qt.sesolve`, instead something equivalent to the following seems to be used internally:; `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline(tlist, samples, bc_type='natural')(np.clip(t, tlist[0], tlist[-1]))`. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; print(qt.about()); options = qt.Options(nsteps=int(1e9), atol=1e-14, rtol=1e-14). num_control_points = 10; tlist_control_points = np.linspace(0, 1, num_control_points); control_samples = 1e-3 * np.random.randn(num_control_points). initial_state = (qt.basis(2, 0) + qt.basis(2, 1)).unit() # |+>; h_drive = qt.basis(2, 1) * qt.basis(2, 1).dag() # |1><1|. qobjevo = qt.QobjEvo([[h_drive, control_samples]], tlist=tlist_control_points). def calling_qobjevo(t, args):; return qobjevo(t). spline_corrected = scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline(tlist_control_points, control_samples, bc_type='natural'); def callable_corrected(t, args):; t = np.clip(t, tlist_control_points[0], tlist_control_points[-1]); coeff = spline_corrected(t).item(); return coeff * h_drive. tlist_state_eval = np.linspace(-0.1, 1.1, int(1e4)). res_qobjevo = qt.sesolve(qobjevo, initial_state, tlist=tlist_state_eval, options=options); res_calling_qobjevo = qt.sesolve(calling_qobjevo, initial_state, tlist=tlist_state_eval, options=options); res_callable_corrected = qt.sesolve(callable_corrected, initial_state, tlist=tlist_state_eval, options=options). # complex argument of <1|s(t)>, for each state |s(t)> in the trajectory for each of the three Hamiltonians; angle_qobjevo = np.angle(np.array([np.array(s).flatten()[1] for s in res_qobjevo.states])); angle_calling_qobjevo = np.angle(np.array([np.array(s).flatten()[1] for ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2063

The interpolation which is used when calling `qobjevo(t)` should match the interpolation used inside the solvers. I find the out-of-bounds behaviour inside the solvers (constant) more intuitive than the one used in `qobjevo(t)` (extrapolate). Between the different boundary condition types, I have no preference. The easiest would probably be to change the interpolation used in `qobjevo(t)` to match the one used inside the solvers. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.7.1; Numpy Version: 1.21.5; Scipy Version: 1.7.3; Cython Version: None; Matplotlib Version: 3.5.2; Python Version: 3.10.4; ```. ### Additional Context. ![qobjevo_vs_callable_interpolation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46033310/214979557-609de51a-caab-4821-9341-e734ee45d6fd.png)",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2063

I have a question that is not really a bug or feature request (although it is, perhaps, a request for more documentation). I also don't know if this is the place to ask, please refer me elsewhere if it is not. I am trying to solve a problem with a time-dependent hamiltonian, time-dependent collapse operators, including calculating two-time-two-operator correllation functions. My questions are the following:. 1) The documentation only shows the use of square brackets for time-dependent terms. However, tuples also work, but give different behaviour. Is this desired? If its desired, can a description of the behaviour be added to the documentation?; In other words, what, in mesolve and correlation_2op_2t, is the difference between:; H = [H0, [H1, f1(t)], [H2, f2(t)]] and H = [H0, (H1, f1(t)), (H2, f2(t))] . 2) The same question as above goes for the collapse operators. . And, for me the most important question is the following; 3) For the system I try to simulate, I need to implement a collapse operator that is not simply of the shape shown in the documentation, but of the shape C_2 = f(t)*\hat{a} + c*\hat{b}.

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2117:1006,Testability,test,tests,1006,"### Describe the Issue!. Cython is getting close to release a new major release. It bring 2 changes that we must asses to be compatible with it.; - The order of the `nogil` and `except` keyword. In cython 0.29, both `nogil except ...` and `except ... nogil` are supported. From 3.0, a warning is raised when the first is used. We used the first order almost everywhere. We need to reorder them all... ; - Cython 0.29 do not use reverse operations such as `__rmatmul__` and `__rmul__`, but call `__mul__` with reverse order (`__mul__(other, self)`). With cython 3, `__rmul__` is used and `self` is always the first input. This breaks some of our tests. The failing tests are related to `Coefficient.__mul__` in qutip/core/cy/coefficient.pyx, `Data.__mul__` in qutip/core/data/base.pyx and `_ConstantElement.__matmul__` and `_EvoElement.__matmul__` both in qutip/core/cy/_element.pyx.

The issue appears when I try to plot some wavefunction in spherical harmonics generated by the `qutip.orbital` function. When using `qutip.sphereplot` for plotting wrong image is shown. . From the source code, it seems the `qutip.orbital` function is using ; ```; phi_mesh, theta_mesh = np.meshgrid(phi, theta); ``` ; to generate the meshgrid, while `qutip.sphereplot` does the opposite:; ```; thetam, phim = np.meshgrid(theta, phi); ```; Personally I would also prefer the latter one in writing my own plotting function. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; theta = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 100); phi = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100); sphereplot( theta, phi, np.abs( orbital(theta, phi, basis(3,0)) ) ); ```. ### Code Output. _No response_. ### Expected Behaviour. correct image should be shown, which is the case when I also use `phi_mesh, theta_mesh = np.meshgrid(phi, theta)` in my custom plotting function. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.7.1; Numpy Version: 1.23.5; Scipy Version: 1.9.3; Cython Version: 0.29.32; Matplotlib Version: 3.6.2; Python Version: 3.8.10; Number of CPUs: 16; BLAS Info: OPENBLAS; OPENMP Installed: False; INTEL MKL Ext: False; Platform Info: Linux (x86_64); ```. ### Additional Context. ![orbital_bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28942302/225354063-f010a4b9-abee-4465-abd1-0db682494161.png); ![orbital_correct](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28942302/225354098-18a68dd9-7bf2-4d28-8125-9697c07bbdfb.png)",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2123

Adds a `_from_csr_blocks` constructor to speed up the construction of the HEOM RHS by a factor of ~4x. What allows `from_csr_blocks` to be fast is that we can order the blocks in a way that makes it possible to write the rows of the output one after the other without a lot of work, and we never have to add a new non-zero element into a row or make a copy of the big output matrix. The implementation in Python was slow just because there is a lot of Python looping and arithmetic when the number of operators being combined becomes large. `_from_csr_blocks` is a private constructor for now. If use cases emerge we can consider making something similar part of the public interface later. **Related issues or PRs**; - None",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2128

When trying to perform a trivial partial trace (of a ket) when no subsystem is traced over (all subsystems are kept), the result is a ket. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import tensor,basis; psi = tensor(basis(2, 0), basis(2, 1)); print(psi.ptrace([0,1])); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; Quantum object: dims = [[2, 2], [1, 1]], shape = (4, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[0.]; [1.]; [0.]; [0.]]; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. A density operator should be returned for consistency. The documentation (https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-tensor.html) also mentions that: . > Note that the partial trace always results in a density matrix (mixed state), regardless of whether the composite system is a pure state (described by a state vector) or a mixed state (described by a density matrix). ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP version: 4.7.1; ```. ### Additional Context. The issue seems to originate in _ptrace_dense (see https://qutip.org/docs/latest/modules/qutip/qobj.html), where the following code appears:; ```; if not dtrace:; # If we are keeping all dimensions, no need to construct an ndarray.; return Q.copy(); ```; A projector onto the state should be returned here instead of the copy of the state.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2129

I'm wondering if it's possible to use `mesolve` to find the evolution of an arbitrary operator in the Heisenberg picture, where the operators carry all of the time dependence, and thus evolve according to the _adjoint_ Lindblad equation. For some operator $O$, the coherent part is $+i [H,O]$ and the dissipator for a collapse operator $L$ is $L^\dagger O L - \frac{1}{2} L^\dagger L O - \frac{1}{2} O L^\dagger L $.; In particular, I was wondering if there is a way to ""hack"" mesolve to do this without any modification, such as using $-O$ instead of $O$ so that it matches the coherent Schrodinger picture evolution $-i [H,O]$ that `mesolve` does, but I'm not sure about the dissipator. Using $L^\dagger$ instead of $L$ would also change the anticommutator term, which actually shouldn't change between the two pictures. Is there a sneaky way of making this work without too much modification? Otherwise, perhaps this would be a good feature to add?. ### Proposed Solution. Instructions on how to use `mesolve` to solve for the time evolution of an operator in the Heisenberg (not Schrodinger) picture, or an extension of `mesolve` to allow for this, possibly through an option in the function call like `picture=True` which defaults to Schrodinger but if False uses the Heisenberg picture. ### Alternate Solutions. _No response_. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2160

https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2162:177,Integrability,depend,dependency,177,"### Describe the Issue!. The `filelock` package is required for cython-compiling coefficient functions. However, QuTiP currently does not warn if `filelock` is missing, and the dependency does not seem to be documented anywhere. Instead, QuTiP silently defaults to a `StrFunctionCoefficient`, i.e., to using `eval`. This behavior comes from here:. https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/7892453dd3ae03ce8ac17caffc0457df200a69ec/qutip/core/coefficient.py#L256-L264. The default value of `use_cython` is therefore set to `False` if `filelock` is missing. The result is the following:. ```python; $ git clone git@github.com:qutip/qutip.git .; $ conda create -n qutip-tmp python cython numpy scipy setuptools packaging wheel pytest ipython matplotlib; $ conda activate qutip-tmp; $ python setup.py install; $ cd ~; $ ipython; 	import qutip; 	coeff = qutip.coefficient(""sin(t)""); 	type(coeff); 	> qutip.core.cy.coefficient.StrFunctionCoefficient; 	exit(); ```. Since cython is installed and there was no warning or error, I think it would be reasonable for the user to assume that the coefficient would be compiled, but it is not. Only when `use_cython` is explicitly enabled, we get an error:. ```shell; In [5]: coeff = qutip.coefficient(""sin(t)"", compile_opt=qutip.CompilationOptions(use_cython=True)); ---------------------------------------------------------------------------; NameError Traceback (most recent call last); Cell In[5], line 1; ----> 1 coeff = qutip.coefficient(""sin(t)"", compile_opt=qutip.CompilationOptions(use_cython=True)).

The options that can be passed to the solvers are not entirely clear by looking at the documentation. For example:; ![image](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/assets/57414022/2c36d3a5-ca7b-42aa-86d2-cc6f273ed115); Does not show the explicit options even thought it refers to them in the parameter documentation. For comparison, SESolver does show the options. This I assume is because the options are inherited from SESolver. But this is not clear either by looking at `MESolver`'s rendered documentation.; ![image](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/assets/57414022/0d8d7a4d-6326-4d1a-a25e-d67264906f85). When using `help(MESolver)` the documentation of the class is much clearer but perhaps too verbose for the online documentation. ### Proposed Solution. I would suggest we render the options property explicitly for each solver. I would also consider rendering the documentation related to the `run` method. If not, we should render at least `Solver` documentation which does not seem to be listed in the class API documentation for solvers. Affected solvers:; - [ ] MESolver; - [ ] SMESolver; - [ ] SSESolver; - [ ] NonMarkovianMCSolver. ### Alternate Solutions. _No response_. ### Additional Context.

The same can be defined for fermions, with the name `fermionic_destroy`, and `fermionic_create` (better suggestions on names are welcome) that satisfy the anti-commutation relations. ### Proposed Solution. - Implement the function `fermionic_destroy`, and `fermionic_create`.; - Add tests to verify the implementation.; - Add docstrings with the math formulas and conventions used.

For `sprepost` for rectangular operators, it's clear that the expected behavior should correspond to a supoperator taking density matrices in an input hilbert space to one in a potentially different dimensional output hilbert space. However, I think that it's not completely clear what behavior one should expect of `spre` (and `spost`) for rectangular operators. One potentially sensible behavior would be to view `spre` and `spost` as special cases of `sprepost` where one uses the identity isometry between input and output hilbert spaces to form a superoperator which will act like `sprepost(A, A.dag())`. However, I don't think such superoperators will necessarily correspond to CPTP channels as they may not admit Kraus decompositions which obey the completeness relation (I haven't actually checked this, it's just my intuition).

So at the very least the behavior of spre has changed for nonsquare operators. I haven't installed the master branch to see what the current behavior is there but if I'm reading [this commit](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/commit/8d6883da7c373dc65fc3adb88b74c2b27e350db6#diff-53b46f507cc9fff2a9bd96162758693033d4d57ad7e06ea2b58ad3dcee2205d1) correctly, then it appears as though the master branch will just throw a `ValueError(""Can't create and identity like a non square matrix."")`. From searching throw past issues, it looks like these are the relevant pull requests:; - https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1098; - https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1491. For `sprepost` for rectangular operators, it's clear that the expected behavior should correspond to a supoperator taking density matrices in an input hilbert space to one in a potentially different dimensional output hilbert space. However, I think that it's not completely clear what behavior one should expect of `spre` (and `spost`) for rectangular operators. One potentially sensible behavior would be to view `spre` and `spost` as special cases of `sprepost` where one uses the identity isometry between input and output hilbert spaces to form a superoperator which will act like `sprepost(A, A.dag())`. However, I don't think such superoperators will necessarily correspond to CPTP channels as they may not admit Kraus decompositions which obey the completeness relation (I haven't actually checked this, it's just my intuition). Since it appears somewhat doubtful that anyone is currently using `spre` or `spost` with nonsquare operators, my suggestion would actually be to raise a more helpful error that acknowledges there still may be use cases for such a situation.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2171
