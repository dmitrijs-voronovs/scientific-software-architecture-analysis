We use CSRF tokens to protect against such attacks, but there is an additional defense-in-depth cookie attribute that we can use called [SameSite](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#samesite-cookie-attribute). The possible values for this attribute are:. - None => browser always sends this cookie in cross-site requests; - Strict => browser never sends this cookie in cross-site requests; - Lax => browser only sends this cookie in cross-site requests that use ""safe"" HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS). Both Lax and Strict protect against the most primitive forms of CSRF (a form on evil.com submitting a POST to batch.hail.is). Lax seems very reasonable, and still allows linking to, say, linking to jobs from Zulip's web app without the user needing to log in once they get there. Worth noting that this does not protect against [all forms of CSRF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-02#section-5.3.7.1) attacks, so this does not replace CSRF tokens, just provides additional defense-in-depth.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13631

In retrospect this seems kind of obvious. Consider `JVMEntryway`. The first `log` statement occurs on line 98 (the line after we set the filename). I think, in my head, the Appender would be created when we initialized the Logger on line 17. That's apparently incorrect. The Appender is lazily created when some internal buffer fills and the logger flushes that buffer. That internal buffer is most likely to fill on the `log.error` lines because they dump a (large) stack trace to the log. That's why we always see the error there. The fix is simple: we track the currently desired output filename and, if we happen to create an appender *after* someone has called `changeFileInAllAppenders`, we initialize that new appender with the filename. This change ensures that, except for a short period during start up, there is always a valid filename.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded. Check the changes in this PR to ensure they won't cause issues with your project. ------------. **Note:** *You are seeing this because you or someone else with access to this repository has authorized Snyk to open fix PRs.*.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded.

There's [this stack overflow issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77003149/java-function-to-upload-files-to-google-cloud-storage-fails-after-updating-packa) where the fix was to use a different part of the API. We're not using `createFrom` though. I can't even find the source code for `JsonResumableSessionFailureScenario`. ### Version. 0.2.124. ### Relevant log output. ```shell; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: is.hail.JVMEntryway received arguments:; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: 0: /hail-jars/gs:__hail-query-ger0g_jars_13536b531342a263b24a7165bfeec7bd02723e4b.jar.jar; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: 1: is.hail.backend.service.Main; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: 2: /batch/8cca2fb0e9764b6195f85b899fb76986; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: 3: /batch/8cca2fb0e9764b6195f85b899fb76986/log; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: 4: gs://hail-query-ger0g/jars/13536b531342a263b24a7165bfeec7bd02723e4b.jar; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: 5: worker; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: 6: gs://aou_tmp/parallelizeAndComputeWithIndex/OLkY5pgCTBWt2Yw4iCp6WsR2N5drFQmMiQJa7wSE_ik=; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: 7: 9571; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: 8: 12185; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.721 JVMEntryway: INFO: Yielding control to the QoB Job.; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.722 Worker$: INFO: is.hail.backend.service.Worker 13536b531342a263b24a7165bfeec7bd02723e4b; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.722 Worker$: INFO: running job 9571/12185 at root gs://aou_tmp/parallelizeAndComputeWithIndex/OLkY5pgCTBWt2Yw4iCp6WsR2N5drFQmMiQJa7wSE_ik= with scratch directory '/batch/8cca2fb0e9764b6195f85b899fb76986'; 2023-09-24 01:58:16.729 GoogleStorageFS$: INFO: Initializing google storage client from service account key; 2023-09-24 01:58:17.061 WorkerTimer$: ",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13721

To fix this I do a few things:; - installed `git` in the linting image; - `set -e` by default and only enable `set +e` later on when necessary (because we don't want a failed `git diff` to immediately exit); - Do away with the file checking and instead check the error code of the grep.

Main changes that rose form fixing fallout from adding assert in `Block.append`:; - Implement basic control-flow structures (if, while, for, switch) in `CodeBuilderLike` and remove the older implementations from `Code`.; - main difference is these are built from sequencing `Code` operations rather than being defined from LIR; - allows for a higher-level implementation that I think is simpler to read.; - Use the type-system to prevent foot-guns like `cb.ifx(cond, label.goto)`. Other changes:; - rename `ifx`, `forLoop` and `whileLoop` to just `if_`, `for_` and `while_`, respectively.; - Implement loops in-terms of one-another to remove code duplication.; - Fix logic for when to write IRs as some default value behaviour was broken when `HAIL_WRITE_IR_FILES` was set in tests",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13752

For (3), just represent the `AbstractTypedCodecSpec` in terms of a virtual type ~~and a buffer spec~~ (assume the buffer spec is StreamBufferSpec).
