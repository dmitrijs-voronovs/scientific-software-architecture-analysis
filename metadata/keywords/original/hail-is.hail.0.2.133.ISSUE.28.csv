Completely rewrites ExtractIntervalFilters. Instead of matching against very specific patterns, and failing completely for things that don't quite match (e.g. an input is let bound, or the fold implementing ""locus is contained in a set of intervals"" is written slightly differently), this uses a standard abstract interpretation framework, which is almost completely insensitive to the form of the IR, only depending on the semantics. It also correctly handles missing key fields, where the previous implementation often produced an unsound transformation of the IR. Also adds a much more thorough test suite than we had before. At the top level, the analysis takes a boolean typed IR `cond` in an environment where there is a reference to some `key`, and produces a set `intervals`, such that `cond` is equivalent to `cond & intervals.contains(key)` (in other words `cond` implies `intervals.contains(key)`, or `intervals` contains all rows where `cond` is true). This means for instance it is safe to replace `TableFilter(t, cond)` with `TableFilter(TableFilterIntervals(t, intervals), cond)`.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded.

My Scala skills are not great, so I don't know if this is written correctly. Basically, we were making a call to list the blobs recursively to test if the path was a directory which was streaming through the first 5000 records. I made the page size equal to 1 record as we don't care about all records. The next thing I did was to just get the blob properties rather than calling exists + get blob properties. So that will cut the number of HTTP calls by half for every blob. Lastly, listing items in a directory which is used for globbing was making a call to get the metadata for each file and then it was making the 3 API calls above to check whether it's a directory, whether it exists, and what the blob properties are. All of this information is in the original result from listing the blobs in the hierarchy so I just use that information directly.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13368

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded.

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13438:348,Deployability,configurat,configuration,348,"### Background. In the world of low-level container runtimes there exists the term ""bundle"", which basically means the pair of a root filesystem and a `config.json` file containing all of the other necessary information to run the container. If you invoke `crun` or `runc` with `--bundle /path/to/bundle`, the runtime assumes the following:. - The configuration file for the container is located at `/path/to/bundle/config.json`; - That `config.json` contains a field [`root.path`](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/config.md#root) that specifies the location of the root filesystem, most commonly as a path relative to `/path/to/bundle`. `crun` offers a way to explicitly reference the location of `config.json` through its `--config` flag. This seems fairly innocuous, but specifying a custom `--config` path can have some unfortunate unintended consequences because it invalidates the assumption in the specification that the configuration resides at `/path/to/bundle/config.json`. Specifically, it breaks [Hooks](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/config.md#posix-platform-hooks). When a hook is run, the runtime (crun) feeds it the [container state](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/runtime.md#state), a JSON of information about the container including the `bundle` path.

In the world of low-level container runtimes there exists the term ""bundle"", which basically means the pair of a root filesystem and a `config.json` file containing all of the other necessary information to run the container. If you invoke `crun` or `runc` with `--bundle /path/to/bundle`, the runtime assumes the following:. - The configuration file for the container is located at `/path/to/bundle/config.json`; - That `config.json` contains a field [`root.path`](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/config.md#root) that specifies the location of the root filesystem, most commonly as a path relative to `/path/to/bundle`. `crun` offers a way to explicitly reference the location of `config.json` through its `--config` flag. This seems fairly innocuous, but specifying a custom `--config` path can have some unfortunate unintended consequences because it invalidates the assumption in the specification that the configuration resides at `/path/to/bundle/config.json`. Specifically, it breaks [Hooks](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/config.md#posix-platform-hooks). When a hook is run, the runtime (crun) feeds it the [container state](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/runtime.md#state), a JSON of information about the container including the `bundle` path.

The dataset is partitioned into files `file1`, ... `fileN`. A locus may appear in two or more partitions. Usually at most two, though theoretically it could span the tail of one partition, an arbitrary number of partitions, then the head of another. The dataset is large, for example 100GiB. Hail will shuffle this dataset because Hail requires keys to appear in at most one partition. We do not want to shuffle 100GiB. Instead, we want to do repeated reads of a partition if a key spans multiple partitions. Consider a key `k` appearing in `file1` and `file2`. Hail should generate a partition which puts key `k` either in the first or second partition. Without loss of generality, assume it is placed in the first partition. When processing partition 1, Hail will read `file1` and `file2`. It will only read the head of `file2` that contains key `k`. Partition 2 will read `file2` and skip all rows with key `k`. Moreover, the rows are not sorted by the second key field, alleles. Hail should do a within-partition sort of each partition to ensure orderedness. In fact, it can do a within-key sort. We believe this Hail code will achieve this:; ```python3; mt = hl.import_table(...) # globs many files; mt = mt.key_by('locus'); mt = mt.annotate(alleles = [mt.ref, mt.alt]); mt = mt.collect_by_key('rows') # this will do repeated-reads instead of a shuffle; mt = mt.annotate(rows = hl.sorted(mt.rows, lambda x: x.alleles)) # within-partition sort; mt = mt.explode('rows'); mt = mt.annotate(**mt.rows); mt = mt._key_by_assert_sorted('locus', 'alleles') # does not shuffle; mt.write(...); ```. Hail should do some subset of the following:; 1. Notice this situation and do the above automatically.; 2. Provide an option to key_by that does the above.; 3.

In the past, all dev and test databases shared the same MySQL Server (with production), so instead of each service getting its own dedicated database, there was one database per dev/test namespace with all the tables for all the services. This made it difficult to reset the database state of a particular service -- you needed to explicitly delete only the tables for that particular service. Nowadays, dev and test databases live on their own MySQL Servers, so each service gets its own database (like in production). This makes it a lot easier to reset a service's database, we just drop the MySQL database for that service. This PR makes that change, deletes all the now unused `delete-*-tables.sql` files, and adds a dev doc explaining how to reset a dev database. The reason these steps were broken is that the sql configs in dev/test namespaces use K8s DNS for the `host`, which does not work out of the box in batch jobs because they are not in the K8s network. There's code in `database.py` that uses the K8s API to resolve the database host to an IP address that the batch jobs can access. This is why I wrote a python script instead of just using `mysql`. I tested these with the following dev deploy, which scrapped everything and I was able to log in after it was done!. ```; hailctl dev deploy -b daniel-goldstein/hail:dev-ns-delete-db -s delete_auth_tables,delete_batch_tables,deploy_batch,add_developers; ```. cc: @sjparsa, @iris-garden given your recent dev namespace woes",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13456

Hail should provide some mechanism for a user to get the list of successful attempts and their outputs. One simple option is to include some kind of seeded randomness which the user can access and to return either the seed or all the draws of the successful attempt for each job in `/jobs` or for the one job in `/job/{job_id}`. For example, consider:. ```; j = b.new_job(); j.command('echo hello gsutil cp - gs://bucket/final-output-$(/hail-random-str)'); ```. Where `/hail-random-str` is a binary we mount into the container that randomly generates numbers seeded by `(batch id, job id, attempt id)`. Hail should use the same randomness to ensure that `write_output` is reliable. We might also want a way to automatically remove the output files of the non-successful (e.g. preempted) attempts. ### Version. 0.2.120. ### Relevant log output. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13502

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13513:214,Deployability,update,update,214,"This PR adds a new token and time_completed column to the `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states` table. The reason for doing this is twofold:. 1. This will get rid of the serialization in MJC where every job needs to update the same row in the `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states` table.; 2. We also push marking the batch complete to outside of the MJC stored procedure as a separate database query. The current code for marking a batch complete won't work for job groups (or at least not without a complicated query I don't know how to easily write) because the job group completion state check needs to be vectorized up the ancestors tree. The mechanism for how this works is there is a new `mark_batch_complete` function in Python that is executed after every MJC. There's also a periodic loop that looks for batches that are complete (n_jobs == n_completed), but have not had state = ""complete"". This makes sure we eventually update the batch state when complete even if MJC is interrupted. The new `mark_batch_complete` function optimistically tries to update the batch state and time_completed if `n_jobs == n_complete AND state != ""complete""`. If an update occurs, then the function issues a callback if specified; otherwise, it just returns. `time_completed` is tracked as a new column on the `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states` table where we take the GREATEST timepoint when updating a row on duplicate key. Then the time_completed is just equal to the MAX of all entries in the table for that batch. I'm still proving backwards compatibility to myself without manually copying time_completed to the `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states` table from the `batches` table. I believe that if we have a running batch:. (A) MJC in SQL uses the new token column when inserting into `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states`, but all new entries are always inserted at token=0 so the original SQL queries currently running on the server execute the same.
