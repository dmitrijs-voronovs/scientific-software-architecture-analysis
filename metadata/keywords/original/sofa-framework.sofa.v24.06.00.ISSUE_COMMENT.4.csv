In the past it was consider that draw tools was a rendering abstraction layer to be used for debugging/inspection or GUI helpers. The recommendation was to use drawTools in the Base::visual() overrides. The main ideas was to allow component developpers to have rendering tools without having a dependency to opengl. On its side, OglXXX component in Sofa.GL exists to hold compoennts that, for whatever reason (performance, lack of time), are still implemented using the opengl api. Up to now, the evolution guidelines was something like:; - replace in the complete code base ogl call by drawTools calls into xxx::draw() ; - move every component for which ogl call remains (mostly in xxxx:drawVisual) into the Sofa.GL.XXX. This PR does something else, as it replace opengl calls from Sofa.GL.OglXXX by drawTools's ones. Implementing component rendering using drawTools instead of ogl calls is probably desirable (if there is no performance cost)... but it cannot be in Sofa.GL. .

I think the PR contains a variation for ""template"" of this pattern with the unspecializedInit(). In most of the case I noticed that the ""call super"" was a bad design choice as it delegate the ""validity"" of the implementation to the child/specialization instead of enforcing the behavioral validity by code structure. ; Example of the call super ""design""; ```cpp; class GeneralImplementation; {; public:; void doSomethingCrucial(); ; virtual void init(); {; doSomethingCrucial();; }; }. class UserImplementation : GeneralImplementation; {; public:; virtual void init(); {; GeneralImplementation::init(); ; }; }; ```; And how it can be change to prevent mis-implementation:; ```cpp; class GeneralImplementation; {; public:; void doSomethingCrucial();; void init(); {; doSomethingCrucial();; doInit(); ; }; ; protected:; virtual void doInit() = 0; ; }. class UserImplementation : GeneralImplementation; {; public:; final void doInit() override; {; /// my specific things; }; }; ```; I don't know if this could/may/must be applied to BilateralInteractionConstraint...but at first sight it looks like a good sanbox. . 4) Mixing reset/init; I see that reset() is actually calling init().

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3126#issuecomment-1187087614:200,Usability,clear,clearer,200,"Hi @alxbilger . Thanks for the PR and requesting a review. The existing code makes the assumption we only want Vec3 and Rigid3, the PR builds on that assumption to make the implementation cleaner and clearer. The changes dones are relevant and can probably merged as-is. . Nevetheless the PR makes the underlying assumption that we only want Vec3Type and Rigid3Type is questionnable in several ways and is also connected to several of Sofa's code architecture issues that are worht discussing. 1) Do we want to support 1, 2,4, 6d constraint ? ; If this is the case then the current non specialized implementation need to be check it actually compiles and do the expected thing. If this is not the case we should consider fixing that.; But if handling 1,2,4, 6d is not possible nor a desirable property the we should consider making code extension through in-heritance and subclassing instead of templatization. . 2) Asymetrical implementation regarding the floating point precision: ; The current implemented allows users to add extra instanciation for Vec3 (f,d) but do not allow such a thing for Rigid3f. This asymetry in implementation is weird to me as I tend to think that if there is functionnal equivalence regarding the templated data (i.e that one data type is in no way special against the other => Vec3 is i no way ""better"" compared to Rigid3) then this functionnal equivalence results in a code base that exhibit symmetrical implementation where the Vec3 and Rigid3 are treated the same. This is not the case as one is specialized in .cpp while the other is not specialized and is implemented in the .inl. . 3) Shouldn't we remove the ""call-super"" ? ; The code and PR makes use of what we call the ""call super""design patern in which an specialization or an in-herited class must call its parent/general implementation to behave correctly. I think the PR contains a variation for ""template"" of this pattern with the unspecializedInit(). In most of the case I noticed that the ""call super"" w",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3126#issuecomment-1187087614

I'm not sure how this PR is affecting / handling that (i.e. if you set a `float` value as a default to a `Data<int>`, how the gcc/clang/msvc error messages look like?); * one drawback in the current design is that there are sometimes bugs introduced by the multiple overloads of `initData()`, because of the ambiguity between the optional default value and the optional pair of bool flags at the end. In particular, for a `Data<std::string>`, calling `initData(&d, ""mydefaultvalue"", ""mydata"", ""help message"")` w",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3167#issuecomment-1196855283

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3231#issuecomment-1236791920:334,Performance,perform,performances,334,"I just had a look on the implementation of `FullVector`. I notice the following differences between `operator[](Index i)` and `element(Index i)`:. - `element(Index i)` is virtual; - `element(Index i)` returns necessarily a `SReal` independent from the type of `FullVector`. It may lead to a type conversion therefore an impact on the performances. But usually, all the components are compiled with `SReal`, so I am not sure there is a conversion here.

The problem adressed by the PR is often seen in SOFA's base classes where a parent class is having virtual function defined to print ""no implemented"" (or to print nothing).

The proposed solution of moving functions in a separated object is going in the right direction (as pointed by @alxbilger by segregating the intefaces). But it is unclear to me if the implementation proposed in the PR is enough because:; - having PartialLinearSolver inheriting from BaseObject looks weird for an ""interface"", ; - using dynamic cast to detect the ""features"" in the ConstraintCorrection, ... ; - the implementation in BTD also looks highly suspicious with:; - plenty of ""debug/trace"" mapped to Datas as if the feature was ""not stable"" or only working in some case.; - a boolean to control if we use the PartialLinearSolver part of the API or if we don't... and I wonder if the actually really work for full & partial solving or only for one of the two APIs.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3241#issuecomment-1227045937

Thanks for reviewing the PR. ; BaseData::read is an existing function in sofa, that do the reading from a stream into a data field. . The PR does not change only how it was implemented. Before the PR, Data::read is duplicated for every type of data stored in the data field while in most of the case the reading pattern is the same. With the PR the ""shared"" behavior is moved into the base class which allows to enforce a consistent behavior regarding error checking & resetting the value when the field to parse is empty.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3278#issuecomment-1265265315

It was decided to unify all the scene template/type to use the same convention as the one used in DataTypeInfo<>. So ```f``` instead of ```float```, ```vector<f>``` instead of ```vector<float>```, ```Vec3d``` instead of ```Vec<3, double>```. Unifying the other way around would have implied to use ```Vec<3, double>``` in our scene templates... which was a bit too much :); With that in mind, the current implementation of DataExchange is behaving exactly as it should. . The unittest you are pointing is showing a normal behavior. This behavior is that the template type that does not have a Name() static method and used in a class that is not implementing GetCustomTemplate will fall back to the automatic generation decoded from the typeid(). But this automatic generation is the code we want to get rid of (if one day someone has enough time to fix that) and not desired behavior to align with. Automatic decoding function to avoid breaking too much things until future evolution. . So currently the DataExchange implementation is using GetCustomClassName in order to implement consistent templates name with the other sofa components and not relying on the automatic generation. . If you are interested in unifying things i would recommend:; short term: implement a way to automatically use the DataTypeInfo<>::name() in the NameDecoder.

But I also wonder how two cubes can be equivalent. We compare two floating-point types, more specifically, the center of a cube along the largest dimension.

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3687#issuecomment-1447335507:1786,Testability,benchmark,benchmarks,1786,"> If I understand correctly, the problem comes from the fact that two equivalent cubes (in terms of the comparison predicate) are not in the same order depending on the platform (compiler). In my opinion, it creates collision responses that are also ordered differently. And the order in collision responses is important (see #2067). Yes, but a small precision in this case the determinism is set across the different compilers (and more precisely the different implementations of the STL). A priori the same compiler/libstd will create the same result. > But I also wonder how two cubes can be equivalent. We compare two floating-point types, more specifically, the center of a cube along the largest dimension. I suspect that both cubes are perfectly aligned in an orthogonal dimension. It is probably due to the construction of the scene (torus are aligned along the X axis), or the symmetry of the geometry. @fredroy do you know when the discrepancy happens? Is it at the very beginning?. Yes, at the very beginning.; Here is a dump of the container being sorted (left linux/gcc and right windows/msvc), after running 1 step ; showing { minBBox maxBBox } for each element. ![diff_gcc_msvc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11028016/221719424-3d8e3a07-23cc-47ce-b277-08673889b83e.png). It is trying to sort according to the axis X and you can see the highlighted lines have the same X. > ; > If we don't want to use `stable_sort` because it is slower, maybe we can make a smarter comparison predicate? For example, if the largest dimension is equivalent, let's compare the second largest dimension etc. Yes, it could be an other solution, but in this end, does `sort() + multiple_test_axis_predicate < stable_sort() + oneaxis_predicate` ? not so sure and it would need more benchmarks.

This is very similar to a `std::tuple` except that the identifiers of the variables is maintained, as well as the added function (such as `addBehaviorModel` and `removeBehaviorModel`). There is a ""universal"" getter (you can equivalently do `n.mapping.push_back(nullptr);` or `get<BaseMapping>(n).push_back(nullptr);` or `n.addMapping(nullptr);`). If we decide to go to this direction, there is difficulty to implement it due to the inhertiance between `Node` and `BaseNode`.
