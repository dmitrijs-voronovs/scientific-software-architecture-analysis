I know you have all put a lot of work in the code and especially the canonicalization code works very smooth now and I could process the 9.6 million compounds within our Simosa database without any problem using the 2.3.0rc2. ; But these tests were on neutral compounds and it was only yesterday when I started working on the output of the pKa calculator of ChemAxon that I discovered this discrepancy. ; The given ring system is also one of those cases where different programs behave differently. For instance with the ChemAxon tools there are multiple models and in one model the ring is being considered as aromatic while with the other it is not. So I guess this one of those rather particular cases when several rules coincide when using kekulize,cpp on this ring.

Will the MinGW build still work if the lib is in a different folder than the executables?.

I'm not sure; it's even possible to have a dynamically linked openbabel on mingw. Anyhow, I moved libopenbabel.* and libinchi.*; to /usr/local/lib - everything still works.; In my opinion lib*.a should be in /usr/local/lib while lib*.dll should be together with the executables. At least this seems to be the way with the other packages.

On Windows with 2.3.0 I don't, but neither do I get any useful results. Some groups, like nitro and isonitrile can be represented in more than one way, e.g. [C-]#[N+]* or [C]$[N]* or C$N* , When making a fs index they are converted automatically to the non-dative form, but the mechanism for dealing with this during searching has got broken. I'll remove the automatic conversion of dative bonds (it can still be applied manually) during the indexing. In the meantime, a partial workaround is to search the current version of an fs index for C$N rather than [C-]#[N+] and switch off the second-stage SMARTS search using the -an option. The result set can be filtered manually using the [C-]#[N+] form.; obabel dataset.fs -osmi -s C$N -an | obabel -ismi -osmi -s [C-]#[N+].

I suppose really I should have a bash at fixing the problems rather than giving you work :-P. The set I was using was based on the ChEBI database as of about 9 months ago. What I was actually hoping to round trip was not OpenBabel, but a SMILES writer I have just written. The hope being to convert from SMILES to InChI and check that its output is equivalent to the InChI output from my program. I did indeed find a few corner cases my SMILES writer failed which I've now fixed but I haven't gone through all the discrepancies....mainly as most of them were coming from OpenBabel :-P. Such a set could be created directly from ChEBI although I have a feeling that for some records the InChI and SMILES don't quite correspond to each other e.g. differences like connected vs disconnected [H+] on acids, which may give false failures.

I used windows 7 64bit. As the first row says in my comment. As far as I know in windows only one command prompt exists (except the superuser mode, which is the same),; But I tried linux (salix64) also but custom user installation was not successful (it was successful but the use was buggy) and my own build failed, I dropped it for better times. >(b1) I think you need to wait longer.; I think ~ 1hr waiting is enough long on a Athlon X4 2.9 GHz machine. >(b2) You need to read the docs for obabel.; As I wrote, I tried to follow the help. In that is recommended to use obabel instead of babel, but perhaps I did not dig too deep.; BTW: you recommend to read documentation, but what would you do when you are reading the followings (see my original post):. ""Options, other than -i -o -O -m, must come a f t e r the input files.""; Next lines:; ""Usage:; obabel [-i<input-type>] <infilename> [-o<output-type>] -O<outfilename> [Options]"". In the first, in/output type should f o l l o w the files, the second shows should be b e f o r e the files. Which one is true ?. I have tried both but with same results.

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1150#issuecomment-281801289:58,Safety,avoid,avoiding,58,"Hi again Noel,. I must change my last remark: your ""hack"" avoiding the SER problem has some issue. Not straightforward to say why, though. To generate the bug, follow your advice: take a peptide ending with a SERINE, get the smiles string, turn it into a PDB without -d or --gen3d, then into a 3D PDB.; As you said, the file ""looks"" fine, and so does the structure. However, there must be something wrong somewhere, I'd say angles or distances, because when I prepare such generated PDB files for docking (prepare_ligand4.py, from the MGL tools kit), the output PDBQT structure is missing bonds. Mainly backbone ones, but the weirdest thing is that aromatic cycles are not generated flat (REALLY not flat, in some cases). This bug is 100% repeatable with OpenBabel 2.3.1 that I'm using. All the peptides generated through those two step PDB have the same issue, while the ones directly generated through the classic -d --gen3d from the smiles string seem to generate correct PDBQT files so far, with the MGL tools kit. . Interestingly, I found that OpenBabel 2.3.0 occasionally generated PDB files bahaving the same way, even when generated in a single -d --gen3d step. There might have been a fix made to the one-step (smiles -> 3D PDB) generation, that wasn't applied to the (no coordinate PDB -> 3D PDB) conversion. Anyway, this two-step conversion idea was worth trying, while waiting for the bug to be fixed, so thanks. I'll wait for the bug fix now. I hope Geoff's work is going well on that part!; Cheers.

The problem is the new code to read the Standard orientation instead of the input orientation. It goes through the file looking for the second occurance of ""orientation"". However, if the ""nosym"" keyword had been supplied, only the input orientation is printed. The while loop then runs till EOF - at which point the following rewind will no longer work (the abstract stream object is gone?), the stream pointer is still at ""-1"" and the subsequent parsing fails. I have changed this now so that the orientation keyword is read every time and if the string ""Symmetry turned off by external request."" is found, only the first orientation is read. It has to be parsed directly as the input orientation is printed before the ""Symmetry turned off"" string, and then all we would have for parsing would be that latter string.

The connection to the H is implicit here, not explicit, isn't it? And I don't think the radical thing is having any effect. Take the following three molecules:. CC(=O)N; CC(=O)[NH]; CC(=O)[NH2]. the query [ND1] matches all of these molecules in Daylight, but only the first in OB. Equally the query [Nh2] (N with 2 implicit H's) matches the first and third molecules in Daylight, but only the first in OB. I agree OB is internally consistent here, it's just not agreeing with Daylight, which is what's giving me headaches as I try to port some old code. Here's the relevant bit from the SMILES manual:. <begin>. 3.4.1 Hydrogens; Hydrogen atoms do not normally need to be specified when writing SMILES for most organic structures. The presence of hydrogens may be specified in three ways: . Implicitly.....for atoms specified without brackets, from normal valence assumptions. Explicitly by count.....inside brackets, by the hydrogen count supplied; zero if unspecified. As explicit atoms.....as [H] atoms. <end>. So while I agree they've not made it very clear, my reading of the second point is that if you specify the H count inside the brackets, you've explicitly specified the implicit H count!. What fun cheminformatics can be!. P.

Taking the same three molecules from below, if I use the query [Nv2] (N with total bond order of 2), then none of them match in OB, whereas the second one (i.e. the radical) does in Daylight.

I agree that it's probably not a bug, although it does mean you are interpreting SMILES strings differently to Daylight, which may not be what people expect. Do you know how other software handles these H's?. For my original purpose, a better query would be something like [Nv2H1], which is unambiguous (obviously once the other bug has been fixed). Coming from a background where our compounds are (nearly) always stored as SMILES, I'd probably been using the Dn descriptor a little lazily. If you can (almost) guarantee no explicit H's, it's phenomenally useful for generating simple queries for e.g. primary amines, pyridones etc. that are independent of tautomeric / protomeric state.

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1188#issuecomment-281802039:467,Usability,simpl,simple,467,"To be honest I kind of agree with you on the whole Dn thing - using queries that rely on explicit vs implicit H's does just sound like a bad idea. Perhaps I shouldn't have waxed quite so lyrical in my previous response. I have been caught out a couple of times even in a SMILES + Daylight environment - deuterated compounds being one example.... To answer your question, if you do make the assumption that all H's are implicit, then a query for a primary amine is as simple as [ND1][CX4], and you can capture both pyridone tautomers with [nD2]c~[OD1]. ""Dn"" becomes a synonym for ""is bonded to n heavy atoms"", which can come in very handy. But to reiterate, on reflection I think this is slightly sloppy querying on my part, and I certainly wouldn't suggest changing the way OB works just so that these queries work as expected. (Though I'd be interested to know how many other people use similar kinds of queries). I do think it would be worth finding out what some of the other major software vendors do with the H descriptor in a SMILES string though, even if this is just a matter of internal representation. To put it another way, if everybody else does it the same way Daylight does, is there a good reason OB is different?. Anyway, thanks for making me think this through a bit more rigorously!.

I have reproduced the problem with the cclib test file but I don't have trunk binaries around right now. I am building a binary with that revision now and will check.

And I don't think it's with OB. You shouldn't put anything inside a Begin/EndModify block that relies on perceived data. The whole point of the block is to postpone the reperception until the final EndModify. Within the block, if the perception code becomes invalid, it is not updated and so you get segfaults if you use it. The specific cause here is either:; (a) the fact that DeleteAtom marks the LSSR and SSSR as needed to be reperceived. This would be reperceived automatically next time the user asks for the SSSR but here you do this within a Modify block, and so the recalculation of the SSSR is suppressed.; or; (b) DeleteAtom contains its Begin/EndModify block, indicating that various perceived information has been invalidated. Since you access the information before the outer EndModify is reached, the vengeful Furies descend.

I see your point about not relying on perceived data once you've made a modification. (Although even there ... what, exactly, invalidates perceived data? It's not clear at all.). On the other hand, getting a segfault for code that looks perfectly reasonable is always bad. Was it reasonable for me to guess that doing a SMARTS match for ""[Fe]"" was going to use the (invalidated) LSSR to recompute the aromaticity of every atom? It cost me a couple days to track this down. (The real code was much more complex than the example posted above ... the atom.Delete() was far, far removed in both time and space from the pattern.Match() call.).

I think my main request is if we could put all the json formats and the related code into a ""json"" directory, much like src/formats/xml -- I think this would organize things much better for people. We probably need to organize the rest of the formats, but that's not relevant for this patch. If you can organize the files better, I'll merge immediately.

Yeah I never opened a pull request for this because I wasn't confident enough that it didn't break anything - especially considering it makes fairly significant changes to the reading and writing of MDL Molfiles. In particular:; - I'm not really sure how Open Babel handles zero-order bonds internally in general. Do any other changes have to be made to accommodate that?; - I had to change AddHydrogens so it doesn't reset the ImplicitValencePerceived flag (just like it doesn't reset the ChiralityPerceived flag). Hopefully that doesn't cause any problems elsewhere.; - I haven't extensively tested the implementation of the algorithm. Everything seems fine, but I just tested it on some of the structures in the supplementary information for the paper. Alex Clark may be the best person to check it over, if he is able to. .

I'm using now the function for structures with partial occupancy sites (for example 50% Si and 50% Al). For the structures I have your FillUnitCell implementation will break my code (and not only mine). To solve the problem, I think, will be enough to add an atom label to the hash. Optional suggestion. My filling is that FillUnitCell cannot hangs on real structures with all atoms to all atoms distance algorithm. 1000 atoms (1E6 pairs) will be processed in a few second. But if you want to make the function as fast as possible and little bit more universal I have a few suggestion.; 1) It will be good to control accuracy of the duplicity. For this I can suggest not to use string hash, but make a class with overridden ""<"" operator which can compare vectors with some precision (and also atom labels). And after that use the class in set. The implementation should be significantly faster.; 2) Use in second part of the function (where you check the duplicity of the transformed structures) not all coordinateSet, but set, with only transformed coordination of the site. .

In this case, fractional coordinate absolute accuracy should be 0.5^n, where n is the number of steps used. I'll play around with an octree implementation soon, as it's definitely better. Until then, the hash approach proves the point and required only small changes to the source. Thanks for looking into this and giving advice!

The atom label could be easily added to the hash, although I'm not understanding how the cif file is organized. Do you have Si and Al atoms overlapping?. > Optional suggestion. My filling is that FillUnitCell cannot hangs on real structures with all atoms to all atoms distance algorithm. 1000 atoms (1E6 pairs) will be processed in a few second. My issue is that I'm using unit cells with ~10,000 atoms, so 1E8 pairs. I have some cifs that take a few hours on the O(N^2) FillUnitCell :(. > 1) It will be good to control accuracy of the duplicity. For this I can suggest not to use string hash, but make a class with overridden ""<"" operator which can compare vectors with some precision (and also atom labels). And after that use the class in set. The implementation should be significantly faster.; > 2) Use in second part of the function (where you check the duplicity of the transformed structures) not all coordinateSet, but set, with only transformed coordination of the site. You're right that there are better approaches than the hash. In fact, game developers have hyper-optimized 3-dimensional collision detection approaches.

I would be more in favour of getting rid of our data files for non user-editable things and moving them into .h files. This opinion is somewhat influenced by Roger's voice asking me why we spend so much time on start up reading these files every time someone runs obabel, instead of just statically initialising an array of cstrings. Actually a number of them are already transformed into .h files for fall-back data. I'm not convinced the startup time is actually significant, but we can certainly try more of the compile-in .h files. My reasoning for the data files is to more easily get users quick-fix bug patches for certain things. -Geoff",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/45#issuecomment-29559580

I believe bond-type 5 is a sort of internal ""this might be aromatic"" flag. After parsing, kekulize.cpp changes these to single/double. My guess is that some ""implicit-H-perceived"" flag isn't getting set if the bond-type == 5 during kekulization. It seems right that BOSum() + GetImplicitHydrogenCount() would be constant under normal valence situations ... but ""constant"" is tricky with S, P, N and so forth, e.g. with double-bonded oxygens.

This was because package that is submitted to PyPI is created from the contents of the `python` directory. See here: https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/commit/3cf839f34eb3375f2cebc57193705b8f1192e676. However, it doesn't look like this has worked correctly, and we now have two `openbabel-python.i` files that are out of sync... It's probably best to figure out a way to go back to having just a single file, but still maintaining the ability to build the python bindings package for submission to PyPI. It may be possible to update `MANIFEST.in` to pull in the file from the parent directory, or if not, maybe we should just keep `scripts/python/openbabel-python.i`, however, that will be inconsistent with the other language bindings.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/137#issuecomment-89657455

(ii) I think the check Noel is referring to, and @jeffjanes for cross-compilation, is processor support. I agree with @jeffjanes that there is an issue where the library could be compiled on a computer with processor support, then run on a computer without it. The most common example is packaging for operating systems. Shipping rpms that require the popcnt instruction would be less than ideal. I also know of several pharma companies that use a module system such that openbabel is run from the same binaries/dynamic libraries on disparate hardware from new to 6+ years old. So, I think there should be some CMake variable set by the user at compilation time for turning it on or off. I don't have strong opinions on defaulting to on or off.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/184#issuecomment-105712012

Of course trying to do that in a portable way would also be problematic. Another the issue is that the ""emulated"" __builtin_popcount you get when lacking the -mpopcnt flag is probably better than the fallback which openbabel uses. So we would need to improve that fall-back method as well, or some systems would end up worse off. . Unless we put the two Tanimoto functions in different compilation modules, and compiled one with -mpopcnt and one without that, but with identical source code. This is rapidly getting over my head. Does anyone know of other examples of packaged software that has dealt with this issue?

So I'm reading this as something that will be fixed by-and-by when Virtual Box updates to the latest qemu, rather than something we need to address.

The ultimate problem is that the openbabel GUI supports either boolean options (uses a checkbox) or options with parameters (uses a textbox), but not a combination of the two. So the GUI right now cannot provide the user a way to choose the three combinations (no ""xw"", ""xw"" with no text, ""xw"" with text). But rather than change the GUI, it's clearer to the user if you just add another option. Regarding (2), it's up to you - I'm not familiar with the use cases. Here is my suggestion:; - no option: default order (presumably this is the order of atoms in the input molecule); - -xw : Sort atoms by atomic number; - -xy 'Al': Al first, then default order; - -xw -xy 'Al': Al first, then sort atoms by atomic number",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/188#issuecomment-225157627

Interestingly, I wasn't able to find any `LC_RPATH` commands in the dylib images, even if `otool -L` shows that libs are linked with `@rpath` definition. In my case this affects libcairo, which is linked as `@rpath/./libcairo.2.dylib`. Of course, without an `@rpath` defined the lib can't be found and hence not loaded (leading to loss of functionality, for which I actually wanted to create another issue). Does this qualify as a bug in the build/linking process?. I guess a user wanting to compile openbabel with python bindings from source on OSX, using non-system python (like anaconda), now only has the option to manually fix library paths using `otool -L`. I wonder whether it's possible to do this during the build process. For example, if e.g. `-DPYTHON_LIBRARY` or `-DCAIRO_LIBRARY` are set, the linker could be instructed to use the provided path name instead of the install_name to link the library (maybe after checking if the install_name is valid). Alternatively, one could post-process the various libraries using `install_name_tool` to fix the path of dynamically linked objects.

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/203#issuecomment-186284645:300,Testability,test,tests,300,"At least for pdbqtformat.cpp, part of the problem seems to be a difference between clang and gcc in how clang handles a decrement of an iterator. In clang (at least on Yosemite) a decrement of an iterator already at .begin() can produce a segfault on subsequent use, so you have to add lots of extra tests. What I have tried so far in pdbqtformat.cpp that seems to work (at least for 4dui.pdb) at line 499 ff in pdbqtformat.cpp is. ```; multimap <unsigned int, unsigned int>::iterator it=how_many_atoms_move.begin();; if ((!moves_many) && !how_many_atoms_move.empty()) {it=how_many_atoms_move.end();; if (it!=how_many_atoms_move.begin())--it;}; for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= depth; i++); {; free_bonds.insert((*it).second);; if (!moves_many) {if (it!=how_many_atoms_move.begin())--it;}; else{if (it!=how_many_atoms_move.end())++it;}; }; ```. This would suggest are review of all cases of --it or it-- in all iterator uses to make sure they are protected for use with clang. ALternatively one could report it as a clang bug, but I am not sure how productive that would be.; -- H. J.
