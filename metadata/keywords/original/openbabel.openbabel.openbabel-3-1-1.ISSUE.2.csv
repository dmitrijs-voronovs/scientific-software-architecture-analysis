However if you write it to a diferent format, like pdb it works fine. I just wanted to notify this bug, since it's easy to overcome using a temp file. . I'm running the pybel module through terminal in mac os El Capitan, installed the openbabel python bindings through homebrew. I'm not sure if this is a bug due to my build or if it is a bug in the code.; I look forward to your response ; Cross. Reported by: crossjenkins.

I use a SMILES code to generate the initial structure (a MOL2 file) of a molecule, it will have the correct connectivity as specified by the SMILES code. In the next step, I further minimize this MOL2 file using obminimize (or just generate a new MOL2 file), only to find the connectivity is now completely wrong. The problem/bug is most acute in aromatic molecules, where the loss of aromaticity information means there are many hydrogen atoms missing.; ; Attached are some examples for your use. I'm using Babel 2.3.2 on MacOS Sierra, though I was able to replicate the error in Debian Linux using the same version of Babel. Thanks again for the great work with Babel!. Cheers,; Jernej.

The guanidinium group is perceived as Arg-N=C([NH2+])N, which is a H-deficient N, instead of Arg-[N+]=C(N)N for example.

The segfault does not always occur when accessing the first Atom and does not consistently happen on the same Atom when running the exact same code multiple times in succession but it does usually happen within the first 5-10 Atoms. ## Notes.

My current workaround which appears to be working is to have a wrapper python atom class around the pybel atom class with variables to keep a copy of all the data that I use from the pybel atom. I initialize those variables in my wrapper's constructor right after the pybel Atom and OBAtom are constructed before their data becomes corrupted. My speculation would be that somewhere in the (pybel Atom -> swig OBAtom wrapper -> C++ OBAtom -> variable) chain memory is being deallocated even though I still have a reference to the pybel Atom. This is because using the debugger I was able to determine that I can access an Atom's variable (e.g. ""valence"") right after I initialize it without a failure and then receive a segmentation fault when trying to access the same variable at the same memory location later in the program.

In the end no changes were made to the data structures used to store information, but the handling of the existing file formats has been tweaked. Storing undervalent atoms in MOL files now uses the valence field, rather than M RAD. M RAD is only used if a spin has been specified. Now reading undervalent atoms from SMILES does not set the spin (it did previously). For depiction, changes were needed to ensure that radical dots were depicted in the same situations as before (by testing for either spin or undervalence).",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1626

This has been resolved in lines **554-555** like this:; ```; if (!atom); break; // something is very wrong; ```; My suggestion is to simply declare `modeCount` as `int`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1772

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1840:867,Availability,avail,available,867,"- [ ] I believe this to be a bug with Open Babel; - [x] This is a feature request. ## Environment Information; Open Babel version: 2.4.1; Operating system and version: macOS High Sierra 10.13.4; Programing Language: C++. ##. Is it possible to generate all kekulize forms for an aromatic molecule using canonical SMILES?; In my case, I need to take into account all possible positions of double bond inside an aromatic ring. for exmaple this SMILES ```C1=CC=C(C(=C1)N)[N+](=O)[O-]``` only illustrate one out of two possible kekulize forms of the molecule. since the molecule is not symetric it is important to know the other form in which the position of double bond inside the aromatic ring is altered. I noticed that there are some c++ openbabel functions that can kekulize molecules such as **start_kekulize()** or **expand_kekulize()** but these functions are not available any more and also I think they just generate one form out of all possible kekulize forms for a given molecule. ; I would be so grateful if you could help me solving the problem. -->",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1840

A drive-by removal of code in EndModify() that I recognise as a workaround for the problem fixed in #1724. I know that there's an idea that all lazily perceived flags should be blown away in EndModify(), but I think this is going too far - we should try as far as possible to avoid blowing away information that has been perceived. Here I make a minor change so that aromaticity perception is preserved even when, for example, an atom is deleted (which triggers this code). IMO, this keeps things simpler and more understandable. Aromaticity will only be reperceived when the user directly unsets the aromaticity flag of the OBMol. Until then, they can delete all they want and nothing will change. If the user deletes an atom from benzene and writes it out as SMILES and sees that it is aromatic, they will soon realise what's going on. This is easier to understand than the current situation, where if you want to preserve the aromatic flags then you need to set the molecule as having aromaticity perceived after deleting an atom.

An input molecule is separated into fragments by cutting rotatable bonds. ; 2. If a fragment is in the fragment database which we prepared, the coordinates of atoms in the fragment were set according to the fragment information.; 3. Connect fragments and set coordinates of atoms which do not belong to any fragment. This idea is inspired from [\[A Andronico, et al., ‎2011\]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci100223t). # How to use; My implementation is an update of current OBBuilder. You can use previous codes. The example code below gets a SMILES from standard input and outputs a SDF to standard output.; ```cpp; #include <iostream>; #include <openbabel/mol.h>; #include <openbabel/obconversion.h>; #include <openbabel/builder.h>. int main() {; OpenBabel::OBConversion conv(&std::cin, &std::cout);; OpenBabel::OBMol mol;; OpenBabel::OBBuilder builder;. conv.SetInAndOutFormats(""SMI"", ""SDF"");; conv.Read(&mol);; builder.Build(mol);; conv.Write(&mol);; }; ```. # Implementation details; Fragments are generated by `obfragment.cpp` and the output is sorted by `obsort-fragment.cpp`.; I used [The Platinum Dataset](https://www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/forschung/acm/datasets.html) to generate `rotation-fragments.txt`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1850

Some formats or existing code may not be expecting this behavior, so it is currently hidden behind an `OB_PERIODIC_MOL` flag in `OBMol`. See also https://github.com/openbabel/enhancement-proposals/pull/6 for more discussion. Currently this PR is more of a minimum viable product, but over the summer I'm planning to submit additional PR's after combing through more of the codebase. This PR also adds an option to write bonding information to CIF output, including notation for bonds across periodic boundaries. Before the code can be merged, there's a handful of details to take care of:. 1. There are some merge conflicts (and we should be careful that any changes are compatible with PR#1823). What's the quickest/cleanest way to address these?; 2. Const correctness is tricky: I couldn't keep the `const` keyword on `OBBond::GetLength()` without making a lot of other changes to `OBMol::HasFlag` and some related methods.; 3. What is best practice for the argument of `OBGenericData->Clone(NULL)`? Is it NULL, the OBMol, or something context-dependent?; 4. Any other comments or cleanup would also be appreciated. Thanks!.

This system of equations aims to minimize all charges in the system, subject to the constraint that the system is charge neutral. I won't go into details of the method here, but it uses Lagrange multipliers and eventually solves a problem similar to `Ax = b` where `x` contains the charges in the system. . The main difficulty of this method is constructing `A`, but each entry contains a few terms, including Coulombic terms, idempotential and orbital overlap energy. # Orbital Overlap Energy; In the derivation Wilmer et al. talk about the orbital overlap energy term (or short-ranged damping term), which they define as. <a href=""https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=E_o(r_{ij})&space;=&space;\sum_m&space;\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K}&space;\right&space;)^2}&space;\left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K}&space;=&space;\frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2}&space;-&space;\frac{1}{r_{ij}}&space;\right&space;)&space;\right&space;)"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_o(r_{ij})&space;=&space;\sum_m&space;\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K}&space;\right&space;)^2}&space;\left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K}&space;=&space;\frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2}&space;-&space;\frac{1}{r_{ij}}&space;\right&space;)&space;\right&space;)"" title=""E_o(r_{ij}) = \sum_m \left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K} \right )^2} \left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K} = \frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2} - \frac{1}{r_{ij}} \right ) \right )"" /></a>.

I wrote up an example failure in the first commit of this PR, where assigning a charge of -1 to an atom can give it 255 implicit hydrogens under certain conditions. I suspect the underlying cause is unsigned integer arithmetic in phmodel.cpp:321 (possibly also 343). Subtraction of two unsigned ints gives an unsigned int--if the difference would be negative, then the result is wrapped back to `UINT_MAX`, e.g. printing `(j->second - old_bond_order)` gives 4294967295 instead of -1. Then there's some truncation to fit in the unsigned char. But even if the overall expression gives the right answer most of the time, I think it would be clearer to be more explicit about the math, which would fix special cases like this bug. How should we adjust the line(s) of code in phmodel.cpp? We could explicitly typecast everything to a signed int then ensure that there are at least zero implicit hydrogens, but that seems verbose. @baoilleach Please feel free to directly commit on my PR if you have any ideas.

I suspect the underlying cause is unsigned integer arithmetic in phmodel.cpp:321 (possibly also 343). Subtraction of two unsigned ints gives an unsigned int--if the difference would be negative, then the result is wrapped back to `UINT_MAX`, e.g. printing `(j->second - old_bond_order)` gives 4294967295 instead of -1. Then there's some truncation to fit in the unsigned char. But even if the overall expression gives the right answer most of the time, I think it would be clearer to be more explicit about the math, which would fix special cases like this bug. How should we adjust the line(s) of code in phmodel.cpp? We could explicitly typecast everything to a signed int then ensure that there are at least zero implicit hydrogens, but that seems verbose. @baoilleach Please feel free to directly commit on my PR if you have any ideas. Of course we'll need to update the test case with the correct answer as well (not H255).",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1895

The result of this analysis is in the attachment. As previously, I noticed that OpenBabel 2.3.2 generated a correct output for the molecule I was analyzing, then I also decide to use this version in my tests. In all tests, I used the openbabel 2.4.1 library (python) for creating an OBMol molecule and then I printed the smiles for each one of the inputs (listed below). To check for possible errors of valence, charge, etc, I used the tool Chemicalize from Chemaxon (the figures in the attachment were obtained with this tool). First, I extract the ligand from the PDB file (all ligands and ids were informed in the attached file). Four different inputs were used to create the OBMol object:; 1) A .mol file obtained by converting the extracted file using OpenBabel 2.3.2.; 2) A .mol file obtained by converting the extracted file using OpenBabel 2.4.1. ; 3) The .pdb file. Function used: readfile(""pdb"", file); 4) The .pdb file as a string. Function used: readstring(""pdb"", pdb_block). Besides it, for each ligand I also evaluated the impact of creating the molecule without hydrogens and adding hydrogens according to some pH value. In the excel file, you'll find a column with the ligand information, one to indicate if I had used hydrogens and other to inform at which pH the hydrogens were added. Also, four other columns were added (one for each input). The red cells indicate if there is an incorrect aromatic perception.

I think the easiest fix would be if obabel could be flexible to be upgraded to work with protobuf version 3.7.1. ## Steps to Reproduce; <!--; If the problem occurs with a particular file, please either upload and attach the file or include a link here - this greatly improves our ability to test your problem.; Please include screenshots or text output if they help illustrate a behavior.; -->; Conda installed openbabel and tensorflow (on ubuntu). Just used a python script where I tried ""import openbabel"" and ""import tensorflow as tf,"" in various orders (i.e. openbabel first, then tf, tf first, then openbabel, etc.). The issue of the protobuf library comes up when the import is done in certain orders. Downgrading tf to 1.12.0 solves the issue, but just wanted to note this here in case upgrading dependency of the protobuf library to 3.7.1 is an easy fix.",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1983

Also added some very basic tests. maeparser APIs require C++11, so the most controversial change here is enabling C++11 if maeparser is enabled (which it would be by default). All code seems to build fine with this enabled (at least with modern compilers), so hopefully this will be OK for OpenBabel.

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/2008:37,Availability,redundant,redundant,37,"I've created a test suite of 14k non-redundant ligands from the pdb. These are provided as reasonably processed sdf files. testroundtrip.py verifies that they can be read in and roundtripped (with hydrogens) through sdf, mol2, and pdb file formats without mucking things up. . Initially there were thousands of failures. Now there are none. You can go through all the commits for the details, but here are the bigger changes:. - mol2 file format now outputs formal charges with a UNIT_ATOM_ATTR record (there is an option to disable its output); - pdb files now output bond orders through the popular but non-standard convention of duplicating CONECT records; - sdf files will only have aliases treated as substructure replacements if the target atom is a wildcard; - numerous adjustments to bond typing rules to make them more conservative. The additional tests add a few minutes to testing, but I think it's very important that we include them. This sort of large test set is needed. Plans for the future:; - port python driver to c++ to avoid python dependency; - make things work without having to roundtrip the molecules with hydrogens; - compare protonation states to rdkit, find and fix errors; - additional file formats for roundtripping",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/2008
