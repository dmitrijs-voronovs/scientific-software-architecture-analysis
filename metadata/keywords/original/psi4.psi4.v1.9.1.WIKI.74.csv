Theory¶; Density cumulant functional theory (DCFT) is a density-based ab initio theory; that can compute electronic energies without the use of the wavefunction. The; theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and; two-particle density matrices (OPDM and TPDM):. Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices,; and are the standard one- and two-electron integrals,; and are the elements of the OPDM and TPDM,; respectively. Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements and; cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCFT one takes a different route and; replaces the TPDM in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; and a correction :. The idempotent part of the OPDM corresponds to a Hartree-Fock-like density of; non-interacting electrons, while the non-idempotent correction ; depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.; Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:. where the antisymmetrized two-electron integrals and the generalized Fock operator; matrix elements were defined as follows:.

After that the DC-06 analytic; gradients code will be executed to perform the solution of the DCFT response; equations, compute the analytic gradients of the DCFT energy and perform the; geometry optimization. Recommendations¶; Here is the list of the recommendations for the DCFT module:. For the computations of small systems (less than 150 basis; functions and high symmetry) the use of the default parameters is recommended,; including the choice of the two-step algorithm.; For large systems (more than 150 basis functions) the simultaneous algorithm; is preferred and can be significantly faster than two-step, as the result of; smaller number of the expensive steps. In addition,; significant savings can be achieved if one sets AO_BASIS option to; DISK together with simultaneous algorithm. It should be noted, however, that; the analytic gradients of the DC-06 method are currently not implemented for; AOBASIS DISK option.; In the case when insufficient memory is available, set AO_BASIS option; to DISK. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In the case when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. or; ).; If the oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using quadratically-convergent algorithm for closed-shell molecules, it; is recommended to set QC_COUPLING option to FALSE for efficiency; reasons.

The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCFT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability; problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of the OPDM is; N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; the TPDM.; In order to obtain the DCFT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:; 1) The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the; idempotent part of the one-particle density matrix . This is; achieved by the self-consistent diagonalization of the generalized Fock; operator matrix defined above, which introduces the relaxation of the orbitals.; 2) The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density; cumulant , constrained to the N-representability conditions.; Making the energy stationary requires the solution of the two sets of coupled; equations for the orbital and cumulant updates, respectively (also known as; residual equations). At the present moment three different algorithms for the; solution of the system of coupled equations are available (see section; Iterative Algorithms for details).; Publications resulting from the use of the DCFT code should cite contributions; listed here. Methods¶; Currently two DCFT methods (functionals) are available: DC-06 and DC-12. Both; methods use approximate N-representability conditions derived from the; second-order perturbation theory, but differ in the description of the; correlated (non-idempotent) part of the one-particle density; matrix. While in the DC-06 method is derived from the density cumulant; in an approximate way, the DC-12 method derives this contribution exactly, and; therefore takes full advantage of the N-representability conditions. Both DC-06; and DC-12 methods have similar computational cost. However, the DC-12 method; usually exhibits much better numerical stabil",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/dcft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/dcft.html

At the present moment three iterative algorithms for the solution of the; equations are available. The choice of the algorithm is controlled using the; ALGORITHM option.; 1) Two-step algorithm (can be invoked by setting ALGORITHM option to; TWOSTEP and is currently the default).

In addition,; significant savings can be achieved if one sets AO_BASIS option to; DISK together with simultaneous algorithm. It should be noted, however, that; the analytic gradients of the DC-06 method are currently not implemented for; AOBASIS DISK option.; In the case when insufficient memory is available, set AO_BASIS option; to DISK. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In the case when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. or; ).; If the oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using quadratically-convergent algorithm for closed-shell molecules, it; is recommended to set QC_COUPLING option to FALSE for efficiency; reasons.

For the comparison of the quality of these methods we refer; user to the recent publications.; The DCFT functional can be specified by the DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option. The; default choice is the DC-06 functional. In addition to the two methods listed; above, DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option can be set to CEPA0 (coupled electron; pair approximation zero, equivalent to linearized coupled cluster doubles; method, LCCD). CEPA0 can be considered as a particular case of the DC-06 and DC-12; methods in the limit of zero non-idempotency of OPDM.

If the REFERENCE option is not specified in the input file,; the PSI4 Python driver will conveniently set it to UHF for the DCFT; computations. Iterative Algorithms¶; As explained in the Theory section, in order to obtain the DCFT energy one; needs to solve the system of coupled equations for the orbitals and the density; cumulant. At the present moment three iterative algorithms for the solution of the; equations are available. The choice of the algorithm is controlled using the; ALGORITHM option.; 1) Two-step algorithm (can be invoked by setting ALGORITHM option to; TWOSTEP and is currently the default). In two-step algorithm the DCFT equations; are solved in macroiterations. Each macroiteration consists of two sets of; microiterations. In the first set the density cumulant equations are solved; iteratively, while the orbitals are kept fixed. After the density cumulant is; converged, the second set of microiterations is performed for the; self-consistent update of the orbitals with the fixed density cumulant. Each; macroiteration is completed by performing the orbital transformation of the; integrals. The convergence of the two-step algorithm is accelerated using the; DIIS extrapolation technique.; 2) Simultaneous al",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/dcft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/dcft.html

The solution of the Newton-Raphson equations is performed; iteratively using the preconditioned conjugate gradients method, where only the; product of the electronic Hessian with the step vector is computed for; efficiency. The electronic Hessian is build for both the cumulant and orbital; updates and both updates are performed simultaneously. By default the; electronic Hessian also contains the matrix elements that couple the orbitals; and the density cumulant. The computation of these coupling elements increases; the cost of the macroiteration, but usually leads to faster convergence and is; recommended for open-shell systems. If the computation of the coupling elements; is not desired, it can be turned off by setting QC_COUPLING to FALSE.; It is important to note that the quadratically-convergent algorithm is not yet fully; optimized and often converges slowly when the RMS of the cumulant or; the orbital gradient is below .; The choice of the iterative algorithm can significantly affect the cost of the; energy computation. While the two-step algorithm requires a small number of; disk-intensive integral transformations, the simultaneous; algorithm benefits from a smaller number of expensive ; cumulant updates. As a result, for the small closed-shell systems the two-step; algorithm is usually preferred, while for the larger systems and the molecules with the; open-shell character it is recommended to use the simultaneous algorithm. The; efficiency of the simultaneous algorithm can be greatly increased by avoiding; the transformation of the four-index virtual two-electron integrals; and computing the terms that involve these integrals in the AO; basis.

Both DC-06; and DC-12 methods have similar computational cost. However, the DC-12 method; usually exhibits much better numerical stability and can be significantly; cheaper than the DC-06 in the problematic cases as the result of the improved; convergence. For the comparison of the quality of these methods we refer; user to the recent publications.; The DCFT functional can be specified by the DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option. The; default choice is the DC-06 functional. In addition to the two methods listed; above, DCFT_FUNCTIONAL option can be set to CEPA0 (coupled electron; pair approximation zero, equivalent to linearized coupled cluster doubles; method, LCCD). CEPA0 can be considered as a particular case of the DC-06 and DC-12; methods in the limit of zero non-idempotency of OPDM. This option has a limited; functionality and should only be used for the test purposes.; At the present moment DCFT computations can only be run with the unrestricted; orbitals. If the REFERENCE option is not specified in the input file,; the PSI4 Python driver will conveniently set it to UHF for the DCFT; computations. Iterative Algorithms¶; As explained in the Theory section, in order to obtain the DCFT energy one; needs to solve the system of coupled equations for the orbitals and the density; cumulant. At the present moment three iterative algorithms for the solution of the; equations are available. The choice of the algorithm is controlled using the; ALGORITHM option.; 1) Two-step algorithm (can be invoked by setting ALGORITHM option to; TWOSTEP and is currently the default). In two-step algorithm the DCFT equations; are solved in macroiterations. Each macroiteration consists of two sets of; microiterations. In the first set the density cumulant equations are solved; iteratively, while the orbitals are kept fixed.

Theory¶; Density cumulant functional theory (DCFT) is a density-based ab initio theory; that can compute electronic energies without the use of the wavefunction. The; theory starts by writing the exact energy expression in terms of the one- and; two-particle density matrices (OPDM and TPDM):. Here we used Einstein convention for the summation over the repeated indices,; and are the standard one- and two-electron integrals,; and are the elements of the OPDM and TPDM,; respectively. Naively, one might expect that it is possible to minimize the; energy functional in the equation above and obtain the exact energy. This is,; however, not trivial, as the density matrix elements and; cannot be varied arbitrarily, but must satisfy some; conditions that make sure that the density matrices are N-representable, i.e.; correspond to an antisymmetric N-electron wavefunction. Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed. In addition, the lack; of separability of the density matrices may result in the loss of; size-consistency and size-extensivity. In DCFT one takes a different route and; replaces the TPDM in favor of its two-particle density cumulant:. The one-particle density matrix is separated into its idempotent part; and a correction :. The idempotent part of the OPDM corresponds to a Hartree-Fock-like density of; non-interacting electrons, while the non-idempotent correction ; depends on the density cumulant and describes the electron correlation effects.; Inserting the above two equations into the energy expression, we obtain:. where the antisymmetrized two-electron integrals and the generalized Fock operator; matrix elements were defined as follows:.

Energy functional has several important properties. First,; the energy is now a function of two types of independent parameters, the; idempotent part of OPDM and the density cumulant; . As a result, the energy functional is Hermitian,; which is important for the evaluation of the molecular properties. The additive; separability of the density cumulant guarantees that all of the DCFT methods; are size-extensive and size-consistent. Furthermore, the N-representability; problem is now greatly simplified, because the idempotent part of the OPDM is; N-representable by construction. One only needs to worry about the; N-representability of the density cumulant, which is a relatively small part of; the TPDM.; In order to obtain the DCFT energy, two conditions must be satisfied:; 1) The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the; idempotent part of the one-particle density matrix . This is; achieved by the self-consistent diagonalization of the generalized Fock; operator matrix defined above, which introduces the relaxation of the orbitals.; 2) The energy must be stationary with respect to the variation of the density; cumulant , constrained to the N-representability conditions.; Making the energy stationary requires the solution of the two sets of coupled; equations for the orbital and cumulant updates, respectively (also known as; residual equations).

A value of 0 makes the program perform I/O one RAS subblock at a time; 1 uses entire CI vectors at a time; and 2 uses one irrep block at a time.

David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function , we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1); The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly and doubly. substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; . The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI]. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations.

A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it.

However, please; note that these computations are essentially doing high-order CI (up to; full CI) computations to obtain these results, and hence they will only; be possible for very small systems (generally a dozen electrons or less).; The simplest way to run high-order perturbation theory computations is to; call, e.g., energy('mp10') to invoke a MP10 computation or; energy('zapt25') to invoke a ZAPT25 computation. This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy. The program then; sets MAX_NUM_VECS to the required order in the; wavefunction.; By default, the requested n-th order energy is saved as the current; energy to the process environment.

Leininger; Section author: C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function , we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1); The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly and doubly. substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; . The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI]. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations.

Thus, orbital; subspace keywords such as RAS1,; RAS2, RAS3, FROZEN_DOCC, FROZEN_UOCC,; ACTIVE, etc., should be set; in the global section of input so they may also be read by other modules.; For single-reference CI computations, the easiest way to invoke a CI; computation with DETCI is simply to call energy(), optimize(), etc.,; with the common name for that CI wavefunction, like energy('cisd'); for a CISD single-point energy. The Python driver; recognizes cisd, cisdt, and cisdtq. Higher order; single-refernce CI wavefunctions, like those including singles through; 6-fold excitations, can be invoked using numbers, like ci6. A full; CI can be specifed by fci. More complicated CI computations, like; RASCI, can be performed by setting the appropriate keywords and calling the; module generically like energy('detci').

Leininger; Section author: C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree–Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a “single-reference” CI based; on reference function , we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. (1); The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree–Fock is a CI; that adds all singly and doubly. substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; . The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results.; The CI code in PSI4 is described in detail in; [Sherrill:1999:CI]. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; PSI4 is not optimized for CISD computations. Instead, emphasis; has been placed on developing a very efficient program to handle more; general CI wavefunctions which may be helpful in more challenging cases; such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions. The CI; code is based on the ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/detci.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/detci.html

It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI’s. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the CI.; The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. Use of DETCI for CASSCF; wavefunctions is described in another section of this manual.; As just mentioned, the DETCI module is designed for challenging; chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable. Because; CI wavefunctions which go beyond CISD (such as RAS CI) are fairly complex,; typically the DETCI code will be used in cases where the; tradeoffs between computational expense and completeness of the; model space are nontrivial. Hence, the user is advised to develop; a good working knowledge of multi-reference and RAS CI methods before; attempting to use the program for a production-level project.

Arbitrary Order Perturbation Theory¶; The DETCI module is capable of computing energies for arbitrary; order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MPn, for closed-shell; systems with an RHF reference) and for Z-averaged perturbation theory; (ZAPTn, open-shell systems with an ROHF reference). However, please; note that these computations are essentially doing high-order CI (up to; full CI) computations to obtain these results, and hence they will only; be possible for very small systems (generally a dozen electrons or less).; The simplest way to run high-order perturbation theory computations is to; call, e.g., energy('mp10') to invoke a MP10 computation or; energy('zapt25') to invoke a ZAPT25 computation. This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy. The program then; sets MAX_NUM_VECS to the required order in the; wavefunction.; By default, the requested n-th order energy is saved as the current; energy to the process environment.

Introduction¶; Second-order Møller-Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic products in the; bra- and ket- of the -type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference. An efficient,; threaded, disk-based DF-MP2 code is available in PSI4 for all single; reference types available in the SCF module.; An example utilization of the code is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set scf_type df; set freeze_core True. energy('df-mp2'). The energy('df-mp2') call to energy() executes; the predefined DF-MP2 procedure, first calling; the SCF module with a default RHF reference and DF algorithm for the; two-electron integrals.

However, there is; one disk transpose of the tensor in the RHF-MP2 algorithm; [two for UHF-MP2 and ROHF-MBPT(2)], so more memory will reduce seek times.; If you notice DFMP2 using more memory than allowed, it is possible that; the threaded three-index ERI computers are using too much overhead memory.; Set the DF_INTS_NUM_THREADS to a smaller number to prevent this; in this section (does not affect threaded efficiency in the rest of the; code).; DFMP2 likes disk. At a minimum, doubles are required for; RHF-MP2, and doubles are required for UHF-MP2.; DFMP2 likes threads. Some of the formation of the tensor; relies on threaded BLAS (such as MKL) for efficiency.

Introduction¶; Second-order Møller-Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic products in the; bra- and ket- of the -type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach.

Introduction¶; Second-order Møller-Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic products in the; bra- and ket- of the -type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference. An efficient,; threaded, disk-based DF-MP2 code is available in PSI4 for all single; reference types available in the SCF module.; An example utilization of the code is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set scf_type df; set freeze_core True. energy('df-mp2').

DF-MP2: Density-Fitted Second-Order Møller-Plesset Perturbation Theory¶; Code author: Robert M. Parrish; Section author: Robert M. Parrish; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DFMP2. Introduction¶; Second-order Møller-Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2) occupies a unique role; in quantum chemistry due to its small-prefactor treatment of; dynamic electron correlation. This unusually cheap; ab initio treatment of electron correlation may be made even more; efficient by means of the Density-Fitting (DF) approximation (also known as; Resolution-of-the-Identity or RI), wherein the quadratic products in the; bra- and ket- of the -type Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs); appearing in MP2 are cast onto a linear-scaling auxiliary basis by least-squares; fitting. Substitution of the DF factorization into the MP2 equations results in; a formal scaling and prefactor reduction of MP2, and further speed gains are; possible due to heavy utilization of matrix-multiplication kernels and minimal; storage requirements in a DF approach. The method has been found to be quite; robust and accurate, and it should be preferred unless extreme accuracy is required; or a fitting basis is not defined for the primary basis and atom type; encountered. In particular, we have found excellent efficiency and tractability; gains when using DF-MP2 in concert with a DF-SCF reference. An efficient,; threaded, disk-based DF-MP2 code is available in PSI4 for all single; reference types available in the SCF module.; An example utilization of the code is:; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set scf_type df; set freeze_core True. energy('df-mp2').

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes. Pruned grids are; not yet available, but will be implemented by RC1 (in final debugging). The; default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131. The spherical grids are rotated according to a common set of rules developed; during the implementation of SG1.

For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-12.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to those; listed above for Hartree-Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn-Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled. We hope to have a patch for this deficit soon. Please let us; know if you have a strong need for this capability, and we will move the; priority up.

The global hybrid ansatz has become; exceedingly popular, with functionals such as the ubiquitous B3LYP often; producing absurdly accurate results.; A more advanced GKS functional technology which has developed enormous; popularity in recent years is the Long-Range Corrected (LRC) ansatz. LRC; recognizes that the local DFA is potentially exact at short range in the; exchange hole, and that the hybrid-exchange energy of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is also exact for true electrons at long range in the exchange; hole. Therefore LRC switches from DFA at short range to hybrid exchange at long; range, typically using the function as a; partition function.; Tying all these pieces together, a full LRC-hybrid GKS functional has the; generic form,. For LRC functionals, the choice of range-separtion parameter has; been the subject of considerable activity since the inception of LRC; functionals. Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between -electron and -electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz.

LRC; recognizes that the local DFA is potentially exact at short range in the; exchange hole, and that the hybrid-exchange energy of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is also exact for true electrons at long range in the exchange; hole. Therefore LRC switches from DFA at short range to hybrid exchange at long; range, typically using the function as a; partition function.; Tying all these pieces together, a full LRC-hybrid GKS functional has the; generic form,. For LRC functionals, the choice of range-separtion parameter has; been the subject of considerable activity since the inception of LRC; functionals. Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between -electron and -electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz.

This approach was championed by Grimme,; whose “-D2” approach is a de facto industry standard. The more modern “-D3”; approach is gaining popularity, and may supersede -D2 in the next few years. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a KS-DFT computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('b3lyp') (or other valid functional name):; molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('b3lyp'). This will run a B3LYP Restricted Kohn-Sham (RKS) on neutral singlet Helium in; spatial symmetry with a minimal STO-3G basis, 1.0E-8 energy; and density convergence criteria, a PK ERI algorithm, symmetric; orthogonalization, DIIS, and a core Hamiltonian guess. For more information on; any of these options, see the relevant section below, or in the Hartree-Fock; section above.

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS. This; is because ROHF is implicitly assumed to be followed by a correlated method; which can break the positive definiteness of the spin polarization. KS-DFT with; the true functional is expected to be the final step, thus restricting the; solution to positive definite spin polarization is not physical. See the; section in Szabo on methyl radical for an example. Functional Selection¶; PSI4 features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call:; energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; REFERENCE option before the call to energy:; set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by the DFT_FUNCTIONAL; option:; set dft_functional b3lyp; energy('scf'). For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; DFT_ALPHA option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree-Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the DFT_OMEGA option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional.; A brief summary of some of the more notable functionals in PSI4, and links; to the complete listing of all functionals of each class are presented below:.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to those; listed above for Hartree-Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn-Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled. We hope to have a patch for this deficit soon. Please let us; know if you have a strong need for this capability, and we will move the; priority up. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c1 # IP fitting must be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; dft_functional wb97; }. # Arguments are molecule object, minimum omega, maximum omega; ip_fitting(h2o, 0.4, 2.0). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of , though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; . The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of . This small test case has a tuned; of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0.

If you would like to publish; results using this code, please contact Rob Parrish to make arrangements for; collaboration. Dispersion Corrections¶; Dispersion corrections are discussed at this link. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D.

Grid Selection¶; PSI4 uses the standard Lebedev-Laikov spherical quadratures in concert with a; number of radial quadratures and atomic partitioning schemes. Pruned grids are; not yet available, but will be implemented by RC1 (in final debugging). The; default grid in PSI4 is a Lebedev-Treutler (75,302) grid with a Treutler; partition of the atomic weights.; Spherical grids are all of the extremely efficient Lebedev-Laikov type.; Spherical grid resolution is controlled by the DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; option, which may take one of the following values:. DFT_SPHERICAL_POINTS; Order. 6; 3. 14; 5. 26; 7. 38; 9. 50; 11. 74; 13. 86; 15. 110; 17. 146; 19. 170; 21. 194; 23. 230; 25. 266; 27. 302; 29. 350; 31. 434; 35. 590; 41. 770; 47. 974; 53. 1202; 59. 1454; 65. 1730; 71. 2030; 77. 2354; 83. 2702; 89. 3074; 95. 3470; 101. 3890; 107. 4334; 113. 4802; 119. 5294; 125. 5810; 131.

For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the DFT_BASIS_TOLERANCE, which; defaults to 1E-12.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to those; listed above for Hartree-Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn-Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled.

The global hybrid ansatz has become; exceedingly popular, with functionals such as the ubiquitous B3LYP often; producing absurdly accurate results.; A more advanced GKS functional technology which has developed enormous; popularity in recent years is the Long-Range Corrected (LRC) ansatz. LRC; recognizes that the local DFA is potentially exact at short range in the; exchange hole, and that the hybrid-exchange energy of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is also exact for true electrons at long range in the exchange; hole. Therefore LRC switches from DFA at short range to hybrid exchange at long; range, typically using the function as a; partition function.; Tying all these pieces together, a full LRC-hybrid GKS functional has the; generic form,. For LRC functionals, the choice of range-separtion parameter has; been the subject of considerable activity since the inception of LRC; functionals. Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between -electron and -electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz.

On the correlation; side, this is primarily observed in the inability of KS-DFT to treat dispersion; interactions.; Generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) functionals incorporate long-range information into; the functional through orbital-dependent contributions, and are designed to; combat the failures of local KS-DFT, particularly the MSIE on the exchange side.; Note that these functionals are often referred to as “implicit” density; functionals, as the orbitals are themselves functionals of the Kohn-Sham; potential.; The simplest form of an exchange-side GKS is the global hybrid ansatz, in which; some fraction of the exact Hartree-Fock exchange of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is added to the functional, with the local part of the exchange; functional decreased by the corresponding amount. Note that the term; “exact-exchange” refers to the Hartree-Fock being the exact exchange energy of; the noninteracting quasiparticles, not the true electrons. Therefore, adding; 100% exact exchange is not physically reasonable, and will often lead to; extremely poor results. The fraction of exact-exchange, denoted ,; is often determined by adiabatic or heuristic arguments, and is typically around; 25%. The addition of exact exchange borrows another piece from an existing; Hartree-Fock code, with the caveat that Hartree-Fock exchange is often much more; costly to obtain than the Coulomb matrix. The global hybrid ansatz has become; exceedingly popular, with functionals such as the ubiquitous B3LYP often; producing absurdly accurate results.; A more advanced GKS functional technology which has developed enormous; popularity in recent years is the L",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/dft.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/dft.html

LRC; recognizes that the local DFA is potentially exact at short range in the; exchange hole, and that the hybrid-exchange energy of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is also exact for true electrons at long range in the exchange; hole. Therefore LRC switches from DFA at short range to hybrid exchange at long; range, typically using the function as a; partition function.; Tying all these pieces together, a full LRC-hybrid GKS functional has the; generic form,. For LRC functionals, the choice of range-separtion parameter has; been the subject of considerable activity since the inception of LRC; functionals. Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of “gap; fitting” or “optimal tuning” or simply “tuning.” The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the is varied until the; Koopman’s IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between -electron and -electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz. This guarantees the asymptotics of; the exchange potential,. Note that LRC functionals with default only capture the; dependence,. hybrid functionals only capture part of the dependence,. and local functionals decay exponentially, resulting in completely incorrect; asymptotics,.

IP-fitting is found to be particularly critical for the qualitative; determination of excited state ordering in many low band-gap systems.; For dispersion-bound complexes, a very simple additive empirical dispersion; potential, based on a damped Lennard-Jones potential can often produce; remarkably accurate results with KS-DFT. This approach was championed by Grimme,; whose “-D2” approach is a de facto industry standard. The more modern “-D3”; approach is gaining popularity, and may supersede -D2 in the next few years. Minimal Input¶; Minimal input for a KS-DFT computation is a molecule block, basis set; option, and a call to energy('b3lyp') (or other valid functional name):; molecule {; He; }. set basis sto-3g. energy('b3lyp'). This will run a B3LYP Restricted Kohn-Sham (RKS) on neutral singlet Helium in; spatial symmetry with a minimal STO-3G basis, 1.0E-8 energy; and density convergence criteria, a PK ERI algorithm, symmetric; orthogonalization, DIIS, and a core Hamiltonian guess. For more information on; any of these options, see the relevant section below, or in the Hartree-Fock; section above.

These are set in the REFERENCE option.; Note that there are not equivalents to ROHF or CUHF, e.g., no ROKS or CUKS. This; is because ROHF is implicitly assumed to be followed by a correlated method; which can break the positive definiteness of the spin polarization. KS-DFT with; the true functional is expected to be the final step, thus restricting the; solution to positive definite spin polarization is not physical. See the; section in Szabo on methyl radical for an example. Functional Selection¶; PSI4 features an extensive list of LSDA, GGA, Meta, Hybrid, LRC, and -D; functionals. These can be specified by a variety of means. Perhaps the simplest; is to use the functional name as the energy procedure call:; energy('b3lyp'). Note that if you are running an unrestricted computation, you should set the; REFERENCE option before the call to energy:; set reference uks; energy('b3lyp'). The functional may also be manually specified by the DFT_FUNCTIONAL; option:; set dft_functional b3lyp; energy('scf'). For hybrid functionals, the fraction of exact exchange is controlled by the; DFT_ALPHA option. For the LRC functionals, the fraction of long-range; Hartree-Fock and short-range DFA is controlled by the DFT_OMEGA option.; Changing these will override the default behavior of the requested functional.; A brief summary of some of the more notable functionals in PSI4, and links; to the complete listing of all functionals of each class are presented below:.

ERI Algorithms¶; The ERI algorithms for the Coulomb and hybrid exchange are identical to those; listed above for Hartree-Fock. However, for LRC functionals, the long-range; exchange contributions to the Kohn-Sham matrix have only been implemented in the; DF and DIRECT algorithms. The use of DF is highly recommended for KS-DFT, as the; errors incurred by the density fitting approximation (in a proper -JKFIT; auxiliary basis) are orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of any known; functional.; Note: gradients with LRC functionals and DF integrals technology are not; currently enabled. We hope to have a patch for this deficit soon. Please let us; know if you have a strong need for this capability, and we will move the; priority up. IP Fitting¶; In collaboration with the Bredas group, we have developed an automatic procedure; for IP fitting of LRC functionals, based on a modified Regula-Falsi method. To; perform IP fitting, one simply calls the ip_fitting() Python macro, after; setting up a standard LRC UKS computation. A representative example is:; memory 512 MB. molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; symmetry c1 # IP fitting must be run in C1 symmetry; }. set {; reference uks # UKS, as we need to do neutral/cation; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; dft_functional wb97; }. # Arguments are molecule object, minimum omega, maximum omega; ip_fitting(h2o, 0.4, 2.0). This performs IP fitting on water for wB97/cc-pVDZ with density fitting. A; number of neutral and cation single-point computations are run at various values; of , though the later iterations are much faster due to reuse of; the DF tensors, and starting from the neutral/cation orbitals of the previous; . The procedure can also be assisted by providing a tighter guess; for the bounds of . This small test case has a tuned; of 1.700, hence the bounds of 0.4 and 2.0.

Note: this feature is new/powerful enough that we have several papers pending on; it, and are interested in expanding this work. If you would like to publish; results using this code, please contact Rob Parrish to make arrangements for; collaboration. Dispersion Corrections¶; Dispersion corrections are discussed at this link. Recommendations¶; The KS-DFT code is quite new, but relatively complete. During code development,; emphasis was placed on flexibility of functional technology, efficiency for; medium to large systems in difficult electronic environments (e.g., compact; spatial extents, diffuse basis sets, low band-gaps, LRC and/or hybrid GKS; functionals), and time to code completion. We are very interested in optimizing; and extending the code, so expect performance gains and extensions to; gradients/hessians and TDDFT in future releases.; Some rough guidelines for using the KS-DFT code are as follows,. Use DF for the ERI algorithm wherever possible.; PSI4 is a “tight” code, meaning we’ve set the default numerical cutoffs; for integrals, grids, and convergence criteria in such a way that you will often; get many more digits of precision than needed. You may be able to realize; additional speed gains by loosening some of these thresholds. See; SCF Convergence for default convergence criteria.; Read the literature to determine which functional technology to use. The world; contains far too many papers using B3LYP on noncovalent interactions without a -D.

The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; , obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, , modulated; by a damping function, , that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by ); over a distance characterized by the sum of the two atomic vdW radii,; , while an overall scaling term, , is optimized; to be unique to each functional.

The individual atomic are interpolated from; several reference values based upon coordination numbers extracted from; the molecular structure, rather than assigned solely by atomic identity as; in DFT-D2, and thereby incorporate some awareness of the chemical; environment into an otherwise largely heuristic correction.

Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces. Initially proposed by Yang; [Wu:2002:515] and assiduously developed by Grimme, [Grimme:2004:1463]; [Grimme:2006:1787] [Grimme:2010:154104] the DFT+Dispersion method; appends to the base functional a scaled, damped, and fitted leading term; to the well-known dispersion energy series, . The DFT-D2 [Grimme:2006:1787] variant; takes the explicit form below. Here, dispersion coefficients,; , obtained from the geometric mean of tabulated elemental; values, are summed over interatomic distances, , modulated; by a damping function, , that gradually activates; the dispersion correction (at a rate characterized by ); over a distance characterized by the sum of the two atomic vdW radii,; , while an overall scaling term, , is optimized; to be unique to each functional. ( is; sometimes allowed to vary as well.). (1). Grimme recently presented a refined method, DFT-D3, [Grimme:2010:154104]; which incorporates an additional term in the dispersion; series and adjusts the combination formula and damping; function. The individual atomic are interpolated from; several reference values based upon coordination numbers extracted from; the molecular structure, rather than assigned solely by atomic identity as; in DFT-D2, and thereby incorporate some awareness of the chemical; environment into an otherwise largely heuristic correction. The -D3; dispersion has the following form, where and ; are the customary nonunity parameters fitted for individual functionals. (2).

Finally, add your; file to the STATICDOC variable in the Makefile at; psi4/doc/sphinxman/Makefile.in. Sphinx will now build with your new; page. Adding a new module to “Theoretical Methods”; Copy the file of a well-established module, like; psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/sapt.rst. Change the title, author, sec; label, ref, and source labels at the top of the file to point instead to; your code. Edit psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/methods.rst to add the; name of your file so that it will appear in the TOC tree. Add your file; to the STATICDOC variable in the Makefile at; psi4/doc/sphinxman/Makefile.in. Sphinx will now build with your new; file. Follow the models in existing methods pages to write your; documentation. If you don’t get all the keyword links, bibliography; links, sample inputs, math, tables, etc. working in Sphinx, don’t worry; about it.

Documentation¶; PSI4’s documentation is generated by Sphinx; and lives in psi4/doc/sphinxman.

Installing Sphinx¶; Installing Sphinx is only necessary to build the documentation; yourself, locally. The docs are served from; from trac and psicode, so most users/developers won’t need Sphinx; installed. Nevertheless, installation is easy.; On Mac:; >>> easy_install sphinx. On Linux:.

Check the path; >>> which sphinx-build; >>> which latex; >>> which dvipng. LaTeX and dvipng are needed to render math. If the latter is missing,; the following may work.; >>> sudo yum install dvipng. Documentation Structure¶; Sphinx has nice capabilities for extracting docstrings from python files,; presenting both auto-generated and narrative documentation in; the same format, hyperlinking within and to trac/external websites, and; generating documentation in different formats from the same source.; PSI4’s documentation is a unified document covering information for; both users and programmers, with different portions served up depending on; the target audience.

Navigation. index. modules    . toc    . next    . previous    ; PSI4 [beta4] » ; Contributions: Intro to Programming in PSI4 ». Documentation¶; PSI4’s documentation is generated by Sphinx; and lives in psi4/doc/sphinxman. It is available online at; http://sirius.chem.vt.edu/psi4manual/latest/index.html; for the latest public release and at; http://sirius.chem.vt.edu/psi4manual/master/index.html; for the latest development branch (not all links may be publically; accessible). Installing Sphinx¶; Installing Sphinx is only necessary to build the documentation; yourself, locally. The docs are served from; from trac and psicode, so most users/developers won’t need Sphinx; installed. Nevertheless, installation is easy.; On Mac:; >>> easy_install sphinx. On Linux:. Download; >>> curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/S/Sphinx/Sphinx-1.1.3.tar.gz. Unpack, etc. Build and Install; >>> python setup.py build; >>> sudo python setup.py install. Check the path; >>> which sphinx-build; >>> which latex; >>> which dvipng. LaTeX and dvipng are needed to render math. If the latter is missing,; the following may work.; >>> sudo yum install dvipng. Documentation Structure¶; Sphinx has nice capabilities for extracting docstrings from python files,; presenting both auto-generated and narrative documentation in; the same format, hyperlinking within and to trac/external websites, and; generating documentation in different formats from the same source.; PSI4’s documentation is a unified document covering information for; both users and programmers, with different portions served up depending on; the target audience. To this end, one can navigate to $(OBJDIR)/doc/sphinxman; and build the following targets.:; >>> make help # to see options; >>> make # to build html. >>> make html; >>> make html-user; >>> make html-prog; >>> make latexpdf-user; >>> make latexpdf-prog. This will build the following files, respectively.; build/html/index.html;",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/documentation.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/documentation.html

Much of the documentation is auto-generated from the source. At present,; this covers:. Physical Constants: psi4/include/physconst.h; Python Driver: docstrings from *.py files in psi4/lib/python; Databases: docstrings from *.py files in psi4/lib/databases; Basis Sets: *.gbs files in psi4/lib/basis; C++ Keywords: psi4/src/bin/psi4/read_options.cc; Sample Inputs: input.dat files in psi4/samples; PSI Variables: Process::environment.globals lines and comments in the C++ code; Plugins: doc.rst text, *.py modules, and C++ keywords in psi4/tests/plugin_* plugin directories (disabled at the moment); PSI Files: scratch file names and numbers in psi4/include/psifiles.h. Some documentation is even extracted from Psi4 objects at runtime. PsiMod: docstrings for the PsiMod built-in module constructed in psi4/src/bin/psi4; DFT: functional availibility and characteristics as encoded in psi4/lib/python/functional.py; BasisFamily: fitting basis sets for each orbital basis as encoded in psi4/lib/python/basislistdunning.py and psi4/lib/python/basislistother.py.

Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to e",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/external-1.html

These environment; variables are typically defined in a .tcshrc or .bashrc.; (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() Psithon function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. set scf {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1,5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy('scf'). (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables. Command Line Options¶; PSI4 can be invoked with no command line arguments, as it takes as input; by default the file “input.dat” and directs output by default to “output.dat”.; The set of three commands below are completely equivalent, while the fourth",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/external-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/external-1.html

It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; phsyically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or, more flexibly, through; a resource file, ~/.psi4rc (example psi4/samples/example_psi4rc_file).; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. The primary use of the ~/.psi4rc file is to control the; handling of scratch files. PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to the ~/.psi4rc; file.:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user').

The ~/.psi4rc file can also be used to define constants that are accessible; in input files or to place any Python statements that should be executed; with every PSI4 instance. Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to e",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/external.html

These environment; variables are typically defined in a .tcshrc or .bashrc.; (2) The -n Command Line Flag; To change the number of threads at runtime, the psi4 -n flag may be used. An; example is:; psi4 -i input.dat -o output.dat -n 4. which will run on four threads.; (3) Setting Thread Numbers in an Input; For more explicit control, the Process::environment class in PSI4 can; override the number of threads set by environment variables. This functionality; is accessed via the set_num_threads() Psithon function, which controls; both MKL and OpenMP thread numbers. The number of threads may be changed; multiple times in a PSI4 input file. An example input for this feature is:; # A bit small-ish, but you get the idea; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 90.0; }. set scf {; basis cc-pvdz; scf_type df; }. # Run from 1 to 4 threads, for instance, to record timings; for nthread in range(1,5):; set_num_threads(nthread); energy('scf'). (4) Method-Specific Control; Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify:; set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation. Setting; this variable to 0 (the default) uses the number of threads specified by the; set_num_threads() Psithon method or the default environmental variables.

All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to the ~/.psi4rc; file.:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) for restart purposes. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). which is equivalent to; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_CHKPT, True",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/external.html

The ~/.psi4rc file can also be used to define constants that are accessible; in input files or to place any Python statements that should be executed; with every PSI4 instance. Threading¶; Most new modules in PSI4 are designed to run efficiently on SMP architectures; via application of several thread models. The de facto standard for PSI4; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel’s excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and Boost; Threads for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in PSI4 uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled PSI4 with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL).; Control of threading in PSI4 can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model. This hierarchy is; explained below. Note that each deeper level trumps all previous levels.; (1) OpenMP/MKL Environment Variables; The easiest/least visible way to thread PSI4 is to set the standard OpenMP/MKL; environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS.; For instance, in tcsh:; setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 4; setenv MKL_NUM_THREADS 4.

It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; phsyically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or, more flexibly, through; a resource file, ~/.psi4rc (example psi4/samples/example_psi4rc_file).; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. The primary use of the ~/.psi4rc file is to control the; handling of scratch files. PSI4 has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk. Most; quantities, such as molecular integrals, are intermediates that are not of; interest to the user and can be deleted after the computation finishes, but; pertinent details of computations are also written to a checkpoint file and; might be useful in subsequent computations. All files are written to the; designated scratch numbered by content and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user.; A Python callable handle to the PSI4 I/O management routines is available,; and is called psi4_io. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to the ~/.psi4rc; file.:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user').

Recommendations for BLAS and LAPACK libraries; V. Miscellaneous architecture-specific notes; VI. Common Problems with PSI Compilation. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File¶; One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process (details here); is to tell PSI4 where to write its temporary; (“scratch”) files. Electronic structure packages like PSI4 can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to; ensure that PSI4 is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; phsyically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, PSI4 will write temporary files to /tmp, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB–1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell PSI4 the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the; PSI_SCRATCH environment variable or, more flexibly, through; a resource file, ~/.psi4rc (example psi4/samples/example_psi4rc_file).; For convenience, ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/external.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/external.html

To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say /scratch/user, add the following command to the ~/.psi4rc; file.:; psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case $MYSCRATCH) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that:; import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 32 is; the checkpoint file that the user might want to retain in the working directory; (i.e., where PSI4 was launched from) for restart purposes. This is; accomplished by the commands below:; psi4_io.set_specific_path(32, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(32, True). which is equivalent to; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_CHKPT, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_CHKPT, True).

Coupled electron pair approximation¶; Coupled-pair methods can be viewed as approximations to CCSD or as; size-extensive modifications of CISD. The methods have the same; complexity as CISD, and solving the CISD or coupled-pair equations; requires fewer floating point operations than solving the CCSD. CISD,; CCSD, and the coupled-pair methods discussed below all scale formally with; the sixth power of system size, and, as with the QCISD method, CEPA; methods retain complexity of the CCSD equations.; For a detailed discussion of the properties of various coupled-pair; methods, see Ref.

Note, however, that 1-electron properties are currently; unavailable when coupling these stationary CEPA-like methods with frozen; natural orbitals. Density-fitted coupled cluster¶; Density fitting (DF) or resolution of the identity (RI) techniques are; popular in quantum chemistry to avoid the computation and storage of the; 4-index electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor and even to reduce the; computational scaling of some terms. DF-CCSD(T) computations are; available in PSI4, with or without the use of FNOs, through the FNOCC; module. The implementation and accuracy of the DF-CCSD(T) method are; described in Ref. [DePrince:2013:inprep].; The default auxiliary basis set for a DF-CCSD computation is chosen to be; the RI set (optimized for DFMP2) most similar to the primary basis set.; For example, if the primary basis set is aug-cc-pVDZ, the default; auxiliary basis set will be the aug-cc-pVDZ-RI set. PSI4 of course; allows the user to specify any supported predefined basis set as the; auxiliary set. Alternatively, the user can request a set defined by the; partial Cholesky decomposition of the 4-index ERI tensor.; The following is a minimal input file that describes a DF-CCSD(T); computation using 3-index integrals obtained by partial Cholesky; decomposition of the 4-index ERI tensor.; molecule h2o {; 0 1; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }. set {; df_basis_cc cholesky; basis aug-cc-pvdz; freeze_core true; }; energy('df-ccsd(t)').

Quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster¶; The quadratic configuration interaction singles doubles (QCISD) method of; Pople, Head-Gordon, and Raghavachari [Pople:1987:5968] was originally; presented as a size-consistent extension of configuration interaction; singles doubles (CISD). The method can also be obtained as a; simplified version of the coupled cluster singles doubles (CCSD); method [Purvis:1982]. Consider the set of equations defining CCSD:.

The; QCISD equations can be obtained by omitting all but two terms that; are nonlinear in and :. (2); QCISD is slightly cheaper that CCSD computationally, but it retains the; complexity of the original equations.

The default --prefix is /usr/local/psi. Note; The configure script’s --prefix directory will be referred to as; $prefix for the remainder of these instructions.

To make it easy to recompile later (especially if; you’re a developer), it can be convenient (but not necessary) to to put; the configure options in a small executable file, so you can re-do the; configuration later very easily. Let us assume that we will be putting; the configure options in a file named do-configure, in the top-level; psi4 directory (we’ll keep it up there instead of down in the compilation; directory $objdir, so that if we delete the compilation directory later,; we’ll still have the do-configure file).

If you do choose to use the; RedHat/Fedora stock BLAS and LAPACK, make sure that the blas-devel; and lapack-devel packages are installed. Perhaps the best choice, if you have it available, is; Intel’s MKL library, which includes BLAS and LAPACK (note: use; version 11 or later, we had difficulty with version 10 for very; large coupled-cluster computations). MKL is efficient and works; well in threaded mode.; Otherwise, the simplest choice is to use ATLAS; (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/), which is readily available; on all Linux distributions. Another alternative is OpenBLAS; (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS, formerly GotoBLAS). These; work well on nearly every achitecture to which the PSI4 developers; have access, though we have identified at least one case in which; the Goto libraries yielded faulty DGEMM calls.

On Mac OS X; systems, the vecLib package that comes with Xcode works well. PSI4 does not require a Fortran compiler, unless the resident BLAS; and LAPACK libraries require Fortran-based system libraries. If you see; compiler complaints about missing symbols like “do_fio” or “e_wsfe”, then; your libraries were most likely compiled with g77 or gfortran, which; require -lg2c to resolve the Fortran I/O calls. Use of the same gcc; package for PSI4 should normally resolve this problem. The PSI4 configure script can often identify and use several; different BLAS and LAPACK libraries, but its ability to do this; automatically depends on a number of factors, including correspondence; between the compiler used for PSI4 and the compiler used to build; BLAS/LAPACK, placement of the libraries in commonly searched directories,; etc. PSI4’s configure script will find your BLAS and LAPACK if any of the; the following are installed in standard locations (e.g. /usr/local/lib):. ATLAS: libf77blas.a and libatlas.a, plus netlib’s liblapack.a; MKL 8: libmkl.so and libmkl_lapack64.a (with the corresponding; Intel compilers); Goto: libgoto.a and netlib’s liblapack.a; Cray SCSL (e.g. on SGI Altix): libscs.so (NB: No Fortran compiler; is necessary in this case, so --with-fc=no should work.); ESSL (e.g. on AIX systems): libessl.a.

In addition, the most common compilation problems; involve these libraries. Users may therefore wish to consider the following; BLAS and LAPACK recommendations when building PSI4:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat. This library is usually just the; netlib distribution and is completely unoptimized. PSI4’s; performance will suffer if you choose this route.; The choice of LAPACK is less critical, and so the unoptimized; netlib distribution is acceptable. If you do choose to use the; RedHat/Fedora stock BLAS and LAPACK, make sure that the blas-devel; and lapack-devel packages are installed. Perhaps the best choice, if you have it available, is; Intel’s MKL library, which includes BLAS and LAPACK (note: use; version 11 or later, we had difficulty with version 10 for very; large coupled-cluster computations). MKL is efficient and works; well in threaded mode.; Otherwise, the simplest choice is to use ATLAS; (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/), which is readily available; on all Linux distributions. Another alternative is OpenBLAS; (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS, formerly GotoBLAS). These; work well on nearly every achitecture to which the PSI4 developers; have access, though we have identified at least one case in which; the Goto libraries yielded faulty DGEMM calls. On Mac OS X; systems, the vecLib package that comes with Xcode works well. PSI4 does not require a Fortran compiler, unless the resident BLAS; and LAPACK libraries require Fortran-based system libraries. If you see; compiler complaints about missing symbols like “do_fio” or “e_wsfe”, then; your libraries were most likely compiled with g77 or gfortran, which; require -lg2c to resolve the Fortran I/O calls. Use of the same gcc; package for PSI4 should normally resolve this problem.

IV. Recommendations for BLAS and LAPACK libraries¶; Much of the speed and efficiency of the PSI4 programs depends on the; corresponding speed and efficiency of the available BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). In addition, the most common compilation problems; involve these libraries. Users may therefore wish to consider the following; BLAS and LAPACK recommendations when building PSI4:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat. This library is usually just the; netlib distribution and is completely unoptimized. PSI4’s; performance will suffer if you choose this route.; The choice of LAPACK is less critical, and so the unoptimized; netlib distribution is acceptable. If you do choose to use the; RedHat/Fedora stock BLAS and LAPACK, make sure that the blas-devel; and lapack-devel packages are installed. Perhaps the best choice, if you have it available, is; Intel’s MKL library, which includes BLAS and LAPACK (note: use; version 11 or later, we had difficulty with version 10 for very; large coupled-cluster computations). MKL is efficient and works; well in threaded mode.; Otherwise, the simplest choice is to use ATLAS; (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/), which is readily available; on all Linux distributions. Another alternative is OpenBLAS; (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS, formerly GotoBLAS). These; work well on nearly every achitecture to which the PSI4 developers; have access, though we have identified at least one case in which; the Goto libraries yielded faulty DGEMM calls. On Mac OS X; systems, the vecLib packag",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/installfile.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/installfile.html

Another alternative is OpenBLAS; (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS, formerly GotoBLAS). These; work well on nearly every achitecture to which the PSI4 developers; have access, though we have identified at least one case in which; the Goto libraries yielded faulty DGEMM calls. On Mac OS X; systems, the vecLib package that comes with Xcode works well. PSI4 does not require a Fortran compiler, unless the resident BLAS; and LAPACK libraries require Fortran-based system libraries. If you see; compiler complaints about missing symbols like “do_fio” or “e_wsfe”, then; your libraries were most likely compiled with g77 or gfortran, which; require -lg2c to resolve the Fortran I/O calls. Use of the same gcc; package for PSI4 should normally resolve this problem. The PSI4 configure script can often identify and use several; different BLAS and LAPACK libraries, but its ability to do this; automatically depends on a number of factors, including correspondence; between the compiler used for PSI4 and the compiler used to build; BLAS/LAPACK, placement of the libraries in commonly searched directories,; etc. PSI4’s configure script will find your BLAS and LAPACK if any of the; the following are installed in standard locations (e.g. /usr/local/lib):. ATLAS: libf77blas.a and libatlas.a, plus netlib’s liblapack.a; MKL 8: libmkl.so and libmkl_lapack64.a (with the corresponding; Intel compilers); Goto: libgoto.a and netlib’s liblapack.a; Cray SCSL (e.g. on SGI Altix): libscs.so (NB: No Fortran compiler; is necessary in this case, so --with-fc=no should work.); ESSL (e.g. on AIX systems): libessl.a. If configure cannot identify your BLAS and LAPACK libraries; automatically, you can specify them on the command-line using the; --with-blas and --with-lapack arguments described above. Here are a few; examples that work on the PSI4 developers’ systems:. Linux with ATLAS:; --with-blas='-lf77blas -latlas' --with-lapack='-llapack -l",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/installfile.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/installfile.html

For Linux/gfortran,; simply; cp make.inc.example make.inc. Next, edit BLASLIB in make.inc to point to your BLAS library; (full pathnames are recommended):; BLASLIB = /home/david/software/atlas3.9.25/lib/libf77blas.a /home/david/software/atlas3.9.25/lib/libatlas.a. Edit Makefile as necessary (probably not needed).; make. Copy the resulting file [lapack_($ARCH).a] where you want it; (a standard location like /usr/local/lib is easier for PSI to find).; It is probably helpful to rename the file liblapack.a. V. Miscellaneous Architecture-Specific Notes¶. Linux on x86 and x86_64; Intel compilers: We had trouble with icpc 12.0.x. Use 12.1 or; later. VI. Common Problems with PSI Compilation¶. No rule to make target foo.h, needed by bar.d. Stop.; This commonly happens after pulling updates from the repository. It happens; when a library header file is removed or renamed by the update, but there are; still old dependency files in the object directory, which think that they; still need to know about that header. There’s a simple remedy, just run; >>> make DODEPEND=no dclean. in the object directory. Make gets stuck in an infinite loop; This means that the makefiles have not been properly updated. Running; >>> autoconf. in the top-level Psi directory, followed by; >>> ./config.status --recheck; >>> ./config.status. in the object directory should fix it. This procedure will need to be run; whenever an update changes the directory structure. Incompatible g++/icpc; The Intel compilers require an installed set of C++ headers. Unfortunately,; the GNU compilers tend to be more cutting-edge than the Intel compilers,; meaning that Intel is always playing catch-up to new features in g++. This; means the two are often incompatible, leading to trouble if one wants to use; icpc to compile PSI4 (or anything else...).

Step 7: User Configuration; After the PSI4 package has been successfully installed, the user will need; to add the installation directory into his/her path. If the package has; been installed in the default location /usr/local/psi, then in C shell,; the user should add something like the following to their .cshrc file:; setenv PSI /usr/local/psi; set path = ($path $PSI/bin). Next, the user needs to tell the PSI4 I/O manager how to handle scratch files.; Identify the path to a fast scratch disk for which the user has write access.; If the local /tmp volume is large enough, it might be used.; However, a dedicated scratch volume (using RAID0 striping for speed) is; recommended. Warning; Scratch should NOT be a NFS-mounted volume, as writes to a; remote disk over the network can be very slow and can tie up the network; and negatively impact other users. Specify scratch location by editing the .cshrc file to set the scratch; environment variable PSI_SCRATCH. If the selected location is; /scratch/user, add something like the following:; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /scratch/user.

IV. Recommendations for BLAS and LAPACK libraries¶; Much of the speed and efficiency of the PSI4 programs depends on the; corresponding speed and efficiency of the available BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). In addition, the most common compilation problems; involve these libraries. Users may therefore wish to consider the following; BLAS and LAPACK recommendations when building PSI4:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat. This library is usually just the; netlib distribution and is completely unoptimized. PSI4’s; performance will suffer if you choose this route.; The choice of LAPACK is less critical, and so the unoptimized; netlib distribution is acceptable. If you do choose to use the; RedHat/Fedora stock BLAS and LAPACK, make sure that the blas-devel; and lapack-devel packages are installed. Per",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b4/installfile.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b4/installfile.html

Another alternative is OpenBLAS; (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS, formerly GotoBLAS). These; work well on nearly every achitecture to which the PSI4 developers; have access, though we have identified at least one case in which; the Goto libraries yielded faulty DGEMM calls. On Mac OS X; systems, the vecLib package that comes with Xcode works well. PSI4 does not require a Fortran compiler, unless the resident BLAS; and LAPACK libraries require Fortran-based system libraries. If you see; compiler complaints about missing symbols like “do_fio” or “e_wsfe”, then; your libraries were most likely compiled with g77 or gfortran, which; require -lg2c to resolve the Fortran I/O calls. Use of the same gcc; package for PSI4 should normally resolve this problem. The PSI4 configure script can often identify and use several; different BLAS and LAPACK libraries, but its ability to do this; automatically depends on a number of factors, including correspondence; between the compiler used for PSI4 and the compiler used to build; BLAS/LAPACK, placement of the libraries in commonly searched directories,; etc. PSI4’s configure script will find your BLAS and LAPACK if any of the; the following are installed in standard locations (e.g. /usr/local/lib):. ATLAS: libf77blas.a and libatlas.a, plus netlib’s liblapack.a; MKL 8: libmkl.so and libmkl_lapack64.a (with the corresponding; Intel compilers); Goto: libgoto.a and netlib’s liblapack.a; Cray SCSL (e.g. on SGI Altix): libscs.so (NB: No Fortran compiler; is necessary in this case, so --with-fc=no should work.); ESSL (e.g. on AIX systems): libessl.a.

IV. Recommendations for BLAS and LAPACK libraries¶; Much of the speed and efficiency of the PSI4 programs depends on the; corresponding speed and efficiency of the available BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). In addition, the most common compilation problems; involve these libraries. Users may therefore wish to consider the following; BLAS and LAPACK recommendations when building PSI4:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat. This library is usually just the; netlib distribution and is completely unoptimized. PSI4’s; performance will suffer if you choose this route.; The choice of LAPACK is less critical, and so the unoptimized; netlib distribution is acceptable. If you do choose to use the; RedHat/Fedora stock BLAS and LAPACK, make sure that the blas-devel; and lapack-devel packages are installed. Perhaps the best choice, if you have it available, is; Intel’s MKL library, which includes BLAS and LAPACK (note: use; version 11 or later, we had difficulty with version 10 for very; large coupled-cluster computations). MKL is efficient and works; well in threaded mode.; Otherwise, the simplest choice is to use ATLAS; (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/), which is readily available; on all Linux distributions. Another alternative is OpenBLAS; (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS, formerly GotoBLAS). These; work well on nearly every achitecture to which the PSI4 developers; have access, though we have identified at least one case in which; the Goto libraries yielded faulty DGEMM calls.
