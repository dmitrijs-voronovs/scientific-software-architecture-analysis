A significant limitation of using the Google Backend on Cromwell today is that [only N* machine types](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/supportedBackends/google/batch/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/batch/util/GcpBatchMachineConstraints.scala#L29-L32) can be used on GCP. In particular, N* machine types do not provide access to modern GPUs and users interested in running workflows on GPUs are limited to older NVIDIA T4 or V100 accelerators. ## Proposal. Add support for standard machine types, which would allow running workflows on a much broader range of machine types on GCP, including those configured with modern GPUs (e.g.: NVIDIA A100, H100).

Issue: Last week, Cromwell started logging stuff like `Status change from AwaitingCloudQuota to AwaitingCloudQuota`. This is noisy and not useful. . Cause: [This PR](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7527/files#diff-2679a7465ba7f1f56db9d588d0e64c3e4a4fe47b404299d7b7f18d66dccddfbf) changed the definitions of certain statuses, causing the `==` operator to not return true for statuses of the same type but with different lists of execution events. . Fix: Go back to the old behavior and rely only on the type of the run status, not what data it may contain. . #### `CHANGELOG.md`; - [ ] I updated `CHANGELOG.md` in this PR; - [x] I assert that this change shouldn't be included in `CHANGELOG.md` because it doesn't impact community users. #### Terra Release Notes; - [ ] I added a suggested release notes entry in this Jira ticket; - [x] I assert that this change doesn't need Jira release notes because it doesn't impact Terra users",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7536

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7545:231,Availability,avail,available,231,"### Description. Currently, and as described in https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7535, only general-purpose machine types are supported in Google Backend, which prevents running wdl workflows on many machine types available on GCP, including those provisioned with modern GPUs. I believe the simplest and most general solution would be to pass the machine type directly from the wdl configuration to the Google Batch API. The idea is that this approach would be more resilient to machine types being added or deprecated on GCP, as users would only need to update their wdl workflows in such cases. An alternative approach of mapping machine specs (e.g.: cpu platform and gpu requirements) to standard machine types would potentially introduce an additional layer of maintenance with little benefit. This PR adds support for a new standardMachineType key in the runtime section, which is only parsed for the Google backend. ### Testing.

Currently, and as described in https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7535, only general-purpose machine types are supported in Google Backend, which prevents running wdl workflows on many machine types available on GCP, including those provisioned with modern GPUs. I believe the simplest and most general solution would be to pass the machine type directly from the wdl configuration to the Google Batch API. The idea is that this approach would be more resilient to machine types being added or deprecated on GCP, as users would only need to update their wdl workflows in such cases.

The `google_legacy_machine_selection` workflow option that exists on PAPI v2 to pick JES-shaped machines was not completely wired in to the GCP Batch backend. However when I completed the wiring job and ran the `hello_google_legacy_machine_selection` Centaur test I got this:. ```; Task wf_hello.hello:NA:1 failed: Job failed when Batch tries to schedule it:; Batch Error: code - CODE_MACHINE_TYPE_NOT_FOUND, description - ; machine type predefined-1-2048 for job job-xyz, project 8675309, region us-central1, zones (if any) us-central1-b is not available.; ```.

I'm currently working with the reference-disks option using GCPBatch as my backend. I executed the create_images.sh script from the documentation (https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/backends/GCPBatch/) to generate my reference-disk-localization-manifests. I'm also using Cromwell v87, as specified in the same documentation. I also tested with the current `develop` build. While the manifest is correctly configured in the Cromwell config, and the reference disk appears to be mounting successfully, I’m encountering a failure with the umount command.
