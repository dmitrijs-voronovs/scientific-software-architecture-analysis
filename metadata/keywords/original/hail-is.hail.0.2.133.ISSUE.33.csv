(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded.

There are really two distinct conceptual changes remaining here. Given my waning time available, I am not going to split them into two pull requests. The changes are:. 1. `basename` always agrees with the [`basename` UNIX utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basename). In particular, the folder `/foo/bar/baz/`'s basename is *not* `''` it is `'baz'`. The only folders or objects whose basename is `''` are objects whose name literally ends in a slash, e.g. an *object* named `gs://foo/bar/baz/`. 2. `hailctl fs sync`, a robust copying tool with a user-friendly CLI. `hailctl fs sync` comprises two pieces: `plan.py` and `sync.py`. The latter, `sync.py` is simple: it delegates to our existing copy infrastructure. That copy infastructure has been lightly modified to support this use-case. The former, `plan.py`, is a concurrent file system `diff`. `plan.py` generates and `sync.py` consumes a ""plan folder"" containing these files:. 1. `matches` files whose names and sizes match. Two columns: source URL, destination URL. 2. `differs` files or folders whose names match but either differ in size or differ in type. Four columns: source URL, destination URL, source state, destination state. The states are either: `file`, `dif`, or a size. If either state is a size, both states are sizes. 3. `srconly` files only present in the source. One column: source URL. 4. `dstonly` files only present in the destination.

There are really two distinct conceptual changes remaining here. Given my waning time available, I am not going to split them into two pull requests. The changes are:. 1. `basename` always agrees with the [`basename` UNIX utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basename). In particular, the folder `/foo/bar/baz/`'s basename is *not* `''` it is `'baz'`. The only folders or objects whose basename is `''` are objects whose name literally ends in a slash, e.g. an *object* named `gs://foo/bar/baz/`. 2. `hailctl fs sync`, a robust copying tool with a user-friendly CLI. `hailctl fs sync` comprises two pieces: `plan.py` and `sync.py`. The latter, `sync.py` is simple: it delegates to our existing copy infrastructure. That copy infastructure has been lightly modified to support this use-case. The former, `plan.py`, is a concurrent file system `diff`. `plan.py` generates and `sync.py` consumes a ""plan folder"" containing these files:. 1. `matches` files whose names and sizes match.

Since there's nothing to be done operationally (and there's no current work underway to get rid of them), these alerts only contribute to alert fatigue and hide potential problems in the system that could be addressed. This demotes a deadlock to the `info` level so we can still see how often they occur but are not alerted by them.

In this pull request, I add a function to perform a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistical test for association. This pull request closes #13481. ### Testing. I add unit tests. Since I have not used R before (the [associated GitHub issue](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13481) suggests using R to create test cases), I created the unit tests from examples that I found on the internet. I linked these sources in the code for the unit tests. I built the documentation locally and inspected it to confirm that it matches my expectations. I am having trouble testing the docstring examples locally. When I run `make -C hail doctest-query`, the tests error due to a checksum exception. ### Discussion. ~I have not added an example to the documentation that uses a matrix table yet. (This is an acceptance criteria in #13481.) I wanted to get some advice about the best way to do this. I think ideally, the example would have a binary phenotype, an allele to test for association, and some stratifying variable.

With Frequencies we can use the hl.agg.filter with hl.agg.call_stats to get what we want, but there isn‚Äôt really an equivalent for samples since hl.sample_qc and hl.vds.sample_qc take MTs and return HTs rather than taking expressions and returning aggregation expressions. Would the Hail team have the bandwidth in the next couple weeks to put in a modification to the hl.vds.sample_qc to make it function similar to the hl.agg.call_stats ?. My thoughts on it:. It's a reasonable ask. You'll have four parts (first three are aggregators): rmt_sq, vmt_sq, ac_and_atype, and combine. The user must ensure the same filters, groups, etc. are applied to each aggregator. If you group, you'll need to ensure the right grouped AC is passed around. It might look like this on the variant matrix table. The reference stuff looks similar.; ```python3; vmt = vmt.annotate_entries(GT=hl.vds.lgt_to_gt(vmt.LGT, vmt.LA)); vmt = vmt.annotate_rows(ac_atype=hl.agg.group_by(foo, ac_and_atype(vmt.GT, vmt.alleles))); vmt = vmt.annotate_cols(; qc=hl.agg.group_by(; foo,; vmt_sample_qc(; global_gt=vmt.GT,; gq=vmt.GQ,; ac=ac_atype[foo].ac,; atype=ac_atype[foo].atype,; dp=vmt.DP); ); ); ```; The atype needn't really be grouped. That should maybe be its own aggregator and then you can use stats directly to get a valid AC.

https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14264:2134,Usability,clear,clear,2134,"e want, but there isn‚Äôt really an equivalent for samples since hl.sample_qc and hl.vds.sample_qc take MTs and return HTs rather than taking expressions and returning aggregation expressions. Would the Hail team have the bandwidth in the next couple weeks to put in a modification to the hl.vds.sample_qc to make it function similar to the hl.agg.call_stats ?. My thoughts on it:. It's a reasonable ask. You'll have four parts (first three are aggregators): rmt_sq, vmt_sq, ac_and_atype, and combine. The user must ensure the same filters, groups, etc. are applied to each aggregator. If you group, you'll need to ensure the right grouped AC is passed around. It might look like this on the variant matrix table. The reference stuff looks similar.; ```python3; vmt = vmt.annotate_entries(GT=hl.vds.lgt_to_gt(vmt.LGT, vmt.LA)); vmt = vmt.annotate_rows(ac_atype=hl.agg.group_by(foo, ac_and_atype(vmt.GT, vmt.alleles))); vmt = vmt.annotate_cols(; qc=hl.agg.group_by(; foo,; vmt_sample_qc(; global_gt=vmt.GT,; gq=vmt.GQ,; ac=ac_atype[foo].ac,; atype=ac_atype[foo].atype,; dp=vmt.DP); ); ); ```; The atype needn't really be grouped. That should maybe be its own aggregator and then you can use stats directly to get a valid AC. I sketched this here: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/compare/main...danking:hail:agg-sample-qc but there are probably bugs in that. This issue is complete when we merge a PR that:; 1. Exposes one or more aggregators which compute all the statistics from `hl.vds.sample_qc` on the component matrix tables of a VDS: the variant data and the reference data.; 2. Exposes a combination function which combines reference and variant stats to produce `bases_over_dp_threshold` and `bases_over_gq_threshold`.; 3. Includes extensive tests comparing these aggregators to the original `hl.vds.sample_qc`.; 4.

This significantly improved the speed of the implementation presumably because the sort operation generates much less IR.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14312

I *was* able to give it a type but it was really complicated, involved `@overload`, and did not seem to help me reason about that function. I presumed the root cause was that the Resource class had an insufficient interface. Here is how I understand what that function was trying to achieve: We need to track the set of resources that are produced by, produced-by-and-later-consumed, and consumed by a job:. 1. ""Produced by"" corresponds to `Job._valid`.; 2. ""Produced-by-and-later-consumed"" corresponds to `Job._internal_outputs` and `Job._external_outputs`.; 3. ""Consumed by"" corresponds to `Job._inputs`. There is also `Job._mentioned` which I do not fully understand but which does not use `_add_resource_to_set`. There is an important distinction between the latter two and the first kind of resource set. The latter two must be what I am now calling `SingleResource`s. These are actual single files that need to be uploaded or downloaded. In contrast the ""produced by"" set (and, I think `Job._mentioned`) might include `ResourceGroup`s which are composite: one or more `SingleResource`s that must be transmitted as a group. For example, a VCF file and its TBI index file must always be transmitted as a group, even if a job only references one of those two files. That's the essential functionality of a `ResourceGroup`. I introduced three operations to `Resource` which I think make this system simpler:. 1. `get_resource_group`: if a `Resource` is a group or a member thereof, return it. 2. `component_resources`: if a `Resource` is composite, return the components, otherwise just return the resource itself. 3. `bonded_resources`: the minimum set of resources that must be transmitted if this resource is transmitted. In particular, a member of a resource group returns itself and the other resources in the group. A resource group just returns its components.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again.

(*) Note that the real score may have changed since the PR was raised. Some vulnerabilities couldn't be fully fixed and so Snyk will still find them when the project is tested again. This may be because the vulnerability existed within more than one direct dependency, but not all of the affected dependencies could be upgraded. Check the changes in this PR to ensure they won't cause issues with your project. ------------. **Note:** *You are seeing this because you or someone else with access to this repository has authorized Snyk to open fix PRs.*.

We converted those multi-sample VCFs to hailmatrix tables with following WDL code in Terra:. ```python; import hail as hl. hl.init(spark_conf={""spark.driver.memory"": ""~{memory_gb}g""}). callset = hl.import_vcf(""~{source_vcf}"",; array_elements_required=False,; force_bgz=True,; reference_genome='~{reference_genome}'). callset.write(""~{target_prefix}"", overwrite=True); ```. After sample filtering, we want to export it to VCF. ```python; import hail as hl. hl.init(spark_conf={; ""spark.driver.memory"": ""~{memory_gb}g"",; ""spark.local.dir"": ""./tmp""; },; tmp_dir=""./tmp"",; local_tmpdir=""./tmp"",; idempotent=True); hl.default_reference(""~{reference_genome}""). mt = hl.read_matrix_table(""~{input_hail_mt_path}""); hl.export_vcf(mt, ""~{hail_vcf}"", tabix = False); ```. It worked on chr1 to chr22, but failed at chrX and chrY with error: VCF spec does not support phased haploid calls.

A cancelled task is not necessarily done. The task could catch the `CancelledError` and do something, including raise a different exception (e.g. because a resource close failed). 3. Nested try-finally sucks. This PR adds `_cleanup_future` which:. 1. Cancels the future. 2. Waits for the future to receive its cancellation and then terminate. 3. Checks if the future is cleanly cancelled (in which case there is nothing more for us to do). 4. Retrieves any present exceptions from a not-cancelled (but done!) future.

On GNU/Linux, when spawning a process, there are practical limits to the size of the arguments array *and* the environment. These limits are documented in [the `execve` man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html). Bioinformatics tools sometimes work around this limitation by accepting a single file which contains new-line separated arguments. For example: [`bcftools --file-list NAME ...`](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html). The concrete proposal was to provide an operation like `hb.file_list`:; ```python3; j.command(f'bcftools --file-list {hb.file_list(resources_list)}'); ```. The question is how to construct this file list. We could generate code to create the file but this would still fail if there were so many resources that the environment was too large. A really resilient way to do this would be for the Batch worker to mount a list of filenames into the container as a file.
