I thought maybe it's due to some special symbols in sequences in the failed fastas or larger size of proteins. Seems not, since ""X"" symbols where in completed fastas as well, as well as protein length ~30K or short. dividing these fasta files to a set of smaller solves this problem for a subset of new, but still leaves some with the same error.

https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/issues/777:124,Testability,test,tested,124,"Hi,; I want to run ""mmseqs easy-rbh"" on all pairs of a large dataset of genomes (let's say 100 genomes, so 10,000 pairs). I tested on 1 pairs and it took 27 seconds to run. I thought to use the modules instead of the easy workflow to make it faster - what I did is:; mmseqs createdb <protein_fasta1>; mmseqs createdb <protein_fasta2>; mmseqs rbh <protein_fasta1_db> <protein_fasta2_db> alnOffsettedDB tmpDir; mmseqs convertalis <protein_fasta1_db> <protein_fasta2_db> alnOffsettedDB output_m8. The advantage of this is that I do only once the ""createdb"" operations for all genomes. And indeed, the rbh+convertalis commands took 17 seconds to run, which is faster than 27 seconds, and very significant when multiplied by 10,000 genome pairs. But the problem is that the outputs are different - the output of ""easy-rbh"" had 100 more pairs than the output of my implementation. Can you please help me fix my implementation? or explain how to use the easy-rbh but with pre-computed databases?. thanks",MatchSource.ISSUE,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/issues/777

I have tried clustering it again using `linclust` to 90% identity and 80% overlap, however, the number of clusters is larger than I expected (75M from 76M initial Uniref90 size). I thought that might be due to the reduced sensitivity as a further reduced amino acid alphabet is applied before computing the k-mers. . I've tried to use `mmseq cluster` instead, however, this seems to take a very long time. After 13h the progress bar has only two '=' signs. . I am not sure if I am approaching the right way. Is linclust capable to cluster a protein sequence database that has been translated to a reduced amino acid alphabet or does it interfere with the mmseq alphabet used during k-mer comparison?. I was expecting a much smaller number of clusters as sequences only use 5 letters now so they are more likely to be more similar. . For `mmseq cluster`, what is the expected computation time for 76M sequences? . ## Your Environment; Running on a 64-core and 500GB RAM Linux machine.",MatchSource.ISSUE,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/issues/781

https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/issues/792:43,Deployability,release,release,43,"Hi - I ran the easy-search command (newest release, 6f452, self-compiled with cmake 3.25.2 and gcc 12.2.0) on a Linux system with the example query and database file from the MMseqs2 repository and encountered an unexpected behaviour. The BLAST tab output format never includes gap openings (even though many alignments should contain them) and the bit score deviates from what e.g. BLAST reports for the same alignments. To give an example, the pretty html output contains the following alignment for query ```C0QTH6``` and subject ```A0A059IV01```:. ```; Q 0 IGAGVAIGAAAGGGAAGLGNAIRGVLEGMARNPNMGGKLLTTMFIGMALIETFVLYGLLIAIIFLF; T 0 IAIGLAVFGMLGAG-LGIANIFSAMLNGIARNPESEGKMKSYVYIGAAMVEIMGLLAFVLAMLLIF; ```. However, when running the same search but producing a BLAST tab output, the gap is not present (i.e. 0 gap openings):. ```; C0QTH6	A0A059IV01	0.333 66 43	0	43	108	9	73	3.416E-07 48; ```. BLAST produces basically the same alignment (the gap is moved by one but it should create the same score due to the pairing):. ```; Query 43 IGAGVAIGAAAGGGAAGLGNAIRGVLEGMARNPNMGGKLLTTMFIGMALIETFVLYGLLIAIIFLF 108; I G+A+ G G G+ N +L G+ARNP GK+ + ++IG A++E L ++A++ +F; Sbjct 9 IAIGLAVFGMLGAGL-GIANIFSAMLNGIARNPESEGKMKSYVYIGAAMVEIMGLLAFVLAMLLIF 73; ```. Here, the BLAST tab format also includes the gap and it leads to a different bit score compared to MMseqs2. ```; C0QTH6	A0A059IV01	33.333 66 43	1	43	108	9	73	4.79e-08 46.2; ```.

https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/issues/815:134,Deployability,pipeline,pipeline,134,"Hi, I have been using MMseqs2 to obtain clusters of multiple sequence files and then obtain each sequence's taxonomy. I followed this pipeline:. ```; mmseqs easy-cluster ${rawfas[@]} newcluster tmp --min-seq-id 0.3 -c 0.5 --cov-mode 1 --cluster-mode 2 -e 0.001 -s 6; mmseqs createdb ${rawfas[@]} queryDB_all; mmseqs taxonomy queryDB $TXDB clusterTax tmp --lca-mode 4 --split-memory-limit 60G \; --lca-ranks superkingdom,phylum,class,order,family,genus; mmseqs createtsv queryDB clusterTax ../clusterTax.tsv; ```. The output of these is a clusterRes_cluster.tsv file including the representative sequences and the cluster members, and a clusterTax file with the taxonomy for each sequence. My question is, is there any MMseqs2 implementation to obtain the common taxonomy for each cluster, like an LCA algorithm applied to all the sequences belonging to each cluster, or something similar? Or another software that allows me to do that?.

However, I am getting the following error: ; `nr_mapping is empty. Rerun createtaxdb to recreate taxonomy mapping.`. It is unclear what this suggestion to recreate the taxonomy means or what this command should look like. I would appreciate any help with that. .

We're currently looking for a replacement for CD-HIT-EST for clustering genes in nucleotide space. We have a few conditions when clustering. The CD-HIT-COMMAND is straightforward:. ```; cd-hit-est -i genes.fa -o cluster.fa -c 0.95 -T 64 -M 0 -G 0 -aS 0.9 -g 1 -r 0 -d 0; ```. Basically, we want to perform greedy clustering at 95% identity and at least 90% of the shorter gene should be aligned. The longest sequence of a cluster should become the representative and a member of a cluster should not align against any other representative with a better score/percid. We have now come up with the following command(s):. ```; mmseqs createdb genes.fa genes.mmseqs.db --dbtype 2 --shuffle 0. mmseqs cluster genes.mmseqs.db genes.mmseqs.cluster tmp --kmer-per-seq-scale 0 --kmer-per-seq 1000 \; -s 4 --max-seq-len 80000 --remove-tmp-files 0 --cluster-mode 2 --min-seq-id 0.95 --threads 64 --cov-mode 1 \; -c 0.9 --spaced-kmer-mode 0 --alignment-mode 3 --cluster-reassign 1; ```. The key parameter seems to be `--spaced-kmer-mode 0` as this prevents very similar sequences being placed in different clusters. as reported by others (#831 #489). Using these parameters the clustering compares quite well against the clusters produced by cd-hit:; ```; mmseqs clusters = 13'471'787; cdhit clusters = 13'640'333; runtime(mmseqs) / runtime(cdhit) = 0.09; Rand Score: 0.99; Adjusted Rand Score: 0.91; V-measure: 0.99; ```.

The second column of a standard PSSM generated by PSIBlast corresponds to the aminoacids of the input fasta however the PSSM generated by Mmseqs changes the sequences somehow.

With the output file produced listing the contig_name along with the total number of predicted ORFs and the number of those ORFs with top hits that agree with the assigned LCA of the contig. ## Current Behavior; When I run the following command:; ```bash; mmseqs easy-taxonomy contigs.fasta swissprotDB tax tmp; ```; I get the following results files:; ```bash; tax_lca.tsv; tax_report; tax_tophit_aln; tax_tophit_report; ```; None of which contain the expected output described in the documentation. I have had a look at using `aggregatetax` command, but run into problem with the `createtsv` command not reassigning the contig names correctly.; ```bash; mmseqs createdb contigs.fasta contigsDb; mmseqs extractorfs contigsDb orfsAaDb --translate 1; mmseqs taxonomy orfsAaDb swissprotDB taxPerOrf tmp --tax-output-mode 2; mmseqs aggregatetaxweights swissprotDB orfsAaDb_h taxPerOrf taxPerOrf_aln taxPerContig --majority 0.5; mmseqs createtsv orfsAaDb contigsDb taxPerContig aggregatetaxResult.tsv; ```. ## Your Environment; ```bash; MMseqs2 Version: 113e3212c137d026e297c7540e1fcd039f6812b1; Pre-compiled binary; ```.

Given that my project processes a large volume of PDB chains (around 400k), understanding the trade-offs between these methods is essential.

From the `mmseqs search` output one can see that the top hit (NZ_JH601103.1), has the best target, query coverage and evalue.; The top hit belongs to the organism `Dolosigranulum pigrum` https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_JH601103 which has the following taxonomy:. `d__Bacteria; p__Bacillota; c__Bacilli; o__Lactobacillales; f__Carnobacteriaceae; g__Dolosigranulum; s__Dolosigranulum pigrum`. I wonder how this discrepancy between the taxonomy of the `mmseqs search` top hit and the taxonomy provided by `mmseqs taxonomy` can happen?. ## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs).

To shorter the search time, I am trying to create a small database with a certain number of species. I have got the ncbi taxIDs of them already, my question is how to filter the ntDATABase with those taxIDs. In my mind now, I should use the filterdb function with --filter-regex and --filter-column. Problem is I don't know which column is the taxID in the ntDATAbase. Could anyone guide me how to check the structure of the data base and find which column is the taxID? Or are there any other ways to filter the nt database using the taxID list?.

Any advice or insights from your experience with MMseqs2 and GTDB would be appreciated!",MatchSource.ISSUE,soedinglab,MMseqs2,15-6f452,https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki,https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/issues/895
