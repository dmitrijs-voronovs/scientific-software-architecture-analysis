How to name orbital bases (e.g., AO & SO)¶; Many different working bases (the internal linear algebraic basis, not the; name of the Gaussian basis) are used within PSI4, each with a unique; and important purpose. It is critical to keep them all distinct to prevent; weird results from occurring. AO (Atomic Orbitals): Cartesian Gaussians (6D, 10F, etc.),; (L + 1)(L + 2)/2 functions per shell of angular momentum L. The; ordering of Cartesian exponents for a given L is given by the standard; ordering below (MATLAB code)",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/prog_blas-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/prog_blas-1.html

The number of OSOs may be; slightly smaller than the total number of USOs, due to removal of linear; dependencies via Canonical Orthogonalization. The OSOs are rarely; encountered, as usually we go straight from USOs to MOs.; MO (Molecular Orbitals): The combination of OSOs that diagonalizes; the Fock Matrix, so each basis function is a Hartree-Fock (or Kohn-Sham); molecular orbital. The number of OSOs and MOs is always the same. MOs are; orthonormal.; LO (Localized Orbitals): Localized occupied orbitals, a different; combination of the occupied molecular orbitals which enhances spatial; locality. LOs do not diagonalize the occ-occ block of the Fock Matrix, but; remain orthonormal to each other and the virtual space. How to name orbital dimensions¶; There are a number of different names used to refer to the basis set size.; These may seem redundant, but they have subtly different meanings, as; detailed below.; A calculation can use either pure (5D, 7F, 9G, etc.) basis functions or; Cartesian (6D, 10F, 15G, etc.), as dictated by the input file / basis set; specification. Also, the basis can be represented in terms of atomic; orbitals (AO) or symmetry-adapted orbitals (SO). Further complications; come from the fact that a nearly linearly-dependent basis set will have; functions removed from it to prevent redundancies. With all of these; factors in mind, here are the conventions used internally:. nao — The number of atomic orbitals in Cartesian representation.; nso — The number of atomic orbitals but in the pure representation if the current basis uses pure functions, number of Cartesian AOs otherwise.; nbf — The number of basis functions, which is the same as nso.; nmo — The number of basis functions, after projecting out redundancies in the basis.

Programming with the Core Libraries; Linear Algebra in PSI4. Linear Algebra in PSI4¶. How to call BLAS & LAPACK in PSI4¶; Computational chemistry is essentially linear algebra on molecular; systems, so using stable, portable, scalable, and efficient numerical; linear algebra methods in PSI4 is critical. To that end, we use BLAS1; (vector-vector operations, like dot products), BLAS2 (matrix-vector; operations, like rank-1 update), BLAS3 (matrix-matrix operations, like; matrix multiplication), and LAPACK (advanced matrix decompositions and; solutions). The methods provided by BLAS and LAPACK are standard, but the; performance of actual implementations differ greatly from one version to; another. Moreover, the standard interfaces to the libraries are Fortran,; so PSI4 provides a common set of wrappers in psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libqt/qt.h . Warning; Although block_matrix, init_array, and print_mat are still; around, their use is discouraged in favor of operations on; psi4.core.Matrix itself. The advice in these docs will catch up; shortly. BLAS Wrappers¶; BLAS wrappers are currently fully supported at double precision.; BLAS commands involving matrices are wrapped so as to be conventional; C-style “row-major” indexing, meaning that the column is the fast index; like normal. The calls to BLAS1 routines are wrapped so as to allow for operations on; vectors with more than 2^{31} elements (~16 GB, getting to be a problem).; So passing a signed or unsigned long works, though the stride arguments; must be integers.; All routines are declared in qt.h.

How to name orbital dimensions¶; There are a number of different names used to refer to the basis set size.; These may seem redundant, but they have subtly different meanings, as; detailed below.; A calculation can use either pure (5D, 7F, 9G, etc.) basis functions or; Cartesian (6D, 10F, 15G, etc.), as dictated by the input file / basis set; specification.

How to name orbital dimensions¶; There are a number of different names used to refer to the basis set size.; These may seem redundant, but they have subtly different meanings, as; detailed below.; A calculation can use either pure (5D, 7F, 9G, etc.) basis functions or; Cartesian (6D, 10F, 15G, etc.), as dictated by the input file / basis set; specification. Also, the basis can be represented in terms of atomic; orbitals (AO) or symmetry-adapted orbitals (SO). Further complications; come from the fact that a nearly linearly-dependent basis set will have; functions removed from it to prevent redundancies. With all of these; factors in mind, here are the conventions used internally:. nao — The number of atomic orbitals in Cartesian representation.; nso — The number of atomic orbitals but in the pure representation if the current basis uses pure functions, number of Cartesian AOs otherwise.; nbf — The number of basis functions, which is the same as nso.; nmo — The number of basis functions, after projecting out redundancies in the basis.

Programming with the Core Libraries; Linear Algebra in PSI4. Linear Algebra in PSI4¶. How to call BLAS & LAPACK in PSI4¶; Computational chemistry is essentially linear algebra on molecular; systems, so using stable, portable, scalable, and efficient numerical; linear algebra methods in PSI4 is critical. To that end, we use BLAS1; (vector-vector operations, like dot products), BLAS2 (matrix-vector; operations, like rank-1 update), BLAS3 (matrix-matrix operations, like; matrix multiplication), and LAPACK (advanced matrix decompositions and; solutions). The methods provided by BLAS and LAPACK are standard, but the; performance of actual implementations differ greatly from one version to; another. Moreover, the standard interfaces to the libraries are Fortran,; so PSI4 provides a common set of wrappers in psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libqt/qt.h . Warning; Although block_matrix, init_array, and print_mat are still; around, their use is discouraged in favor of operations on; psi4.core.Matrix itself. The advice in these docs will catch up; shortly. BLAS Wrappers¶; BLAS wrappers are currently fully supported at double precision.; BLAS commands involving matrices are wrapped so as to be conventional; C-style “row-major” indexing, meaning that the column is the fast index; like normal. The calls to BLAS1 routines are wrapped so as to allow for operations on; vectors with more than 2^{31} elements (~16 GB, getting to be a problem).; So passing a signed or unsigned long works, though the stride arguments; must be integers.; All routines are declared in qt.h. Each routine is prefixed with a; C_, followed by the standard Fortran name of the routine, in capital; letters. Input parameters of single primitives (int, double,; unsigned long int, char, …) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous; memory (as provided by block_matrix, for example), ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/prog_blas.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/prog_blas.html

Note that the individual functions are not normalized for; angular momentum as in most codes: the self-overlap of a PSI4 Cartesian D; or higher function with more than one nonzero Cartesian exponent (e.g., lx; = 1, ly = 1, lz = 0) will be less than one. If Spherical Harmonics are; used, 2L + 1 real combinations of the spherical harmonics are built from; the (L+1)(L+2)/2 Cartesian Gaussians, according to H. Schlegel and M.; Frish, IJQC, 54, 83-87, 1995. Unlike Cartesian functions these functions; are all strictly normalized. Note that in PSI4, the real combinations of; spherical harmonic functions (see the paragraph below Eq. 15 in the; Schlegel paper) are ordered as: 0, 1+, 1-, 2+, 2-, ….; USO (Unique Symmetry-Adapted Orbitals): Spatial symmetry-adapted; combinations of SOs, blocked according to irrep. The total number of USOs; is the same as the number of SOs, but the number of USOs within each irrep; is usually much smaller, which can lead to significant performance; improvements. Note that this basis is sometimes unfortunately referred to; as the SO basis, so it’s a bit context specific.; OSO (Orthogonal Symmetry-Adapted Orbitals): USOs orthogonalized by; Symmetric or Canonical Orthogonalization. The number of OSOs may be; slightly smaller than the total number of USOs, due to removal of linear; dependencies via Canonical Orthogonalization. The OSOs are rarely; encountered, as usually we go straight from USOs to MOs.; MO (Molecular Orbitals): The combination of OSOs that diagonalizes; the Fock Matrix, so each basis function is a Hartree-Fock (or Kohn-Sham); molecular orbital. The number of OSOs and MOs is always the same.

DGEMM: General Matrix-Matrix product; DTRMM: General Triangular Matrix-General Matrix product; DTRSM: Triangular Matrix-General Matrix solution via back substitution (just as fast as DTRMM); DSYMM/DSYMV calls are not appreciably faster than DGEMM calls, and should only be used in expert situations (like using the other half of the matrix for some form of other transformation).; DTRMM/DTRMV calls are 2x faster than DGEMM, and should be used where possible. LAPACK Wrappers¶; All standard LAPACK 3.2 double precision routines are provided.; LAPACK commands remain in Fortran’s “column-major” indexing, so all the; results will be transposed, and leading dimensions may have to be fiddled; with (using lda = n in both directions for square matrices is highly; recommended). An example of the former problem is a Cholesky; Decomposition: you expect to get back a lower triangular matrix L such; that L L^T = A, but this is returned in column-major order, so the actual; recovery of the matrix A with the row-major BLAS wrappers effectively; involves L^T L = A. On of the biggest consequences is in linear equations:; The input/output forcing/solution vector must be explicitly formed in; column-major indexing (each vector is placed in a C++ row, with its; entries along the C++ column). This is visualized in C++ as the transpose; of the forcing/solution vector. All routines are declared in qt.h. Each; routine is prefixed with a C_, followed by the standard Fortran name of; the routine, in capital letters. Input parameters of single primitives; (int, double, unsigned long int, char, …) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous memory; (as provided by block_matrix, for example), and are passed by providing a; pointer to the first double or int element of the data (this is array[0]; if array is double**).

Although this looks more complex, it’s essentially doing the same thing. There; are a number of differences that we’ll highlight now. Sieving¶; This is one of two breaking changes to the old style syntax. Instead of; constructing a sieve object, the integral object should be queried directly; using the exact same syntax. Requests for whether a shell is significant or a; shell block is significant are both supported. A sieve object is created if; matching basis sets are found in either the bra or the ket.

Therefore care must be taken to ensure that the missing permutations; are correctly accounted for when processing the integrals within the loop. See; the DirectJK code in libfock for an example of using this scheme for a Fock; matrix build. Using bra-ket symmetry¶; In cases where there is no batching performed, bra-ket symmetry can be; trivially enforced by ensuring that one of the block indices is greater than or; equal to the other. When batching is used, the situation is trickier; some ket; batches may contain a mixture of integrals that are bra-ket unique and those; that are not. To handle this we must do a coarse check at the top of the loop; to see if any integrals in the batch are needed, which is implemented by; asking the integral engine where to start looping in the ket via the call to; eri->first_RS_shell_block(PQpair_idx). This is followed by a more fine; grained check within the loops to filter individual integrals in the case where; bra and ket have the same angular momentum and there’s a possibility of a; handful of integrals coming from the ket that are redundant. Note that the bra; is not batched in any of our engines currently: only the ket is. For this; reason, density fitting integrals should be written as (A0|PQ) rather than; (PQ|A0) where possible, because we want the ket to contain more functions than; the bra for efficient blocking. Instantiating integral objects¶; With sieving being introduced in the new integral objects, the cost of their; construction has increased. Although significantly cheaper than computing; integrals themselves, construction of integral objects can be non-negligible,; especially if many threads are used. For example, this pattern can be found in; old versions of the code:; std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(facto",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/prog_integrals-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/prog_integrals-1.html

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/prog_integrals-1.html:5990,Deployability,update,updated,5990," The old code copied integrals into a buffer owned by the integral object, whose; address remained constant and could be retrieved by the buffer() member; function. To avoid unnecessary copies, the new code instead uses the integrals; directly from the underlying integral engine’s memory, which may change with; each call to compute integrals. The integral engine provides a; std::vector<const double*> containing the pointers to the start of each; “chunk” of integrals. For first derivatives there are 12 such “chunks”, which; are ordered Px,Py,Pz,Qx,Qy,Qz,Rx,Ry,Rz,Sx,Sy,Sz, where the Px refers to the x; derivative with respect to the basis functions in shell P. Note that all; integral derivatives are provided by the new integral code, unlike the previous; version where only 9 of 12 were provided and the user was responsible for using; translation invariance relationships to fill in the rest.

Density Screening¶; The old code looked only at the integral to determine whether terms can be; avoided a priori. However, if the integral is to be contracted with a; density or a density-like quantity, the screening can be performed on the; product, which yields more sparsity. To enable this, simply call the integral; object’s update_density member, passing it a SharedMatrix holding the; current density (remember that it changes during each iteration of the SCF) and; the product will be considered during screening.

Shell blocking¶; Each underlying integral engine knows whether it will use blocks, and will set up; the metadata automatically.

Only shell pairs with significant; overlap are included in the shell block information, making this an efficient; way to loop over non-negligible terms. Permutational symmetry¶; The pairs within each block are optimized for efficiency. First, they are; screened during the integral object’s creation to ensure that only terms with; appreciable overlap are stored. Second, only P,Q combinations that are; permutationally unique are stored, ordered with the higher angular momentum; first.

Instantiating integral objects¶; With sieving being introduced in the new integral objects, the cost of their; construction has increased. Although significantly cheaper than computing; integrals themselves, construction of integral objects can be non-negligible,; especially if many threads are used. For example, this pattern can be found in; old versions of the code:; std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; }. This builds many objects and the cost can add up. With the new scheme,; integral objects are forced to implement a clone() member that can be used as; follows:; std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(ints[0]->clone()));; }. This method only incurs the cost of creating a single integral object, and; performs much cheaper cloning operations to create the other objects for each; thread. Moreover, if integral objects are created only in the initialization; of each code that uses them, and stored persistently, the cost of integral; object creation is further reduced. table of contents.

Although this looks more complex, it’s essentially doing the same thing. There; are a number of differences that we’ll highlight now. Sieving¶; This is one of two breaking changes to the old style syntax. Instead of; constructing a sieve object, the integral object should be queried directly; using the exact same syntax.

Using bra-ket symmetry¶; In cases where there is no batching performed, bra-ket symmetry can be; trivially enforced by ensuring that one of the block indices is greater than or; equal to the other. When batching is used, the situation is trickier; some ket; batches may contain a mixture of integrals that are bra-ket unique and those; that are not. To handle this we must do a coarse check at the top of the loop; to see if any integrals in the batch are needed, which is implemented by; asking the integral engine where to start looping in the ket via the call to; eri->first_RS_shell_block(PQpair_idx). This is followed by a more fine; grained check within the loops to filter individual integrals in the case where; bra and ket have the same angular momentum and there’s a possibility of a; handful of integrals coming from the ket that are redundant. Note that the bra; is not batched in any of our engines currently: only the ket is. For this; reason, density fitting integrals should be written as (A0|PQ) rather than; (PQ|A0) where possible, because we want the ket to contain more functions than; the bra for efficient blocking. Instantiating integral objects¶; With sieving being introduced in the new integral objects, the cost of their; construction has increased.

Instantiating integral objects¶; With sieving being introduced in the new integral objects, the cost of their; construction has increased. Although significantly cheaper than computing; integrals themselves, construction of integral objects can be non-negligible,; especially if many threads are used. For example, this pattern can be found in; old versions of the code:; std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; }. This builds many objects and the cost can add up. With the new scheme,; integral objects are forced to implement a clone() member that can be used as; follows:; std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(ints[0]->clone()));; }. This method only incurs the cost of creating a single integral object, and; performs much cheaper cloning operations to create the other objects for each; thread. Moreover, if integral objects are created only in the initialization; of each code that uses them, and stored persistently, the cost of integral; object creation is further reduced. table of contents.

The new syntax¶; The newer integral engines being interfaced to PSI4 may or may not require; a group of similar integrals to be computed together in a block using; vectorized instructions. To accomodate this possibility, a new syntax has been; introduced in Libmints:; auto blocksPQ = ints[0]->get_blocks12();; auto blocksRS = ints[0]->get_blocks34();. auto factory= std::make_shared<IntegralFactory>(basisset);; int deriv_level = 0;; bool use_shell_pairs = true;; bool needs_exchange = true;; auto eri = factory->eri(deriv_level, use_shell_pairs, needs_exchange);; const auto &buffers = eri->buffers();. eri->update_density(D);; bool use_batching = eri->maximum_block_size() > 1;. // loop over all the blocks of (P>=Q|; for (size_t blockPQ_idx = 0; blockPQ_idx < blocksPQ.size(); blockPQ_idx++) {; const auto& blockPQ = blocksPQ[blockPQ_idx];; // loop over all the blocks of |R>=S); size_t start = ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/prog_integrals.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/prog_integrals.html

Note that all; integral derivatives are provided by the new integral code, unlike the previous; version where only 9 of 12 were provided and the user was responsible for using; translation invariance relationships to fill in the rest. The addresses for; each chunk are updated in the vector after each call to compute integrals, so; the user should keep a const reference to that object, and query that for the; address of interest. Density Screening¶; The old code looked only at the integral to determine whether terms can be; avoided a priori. However, if the integral is to be contracted with a; density or a density-like quantity, the screening can be performed on the; product, which yields more sparsity. To enable this, simply call the integral; object’s update_density member, passing it a SharedMatrix holding the; current density (remember that it changes during each iteration of the SCF) and; the product will be considered during screening. If only coulomb-like terms; are to be computed, the needs_exchange argument to the integral object; constructor should be set to false, otherwise it should be true to correcly; account for products of the density and integrals that contribute to; exchange-like terms. Shell blocking¶; Each underlying integral engine knows whether it will use blocks, and will set up; the metadata automatically. Instead of looping over individual shells, the; user should loop over blocks supplied by the integral object; these blocks will; be just a single shell quartet combination for the case where blocking is not; used. It is simple to loop over pairs within each block using C++11 syntax, as; demonstrated in the code snippet above. Only shell pairs with significant; overlap are included in the shell block information, making this an efficient; way to loop over non-negligible terms.

Second, only P,Q combinations that are; permutationally unique are stored, ordered with the higher angular momentum; first.

General layout of the core: where new C++ code should live¶. New integral operators¶; Most of the heavy lifting in PSI4 is handled by libmints, which can be; found in the psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libmints directory. New types of one- and; two-electron integral operators should be added here. The Wavefunction class; psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libmints/wavefunction.h is also found here and is a key; part of the infrastructure. Every energy calculation is performed by a class; that derives from Wavefunction and is accessible as a return value in the; Python layer. The Wavefunction class contains all pertinent calculation; results, such as one-particle densities, molecular orbitals and gradients. Completely new methods¶; A new method that is not a modification of existing code belongs in its own; folder in psi4/psi4/src/psi4; see other folders in that exist in that; location for examples of setting up CMake, and make sure that the new folder is; added to psi4/psi4/src/psi4/CMakeLists.txt. There are also a number of; variables that can be exported to be available to the user, as detailed in; PSI Variables. To set these variables, the following member of; Wavefunction should be called:; set_variable(""Variable Name"", variable_value);. The new variable should also be documented in; psi4/doc/sphinxman/source/glossary_psivariables.rst. There are a; number of different helpers to export various quantities from the wavefunction; to external formats such as FCHK and MOLDEN.

Integral consuming technologies¶; The general philosophy in PSI4 is to try write two-electron integral; driven tasks in methods like Hartree-Fock, CIS and CPHF in terms of generalized; Fock-like matrices. From here, a single class can be used to construct these; generalized Fock matrices, which is what libFock; (psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libfock) accomplishes. A number of integral; technologies – such as integral-direct, disk-based and density fitting – are; supported in libFock, making them generally available to all elements of the; code that use the generalized Fock matrix strategy. Exposing C++ code to Python¶; The recent push to move sections of the code that are not a bottleneck into the; Python layer requires that the C++ code is callable from Python and that its; results are accessible. The result accessibility is addressed by populating; the appropriate variables in the Wavefunction object.

However,; the PSI4 ecosystem provides a path for easier and more rapid development; of new features. The earliest versions of PSI4 were written by merging; individual executables that performed specific tasks into a unified C++; executable. By linking this C++ executable against the Python interpreter, the; individual modules could be called in any sequence, enabling a very diverse; range of tasks to be accomplished within a given input. Although Python-driven; model allowed for great flexibility from a user’s perspective, programming was; still relatively difficult because it required modifications to be made in C++; code.; Since those early days, the code has undergone some important structural; changes that have greatly simplified the development workflow. These changes; were motivated by the realization that only a few bottlenecks exist in a typical; calculation; by focusing on optimized C++ implementations of these bottlenecks; and making these C++ functions available in Python, most of the code to implement; the overall calculation can be written in simpler Python code. Python is far; better suited to management tasks such as directory navigation and retrieval,; making it a natural choice for overall calculation layout than C++. With the; emergence of NumPy as a standard tool for executing almost any; mathematical technique efficiently in Python, the transitioning of code from; C++ to Python has facilitated a much simpler work flow for prototyping and; developing methods: this is detailed in the next section. Rapid initial development using Psi4NumPy¶; The Psi4NumPy project [Smith:2018:3504] is the recommended; mechanism for developing and prototyping new methods in Psi4.

The earliest versions of PSI4 were written by merging; individual executables that performed specific tasks into a unified C++; executable. By linking this C++ executable against the Python interpreter, the; individual modules could be called in any sequence, enabling a very diverse; range of tasks to be accomplished within a given input. Although Python-driven; model allowed for great flexibility from a user’s perspective, programming was; still relatively difficult because it required modifications to be made in C++; code.; Since those early days, the code has undergone some important structural; changes that have greatly simplified the development workflow. These changes; were motivated by the realization that only a few bottlenecks exist in a typical; calculation; by focusing on optimized C++ implementations of these bottlenecks; and making these C++ functions available in Python, most of the code to implement; the overall calculation can be written in simpler Python code. Python is far; better suited to management tasks such as directory navigation and retrieval,; making it a natural choice for overall calculation layout than C++. With the; emergence of NumPy as a standard tool for executing almost any; mathematical technique efficiently in Python, the transitioning of code from; C++ to Python has facilitated a much simpler work flow for prototyping and; developing methods: this is detailed in the next section.

Because; NumPy provides such a rich set of features for efficient linear; algebra, Fourier transforms, and general tensor manipulations, a massive number; of methods can be easily implemented very easily using that library.

For details about how to write these plugins, see the; Creating New Plugins section. Incorporating code into PSI4¶; For features to be incorporated fully into the PSI4 ecosystem, changes to; the core routines are inevitable. However, the programmer should think very; carefully about the most appropriate language for the task in hand. Let’s; consider a new feature that downloads some data from an external source and; then performs some kind of expensive matrix operation on those data. Because; Python has a rich set of tools for obtaining data from external sources,; writing this tool in the Python layer is a natural choice. If we know that the; matrix will always be small enough to fit in memory, we can simply rely on the; routines present in NumPy to do the heavy lifting and the code is easy to; implement entirely in the Python layer. In the case where the matrix operation; is non-standard and requires some specialized code to handle disk-based; storage, the decision to write in Python is less clear cut.

Sirianni. Note: Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with Psi4. In Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with import psi4 at the top, and commands are behind the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode. Note: PsiAPI mode has been available since late 2016 and the v1.1 release. While we aim to provide deprecation warnings and upgrade helpers, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Here, we will explore the basics of using Psi4 in the interactive PsiAPI style where it is loaded directly as a Python module by reproducing the section A Psi4 Tutorial from the Psi4 manual in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.; Note: If the newest version of Psi4 (v.1.1a2dev42 or newer) is in your path, feel free to execute each cell as you read along by pressing Shift+Enter when the cell is selected. I. Basic Input Structure¶; Psi4 is now a Python module; so, we need to import it into our Python environment:. [1]:. # Ignore this block -- it's for the documentation build; try:; import os, sys; sys.path.insert(1, os.path.abspath('/home/runner/work/psi4/psi4/code",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi-1.html

Basic Input Structure¶; Psi4 is now a Python module; so, we need to import it into our Python environment:. [1]:. # Ignore this block -- it's for the documentation build; try:; import os, sys; sys.path.insert(1, os.path.abspath('/home/runner/work/psi4/psi4/code/objdir/stage//usr/local/psi4/lib/')); except ImportError:; pass. # This is the important part; import psi4. Psi4 is now able to be controlled directly from Python. By default, Psi4 will print any output to the screen; this can be changed by giving a file name (with path if not in the current working directory) to the function psi4.core.set_output_file() API, as a string:. [2]:. psi4.core.set_output_file('output.dat', False). Additionally, output may be suppressed by instead setting psi4.core.be_quiet() API. II. Running a Basic Hartree-Fock Calculation¶; In our first example, we will consider a Hartree-Fock SCF computation for the water molecule using a cc-pVDZ basis set. First, we will set the available memory for Psi4 to use with the psi4.set_memory() API function, which takes either a string like '30 GB' (with units!) or an integer number of bytes of memory as its argument.

As indicated in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the computation and grep-able with ~), the energy decreases with each step, and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle, these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do not).; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~  Step         Total Energy             Delta E       MAX Force       RMS Force        MAX Disp        RMS Disp  ~ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~     1     -76.026632734908    -76.026632734908      0.01523518      0.01245755      0.02742222      0.02277530  ~     2     -76.027022666011     -0.000389931104      0.00178779      0.00142946     ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi-1.html

For instance, psi4.frequency() API will compute molecular vibrational frequencies, and psi4.optimize() API will perform a geometry optimization. IV.

The table can be printed either to the screen, by using standard Python ``print()` syntax <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#print-is-a-function>`__, or to the designated output file output.dat using Psi4’s built-in function psi4.core.print_out() API (C style printing).; As we’ve seen so far, the combination of Psi4 and Python creates a unique, interactive approach to quantum chemistry. The next section will explore this synergistic relationship in greater detail, describing how even very complex tasks can be done very easily with Psi4. [ ]:. table of contents.

Sirianni. Note: Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with Psi4. In Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with import psi4 at the top, and commands are behind the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode. Note: PsiAPI mode has been available since late 2016 and the v1.1 release. While we aim to provide deprecation warnings and upgrade helpers, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Here, we will explore the basics of using Psi4 in the interactive PsiAPI style where it is loaded directly as a Python module by reproducing the section A Psi4 Tutorial from the Psi4 manual in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.; Note: If the newest version of Psi4 (v.1.1a2dev42 or newer) is in your path, feel free to execute each cell as you read along by pressing Shift+Enter when the cell is selected.

If an option needs to be visible only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the code), it can be set by with the; psi4.set_module_options() API function, psi4.set_module_options('scf', {'e_convergence': '1e-8'}).; Note: The arguments to the functions we’ve used so far, like psi4.set_options() API, psi4.set_module_options() API, psi4.energy() API, psi4.optimize(); API, psi4.frequency() API, etc., are case-insensitive.; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found (Hohenstein:2012:WIREs) with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and without diffuse \(d\) functions on heavy atoms) (Papajak:2011:10). So,; we’ll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors while providing much faster computations (Hohenstein:2010:184111,Hohenstein:2010:014101). Since we’re using density fitting for the SAPT, we might as well also use it for the Hartree-Fock; computations that are performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that by adding 'scf_type': 'df' to the dictionary passed to psi4.set_options().; Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that pair with the primary basis set.

We can specify that by adding 'scf_type': 'df' to the dictionary passed to psi4.set_options().; Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that pair with the primary basis set. Fortunately, Psi4 is usually smart enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given computation. In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set) that Psi4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT auxiliary basis for the Hartree-Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set for the SAPT; procedure.; To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to freeze the core electrons by adding 'freeze_core': 'true' to the dictionary passed to psi4.set_options(). The SAPT procedure is invoked by psi4.energy('sapt0/jun-cc-pvdz', molecule=dimer). Here, Psi4 knows to automatically run two monomer computations and a dimer computation and then use these results to perform the SAPT analysis.

Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy¶; Finally, let’s consider an example which highlights the advantages of being able to interact with Psi4 directly with Python.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to generate separate geometries for each distance to be studied. Instead, we can leverage Python loops and string formatting to make our lives simpler. Additionally, let’s suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies. Counterpoise correction involves; computing the dimer energy and then subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to know what method you want to do the couterpoise correction on (here, let’s consider CCSD(T)), and it needs; to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the psi4.geometry() string can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne\(_2\) at a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) interaction energies (in kcal/mol) at each geometry:. [9]:. #!

A PSI4 Tutorial; PsiAPI Tutorial: Using Psi4 as a Python Module. PsiAPI Tutorial: Using Psi4 as a Python Module¶; transcribed by D. A. Sirianni. Note: Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with Psi4. In Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with import psi4 at the top, and commands are behind the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode. Note: PsiAPI mode has been available since late 2016 and the v1.1 release. While we aim to provide deprecation warnings and upgrade helpers, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Here, we will explore the basics of using Psi4 in the interactive PsiAPI style where it is loaded directly as a Python module by reproducing the section A Psi4 Tutorial from the Psi4 manual in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.; Note: If the newest version of Psi4 (v.1.1a2dev42 or newer) is in your path, feel free to execute each cell as you read along by pressing Shift+Enter when the cell is selected. I. Basic Input Structure¶; Psi4 is now a Python module; so, we need to import it into our Python environment:.

The program correctly guessed all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where not all the electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation on methylene (\(\text{CH}_2\)), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S + 1 = 3\)). In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, Psi4 can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two; integers in the Z-matrix (note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule specification below). In this example, we will also specify the bond length and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are first stored and then inserted into the geometry specification using Python 3 string formatting.

This function takes a Python dictionary as its argument, which is a key-value list which associates a Psi4 keyword with its user-defined value. For open shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree-Fock, or UHF) or restricted orbitals (restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than ROHF). III.

(This information could be used to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation. You can see this in the next section of the output file output.dat. The vibrational frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G.; Note: Psi4 has several synonyms for the functions called in this example. For instance, psi4.frequency() API will compute molecular vibrational frequencies, and psi4.optimize() API will perform a geometry optimization. IV. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. Psi4 contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) (Jeziorski:1994:1887). This kind of analysis gives a lot of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and Psi4 makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two dashes, like this:.

Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy¶; Finally, let’s consider an example which highlights the advantages of being able to interact with Psi4 directly with Python.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to generate separate geometries for each distance to be studied. Instead, we can leverage Python loops and string formatting to make our lives simpler. Additionally, let’s suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies. Counterpoise correction involves; computing the dimer energy and then subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to know what method you want to do the couterpoise correction on (here, let’s consider CCSD(T)), and it needs; to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the psi4.geometry() string can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne\(_2\) at a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) interaction energies (in kcal/mol) at each geometry:. [9]:. #!

Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in the ne2_geometry string like we normally would. That’s because we are going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface, by using a Python loop over the list of interatomic distances Rvals.; Before we are able to pass our molecule to Psi4, we need to do two things. First, we must set the value of the intermolecular separation in our Z-matrix (by using Python 3 string formatting) to the particular value of R. Second, we need to turn the Z-matrix string into a Psi4 molecule, by passing it to `psi4.geometry() <http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/api/psi4.driver.geometry.html#psi4.driver.geometry>`__. The; argument bsse_type='cp' tells Psi4 to perform counterpoise (CP) correction on the dimer to compute the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ interaction energy, which is stored in our ecp dictionary at each iteration of our Python loop. Note that we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. Psi4 does it all for us, automatically.; Near the very end of the output file output.dat, the counterpoise correction Python function will print a nice summary of the results of the counterpoise computation (the energies of the dimer, of monomer 1 with the ghost functions of monomer 2, of monomer 2 with the ghost functions of monomer 1, and the overall counterpoise corrected interaction energy):; N-Body: Computing complex (1/2) with fragments (2,) in the basis of fragments (1, 2).; ...; N-Body: Complex Energy (fragments = (2,), basis = (1, 2): -128.70932405488924); ...; N-Body: Computing complex (2/2) with fragments (1,) in the basis of fragments (1, 2).; ...; N-Body: Complex Energy (fragments = (1,), basis = (1, 2): -128.70932405488935); ...; N-Body: Co",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi-1.html

Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies AT THE OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. Luckily, Psi4 updates the molecule with optimized geometry as it is being optimized. So, the optimized geometry for H\(_2\)O is stored inside the h2o molecule object, which we can access! To compute the frequencies, all we need to do; is to again pass the molecule=h2o argument to the psi4.frequency() API function:.

The program correctly guessed all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where not all the electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation on methylene (\(\text{CH}_2\)), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S + 1 = 3\)).

This function takes a Python dictionary as its argument, which is a key-value list which associates a Psi4 keyword with its user-defined value. For open shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree-Fock, or UHF) or restricted orbitals (restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than ROHF). III. Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations (as specified by the psi4.energy() API function). Of course there are other kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing psi4.energy() API with; psi4.optimize() API or psi4.frequency() API, respectively.; Let’s take a look at an example of optimizing the H\(_2\)O molecule using Hartree-Fock with a cc-pVDZ basis set.; Now, here comes the real beauty of running Psi4 interactively: above, when we computed the energy of H\(_2\)O with HF/cc-pVDZ, we defined the Psi4 molecule object h2o. Since we’re still in the Python shell, as long as you executed that block of code, we can reuse the h2o molecule object in our optimization without redefining it, by adding the molecule=h2o argument to the psi4.optimize(); API function:.

The SAPT code is designed to use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors while providing much faster computations (Hohenstein:2010:184111,Hohenstein:2010:014101). Since we’re using density fitting for the SAPT, we might as well also use it for the Hartree-Fock; computations that are performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that by adding 'scf_type': 'df' to the dictionary passed to psi4.set_options().; Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that pair with the primary basis set.

The SAPT procedure is invoked by psi4.energy('sapt0/jun-cc-pvdz', molecule=dimer). Here, Psi4 knows to automatically run two monomer computations and a dimer computation and then use these results to perform the SAPT analysis. The various energy components are printed at the end of the output, in addition to; the total SAPT0 interaction energy. An explanation of the various energy components can be found in the review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz (Jeziorski:1994:1887), and this is discussed in more detail in the SAPT section of the Psi4 manual.; For now, we’ll note that most of the SAPT energy components are negative; this means those are attractive contribut",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi-1.html

Running a Basic Hartree-Fock Calculation¶; In our first example, we will consider a Hartree-Fock SCF computation for the water molecule using a cc-pVDZ basis set. First, we will set the available memory for Psi4 to use with the psi4.set_memory() API function, which takes either a string like '30 GB' (with units!) or an integer number of bytes of memory as its argument. Next, our molecular geometry is passed as a string into; psi4.geometry() API. We may input this geometry in either Z-matrix or Cartesian format; to allow the string to break over multiple lines, use Python’s triple-quote """"""string"""""" syntax. Finally, we will compute the Hartree-Fock SCF energy with the cc-pVDZ basis set by passing the method/basis set as a string ('scf/cc-pvdz') into the function psi4.energy(); API:. [3]:. #!

Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Here, we will explore the basics of using Psi4 in the interactive PsiAPI style where it is loaded directly as a Python module by reproducing the section A Psi4 Tutorial from the Psi4 manual in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.; Note: If the newest version of Psi4 (v.1.1a2dev42 or newer) is in your path, feel free to execute each cell as you read along by pressing Shift+Enter when the cell is selected.

Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies AT THE OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. Luckily, Psi4 updates the molecule with optimized geometry as it is being optimized. So, the optimized geometry for H\(_2\)O is stored inside the h2o molecule object, which we can access! To compute the frequencies, all we need to do; is to again pass the molecule=h2o argument to the psi4.frequency() API function:.

Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. Psi4 contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) (Jeziorski:1994:1887). This kind of analysis gives a lot of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and Psi4 makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two dashes, like this:.

Note: Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with Psi4. In Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with import psi4 at the top, and commands are behind the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode. Note: PsiAPI mode has been available since late 2016 and the v1.1 release. While we aim to provide deprecation warnings and upgrade helpers, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Here, we will explore the basics of using Psi4 in the interactive PsiAPI style where it is loaded directly as a Python module by reproducing the section A Psi4 Tutorial from the Psi4 manual in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.; Note: If the newest version of Psi4 (v.1.1a2dev42 or newer) is in your path, feel free to execute each cell as you read along by pressing Shift+Enter when the cell is selected. I. Basic Input Structure¶; Psi4 is now a Python module; so, we need to import it into our Python environment:.

The program correctly guessed all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where not all the electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation on methylene (\(\text{CH}_2\)), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S + 1 = 3\)). In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, Psi4 can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two; integers in the Z-matrix (note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule specification below). In this example, we will also specify the bond length and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are first stored and then inserted into the geometry specification using Python 3 string formatting. [4]:. #! Sample UHF/6-31G** CH2 Computation.

This function takes a Python dictionary as its argument, which is a key-value list which associates a Psi4 keyword with its user-defined value. For open shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree-Fock, or UHF) or restricted orbitals (restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than ROHF). III.

(This information could be used to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation. You can see this in the next section of the output file output.dat. The vibrational frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G.; Note: Psi4 has several synonyms for the functions called in this example. For instance, psi4.frequency() API will compute molecular vibrational frequencies, and psi4.optimize() API will perform a geometry optimization. IV. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. Psi4 contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) (Jeziorski:1994:1887). This kind of analysis gives a lot of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and Psi4 makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two dashes, like this:.

First, you can see the geometry string ne2_geometry has a two dashes to separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in the ne2_geometry string like we normally would. That’s because we are going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface, by using a Python loop over the list of interatomic distances Rvals.; Before we are able to pass our molecule to Psi4, we need to do two things. First, we must set the value of the intermolecular separation in our Z-matrix (by using Python 3 string formatting) to the particular value of R. Second, we need to turn the Z-matrix string into a Psi4 molecule, by passing it to `psi4.geometry() <http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/api/psi4.driver.geometry.html#psi4.driver.geometry>`__. The; argument bsse_type='cp' tells Psi4 to perform counterpoise (CP) correction on the dimer to compute the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ interaction energy, which is stored in our ecp dictionary at each iteration of our Python loop.

In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with import psi4 at the top, and commands are behind the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode. Note: PsiAPI mode has been available since late 2016 and the v1.1 release. While we aim to provide deprecation warnings and upgrade helpers, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Here, we will explore the basics of using Psi4 in the interactive PsiAPI style where it is loaded directly as a Python module by reproducing the section A Psi4 Tutorial from the Psi4 manual in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.; Note: If the newest version of Psi4 (v.1.1a2dev42 or newer) is in your path, feel free to execute each cell as you read along by pressing Shift+Enter when the cell is selected. I. Basic Input Structure¶; Psi4 is now a Python module; so, we need to import it into our Python environment:.

Psi4 is now able to be controlled directly from Python. By default, Psi4 will print any output to the screen; this can be changed by giving a file name (with path if not in the current working directory) to the function psi4.core.set_output_file() API, as a string:.

This function takes a Python dictionary as its argument, which is a key-value list which associates a Psi4 keyword with its user-defined value. For open shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree-Fock, or UHF) or restricted orbitals (restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than ROHF). III.

Of course there are other kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency computations.

Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy¶; Finally, let’s consider an example which highlights the advantages of being able to interact with Psi4 directly with Python.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to generate separate geometries for each distance to be studied. Instead, we can leverage Python loops and string formatting to make our lives simpler. Additionally, let’s suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies. Counterpoise correction involves; computing the dimer energy and then subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to know what method you want to do the couterpoise correction on (here, let’s consider CCSD(T)), and it needs; to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the psi4.geometry() string can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne\(_2\) at a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) interaction energies (in kcal/mol) at each geometry:. [9]:. #!

Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in the ne2_geometry string like we normally would. That’s because we are going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface, by using a Python loop over the list of interatomic distances Rvals.; Before we are able to pass our molecule to Psi4, we need to do two things. First, we must set the value of the intermolecular separation in our Z-matrix (by using Python 3 string formatting) to the particular value of R. Second, we need to turn the Z-matrix string into a Psi4 molecule, by passing it to `psi4.geometry() <http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/api/psi4.driver.geometry.html#psi4.driver.geometry>`__. The; argument bsse_type='cp' tells Psi4 to perform counterpoise (CP) correction on the dimer to compute the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ interaction energy, which is stored in our ecp dictionary at each iteration of our Python loop. Note that we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. Psi4 does it all for us, automatically.; Near the very end of the output file output.dat, the counterpoise correction Python function will print a nice summary of the results of the counterpoise computation (the energies of the dimer, of monomer 1 with the ghost functions of monomer 2, of monomer 2 with the ghost functions of monomer 1, and the overall counterpoise corrected interaction energy):; N-Body: Computing complex (1/2) with fragments (2,) in the basis of fragments (1, 2).; ...; N-Body: Complex Energy (fragments = (2,), basis = (1, 2): -128.70932405488924); ...; N-Body: Computing complex (2/2) with fragments (1,) in the basis of fragments (1, 2).; ...; N-Body: Complex Energy (fragments = (1,), basis = (1, 2): -128.70932405488935); ...; N-Body: Co",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi.html

Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies AT THE OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. Luckily, Psi4 updates the molecule with optimized geometry as it is being optimized. So, the optimized geometry for H\(_2\)O is stored inside the h2o molecule object, which we can access! To compute the frequencies, all we need to do; is to again pass the molecule=h2o argument to the psi4.frequency() API function:.

By default, the energy should be converged to about \(1.0\times 10^{-6}\), so agreement is only expected for about the first 6 digits after the decimal. If the computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the compilation or installation of the program (see the installation instructions in the main Psi4 manual section Compiling and Installing from Source).; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information. Notice we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information like the charge of the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree-Fock, or RHF, is usually appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where not all the electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation on methylene (\(\text{CH}_2\)), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S + 1 = 3\)). In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we need to tell the program the true value (3).

This function takes a Python dictionary as its argument, which is a key-value list which associates a Psi4 keyword with its user-defined value. For open shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree-Fock, or UHF) or restricted orbitals (restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than ROHF). III. Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations (as specified by the psi4.energy() API function). Of course there are other kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing psi4.energy() API with; psi4.optimize() API or psi4.frequency() API, respectively.; Let’s take a look at an example of optimizing the H\(_2\)O molecule using Hartree-Fock with a cc-pVDZ basis set.; Now, here comes the real beauty of running Psi4 interactively: above, when we computed the energy of H\(_2\)O with HF/cc-pVDZ, we defined the Psi4 molecule object h2o. Since we’re still in the Python shell, as long as you executed that block of code, we can reuse the h2o molecule object in our optimization without redefining it, by adding the molecule=h2o argument to the psi4.optimize(); API function:. [5]:. psi4.set_options({'reference': 'rhf'}); psi4.optimize('scf/cc-pvdz', molecule=h2o). Optimizer: Optimization complete!.

So,; we’ll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors while providing much faster computations (Hohenstein:2010:184111,Hohenstein:2010:014101). Since we’re using density fitting for the SAPT, we might as well also use it for the Hartree-Fock; computations that are performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that by adding 'scf_type': 'df' to the dictionary passed to psi4.set_options().; Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that pair with the primary basis set. Fortunately, Psi4 is usually smart enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given computation. In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set) that Psi4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT auxiliary basis for the Hartree-Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set for the SAPT; procedure.; To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to freeze the core electrons by adding 'freeze_core': 'true' to the dictionary passed to psi4.set_options(). The SAPT procedure is invoked by psi4.energy('sapt0/jun-cc-pvdz', molecule=dimer). Here, Psi4 knows to automatically run two monomer computations and a dimer computation and then use these results to perform the SAPT analysis. The various energy components are printed at the end of the output, in addition to; the total SAPT0 interaction energy. An explanation of the various energy components can be found in the review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz (Jeziorski:1994:1887), and this is discussed in more detail in the SAPT section of the Psi4 manual.; For now, we’ll note that most of the SAPT energy components are negative; this means those are attractive contribut",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psiapi.html

Evangelista and Andrew C. Simmonett; Section author: Alexander E. Vaughn; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, PSIMRCC; State-specific Multireference coupled cluster theories provide highly; accurate energies and properties of electronic states that require; a multiconfigurational zeroth-order wavefunction.

Mk-MRCC is; based on the Jeziorski-Monkhorst ansatz [Jeziorski:1981:1668] for the; wavefunction, \(\Psi\). \[\left| \Psi \right \rangle = \sum_\mu^d e^{\hat{T}^\mu} \left| \Phi_\mu \right\rangle c_\mu \, \text{,}\]; where \(\Phi_\mu\) are the reference determinants,; \(\hat{T}^\mu\) are reference-specific excitation operators, and; \(c_\mu\) are expansion coefficients obtained through diagonalization; of the Mk-MRCC effective Hamiltonian matrix that allows the various; reference determinants to interact. As an example of how this works; the Mk-MRCCSD excitation operators for each reference is contracted; two-body terms. \[\hat{T}^\mu = \hat{T}^\mu_1 + \hat{T}^\mu_2\]; where. \[\hat{T}^\mu_1 = \sum_i^{\textrm{occ}(\mu)} \sum_a^{\textrm{vir}(\mu)} t_i^a (\mu) \hat{a}^\dagger_a \hat{a}_i\]; and. \[\hat{T}^\mu_2 =\frac{1}{4} \sum_i^{\textrm{occ}(\mu)} \sum_a^{\textrm{vir}(\mu)} t_{ij}^{ab} (\mu) \hat{a}^\dagger_b \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_a \hat{a}_i\]; The Mk-MRCC energy is a chosen eigenvalue of the effective Hamiltonian,; \(\textrm{H}^{eff}_{\mu \nu}\). \[\sum_\nu \textrm{H}^{eff}_{\mu \nu} c_\nu =E c_\nu\]; where. \[\textrm{H}^{eff}_{\mu \nu} = \left \",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psimrcc-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psimrcc-1.html

The PSIMRCC; module contained in PSI4 implements the state-specific; multireference coupled-cluster approach of Mukherjee and co-workers; (Mk-MRCC). This method is implemented and shown to be a powerful tool in; [Evangelista:2006:154113] and [Evangelista:2008:124104]. Mk-MRCC is; based on the Jeziorski-Monkhorst ansatz [Jeziorski:1981:1668] for the; wavefunction, \(\Psi\). \[\left| \Psi \right \rangle = \sum_\mu^d e^{\hat{T}^\mu} \left| \Phi_\mu \right\rangle c_\mu \, \text{,}\]; where \(\Phi_\mu\) are the reference determinants,; \(\hat{T}^\mu\) are reference-specific excitation operators, and; \(c_\mu\) are expansion coefficients obtained through diagonalization; of the Mk-MRCC effective Hamiltonian matrix that allows the various; reference determinants to interact. As an example of how this works; the Mk-MRCCSD excitation operators for each reference is contracted; two-body terms. \[\hat{T}^\mu = \hat{T}^\mu_1 + \hat{T}^\mu_2\]; where. \[\hat{T}^\mu_1 = \sum_i^{\textrm{occ}(\mu)} \sum_a^{\textrm{vir}(\mu)} t_i^a (\mu) \hat{a}^\dagger_a \hat{a}_i\]; and. \[\hat{T}^\mu_2 =\frac{1}{4} \sum_i^{\textrm{occ}(\mu)} \sum_a^{\textrm{vir}(\mu)} t_{ij}^{ab} (\mu) \hat{a}^\dagger_b \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_a \hat{a}_i\]; The Mk-MRCC energy is a chosen eigenvalue of the effective Hamiltonian,; \(\textrm{H}^{eff}_{\mu \nu}\). \[\sum_\nu \textrm{H}^{eff}_{\mu \nu} c_\nu =E c_\nu\]; where. \[\textrm{H}^{eff}_{\mu \nu} = \left \langle \Phi_\mu \right | \hat{H}e^{\hat{T}^\nu} \left | \Phi_\nu \right \rangle \, \textrm{.}\]; PSI4 currently implements Mk-MRCC with singles and doubles; [Mk-MRCCSD] and Mk-MRCCSD with perturbative triples [Mk-MRCCSD(T)]; as formulated in [Evangelista:2010:074107].

In; PsiAPI mode, access as, e.g., psi4.constants.h. Memory Specification¶; By default, PSI4 assumes that 500 MiB of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 GB of RAM is available; to PSI4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 GB. memory 2000 MB. memory 2000000 kB. Please note that memory can be specified both in IEC binary units (1 KiB = 1024 bytes) and SI units (1 kB = 1000 bytes). PSI4 recognizes and obeys both of them correctly. The units are not case sensitive (Kb and KB are equivalent to kB).; By default, PSI4 performs a “sanity check” when parsing Psithon input files, enforcing a minimum memory requirement of 250 MiB. While it is generally not recomennded to do so, expert users can bypass this check by directly setting the number of bytes availble to PSI4:; # setting available memory to 2 MB; set_memory_bytes(2000000). Please note that this memory setting only governs the maximal memory; usage of the major data structures, and actual total memory usage; is slightly higher. This is usually a negligible amount, except when; setting tiny memory allowances.; One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. ~/.psi4rc File). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 GB.; set_memory(2000000000). However, unless you’re assured of having only one job running on a node at; a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with ~/.psi4rc have similar memory; capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a; per-calculation basis.; That same command can be used for PsiAPI mode:; psi4.set_memory(int(5e8)).

Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules.

However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed. See scf4 for analogous Z-matrix; and Cartiesian scans. Tables of Results¶; The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the Table() Psithon; function. For example, in the following potential energy surface scan for water; molecule h2o {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }.

The relative energies are reported with; respect to the lowest value in each column. More examples of how to control the; formatting of the tables can be found in the sample input files provided; see; Appendix Test Suite and Sample Inputs for a complete listing. Python Wrappers¶; The Python foundations of the PSI4 driver and Psithon syntax permit; many commonly performed post-processing procedures to be integrated into; the PSI4 suite.; As seen in the neon dimer example from the tutorial section,; the nbody_gufunc() wrapper provides automatic computation of; counterpoise-corrected interaction energies between two molecules. For; example,; energy('mp2', bsse_type='cp'). will compute the counterpoise-corrected density-fitted MP2 interaction energy; between two molecules.; PSI4 also provides the cbs() wrapper,; which automatically computes a complete-basis-set extrapolation (and; automatically sets up the computations with different basis sets required to; do the extrapolation). For example,:; # all equivalent. cbs('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2) and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psithoninput-1.html

For example,:; database('mp2', 'S22', cp=1, benchmark='S22B'). will perform DF-MP2 counterpoise-corrected interaction energies; (cp=1) on all members of Hobza’s S22 database set of van der Waals; dimers, and then compare the results against the S22B benchmark energies.; Built-in databases include S22, A24, HTBH, HBC6, HSG, S22by5, S66, JSCH,; NCB31, S66by8, and NBC10, among others.; These wrapper functions are discussed separately in; Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation.

For more elaborate post-processing of computations, adding; return_wfn=True keyword argument additionally returns; Wavefunction.; # power user returns; E, wfn = energy(..., return_wfn=True); E, wfn = optimize(..., return_wfn=True); E, wfn = frequency(..., return_wfn=True); G, wfn = gradient(..., return_wfn=True) # used by optimize(); H, wfn = hessian(..., return_wfn=True) # used by frequency(). # print gradient array and its rms; wfn.gradient.print_out(); print wfn.gradient().rms(). # format output for other programs; molden(wfn, 'mycalc.molden'). # access array in another format; np.array(wfn.hessian()).

To add EFP fragments to a molecule, see Molecule Specification. Job Control Keywords¶; PSI4 comprises a number of C++ modules that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, viz.:; set {; docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]; }. List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening [ is; on the same line as the name of the keyword.; Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the set keyword. Omitting the module; name, or using the name global or globals will result in the keyword being; applied to all modules. For example, in the following input; molecule{; o; h 1 roh; h 1 roh 2 ahoh. roh = 0.957; ahoh = 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1; energy('ccsd'). the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print; level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs cou",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psithoninput-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psithoninput-1.html

Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, any of which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets = [""cc-pVDZ"", ""cc-pVTZ"", ""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of basis_sets is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed.

Please note that memory can be specified both in IEC binary units (1 KiB = 1024 bytes) and SI units (1 kB = 1000 bytes). PSI4 recognizes and obeys both of them correctly. The units are not case sensitive (Kb and KB are equivalent to kB).; By default, PSI4 performs a “sanity check” when parsing Psithon input files, enforcing a minimum memory requirement of 250 MiB. While it is generally not recomennded to do so, expert users can bypass this check by directly setting the number of bytes availble to PSI4:; # setting available memory to 2 MB; set_memory_bytes(2000000). Please note that this memory setting only governs the maximal memory; usage of the major data structures, and actual total memory usage; is slightly higher. This is usually a negligible amount, except when; setting tiny memory allowances.; One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. ~/.psi4rc File).

PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results; of each computation available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of; H2 and H atom:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol * (2*h_energy - h2_energy); print ""De=%f"" % D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command print_variables(). Note that PSI variables; are cleared at the start of each energy(), etc. in an input; file by clean_variables().; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables() command, the; last will include SCF TOTAL ENERGY but not; FCI TOTAL ENERGY.; The entire dictionary of PSI variables can be obtained through; get_variables().

Psithon: Structuring an Input File. Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, PSI4 was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; PSI4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level PSI4 source directory and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all PSI4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the PSI4 code (which; are obtained from NIST CODATA 2014; are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that the user’s ~/.psi4rc values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).; The physical constants used within PSI4, which are automatically; made available within all PSI4 input files are in Physical Constants.; In Psithon input files, prepend physical constants with psi_ to; prevent clashes with user-defined variables (e.g., psi_h).

The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY').

While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 GB of RAM is available; to PSI4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 GB. memory 2000 MB. memory 2000000 kB. Please note that memory can be specified both in IEC binary units (1 KiB = 1024 bytes) and SI units (1 kB = 1000 bytes). PSI4 recognizes and obeys both of them correctly. The units are not case sensitive (Kb and KB are equivalent to kB).; By default, PSI4 performs a “sanity check” when parsing Psithon input files, enforcing a minimum memory requirement of 250 MiB. While it is generally not recomennded to do so, expert users can bypass this check by directly setting the number of bytes availble to PSI4:; # setting available memory to 2 MB; set_memory_bytes(2000000).

Job Control Keywords¶; PSI4 comprises a number of C++ modules that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules.

However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed. See scf4 for analogous Z-matrix; and Cartiesian scans. Tables of Results¶; The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the Table() Psithon; function. For example, in the following potential energy surface scan for water; molecule h2o {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]; Avals=range(100,102,2). table=Table(rows=[""R"",""A""], cols=[""E(SCF)"",""E(SCS)"",""E(DFMP2)""]). set basis cc-pvdz. for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('mp2'); escf = get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY'); edfmp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); escsmp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); table[R][A] = [escf, escsmp2, edfmp2]. print table; relative=table.copy(); relative.absolute_to_relative(); print relative. we first define a table (on line 10) with two row indices and three column; indices.

The relative energies are reported with; respect to the lowest value in each column. More examples of how to control the; formatting of the tables can be found in the sample input files provided; see; Appendix Test Suite and Sample Inputs for a complete listing. Python Wrappers¶; The Python foundations of the PSI4 driver and Psithon syntax permit; many commonly performed post-processing procedures to be integrated into; the PSI4 suite.; As seen in the neon dimer example from the tutorial section,; the nbody_gufunc() wrapper provides automatic computation of; counterpoise-corrected interaction energies between two molecules. For; example,; energy('mp2', bsse_type='cp'). will compute the counterpoise-corrected density-fitted MP2 interaction energy; between two molecules.; PSI4 also provides the cbs() wrapper,; which automatically computes a complete-basis-set extrapolation (and; automatically sets up the computations with different basis sets required to; do the extrapolation). For example,:; # all equivalent. cbs('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2) and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psithoninput.html

For example,:; database('mp2', 'S22', cp=1, benchmark='S22B'). will perform DF-MP2 counterpoise-corrected interaction energies; (cp=1) on all members of Hobza’s S22 database set of van der Waals; dimers, and then compare the results against the S22B benchmark energies.; Built-in databases include S22, A24, HTBH, HBC6, HSG, S22by5, S66, JSCH,; NCB31, S66by8, and NBC10, among others.; These wrapper functions are discussed separately in; Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation.

To add EFP fragments to a molecule, see Molecule Specification. Job Control Keywords¶; PSI4 comprises a number of C++ modules that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, viz.:; set {; docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]; }. List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening [ is; on the same line as the name of the keyword.; Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the set keyword. Omitting the module; name, or using the name global or globals will result in the keyword being; applied to all modules. For example, in the following input; molecule{; o; h 1 roh; h 1 roh 2 ahoh. roh = 0.957; ahoh = 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1; energy('ccsd'). the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print; level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs cou",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psithoninput.html

Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, any of which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets = [""cc-pVDZ"", ""cc-pVTZ"", ""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of basis_sets is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed.

Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, PSI4 was built; upon the Python interpreter.

In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; PSI4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level PSI4 source directory and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all PSI4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the PSI4 code (which; are obtained from NIST CODATA 2014; are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that the user’s ~/.psi4rc values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).; The physical constants used within PSI4, which are automatically; made available within all PSI4 input files are in Physical Constants.; In Psithon input files, prepend physical constants with psi_ to; prevent clashes with user-defined variables (e.g., psi_h).

Job Control Keywords¶; PSI4 comprises a number of C++ modules that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings.

While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 GB of RAM is available; to PSI4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 GB. memory 2000 MB. memory 2000000 kB. Please note that memory can be specified both in IEC binary units (1 KiB = 1024 bytes) and SI units (1 kB = 1000 bytes). PSI4 recognizes and obeys both of them correctly. The units are not case sensitive (Kb and KB are equivalent to kB).; By default, PSI4 performs a “sanity check” when parsing Psithon input files, enforcing a minimum memory requirement of 250 MiB. While it is generally not recomennded to do so, expert users can bypass this check by directly setting the number of bytes availble to PSI4:; # setting available memory to 2 MB; set_memory_bytes(2000000). Please note that this memory setting only governs the maximal memory; usage of the major data structures, and actual total memory usage; is slightly higher. This is usually a negligible amount, except when; setting tiny memory allowances.; One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. ~/.psi4rc File). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 GB.; set_memory(2000000000). However, unless you’re assured of having only one job running on a node at; a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with ~/.psi4rc have similar memory; capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a; per-calculation basis.; That same command can be used for P",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psithoninput.html

PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results; of each computation available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of; H2 and H atom:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol * (2*h_energy - h2_energy); print ""De=%f"" % D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command print_variables(). Note that PSI variables; are cleared at the start of each energy(), etc. in an input; file by clean_variables().; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables() command, the; last will include SCF TOTAL ENERGY but not; FCI TOTAL ENERGY.; The entire dictionary of PSI variables can be obtained through; get_variables().

Psithon: Structuring an Input File. Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, PSI4 was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; PSI4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level PSI4 source directory and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all PSI4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the PSI4 code (which; are obtained from NIST CODATA 2014; are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that the user’s ~/.psi4rc values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).; The physical constants used within PSI4, which are automatically; made available within all PSI4 input files are in Physical Constants.; In Psithon input files, prepend physical constants with psi_ to; prevent clashes with user-defined variables (e.g., psi_h). In; PsiAPI mode, access as, e.g., psi4.constants.h.

The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable.

Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function.

If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments.

Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the \(^2B_1\); state of water cation, we can specify; SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure.

In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice for symbol.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with \(D_{2h}\) symmetry in \(C_{2v}\), the; \(C_2\) axis can be chosen as either the \(x\), the \(y\), or the \(z\); these can; be specified by requesting the symmetry as c2vx, c2vy, or c2vz, respectively.; Likewise the c2x, c2y, c2z, c2hx, c2hy, and c2hz; labels are valid. For \(C_s\) symmetry the labels csx, csy, and; csz request the \(yz\), \(xz\), and \(xy\) planes be used as the mirror plane,; respectively. If no unique axis is specified, PSI4 will choose an appropriate; subgroup.; Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational; frequencies, might lower the symmetry of the molecule. When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the \(^2B_1\); state of water cation, we can specify; SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic.

The use of fixed values and variables are supported for both. For; example, the geometry for H2 can be specified a number of ways, using the; molecule optional_molecule_name {...} block.; molecule {; H; H 1 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H; H 1 r; r = 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H1; H2 H1 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 -r; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.45; }. Blank lines are ignored and, unlike regular Python syntax, indentation within; the molecule block does not matter, although the molecule keyword itself must; be aligned within the input according to standard Python syntax.

Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }.

The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, PSI4 can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem] database.; For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; PSI4 to search PubChem for a starting structure. The search is actually; performed for compounds whose name contains “benzene”, so multiple; entries will be returned. If the name provided (“benzene” in the above; example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used. If no; exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier; (CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more; specific name. For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a; compound whose name(s) contain “benzene”, but we’re not sure of the exact IUPAC; name, the following input can be used:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene*; }. Appending the “*” prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time; of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file:; Chemical ID IUPAC Name; 241 benzene; 7371 benzenesulfonic acid; 91526 benzenesulfonate; 244 phenylmethanol; 727 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane; 240 benzaldehyde; 65723 benzenesulfonohydrazide; 74296 N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide; 289 benzene-1,2-diol; 243 benzoic acid; 7370 ben",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psithonmol-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psithonmol-1.html

Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry.

Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule.

In this case, the charge and multiplicity of each interacting fragment is; explicitly specified. If the charge and multiplicity are specified for the; first fragment, it is assumed to be the same for all fragments. When; considering interacting fragments, the overall charge is simply the sum of all; fragment charges, and any unpaired electrons are assumed to be coupled to; yield the highest possible \(M_s\) value.; Having defined a molecule containing fragments like eneyne above, it; is a simple matter to perform calculations on only a subset of the; fragments. For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene; fragment alone (extract_subsets(1) pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms; and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the; ethyne fragment ghosted (extract_subsets(1,2) pulls out fragment 1 as; Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. extract_subsets(2,[1,3]):; mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'). clean(). mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf'). If the molecule contains fragments but is not conveniently ordered for the; -- marker, the auto_fragments() function can be applied, as shown in; pywrap-basis, to return as active molecule the previous; active molecule, only fragmented.

OrientationCertain computations require that the molecule is not reoriented. This; can be achieved by adding either no_reorient or noreorient.; To prevent even recentering of the molecule, add no_com or nocom. PubChemA line reading pubchem:mol fetches the geometry for molecule; mol from the PubChem database, where mol is either; the IUPAC molecule name or the CID number. See PubChem Database for; details.

Multiple Molecules¶; To facilitate more elaborate computations, it is possible to provide a name for; each molecule and tell PSI4 which one should be used in a given; calculation.

Although PSI4 will detect the symmetry automatically, and use the largest; possible Abelian subgroup, the user might want to run in a lower point group.; To do this the molecule keyword symmetry symbol can be used; (see Molecule Keywords). In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice for symbol.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier.

PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }.

Note that some of these results do not contain the string “benzene”; these; compounds have synonyms containing that text.

Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, PSI4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjunction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the \(^2B_1\); state of water cation, we can specify; SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure.

In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice for symbol.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with \(D_{2h}\) symmetry in \(C_{2v}\), the; \(C_2\) axis can be chosen as either the \(x\), the \(y\), or the \(z\); these can; be specified by requesting the symmetry as c2vx, c2vy, or c2vz, respectively.; Likewise the c2x, c2y, c2z, c2hx, c2hy, and c2hz; labels are valid. For \(C_s\) symmetry the labels csx, csy, and; csz request the \(yz\), \(xz\), and \(xy\) planes be used as the mirror plane,; respectively. If no unique axis is specified, PSI4 will choose an appropriate; subgroup.; Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational; frequencies, might lower the symmetry of the molecule. When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the \(^2B_1\); state of water cation, we can specify; SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; vari",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psithonmol.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psithonmol.html

For; example, the geometry for H2 can be specified a number of ways, using the; molecule optional_molecule_name {...} block.; molecule {; H; H 1 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H; H 1 r; r = 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H1; H2 H1 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 -r; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.45; }.

Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }.

Multiple Molecules¶; To facilitate more elaborate computations, it is possible to provide a name for; each molecule and tell PSI4 which one should be used in a given; calculation. For example, consider the following input file:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; energy('scf') # on H2. clean(). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; energy('scf') # on H.

The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, PSI4 can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem] database.; For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; PSI4 to search PubChem for a starting structure. The search is actually; performed for compounds whose name contains “benzene”, so multiple; entries will be returned. If the name provided (“benzene” in the above; example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used. If no; exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier; (CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more; specific name. For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a; compound whose name(s) contain “benzene”, but we’re not sure of the exact IUPAC; name, the following input can be used:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene*; }. Appending the “*” prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time; of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file:; Chemical ID IUPAC Name; 241 benzene; 7371 benzenesulfonic acid; 91526 benzenesulfonate; 244 phenylmethanol; 727 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane; 240 benzaldehyde; 65723 benzenesulfonohydrazide; 74296 N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide; 289 benzene-1,2-diol; 243 benzoic acid; 7370 ben",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.4.0/psithonmol.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/psithonmol.html

Note that some of these results do not contain the string “benzene”; these; compounds have synonyms containing that text. We can now replace the; “benzene*” in the input file with one of the above compounds using either the; IUPAC name or the CID provided in the list, viz:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:637563; }. or; molecule benzene {; pubchem:1-methoxy-4-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]benzene; }. Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, PSI4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjunction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group.

In this case, the charge and multiplicity of each interacting fragment is; explicitly specified. If the charge and multiplicity are specified for the; first fragment, it is assumed to be the same for all fragments. When; considering interacting fragments, the overall charge is simply the sum of all; fragment charges, and any unpaired electrons are assumed to be coupled to; yield the highest possible \(M_s\) value.; Having defined a molecule containing fragments like eneyne above, it; is a simple matter to perform calculations on only a subset of the; fragments. For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene; fragment alone (extract_subsets(1) pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms; and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the; ethyne fragment ghosted (extract_subsets(1,2) pulls out fragment 1 as; Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. extract_subsets(2,[1,3]):; mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'). clean(). mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf'). If the molecule contains fragments but is not conveniently ordered for the; -- marker, the auto_fragments() function can be applied, as shown in; pywrap-basis, to return as active molecule the previous; active molecule, only fragmented.

UnitsBy default, Ångström units are used; this is changed by adding; a line that reads units spec, where spec is one; of ang, angstrom, a.u., au, or bohr. OrientationCertain computations require that the molecule is not reoriented. This; can be achieved by adding either no_reorient or noreorient.; To prevent even recentering of the molecule, add no_com or nocom. PubChemA line reading pubchem:mol fetches the geometry for molecule; mol from the PubChem database, where mol is either; the IUPAC molecule name or the CID number. See PubChem Database for; details. SymmetryThe symmetry can be specified by a line reading symmetry; symbol, where symbol is the Schönflies symbol; of the (Abelian) point group to use for the computation, one of one of; c1, c2, ci, cs, d2, c2h, c2v, or d2h.; This need not be specified, as the molecular symmetry is automatically; detected by PSI4.

Multiple Molecules¶; To facilitate more elaborate computations, it is possible to provide a name for; each molecule and tell PSI4 which one should be used in a given; calculation. For example, consider the following input file:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; energy('scf') # on H2. clean(). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; energy('scf') # on H. Here, two separate jobs are performed on two different molecules; the first is; performed on H2, while the second is for H atom. The last molecule to be; specified is the “active” molecule by default. To explicitly activate a named; molecule, the activate command is provided.

For example, water (\(C_{2v}\) symmetry) has three doubly occupied \(A_1\); orbitals, as well as one each of \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) symmetry; the; corresponding DOCC array is therefore:; DOCC = [3, 0, 1, 1]. Although PSI4 will detect the symmetry automatically, and use the largest; possible Abelian subgroup, the user might want to run in a lower point group.; To do this the molecule keyword symmetry symbol can be used; (see Molecule Keywords). In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice for symbol.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with \(D_{2h}\) symmetry in \(C_{2v}\), the; \(C_2\) axis can be chosen as either the \(x\), the \(y\), or the \(z\); these can; be specified by requesting the symmetry as c2vx, c2vy, or c2vz, respectively.; Likewise the c2x, c2y, c2z, c2hx, c2hy, and c2hz; labels are valid.

Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods.

The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure.

Caution; As of 1.0, the below, while essentially still correct, is so aged; as to be difficult to follow. Since quantum chemical methods in PSI4 are accessed through Python functions, and; most important quantities are available as PSI variables, it is straightforward; to create aliases to commonly run calculations or to define hybrid methods. The; psi4/psi4/driver/aliases.py file is intended for editing by the user for; this purpose.; As an example, the MP2.5 method; (which admittedly is already built in to PSI4); is the average of MP2 and MP3. The latter is; available through the arbitrary order MPn code and returns all lower energies; along with it in PSI variables. The following is basic code that will compute; and return the MP2.5 energy.; def run_mp2_5(name, **kwargs):. energy('mp3', **kwargs); e_scf = psi4.get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY'); ce_mp2 = psi4.get_variable('MP2 CORRELATION ENERGY'); ce_mp3 = psi4.get_variable('MP3 CORRELATION ENERGY'). ce_mp25 = 0.5 * (ce_mp2 + ce_mp3); e_mp25 = e_scf + ce_mp25. print """""" MP2.5 total energy: %16.8f\n"""""" % (e_mp25); print """""" MP2.5 correlation energy: %16.8f\n"""""" % (ce_mp25). return e_mp25.

In SAPT, the; Hamiltonian of the dimer is partitioned into contributions from each; monomer and the interaction. \[H=F_A+W_A+F_B+W_B+V\]; Here, the Hamiltonian is written as a sum of the usual monomer Fock; operators, \(F\), the fluctuation potential of each monomer, \(W\), and the; interaction potential, \(V\).

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions.

For now, charge transfer computations are not available with open-shell SAPT0.; A SAPT charge-transfer analysis will perform 5 HF computations: the dimer; in the dimer basis, monomer A in the dimer basis, monomer B in the dimer; basis, monomer A in the monomer A basis, and monomer B in the monomer B; basis. Next, it performs two SAPT computations, one in the dimer basis and; one in the monomer basis. Finally, it will print a summary of the; charge-transfer results:; SAPT Charge Transfer Analysis; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; SAPT Induction (Dimer Basis) -2.0970 [mEh] -1.3159 [kcal/mol] -5.5057 [kJ/mol]; SAPT Induction (Monomer Basis) -1.1396 [mEh] -0.7151 [kcal/mol] -2.9920 [kJ/mol]; SAPT Charge Transfer -0.9574 [mEh] -0.6008 [kcal/mol] -2.5137 [kJ/mol].

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.4.0/sapt-1.html:32968,Availability,error,error,32968,"only its; own basis set). It is also possible to run a closed-shell SAPT computation at any; level using only the monomer-centered basis. To do this, simply add; sapt_basis='monomer' to the energy function, such as; energy('sapt2',sapt_basis='monomer'). This procedure leads to faster compuations, but it converges more slowly; towards the complete basis set limit than the default procedure, which uses; the dimer-centered basis set. Hence, monomer-centered basis SAPT; computations are not recommended. The open-shell SAPT0 code is not; compatible yet with monomer-centered computations. Computations with Mid-bonds¶; SAPT computations with midbonds can be accomplished by adding a third ghost; monomer to the computation. For example; molecule dimer {; 0 1; He 0 0 5; --; 0 1; He 0 0 -5; --; 0 1; @He 0 0 0; }. Here the functions of the third monomer will be added to the virtual space of; the entire computation. Note that an error will be thrown if each atom in the; third monomer is not a ghost to prevent confusion with three-body SAPT which is; not currently supported by Psi4. Interpreting SAPT Results¶; We will examine the results of a SAPT2+3/aug-cc-pVDZ computation on the; water dimer. This computation can be performed with the following; input:; molecule water_dimer {; 0 1; O -1.551007 -0.114520 0.000000; H -1.934259 0.762503 0.000000; H -0.599677 0.040712 0.000000; --; 0 1; O 1.350625 0.111469 0.000000; H 1.680398 -0.373741 -0.758561; H 1.680398 -0.373741 0.758561; units angstrom; }. set globals {; basis aug-cc-pvdz; guess sad; scf_type df; }. set sapt {; print 1; nat_orbs_t2 true; freeze_core true; }. energy('sapt2+3'). To reiterate some of the options mentioned above: the; NAT_ORBS_T2 option will compute MP2 natural orbitals and use; them in the evaluation of the triples correction to dispersion, and the; FREEZE_CORE option will freeze the core throughout the SAPT; computation.

[Parker:2014:094106]; recommend to scale all \(S^{2}\) approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. \[p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alpha}\]; where the recommended exponent is \(\alpha = 1\). To obtain SAPT energies with this scaling,; simply set the keyword exch_scale_alpha true. Alternatively, another value for \(\alpha\); can be specified by setting EXCH_SCALE_ALPHA to a value. For example,; set exch_scale_alpha 1.0. will set \(\alpha = 1.0\) and scale exchange energies with \(p_{EX}(1.0)\).; Instead of this straightforward scaling, SAPT0 energies benefit from a slightly modified; recipe that involves an empirically adjusted exponent \(\alpha = 3.0\).; To distinguish it from its unscaled counterpart, this energy is denoted sSAPT0 (see [Parker:2014:094106]).

SAPT0¶; Generally speaking, SAPT0 should be applied to large systems or large data; sets. The performance of closed-shell SAPT0 relies entirely on error cancellation, which; seems to be optimal with a truncated aug-cc-pVDZ basis, namely,; jun-cc-pVDZ (which we have referred to in previous work as; aug-cc-pVDZ’). We do not recommend using SAPT0 with large basis sets; like aug-cc-pVTZ. A systematic study of the accuracy of closed-shell SAPT0 and other SAPT; truncations, using different basis sets, is reported in; [Parker:2014:094106]. In particular, an empirical recipe for scaled SAPT0; can yield improved performance and has been included in the output file as; the sSAPT0 interaction energy. sSAPT0 is a free by-product and is automatically; computed when SAPT0 is requested (see above for more details).; The SAPT module has been used to perform SAPT0 computations with over; 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions; this code should be scalable to 4000; basis functions. Publications resulting from the use of the SAPT0 code; should cite the following publications: [Hohenstein:2010:184111] and; [Hohenstein:2011:174107]. If the open-shell SAPT0 code is used,; [Gonthier:2016:134106] should be additionally cited. Basic SAPT0 Keywords¶. SAPT_LEVEL¶. The level of theory for SAPT.
