When autoloading we call `TCling::RegisterModule` which in turn can call *many* times `clang::Sema::HandleEndOfTranslationUnit`. Second half of the `TCling::RegisterModule` body suppresses diagnostics this silences warnings coming from Sema and flushes the collected candidates. The case here is a little odd: the diagnostics fires only in ROOT built with release mode. The branches being taken by both release and debug mode seem identical. It looks like the debug mode somehow enters in silence diagnostics mode and release does not.

The case here is a little odd: the diagnostics fires only in ROOT built with release mode. The branches being taken by both release and debug mode seem identical. It looks like the debug mode somehow enters in silence diagnostics mode and release does not. This PR is not critical for the runtime cxxmodules development but it fixes the broken autoloading behavior of 'regular' ROOT.

When autoloading we call `TCling::RegisterModule` which in turn can call *many* times `clang::Sema::HandleEndOfTranslationUnit`. Second half of the `TCling::RegisterModule` body suppresses diagnostics this silences warnings coming from Sema and flushes the collected candidates.

However, I'm not sure the approach taken here is the best. I think that it would be better to change `FindROOT.cmake` to not rely on the `root-config`, but be generated directly from a `FindROOT.cmake.in` with all the paths already computed.
