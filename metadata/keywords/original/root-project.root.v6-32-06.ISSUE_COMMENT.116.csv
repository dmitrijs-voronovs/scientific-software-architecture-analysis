https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7785#issuecomment-816500613:345,Usability,simpl,simple,345,"Alright, thanks for all the details and clarifications. Let me try to bring this PR a conclusion.; The original question was: is it right, at least for the usecases of the function `GetFriendInfo`, to retrieve the name of any friend chain via the following?; ```; const auto *realName = chainFiles->First()->GetName();; ```; Let me try to make (simple) examples of tree/chain friends and how RDataFrame deals with them. Let's say my final goal is to have this dataset. | parent.x | friend.x |; |----------|----------|; | 0 | 0 |; | 1 | 1 |; | 2 | 2 |; | 3 | 3 |; | 4 | 4 |; | 5 | 5 |; | 6 | 6 |; | 7 | 7 |; | 8 | 8 |. I can do that through:; 1. Two TTrees, each with 9 entries, each saved to one single file.; 2. Two TChains, each chain has 9 total entries, each chain is made of three files, each file has internally one TTree with 3 entries.; 3. One TTree with 9 entries saved to one file, plus one TChain with 9 total entries, three files each with a TTree with 3 entries. In each scenario I will create the datasets, read the files back, add one of the two datasets as a friend to the other. Finally, I will try to print the columns both with `TTree::Print` and rdf's `Display`. Plus, I will also use `TTree::Scan` to get more information on the internal structure of the tree and its friend. # Case 1; This is the code I use to recreate the scenario. ```cpp; void write_tree(std::string_view filename, std::string_view treename); {; int x{};. TFile file{filename.data(), ""recreate""};; TTree tree{treename.data(), ""test friend trees""};; tree.Branch(""x"", &x, ""x/I"");. for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++); {; x = i;; tree.Fill();; }; tree.Write();; }; ; int main(){; write_tree(""treeparent.root"", ""treeparent"");; write_tree(""treefriend.root"", ""treefriend"");; TFile parentfile{""treeparent.root"", ""read""};; TFile friendfile{""treefriend.root"", ""read""};. std::unique_ptr<TTree> parenttree{parentfile.Get<TTree>(""treeparent"")};; std::unique_ptr<TTree> friendtree{friendfile.Get<TTree>(""treefriend"")};. parenttree",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7785#issuecomment-816500613
https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7785#issuecomment-816513144:880,Availability,error,error,880,"# TL;DR. ## Case 1 above; If the dataset is made of one main TTree and one friend TTree, everything's good. The `GetFriendInfo` function will return the name of the friend tree. ## Case 2 above; If the dataset is made of two TChains, one main and one friend, we have the following:; 1. TTree::Print(""all"") will always only print information of the main chain, not the friend one; 2. If the friend chain has a name, both TTree::Scan and RDataFrame Display can see the friend column correctly. This use case should be taken into account in `GetFriendInfo`, and it is since the name of the friend chain will always appear as the ""alias"" component of any element of `RFriendInfo::fFriendNames`; 3. If the friend chain has no name, TTree::Scan behaves inconsistently. I can do `Scan(""y:treefriend1.y"")` but then `Scan(""y:treefriend[23].y"")` will both fail. RDataFrame always prints an error, so for the sake of the `GetFriendInfo` function this is not a valid usecase (as also Enrico said). ## Case 3 above; If the dataset is made of a main TTree with a friend TChain attached, then; 1. If we give a name to the chain and then reference its column via ""treefriend.y"", then TTree:Scan(""x:treefriend.y"") throws an error. Inconsistently, if we write TTree:Scan(""x:y""), it works; 2. RDataFrame always returns an error from TTreeReader, `The branch treefriend.y is contained in a Friend TTree that is not directly attached to the main.`. I don't know if it's a bug or a feature (imho it's better than what TTree::Scan does), but again for the sake of `GetFriendInfo` this usecase is not valid and we should not pay attention to it for this PR. ## Conclusion; It is fine to retrieve the first name of the trees in a chain, because even in the worst case if the tree has a different name wrt the friend chain, the alias of that tree name will be the name of the chain itself. If the name of the first tree is equal to the name of any other tree in the chain, then it's the name of the chain itself.

The `GetFriendInfo` function will return the name of the friend tree. ## Case 2 above; If the dataset is made of two TChains, one main and one friend, we have the following:; 1. TTree::Print(""all"") will always only print information of the main chain, not the friend one; 2. If the friend chain has a name, both TTree::Scan and RDataFrame Display can see the friend column correctly. This use case should be taken into account in `GetFriendInfo`, and it is since the name of the friend chain will always appear as the ""alias"" component of any element of `RFriendInfo::fFriendNames`; 3. If the friend chain has no name, TTree::Scan behaves inconsistently. I can do `Scan(""y:treefriend1.y"")` but then `Scan(""y:treefriend[23].y"")` will both fail. RDataFrame always prints an error, so for the sake of the `GetFriendInfo` function this is not a valid usecase (as also Enrico said). ## Case 3 above; If the dataset is made of a main TTree with a friend TChain attached, then; 1. If we give a name to the chain and then reference its column via ""treefriend.y"", then TTree:Scan(""x:treefriend.y"") throws an error. Inconsistently, if we write TTree:Scan(""x:y""), it works; 2. RDataFrame always returns an error from TTreeReader, `The branch treefriend.y is contained in a Friend TTree that is not directly attached to the main.`. I don't know if it's a bug or a feature (imho it's better than what TTree::Scan does), but again for the sake of `GetFriendInfo` this usecase is not valid and we should not pay attention to it for this PR. ## Conclusion; It is fine to retrieve the first name of the trees in a chain, because even in the worst case if the tree has a different name wrt the friend chain, the alias of that tree name will be the name of the chain itself. If the name of the first tree is equal to the name of any other tree in the chain, then it's the name of the chain itself.

With this extended struct, suppose we have a TChain at poistion `i` of the list of friends of the main tree/chain. Then we can have `fFriendNames[i] = std::make_pair(chain.GetName(), alias)` and `fFriendChainSubNames[i] = GetTreeFullPaths(chain)` . This way the chain can still have no name but we retrieve the full list of sub-tree names that is returned by `GetTreeFullPaths`. It would also help in recreating the friend chain afterwards because we would have all the information about every subtree whereas previously we only retrieved info about the first subtree in the chain. Of course `fFriendChainSubNames[i]` would just be a repetition of `fFriendNames[i].first` if at position `i` we have a TTree, but I think that's not an issue. Or even better we just make it an empty vector in that case",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7785#issuecomment-816537360

The RooAddition only sums up its components, and the RooRealSumFunc first multiples each component with a coefficient. Hence, they need different data members and unifying the classes would bring us in schema evolution hell which is too risky in my opinion.
