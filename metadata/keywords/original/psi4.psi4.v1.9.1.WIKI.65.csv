Molden is a; visualization program for electronic structure developed by Gijs Schaftenaar; at the University of of Nijmegen, Netherlands. It is available at; https://www3.cmbi.umcn.nl/molden/ . Molden can; plot atomic orbitals, densities, electrostatic potentials (ESPs), etc.; PSI4 can create a file containing; atomic coordinates, basis set, and SCF orbital coefficients in the; so-called Molden format. This file is; written by the SCF module (see Section SCF); if the user sets the MOLDEN_WRITE keyword to true. This Molden file is; also used to pass information between PSI4 and WebMO, if PSI4; computations are invoked using the WebMO GUI. The filename of the; Molden file ends in “.molden”, and the prefix is determined by; WRITER_FILE_LABEL (if set), or else by the name of the output; file plus the name of the current molecule.

The n-body levels are effectively sorted in the outer list, and any ‘supersystem’ element is at the end. field nfragments: int = -1¶; Number of distinct fragments comprising full molecular supersystem. Validated by:. set_nfragments. field quiet: bool = False¶; Whether to print/log formatted n-body energy analysis. Presently used by multi to suppress output. Candidate for removal from class once in-class/out-of-class functions sorted. field return_total_data: Optional[bool] = None¶; When True, returns the total data (energy/gradient/Hessian) of the system, otherwise returns interaction data. Default is False for energies, True for gradients and Hessians. Note that the calculation of total counterpoise corrected energies implies the calculation of the energies of monomers in the monomer basis, hence specifying return_total_data = True may carry out more computations than return_total_data = False. Validated by:. set_return_total_data. field task_list: Dict[str, Union[AtomicComputer, CompositeComputer, FiniteDifferenceComputer]] = {}¶. build_tasks(mb_computer, mc_level_idx, **kwargs)[source]¶; Adds to the task_list as many new unique tasks as necessary to treat a single model chemistry level at one or several n-body levels.; New tasks are of type mb_computer with model chemistry level specified in kwargs and n-body levels accessed through mc_level_idx.

In addition,; numerous example of hybrid NumPy and Psi4 can be found at the Psi4Numpy; project. Currently only the Matrix; and Vector objects support NumPy interfacing. Let us begin with a simple; conversion from these objects to a NumPy array:; >>> import psi4; >>> import numpy as np. # Build the Psi4 data objects; >>> mat = psi4.core.Matrix(3, 3); >>> vec = psi4.core.Vector(3). # Convert to a NumPy array; >>> numpy_mat = np.array(mat); >>> numpy_vec = np.array(vec). Here the data is copied into new NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays can be converted; back to PSI4 objects using the from_array interface:; >>> new_mat = psi4.core.Matrix.from_array(mat); >>> new_vec = psi4.core.Vector.from_array(vec). NumPy Views¶; Copying the data between NumPy and Psi4 objects can lead to excessive data; movement and convoluted code. Here we introduce the idea of “Views” where the; same data can be viewed by multiple objects. However, this can lead to very; subtle errors if used incorrectly and care needs to be taken when using these; views. Views can be created in two ways:; >>> numpy_mat_view = np.asarray(mat). # Access the NumPy object and set all values to 1 through broadcasting; >>> numpy_mat_view[:] = 1. >>> print(np.array(mat)); [[ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]]. Secondly, these objects have a .np attribute for easy access to the underlying data:; >>> mat.np[:] = 1. this operation is identical to the above. PSI4 Data Objects with Irreps¶; PSI4 data objects natively support multiple irreducible representations; which is quite useful for Quantum Chemistry. However, this is not fundamental; to NumPy and some work around are required to natively support these; operations. Take the following irreped Matrix:; >>> dim = psi4.core.Dimension.from_list([1, 2, 3]); >>> irreped_mat = psi4.core.Matrix(""New Matrix"", dim, dim). # Create a list of Psi4 arrays; >>> list_of_arrays = irreped_mat.to_array(). # Or, use the .nph irreped accessor; >>> irreped_mat.nph[0][:] ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/numpy.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/numpy.html

Interfaces: Enhancing PSI4 Capabilities; Interface to NumPy. Interface to NumPy¶; Code author: Daniel G. A. Smith; Section author: Daniel G. A. Smith; Module: psi4/psi4/driver/p4util/numpy_helper.py. Basics¶; Converting between the PSI4 Data classes and a NumPy array is easy through; various helper functions as detailed in this section. A quick overview NumPy; functionality can be found here. In addition,; numerous example of hybrid NumPy and Psi4 can be found at the Psi4Numpy; project. Currently only the Matrix; and Vector objects support NumPy interfacing. Let us begin with a simple; conversion from these objects to a NumPy array:; >>> import psi4; >>> import numpy as np. # Build the Psi4 data objects; >>> mat = psi4.core.Matrix(3, 3); >>> vec = psi4.core.Vector(3). # Convert to a NumPy array; >>> numpy_mat = np.array(mat); >>> numpy_vec = np.array(vec). Here the data is copied into new NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays can be converted; back to PSI4 objects using the from_array interface:; >>> new_mat = psi4.core.Matrix.from_array(mat); >>> new_vec = psi4.core.Vector.from_array(vec). NumPy Views¶; Copying the data between NumPy and Psi4 objects can lead to excessive data; movement and convoluted code. Here we introduce the idea of “Views” where the; same data can be viewed by multiple objects. However, this can lead to very; subtle errors if used incorrectly and care needs to be taken when using these; views. Views can be created in two ways:; >>> numpy_mat_view = np.asarray(mat). # Access the NumPy object and set all values to 1 through broadcasting; >>> numpy_mat_view[:] = 1. >>> print(np.array(mat)); [[ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]].

Note that this discards all extra information; given in the matrix besides the diagonal blocks determined by the passed; dimension.; dim2 (Optional[Dimension]) – Same as dim1 only if using a Dimension object. Returns:; Returns the given (self) Psi4 object. Return type:; Matrix or Vector. Notes; This is a generalized function to convert a NumPy array to a Psi4 object; Examples; >>> data = np.random.rand(20,1); >>> vector = psi4.core.Matrix.from_array(data). >>> irrep_data = [np.random.rand(2, 2), np.empty(shape=(0,3)), np.random.rand(4, 4)]; >>> matrix = psi4.core.Matrix.from_array(irrep_data); >>> print(matrix.rowdim().to_tuple()); (2, 0, 4). Matrix to Array¶; A general function that converts NumPy arrays to PSI4 data objects. psi4.driver.p4util.numpy_helper._to_array(matrix, copy=True, dense=False)[source]¶; Converts a PSI4 Matrix or Vector to a NumPy array. Either copies the; data or simply constructs a view. Parameters:. matrix (Union[Matrix, Vector]) – Pointers to which Psi4 core class should be used in the construction.; copy (bool) – Copy the data if True, return a view otherwise; dense (bool) – Converts irrepped Psi4 objects to diagonally blocked dense arrays if; True. Returns a list of arrays otherwise. Returns:; Returns a single or list of NumPy arrays depending on options. Return type:; ndarray or List[ndarray]. Notes; This is a generalized function to convert a Psi4 object to a NumPy array; Examples; >>> data = psi4.core.Matrix(3, 3); >>> data.to_array(); [[ 0. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 0.]; [ 0. 0. 0.]]. table of contents.

REMP2 and its orbital-optimized variant OREMP2; are thus straightforward to implement in a (O)LCCD program by appropriate scaling of residual vector contributions and density matrices. OMP2 [Bozkaya:2011:omp2] and [Bozkaya:2013:omp2grad]; OMP3 [Bozkaya:2011:omp3] , [Bozkaya:2013:omp3], and [Bozkaya:2013:omp3grad]; OMP2.5 [Bozkaya:2011:omp3]; OLCCD [Bozkaya:2013:ocepa]; LCCD [Bozkaya:2013:ocepa]; OREMP2 [Behnle:2021:OREMP], and [Behnle:2022:OREMP]. Convergence Problems¶; For problematic open-shell systems, we recommend to use the ROHF or DFT orbitals as an initial guess for orbital-optimized methods. Both ROHF and; DFT orbitals may provide better initial guesses than UHF orbitals, hence convergence may be significantly speeded up with ROHF or DFT orbitals.; In order to use ROHF orbitals, simply set reference rohf. For DFT orbitals, set reference uks and set dft_functional b3lyp. Of; course users can use any DFT functional available in PSI4. Methods¶; The various orbital-optimized methods supported by the OCC/DFOCC; modules in PSI4 are summarized in Table OCC OO; Methods and detailed in Table OCC; OO Capabilities. Note that while two; separate libraries OCC (conventional integrals CONV) and DFOCC; (density-fitted DF and Cholesky-decomposed CD) together provide; the methods described on this page, they are controlled through one; QC_MODULE value OCC. Without set qc_module occ,; these methods may default to implementations in other modules based on efficiency considerations.

Therefore, minimizing the energy with respect to \({\bf \kappa}\); yields. \[{\bf \kappa} = -{\bf A^{-1}w}\]; This final equation corresponds to the usual Newton-Raphson step. OREMP.

Introduction¶; Orbital-optimized methods have several advantages over their non-optimized counterparts.; Once the orbitals are optimized, the wave function will obey the Hellmann–Feynman theorem; for orbital rotation parameters. Therefore, there is no need for orbital response terms; in the evaluation of analytic gradients. In other words, it is unnecessary to solve the; first order coupled-perturbed CC and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) equations.; Further, computation of one-electron properties is easier because there are no response contributions to the particle; density matrices (PDMs). Moreover, active space approximations can be readily incorporated into the CC methods; [Krylov:2000:vod]. Additionally, orbital-optimized coupled-cluster avoids spurious second-order; poles in its response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge invariant [Pedersen:1999:od].; Another advantage is that the orbital-optimized methods do not suffer from artifactual symmetry-breaking; instabilities [Crawford:1997:instability], [Sherrill:1998:od], [Bozkaya:2011:omp2], and [Bozkaya:2011:omp3].; Furthermore, Kurlancheek and Head-Gordon [Kurlancek:2009] demonstrated that first order properties such as; forces or dipole moments are discontinuous along nuclear coordinates when such a symmetry breaking occurs.; They also observed that although the energy appears well behaved, the MP2 method can have natural occupation; numbers greater than 2 or less than 0, hence may violate the N-representability condition. They further; discussed that the orbital response equations generally have a singularity problem at the unrestriction point; where spin-restricted orbitals become unstable to unrestriction. This singularity yields to extremely large or; small eigenvalues of the one-particl",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/occ.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/occ.html

Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder¶; The Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) method is one of many procedures; that partitions a molecular one-particle density matrix into atomic electron densities.; Running MBIS in PSI4 will calculate atomic valence charge widths, volume ratios,; atomic charges, as well as dipoles, quadrupoles, and octupoles.; Additionally, all expectation values of radial moments of n-th order (\(<r^n>\)); are computed up to fourth order. Higher moments can be computed by specifying MAX_RADIAL_MOMENT.; The volume ratios are computed as the ratio between the volume of the atomic density; (\(<r^3>\)) and the volume of the free atom computed using the same level; of theory, but with a potentially unrestricted reference.; The allowed number of iterations and convergence criteria for the stockholder; algorithm is controlled by MBIS_MAXITER and MBIS_D_CONVERGENCE. Note; that the density is partitioned on a molecular quadrature grid, the details of which can be; controlled with the keywords MBIS_RADIAL_POINTS, MBIS_SPHERICAL_POINTS, and; MBIS_PRUNING_SCHEME.

There are two ways the computation of one-electron properties can be requested.; Firstly, the properties can be evaluated from the last; computed one-particle density, using the following syntax:; oeprop(""MO_EXTENTS"", ""MULTIPOLE(4)"", title = ""hello!""). Note that it is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the relaxed density; matrix is computed using the method of interest, which may require setting; additional keywords (see the method’s manual section for details). The named; argument, title, is completely optional and is prepended to any; globals variables set during the computation. The unnamed arguments are the; properties to be computed. These can appear in any order, and multiple; properties may be requested, as in the example above. Note that, due to Python; syntax restrictions, the title argument must appear after the list of; properties to compute. The available properties are shown in the table above.; The syntax above works well for computing properties using the SCF; wavefunction, however, may be difficult (or impossible) to use for some of the; correlated levels of theory. Alternatively, one-electron properties can be; computed using the built-in properties() function, e.g.:; properties('ccsd', properties=['dipole']). The properties() function provides limited functionality, but is a lot easier to; use for correlated methods. For capabilities of properties() see the; corresponding section of the manual.

Theoretical Methods: SCF to FCI; Geometry Optimization. Geometry Optimization¶; Code author: Rollin A. King and Alexander G. Heide; Section author: Rollin A. King, Alexander G. Heide, and Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, OPTKING; PSI4 carries out molecular optimizations using a Python module called; optking. The optking program takes as input nuclear gradients and,; optionally, nuclear second derivatives — both in Cartesian coordinates.; The default minimization algorithm employs an empirical model Hessian,; redundant internal coordinates, an RFO step with trust radius scaling, and the BFGS Hessian update.; The principal literature references include the introduction of redundant; internal coordinates by Peng et al. [Peng:1996:49].; The general approach employed in this code; is similar to the “model Hessian plus RF method” described and tested by Bakken and; Helgaker [Bakken:2002:9160]. However, for separated; fragments, we have chosen not to employ their “extra-redundant” coordinates.; The internal coordinates are generated automatically based on an assumed bond; connectivity. The connectivity is determined by testing if the interatomic; distance is less than the sum of atomic radii times the value of; COVALENT_CONNECT. If the user finds that some; connectivity is lacking by default, then this value may be increased. Warning; The selection of a Z-matrix input, and in particular the inclusion; of dummy atoms, has no effect on the behavior of the optimizer, which begins; from a Cartesian representation of the system. Presently, by default, separate fragments are bonded by the; nearest atoms, and the whole system is treated as if it were part of one; molecule. However, with the option FRAG_MODE, fragments; may instead be related by a minimal set of interfragment coordinates defined by; reference points within each fragment. The reference points can be atomic; positions (cur",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/optking.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/optking.html

Dealing with problematic optimizations¶; Although optking is continuously improved with robustness in mind, some; attempted optimizations will inevitably fail to converge to the desired minima.; For difficult cases, the following suggestions are made. As for any optimizer, computing the Hessian and limiting the step size will; successfully converge a higher percentage of cases. The default settings have; been chosen because they perform efficiently for common, representative test sets.; More restrictive, cautious steps are sometimes necessary.; DYNAMIC_LEVEL allows optking to change the method of optimization; toward algorithms that, while often less efficient, may help to converge difficult; cases. If this is initially set to 1, then optking, as poor steps are detected,; will increase the dynamic level through several forms of more robust and cautious algorithms.; The changes will reduce the trust radius, allow backward steps (partial line; searching), add cartesian coordinates, switch to cartesian coordinates, and take; steepest-descent steps.; The developers have found the OPT",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/optking.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/optking.html

Multi-Fragment Optimizations¶; In previous versions of optking, the metric for connecting atoms was increased until all atoms; were connected. This is the current behavior for FRAG_MODE single.; Setting FRAG_MODE to multi will now add a special; set of intermolecular coordinates between fragments - internally referred to as DimerFrag; coordinates (see here <DimerIntro_> for the brief description).; For each pair of molecular fragments, a set of up to 3 reference points; are chosen on each fragment. Each reference point will be either an atom or a linear combination; of positions of atoms within that fragment. Stretches, bends, and dihedral angles between the two; fragments will be created using these reference points. See; Dimer coordinate table for how reference points are created.; For a set of three dimers A, B, and C, sets of ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/optking.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/optking.html

See; Dimer coordinate table for how reference points are created.; For a set of three dimers A, B, and C, sets of coordinates are created between each pair:; AB, AC, and BC. Each DimerFrag may use different reference points.; Creation of the intermolecular coordinates can be controlled through FRAG_REF_ATOMS; and INTERFRAG_COORDS. FRAG_REF_ATOMS specifies which atoms; (or linear combination of atoms) to use for the reference points and INTERFRAG_COORDS,; which encompasses FRAG_REF_ATOMS, allows for constraints and labels to be added to the; intermolecular coordinates. Note; Manual specification of the interfragment coordinates is supported for power users,; and provides complete control of fragments’ relative orientations.; Setting INTERFRAG_MODE to multi should suffice in almost all cases.; Dimer coordinate table. provides the name and ordering; convention for the coordinates.

Optking will avoid such; coordinates when choosing an initial coordinate system; however, they may arise in the course; of an optimization. In such cases, try restarting from the most recent geometry.; Alternatively, setting OPT_COORDINATES to cartesian will avoid any internal; coordinate difficulties altogether. These coordinate changes can be automatically; performed by turning DYNAMIC_LEVEL to 1. Warning; In some cases, such as the coordinate issues described above, optking will reset to maintain; a consistent history. If an error occurs in Psi4 due to GEOM_MAXITER being exceeded but; the final step report indicates that optking has not taken GEOM_MAXITER steps, such a; reset has occured. Inspection will show that the step counter was reset to 1 somewhere in the; optimization. Convergence Criteria¶; Optking monitors five quantities to evaluate the progress of a geometry; optimization. These are (with their keywords) the change in energy; (MAX_ENERGY_G_CONVERGENCE), the maximum element of; the gradient (MAX_FORCE_G_CONVERGENCE), the root-mean-square; of the gradient (RMS_FORCE_G_CONVERGENCE), the maximum element; of displacement (MAX_DISP_G_CONVERGENCE), and the; root-mean-square of displacement (RMS_DISP_G_CONVERGENCE),; all in internal coordinates and atomic units.

Files in a Plugin Directory¶; In addition to the main myplugin.cc file, a fresh plugin directory contains the following files. CMakeLists.txt — CMake file governing project plugin.; The plugin source and CMakeLists.txt is independent of platform; and PSI4 installation. You use CMake (version 3.1 or later); to generate a Makefile for the plugin by pointing it to a specific; PSI4 installation. Run psi4 --plugin-compile to get a command; to execute to generate the Makefile.

The; location of the plugin directory must be included in PYTHONPATH,; either externally in the calling shell or defined in the input file.; This is usually done by manipulating PSIPATH. Then,; the plugin can be loaded as import myplugin and executed as; energy('myplugin'). Any other Python functions are also available from; the input file, e.g. myplugin.testfunction(), note the namespace; protection.; pymodule.py — Python component of the plugin.; By encoding the sequence of PSI4 module; calls needed to run the plugin in the run_myplugin() function in this; file, the plugin is hooked into the main PSI4 driver function; energy() and so can be accessed through; energy('myplugin') in an input file. Any other Python functions can; also be placed in this file.; __init__.py — Init script for the plugin (in the sense that; the whole plugin directory is a Python module). This file generally won’t; need editing unless additional Python files are added to the plugin; directory (add additional lines to the # Load Python modules section); or the plugin depends on .so codes in other plugin directories (add; additional plugin_load lines relative to the current plugin directory to; the # Load C++ plugin section). doc.rst — Documentation file.

Adding New Code to PSI4; Creating New Plugins. Creating New Plugins¶. Modular Approach to Development¶; It is slightly cumbersome to the development cycle to recompile PSI4; every time a change is made to the C++ code.; It’s also daunting to new developers if they’re required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with Psi3 due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, PSI4 now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi’s vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. Creating a New Plugin¶; PSI4 can create basic plugins for you and automatically tailor them; to your compilation environment. To create a basic plugin, run the; following while replacing myplugin with the name of your great code.; If the name you provide is not valid, PSI4 will complain.; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin. PSI4 will create a new directory with the name you specify for the; plugin. In this example, a directory named myplugin will be created.; All you need to do is cd into the directory, use PSI4 to generate; a Makefile, and type make. Then execute psi4 in the directory on the; default input file.; >>> cd myplugin; >>> `psi4 --plugin-compile`; >>> make; >>> psi4. PSI4 comes with a few templates that provide an excellent starting; point. These include code that demonstrates AO, MO, and SO integrals. Use; one of the following commands that meets your needs:; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-template aointegrals; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-template mointegrals; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-template sointegrals; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/plugins.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/plugins.html

Files in a Plugin Directory¶; In addition to the main myplugin.cc file, a fresh plugin directory contains the following files. CMakeLists.txt — CMake file governing project plugin.; The plugin source and CMakeLists.txt is independent of platform; and PSI4 installation. You use CMake (version 3.1 or later); to generate a Makefile for the plugin by pointing it to a specific; PSI4 installation. Run psi4 --plugin-compile to get a command; to execute to generate the Makefile. What that command is doing is; loading the compilers and options used to build the parent PSI4; (the -C psi4PluginCache part) which in turn can be overridden; by passing -Doption=value commands to cmake and pointing; toward a particular PSI4 (and probably pybind11) library to; link against (the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH part) and telling it to; do an in-source build (the . part). Then just run make in; your plugin directory. After any change to the plugin C++ code,; make must be run in the plugin directory to recompile the; myplugin.so executable, but recompiling the main PSI4 code; is not necessary. Should you add additional (non-header) files to; the plugin or need to link to additional external libraries, add that; information here.; input.dat — Sample input file for the plugin.; Since the __init__.py file makes the plugin directory look like a; Python module, the plugin can be treated as such in an input file.

Adding New Code to PSI4; Creating New Plugins. Creating New Plugins¶. Modular Approach to Development¶; It is slightly cumbersome to the development cycle to recompile PSI4; every time a change is made to the C++ code.; It’s also daunting to new developers if they’re required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with Psi3 due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, PSI4 now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi’s vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. Creating a New Plugin¶; PSI4 can create basic plugins for you and automatically tailor them; to your compilation environment. To create a basic plugin, run the; following while replacing myplugin with the name of your great code.; If the name you provide is not valid, PSI4 will complain.; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin. PSI4 will create a new directory with the name you specify for the; plugin. In this example, a directory named myplugin will be created.; All you need to do is cd into the directory, use PSI4 to generate; a Makefile, and type make. Then execute psi4 in the directory on the; default input file.; >>> cd myplugin; >>> `psi4 --plugin-compile`; >>> make; >>> psi4. PSI4 comes with a few templates that provide an excellent starting; point. These include code that demonstrates AO, MO, and SO integrals. Use; one of the following commands that meets your needs:; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-template aointegrals; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-template mointegrals; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-template sointegrals; >>> psi4 --plugin-name myplugin --plugin-",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/plugins.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/plugins.html

Adding Methods to Driver¶. proc.py¶; Methods that are computable by only one module should be added to the procedures dictionary in; psi4/psi4/driver/procrouting/proc_table.py; that associates method names with functions; to run them located in psi4/psi4/driver/procrouting/proc.py.; The function should start with a declaration, as below. methodname is; never seen by users, so it’s good to be specific to method or module.; The function must always take as arguments (name, **kwargs).; # energy method; def run_methodname(name, **kwargs):. # gradient method; def run_methodname_gradient(name, **kwargs):. If the function needs to test the identity of name several times, it; can be convenient to predefine the lowercase version of the variable. The; case of all other py-side options (in kwargs) has already been handled by; energy(), etc. in driver.py and need not be repeated here.; # include if convenient; lowername = name.lower(). # never include; kwargs = kwargs_lower(kwargs).

Adding Methods to Driver¶. proc.py¶; Methods that are computable by only one module should be added to the procedures dictionary in; psi4/psi4/driver/procrouting/proc_table.py; that associates method names with functions; to run them located in psi4/psi4/driver/procrouting/proc.py.; The function should start with a declaration, as below. methodname is; never seen by users, so it’s good to be specific to method or module.; The function must always take as arguments (name, **kwargs).; # energy method; def run_methodname(name, **kwargs):. # gradient method; def run_methodname_gradient(name, **kwargs):. If the function needs to test the identity of name several times, it; can be convenient to predefine the lowercase version of the variable. The; case of all other py-side options (in kwargs) has already been handled by; energy(), etc. in driver.py and need not be repeated here.; # include if convenient; lowername = name.lower(). # never include; kwargs = kwargs_lower(kwargs).

How to name orbital bases (e.g., AO & SO)¶; Many different working bases (the internal linear algebraic basis, not the; name of the Gaussian basis) are used within PSI4, each with a unique; and important purpose. It is critical to keep them all distinct to prevent; weird results from occurring. AO (Atomic Orbitals): Cartesian Gaussians (6D, 10F, etc.),; (L + 1)(L + 2)/2 functions per shell of angular momentum L. The; ordering of Cartesian exponents for a given L is given by the standard; ordering below (MATLAB code)",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/prog_blas.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/prog_blas.html

The number of OSOs may be; slightly smaller than the total number of USOs, due to removal of linear; dependencies via Canonical Orthogonalization. The OSOs are rarely; encountered, as usually we go straight from USOs to MOs.; MO (Molecular Orbitals): The combination of OSOs that diagonalizes; the Fock Matrix, so each basis function is a Hartree-Fock (or Kohn-Sham); molecular orbital. The number of OSOs and MOs is always the same. MOs are; orthonormal.; LO (Localized Orbitals): Localized occupied orbitals, a different; combination of the occupied molecular orbitals which enhances spatial; locality. LOs do not diagonalize the occ-occ block of the Fock Matrix, but; remain orthonormal to each other and the virtual space. How to name orbital dimensions¶; There are a number of different names used to refer to the basis set size.; These may seem redundant, but they have subtly different meanings, as; detailed below.; A calculation can use either pure (5D, 7F, 9G, etc.) basis functions or; Cartesian (6D, 10F, 15G, etc.), as dictated by the input file / basis set; specification. Also, the basis can be represented in terms of atomic; orbitals (AO) or symmetry-adapted orbitals (SO). Further complications; come from the fact that a nearly linearly-dependent basis set will have; functions removed from it to prevent redundancies. With all of these; factors in mind, here are the conventions used internally:. nao — The number of atomic orbitals in Cartesian representation.; nso — The number of atomic orbitals but in the pure representation if the current basis uses pure functions, number of Cartesian AOs otherwise.; nbf — The number of basis functions, which is the same as nso.; nmo — The number of basis functions, after projecting out redundancies in the basis.

Programming with the Core Libraries; Linear Algebra in PSI4. Linear Algebra in PSI4¶. How to call BLAS & LAPACK in PSI4¶; Computational chemistry is essentially linear algebra on molecular; systems, so using stable, portable, scalable, and efficient numerical; linear algebra methods in PSI4 is critical. To that end, we use BLAS1; (vector-vector operations, like dot products), BLAS2 (matrix-vector; operations, like rank-1 update), BLAS3 (matrix-matrix operations, like; matrix multiplication), and LAPACK (advanced matrix decompositions and; solutions). The methods provided by BLAS and LAPACK are standard, but the; performance of actual implementations differ greatly from one version to; another. Moreover, the standard interfaces to the libraries are Fortran,; so PSI4 provides a common set of wrappers in psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libqt/qt.h . Warning; Although block_matrix, init_array, and print_mat are still; around, their use is discouraged in favor of operations on; psi4.core.Matrix itself. The advice in these docs will catch up; shortly. BLAS Wrappers¶; BLAS wrappers are currently fully supported at double precision.; BLAS commands involving matrices are wrapped so as to be conventional; C-style “row-major” indexing, meaning that the column is the fast index; like normal. The calls to BLAS1 routines are wrapped so as to allow for operations on; vectors with more than 2^{31} elements (~16 GB, getting to be a problem).; So passing a signed or unsigned long works, though the stride arguments; must be integers.; All routines are declared in qt.h. Each routine is prefixed with a; C_, followed by the standard Fortran name of the routine, in capital; letters.

How to call BLAS & LAPACK in PSI4¶; Computational chemistry is essentially linear algebra on molecular; systems, so using stable, portable, scalable, and efficient numerical; linear algebra methods in PSI4 is critical. To that end, we use BLAS1; (vector-vector operations, like dot products), BLAS2 (matrix-vector; operations, like rank-1 update), BLAS3 (matrix-matrix operations, like; matrix multiplication), and LAPACK (advanced matrix decompositions and; solutions). The methods provided by BLAS and LAPACK are standard, but the; performance of actual implementations differ greatly from one version to; another. Moreover, the standard interfaces to the libraries are Fortran,; so PSI4 provides a common set of wrappers in psi4/psi4/src/psi4/libqt/qt.h . Warning; Although block_matrix, init_array, and print_mat are still; around, their use is discouraged in favor of operations on; psi4.core.Matrix itself. The advice in these docs will catch up; shortly. BLAS Wrappers¶; BLAS wrappers are currently fully supported at double precision.; BLAS commands involving matrices are wrapped so as to be conventional; C-style “row-major” indexing, meaning that the column is the fast index; like normal. The calls to BLAS1 routines are wrapped so as to allow for operations on; vectors with more than 2^{31} elements (~16 GB, getting to be a problem).; So passing a signed or unsigned long works, though the stride arguments; must be integers.; All routines are declared in qt.h. Each routine is prefixed with a; C_, followed by the standard Fortran name of the routine, in capital; letters.

Important BLAS Routines¶. BLAS1. DDOT: dot product; DCOPY: efficient memory copy (with variable stride); DAXPY: y = y + alpha*x; DROT: Givens Rotation; DNRM2: Vector norm square. BLAS2. DGEMV: General Matrix-Vector product; DTRMV: Triangular Matrix-Vector product (2x faster, not wrapped yet); DTRSM: Triangular Matrix-Vector solution via back substitution (just as fast as DTRMV); DGER: Rank-1 update (not wrapped yet). BLAS3. DGEMM: General Matrix-Matrix product; DTRMM: General Triangular Matrix-General Matrix product; DTRSM: Triangular Matrix-General Matrix solution via back substitution (just as fast as DTRMM); DSYMM/DSYMV calls are not appreciably faster than DGEMM calls, and should only be used in expert situations (like using the other half of the matrix for some form of other transformation).; DTRMM/DTRMV calls are 2x faster than DGEMM, and should be used where possible.

If Cartesian functions are used, the number of functions; per shell remains (L + 1)(L + 2)/2, and the ordering remains the same; as above. Note that the individual functions are not normalized for; angular momentum as in most codes: the self-overlap of a PSI4 Cartesian D; or higher function with more than one nonzero Cartesian exponent (e.g., lx; = 1, ly = 1, lz = 0) will be less than one. If Spherical Harmonics are; used, 2L + 1 real combinations of the spherical harmonics are built from; the (L+1)(L+2)/2 Cartesian Gaussians, according to H. Schlegel and M.; Frish, IJQC, 54, 83-87, 1995. Unlike Cartesian functions these functions; are all strictly normalized. Note that in PSI4, the real combinations of; spherical harmonic functions (see the paragraph below Eq. 15 in the; Schlegel paper) are ordered as: 0, 1+, 1-, 2+, 2-, ….; USO (Unique Symmetry-Adapted Orbitals): Spatial symmetry-adapted; combinations of SOs, blocked according to irrep. The total number of USOs; is the same as the number of SOs, but the number of USOs within each irrep; is usually much smaller, which can lead to significant performance; improvements. Note that this basis is sometimes unfortunately referred to; as the SO basis, so it’s a bit context specific.; OSO (Orthogonal Symmetry-Adapted Orbitals): USOs orthogonalized by; Symmetric or Canonical Orthogonalization. The number of OSOs may be; slightly smaller than the total number of USOs, due to removal of linear; dependencies via Canonical Orthogonalization. The OSOs are rarely; encountered, as usually we go straight from USOs to MOs.; MO (Molecular Orbitals): The combination of OSOs that diagonalizes; the Fock Matrix, so each basis function is a Hartree-Fock (or Kohn-Sham); molecular orbital.

LOs do not diagonalize the occ-occ block of the Fock Matrix, but; remain orthonormal to each other and the virtual space. How to name orbital dimensions¶; There are a number of different names used to refer to the basis set size.; These may seem redundant, but they have subtly different meanings, as; detailed below.; A calculation can use either pure (5D, 7F, 9G, etc.) basis functions or; Cartesian (6D, 10F, 15G, etc.), as dictated by the input file / basis set; specification. Also, the basis can be represented in terms of atomic; orbitals (AO) or symmetry-adapted orbitals (SO). Further complications; come from the fact that a nearly linearly-dependent basis set will have; functions removed from it to prevent redundancies. With all of these; factors in mind, here are the conventions used internally:. nao — The number of atomic orbitals in Cartesian representation.; nso — The number of atomic orbitals but in the pure representation if the current basis uses pure functions, number of Cartesian AOs otherwise.; nbf — The number of basis functions, which is the same as nso.; nmo — The number of basis functions, after projecting out redundancies in the basis. When molecular symmetry is utilized, a small array of sizes per irrep is; usually allocated on the stack, and is named by augmenting the name above; with a pi (per-irrep), e.g. nmopi. Note that the number of irreps is; always the singular nirrep, and that the index variable h is always used; in a for-loop traverse of irreps.

How to name orbital spaces (e.g., docc)¶; As with basis sets, a number of names are used to refer to refer to the; quantity of electrons, virtuals, and active sub-quantities of a PSI4; calculation. All of these can be defined per irrep as above. Some common; conventions are:. nelec — The number of electrons, rarely used due to specialization of alphas and betas or soccs and doccs.; nalpha — The number of alpha electrons.; nbeta — The number of beta electrons; docc — The number of doubly-occupied orbitals; socc — The number of singly-occupied orbitals (Almost always alpha, we don’t like open-shell singlets much).; nvir — The number of virtual orbitals.

An integral factory is used, which can then produce integral object for various; operator types and derivative levels. A sieve is also constructed; this allows; a quick determination of whether an integral shell quartet will be significant; in magnitude or not, potentially saving a lot of work.

Although this looks more complex, it’s essentially doing the same thing. There; are a number of differences that we’ll highlight now. Sieving¶; This is one of two breaking changes to the old style syntax. Instead of; constructing a sieve object, the integral object should be queried directly; using the exact same syntax. Requests for whether a shell is significant or a; shell block is significant are both supported. A sieve object is created if; matching basis sets are found in either the bra or the ket.

Therefore care must be taken to ensure that the missing permutations; are correctly accounted for when processing the integrals within the loop. See; the DirectJK code in libfock for an example of using this scheme for a Fock; matrix build. Using bra-ket symmetry¶; In cases where there is no batching performed, bra-ket symmetry can be; trivially enforced by ensuring that one of the block indices is greater than or; equal to the other. When batching is used, the situation is trickier; some ket; batches may contain a mixture of integrals that are bra-ket unique and those; that are not. To handle this we must do a coarse check at the top of the loop; to see if any integrals in the batch are needed, which is implemented by; asking the integral engine where to start looping in the ket via the call to; eri->first_RS_shell_block(PQpair_idx). This is followed by a more fine; grained check within the loops to filter individual integrals in the case where; bra and ket have the same angular momentum and there’s a possibility of a; handful of integrals coming from the ket that are redundant. Note that the bra; is not batched in any of our engines currently: only the ket is. For this; reason, density fitting integrals should be written as (A0|PQ) rather than; (PQ|A0) where possible, because we want the ket to contain more functions than; the bra for efficient blocking. Instantiating integral objects¶; With sieving being introduced in the new integral objects, the cost of their; construction has increased. Although significantly cheaper than computing; integrals themselves, construction of integral objects can be non-negligible,; especially if many threads are used. For example, this pattern can be found in; old versions of the code:; std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(facto",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/prog_integrals.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/prog_integrals.html

This bottleneck no longer exists, so these; extra transformation steps have been removed as part of the switch to Libint2,; and the affected codes (PCM and CPPE interfaces) now compute the potential and; field integrals in the representation required by the basis set.; Also, note that the way external point charges are specified has changed.; Previously, a set of N external point charges would be specified by passing a; matrix with dimensions N rows and 4 columns – corresponding to charge, x, y, z; – to the set_charge_field() member of the potential integral class. The; same information is now passed using the more verbose; std::vector<std::pair<double, std::array<double, 3>>> type instead, to be; consistent with Libint2’s convention. New Operators Available¶; Libint2 provides a range of integrals that were previously not available in; PSI4, such as the Erfc attenuated nuclear potential integrals needed for; Ewald methods. If new integrals are added to Libint2 but are not yet; interfaced to PSI4, please open an issue on the PSI4 GitHub page to; alert the developers, who will be able to add the appropriate code.; Available integrals classes and parameters currently documented at; Libint2 C++11 Interface Wiki. Shell Pairs¶; To ensure consistency between one- and two-electron terms when screening, and; for efficiency reasons, shell pair lists should be used to iterate over pairs; of Gaussian shells. These lists contain integer pair numbers, corresponding to; the pairs of shells that have sufficient overlap to survive the screening; process. Iterating over these lists is simple:; const auto& shell_pairs = Vint->shellpairs();; size_t n_pairs = shell_pairs.size();; for (size_t p = 0; p < n_pairs; ++p) {; auto P = shell_pairs[p].first;; auto Q = shell_pairs[p].second;; // do something with shells P and Q; }.

https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/prog_integrals.html:5992,Deployability,update,updated,5992," The old code copied integrals into a buffer owned by the integral object, whose; address remained constant and could be retrieved by the buffer() member; function. To avoid unnecessary copies, the new code instead uses the integrals; directly from the underlying integral engine’s memory, which may change with; each call to compute integrals. The integral engine provides a; std::vector<const double*> containing the pointers to the start of each; “chunk” of integrals. For first derivatives there are 12 such “chunks”, which; are ordered Px,Py,Pz,Qx,Qy,Qz,Rx,Ry,Rz,Sx,Sy,Sz, where the Px refers to the x; derivative with respect to the basis functions in shell P. Note that all; integral derivatives are provided by the new integral code, unlike the previous; version where only 9 of 12 were provided and the user was responsible for using; translation invariance relationships to fill in the rest. The addresses for; each chunk are updated in the vector after each call to compute integrals, so; the user should keep a const reference to that object, and query that for the; address of interest. Density Screening¶; The old code looked only at the integral to determine whether terms can be; avoided a priori. However, if the integral is to be contracted with a; density or a density-like quantity, the screening can be performed on the; product, which yields more sparsity. To enable this, simply call the integral; object’s update_density member, passing it a SharedMatrix holding the; current density (remember that it changes during each iteration of the SCF) and; the product will be considered during screening. If only coulomb-like terms; are to be computed, the needs_exchange argument to the integral object; constructor should be set to false, otherwise it should be true to correcly; account for products of the density and integrals that contribute to; exchange-like terms.

Shell blocking¶; Each underlying integral engine knows whether it will use blocks, and will set up; the metadata automatically. Instead of looping over individual shells, the; user should loop over blocks supplied by the integral object; these blocks will; be just a single shell quartet combination for the case where blocking is not; used. It is simple to loop over pairs within each block using C++11 syntax, as; demonstrated in the code snippet above. Only shell pairs with significant; overlap are included in the shell block information, making this an efficient; way to loop over non-negligible terms. Permutational symmetry¶; The pairs within each block are optimized for efficiency. First, they are; screened during the integral object’s creation to ensure that only terms with; appreciable overlap are stored. Second, only P,Q combinations that are; permutationally unique are stored, ordered with the higher angular momentum; first. Therefore care must be taken to ensure that the missing permutations; are correctly accounted for when processing the integrals within the loop.

One Electron Integrals in PSI4¶; After version 1.5, we started transitioning the one electron integral code over to; use Libint2 instead of the old handwritten Obara-Saika code. There are a; number of reasons motivating this switch. For methods requiring; potentials and fields evaluated at many external sites, such as PCM and; polarizable embedding, the efficiency of the one electron integrals can be rate; limiting. We also started to introduce integral screening, and it is important; to balance the screening used for one- and two-electron terms carefully, so this; is a good opportunity to re-evaluate the code.

The new syntax¶; The newer integral engines being interfaced to PSI4 may or may not require; a group of similar integrals to be computed together in a block using; vectorized instructions.

The integral engine provides a; std::vector<const double*> containing the pointers to the start of each; “chunk” of integrals. For first derivatives there are 12 such “chunks”, which; are ordered Px,Py,Pz,Qx,Qy,Qz,Rx,Ry,Rz,Sx,Sy,Sz, where the Px refers to the x; derivative with respect to the basis functions in shell P. Note that all; integral derivatives are provided by the new integral code, unlike the previous; version where only 9 of 12 were provided and the user was responsible for using; translation invariance relationships to fill in the rest. The addresses for; each chunk are updated in the vector after each call to compute integrals, so; the user should keep a const reference to that object, and query that for the; address of interest. Density Screening¶; The old code looked only at the integral to determine whether terms can be; avoided a priori. However, if the integral is to be contracted with a; density or a density-like quantity, the screening can be performed on the; product, which yields more sparsity. To enable this, simply call the integral; object’s update_density member, passing it a SharedMatrix holding the; current density (remember that it changes during each iteration of the SCF) and; the product will be considered during screening. If only coulomb-like terms; are to be computed, the needs_exchange argument to the integral object; constructor should be set to false, otherwise it should be true to correcly; account for products of the density and integrals that contribute to; exchange-like terms. Shell blocking¶; Each underlying integral engine knows whether it will use blocks, and will set up; the metadata automatically. Instead of looping over individual shells, the; user should loop over blocks supplied by the integral object; these blocks will; be just a single shell quartet combination for the case where blocking is not; used.

We also started to introduce integral screening, and it is important; to balance the screening used for one- and two-electron terms carefully, so this; is a good opportunity to re-evaluate the code.

Accessing integrals¶; Before the Libint2 transition, one electron integrals were computed in a flat; array, internally called buffer_, which was accessed through the integral; object’s buffer() method. For integrals with multiple operators, e.g.,; dipole operators that have three distinct components, the buffer was simply; elongated by the appropriate amount and the caller was responsible for striding; through each resulting batch correctly.

For simple integrals, such as overlap or kinetic, only the buffer; corresponding to the zeroth element of this array contains integrals. Derivative Integrals¶; The old one electron integral code used translational invariance relations to; minimze the number of integrals to be computed, leaving the caller with some; bookkeeping to do to compute all terms. For example, consider an overlap; integral: its value depends only on the relative separation of the two centers; and not their absolute positions in space. Therefore, the derivative with; respect to center A is the negative of the same derivative with respect to; center B, so one is trivially gleaned from the other. Extending this to second; derivatives, the same principle leads to the fact that double derivatives with; respect to center A are equal to double derivatives with respect to center B,; which are also equal to the negative of the mixed double derivatives with; respect to both center A and B.

For example, this pattern can be found in; old versions of the code:; std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; }.

Introduction¶; PSI4 has a number of backends available to compute integrals. In order to; accomodate these options, while providing a clean interface to the programmer,; an abstraction layer is implemented within Libmints. A recent upgrade to the; primary integral engine has seen some important changes to the way this; interface layer is used; this document is designed to aid new developers as; well as those familiar with the older calling conventions to ensure that the; most efficient calling conventions are applied. The older style¶; A very simple loop that does not use permutational symmetry might look; something like this in the old scheme:; auto sieve = std::make_shared<ERISieve>(basisset, cutoff);; auto factory= std::make_shared<IntegralFactory>(basisset);; int deriv_level = 0;; bool use_shell_pairs = true;; auto eri = factory->eri(deriv_level, use_shell_pairs);; const double* buffer = eri_->buffer();; for (int P = 0; P < basisset->nshell(); ++P) {; const auto& Pshell = basisset->shell(P);; for (int Q = 0; Q < basisset->nshell(); ++Q) {; const auto& Qshell = basisset->shell(Q);; for (int R = 0; R < basisset->nshell(); ++R) {; const auto& Rshell = basisset->shell(R);; for (int S = 0; S < basisset->nshell(); ++S) {; const auto& Sshell = basisset->shell(S);; if(sieve->shell_significant(P, Q, R, S) {; eri->compute_shell(P, Q, R, S);; // results are in buffer, do something with them..; }; }; }; }; }. An integral factory is used, which can then produce integral object for various; operator types and derivative levels. A sieve is also constructed; this allows; a quick determination of whether an integral shell quartet will be significant; in magnitude or not, potentially saving a lot of work. This simple scheme is; clean and easy to understand, and is still supported in the latest version of; PSI4 with only a small change to the sieve syntax and handling of buffer; addresses, noted below.

The new syntax¶; The newer integral engines being interfaced to PSI4 may or may not require; a group of similar integrals to be computed together in a block using; vectorized instructions. To accomodate this possibility, a new syntax has been; introduced in Libmints:; auto blocksPQ = ints[0]->get_blocks12();; auto blocksRS = ints[0]->get_blocks34();. auto factory= std::make_shared<IntegralFactory>(basisset);; int deriv_level = 0;; bool use_shell_pairs = true;; bool needs_exchange = true;; auto eri = factory->eri(deriv_level, use_shell_pairs, needs_exchange);; const auto &buffers = eri->buffers();. eri->update_density(D);; bool use_batching = eri->maximum_block_size() > 1;. // loop over all the blocks of (P>=Q|; for (size_t blockPQ_idx = 0; blockPQ_idx < blocksPQ.size(); blockPQ_idx++) {; const auto& blockPQ = blocksPQ[blockPQ_idx];; // loop over all the blocks of |R>=S); size_t start = ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/prog_integrals.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/prog_integrals.html

Note that all; integral derivatives are provided by the new integral code, unlike the previous; version where only 9 of 12 were provided and the user was responsible for using; translation invariance relationships to fill in the rest. The addresses for; each chunk are updated in the vector after each call to compute integrals, so; the user should keep a const reference to that object, and query that for the; address of interest. Density Screening¶; The old code looked only at the integral to determine whether terms can be; avoided a priori. However, if the integral is to be contracted with a; density or a density-like quantity, the screening can be performed on the; product, which yields more sparsity. To enable this, simply call the integral; object’s update_density member, passing it a SharedMatrix holding the; current density (remember that it changes during each iteration of the SCF) and; the product will be considered during screening. If only coulomb-like terms; are to be computed, the needs_exchange argument to the integral object; constructor should be set to false, otherwise it should be true to correcly; account for products of the density and integrals that contribute to; exchange-like terms. Shell blocking¶; Each underlying integral engine knows whether it will use blocks, and will set up; the metadata automatically. Instead of looping over individual shells, the; user should loop over blocks supplied by the integral object; these blocks will; be just a single shell quartet combination for the case where blocking is not; used. It is simple to loop over pairs within each block using C++11 syntax, as; demonstrated in the code snippet above. Only shell pairs with significant; overlap are included in the shell block information, making this an efficient; way to loop over non-negligible terms.

Permutational symmetry¶; The pairs within each block are optimized for efficiency. First, they are; screened during the integral object’s creation to ensure that only terms with; appreciable overlap are stored. Second, only P,Q combinations that are; permutationally unique are stored, ordered with the higher angular momentum; first. Therefore care must be taken to ensure that the missing permutations; are correctly accounted for when processing the integrals within the loop. See; the DirectJK code in libfock for an example of using this scheme for a Fock; matrix build.

For methods requiring; potentials and fields evaluated at many external sites, such as PCM and; polarizable embedding, the efficiency of the one electron integrals can be rate; limiting. We also started to introduce integral screening, and it is important; to balance the screening used for one- and two-electron terms carefully, so this; is a good opportunity to re-evaluate the code. Finally, given the complexity; of the OS recursion code, the switch to an external library leaves a more; compact codebase to maintain. The one electron integrals which are not provided by Libint2; are now handled by a new implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson (M-D) algorithm,; leading to removal of the OS code in version 1.6.

Shell Pairs¶; To ensure consistency between one- and two-electron terms when screening, and; for efficiency reasons, shell pair lists should be used to iterate over pairs; of Gaussian shells. These lists contain integer pair numbers, corresponding to; the pairs of shells that have sufficient overlap to survive the screening; process. Iterating over these lists is simple:; const auto& shell_pairs = Vint->shellpairs();; size_t n_pairs = shell_pairs.size();; for (size_t p = 0; p < n_pairs; ++p) {; auto P = shell_pairs[p].first;; auto Q = shell_pairs[p].second;; // do something with shells P and Q; }.

However,; the PSI4 ecosystem provides a path for easier and more rapid development; of new features. The earliest versions of PSI4 were written by merging; individual executables that performed specific tasks into a unified C++; executable. By linking this C++ executable against the Python interpreter, the; individual modules could be called in any sequence, enabling a very diverse; range of tasks to be accomplished within a given input. Although Python-driven; model allowed for great flexibility from a user’s perspective, programming was; still relatively difficult because it required modifications to be made in C++; code.; Since those early days, the code has undergone some important structural; changes that have greatly simplified the development workflow. These changes; were motivated by the realization that only a few bottlenecks exist in a typical; calculation; by focusing on optimized C++ implementations of these bottlenecks; and making these C++ functions available in Python, most of the code to implement; the overall calculation can be written in simpler Python code. Python is far; better suited to management tasks such as directory navigation and retrieval,; making it a natural choice for overall calculation layout than C++. With the; emergence of NumPy as a standard tool for executing almost any; mathematical technique efficiently in Python, the transitioning of code from; C++ to Python has facilitated a much simpler work flow for prototyping and; developing methods: this is detailed in the next section. Rapid initial development using Psi4NumPy¶; The Psi4NumPy project [Smith:2018:3504] is the recommended; mechanism for developing and prototyping new methods in Psi4. Because; NumPy provides such a rich set of features for efficient linear; algebra, Fourier transforms, and general tensor manipulations, a massive number; of methods can be easily implemented very easily using that library.

Rapid initial development using Psi4NumPy¶; The Psi4NumPy project [Smith:2018:3504] is the recommended; mechanism for developing and prototyping new methods in Psi4. Because; NumPy provides such a rich set of features for efficient linear; algebra, Fourier transforms, and general tensor manipulations, a massive number; of methods can be easily implemented very easily using that library. To; facilitate this workflow, PSI4 exports key quantities such as integrals,; densities and molecular orbitals in NumPy format. From this point, the; programmer can simply call the appropriate PSI4 functions to compute the; desired input quantities, retrieve them in NumPy format, and then write the; remaining code using standard Python and/or NumPy syntax. This approach does; not require any recompilation of code, resulting in a particularly facile; development workflow. Detailed examples and tutorials are available in the; Psi4NumPy repository.

Sirianni. Note: Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with Psi4. In Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with import psi4 at the top, and commands are behind the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode. Note: PsiAPI mode has been available since late 2016 and the v1.1 release. While we aim to provide deprecation warnings and upgrade helpers, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Here, we will explore the basics of using Psi4 in the interactive PsiAPI style where it is loaded directly as a Python module by reproducing the section A Psi4 Tutorial from the Psi4 manual in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.; Note: If the newest version of Psi4 (v.1.1a2dev42 or newer) is in your path, feel free to execute each cell as you read along by pressing Shift+Enter when the cell is selected.

Psi4 is now able to be controlled directly from Python. By default, Psi4 will print any output to the screen; this can be changed by giving a file name (with path if not in the current working directory) to the function psi4.set_output_file() API, as a string:. [3]:. psi4.set_output_file('output.dat', False). Additionally, output may be suppressed by instead setting psi4.core.be_quiet() API . II. Running a Basic Hartree-Fock Calculation¶; In our first example, we will consider a Hartree-Fock SCF computation for the water molecule using a cc-pVDZ basis set. First, we will set the available memory for Psi4 to use with the psi4.set_memory() API function, which takes either a string like '30 GB' (with units!) or an integer number of bytes of memory as its argument. Next, our molecular geometry is passed as a string into; psi4.geometry() API. We may input this geometry in either Z-matrix or Cartesian format; to allow the string to break over multiple lines, use Python’s triple-quote """"""string"""""" syntax. Finally, we will compute the Hartree-Fock SCF energy with the cc-pVDZ basis set by passing the method/basis set as a string ('scf/cc-pvdz') into the function psi4.energy(); API:. [3]:. #!

These can be specified by replacing psi4.energy() API with; psi4.optimize() API or psi4.frequency() API, respectively.; Let’s take a look at an example of optimizing the H\(_2\)O molecule using Hartree-Fock with a cc-pVDZ basis set.; Now, here comes the real beauty of running Psi4 interactively: above, when we computed the energy of H\(_2\)O with HF/cc-pVDZ, we defined the Psi4 molecule object h2o. Since we’re still in the Python shell, as long as you executed that block of code, we can reuse the h2o molecule object in our optimization without redefining it, by adding the molecule=h2o argument to the psi4.optimize(); API function:.

This should perform a series of gradient computations. The gradient points which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the geometry to follow the gradient. After a few cycles, the geometry should converge with a message like Optimization complete!. As indicated in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the computation and grep-able with ~), the energy decreases with each step, and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step; (in principle, these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do not).; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; Step Total Energy Delta E MAX Force RMS Force MAX Disp RMS Disp ~; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ~; 1 -76.026632734908 -76.026632734908 0.01523518 0.01245755 0.02742222 0.02277530 ~; 2 -76.027022666011 -0.000389931104 0.00178779 0.00142946 0.01008137 0.00594928 ~; 3 -76.027032729374 -0.000010063363 0.00014019 0.00008488 0.00077463 0.0004473",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psiapi.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psiapi.html

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it’s important to keep in mind that the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular geometry. Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies AT THE OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. Luckily, Psi4 updates the molecule with optimized geometry as it is being optimized. So, the optimized geometry for H\(_2\)O is stored inside the h2o molecule object, which we can access! To compute the frequencies, all we need to do; is to again pass the molecule=h2o argument to the psi4.frequency() API function:. [6]:. scf_e, scf_wfn = psi4.frequency('scf/cc-pvdz', molecule=h2o, return_wfn=True). 6 displacements needed.; 1 2 3 4 5 6. Executing this cell will prompt Psi4 to compute the Hessian (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to nuclear displacements. From this, it can obtain the harmonic vibrational frequencies, given below (roundoff errors of around \(0.1\) cm\(^{-1}\) may exist):; Irrep Harmonic Frequency; (cm-1); -----------------------------------------------; A1 1775.6478; A1 4113.3795; B2 4212.1814; -----------------------------------------------.

The vibrational frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G.; Note: Psi4 has several synonyms for the functions called in this example. For instance, psi4.frequency() API will compute molecular vibrational frequencies, and psi4.optimize() API will perform a geometry optimization. IV. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. Psi4 contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) (Jeziorski:1994:1887).

[8]:. -0.0022355825227244703. All of the options we have currently set using psi4.set_options() API are “global” options (meaning that they are visible to all parts of the program). Most common Psi4 options can be set like this. If an option needs to be visible only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the code), it can be set by prefixing the option name with; [MODULE]__, for example psi4.set_options('scf__e_convergence': 1e-8}).; Note: The arguments to the functions we’ve used so far, like psi4.set_options() API, psi4.energy() API, psi4.optimize() API, psi4.frequency(); API, etc., are case-insensitive.; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found (Hohenstein:2012:WIREs) with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and without diffuse \(d\) functions on heavy atoms) (Papajak:2011:10). So,; we’ll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors while providing much faster computations (Hohenstein:2010:184111,Hohenstein:2010:014101). Since we’re using density fitting for the SAPT, we might as well also use it for the Hartree-Fock; computations that are performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that by adding 'scf_type': 'df' to the dictionary passed to psi4.set_options().; Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that pair with the primary basis set. Fortunately, Psi4 is usually smart enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given computation.

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it’s important to keep in mind that the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular geometry. Therefore, it’s important to obtain the vibrational frequencies AT THE OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. Luckily, Psi4 updates the molecule with optimized geometry as it is being optimized. So, the optimized geometry for H\(_2\)O is stored inside the h2o molecule object, which we can access! To compute the frequencies, all we need to do; is to again pass the molecule=h2o argument to the psi4.frequency() API function:. [6]:. scf_e, scf_wfn = psi4.frequency('scf/cc-pvdz', molecule=h2o, return_wfn=True). 6 displacements needed.; 1 2 3 4 5 6. Executing this cell will prompt Psi4 to compute the Hessian (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to nuclear displacements. From this, it can obtain the harmonic vibrational frequencies, given below (roundoff errors of around \(0.1\) cm\(^{-1}\) may exist):; Irrep Harmonic Frequency; (cm-1); -----------------------------------------------; A1 1775.6478; A1 4113.3795; B2 4212.1814; -----------------------------------------------.

Sirianni. Note: Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with Psi4. In Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with import psi4 at the top, and commands are behind the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode. Note: PsiAPI mode has been available since late 2016 and the v1.1 release. While we aim to provide deprecation warnings and upgrade helpers, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Here, we will explore the basics of using Psi4 in the interactive PsiAPI style where it is loaded directly as a Python module by reproducing the section A Psi4 Tutorial from the Psi4 manual in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.; Note: If the newest version of Psi4 (v.1.1a2dev42 or newer) is in your path, feel free to execute each cell as you read along by pressing Shift+Enter when the cell is selected.

For example, let’s run a computation on methylene (\(\text{CH}_2\)), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S + 1 = 3\)). In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, Psi4 can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two; integers in the Z-matrix (note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule specification below). In this example, we will also specify the bond length and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are first stored and then inserted into the geometry specification using Python 3 string formatting.

Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy¶; Finally, let’s consider an example which highlights the advantages of being able to interact with Psi4 directly with Python.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to generate separate geometries for each distance to be studied. Instead, we can leverage Python loops and string formatting to make our lives simpler. Additionally, let’s suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies. Counterpoise correction involves; computing the dimer energy and then subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to know what method you want to do the couterpoise correction on (here, let’s consider CCSD(T)), and it needs; to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer B.

Note: Psithon and PsiAPI refer to two modes of interacting with Psi4. In Psithon mode, you write an input file in our domain-specific language (not quite Python) where commands don’t have psi4. in front, then submit it to the executable psi4 which processes the Psithon into pure Python and runs it internally. In PsiAPI mode, you write a pure Python script with import psi4 at the top, and commands are behind the psi4. namespace, then submit it to the python interpreter.; Both modes are equally powerful. This tutorial covers the PsiAPI mode. Note: PsiAPI mode has been available since late 2016 and the v1.1 release. While we aim to provide deprecation warnings and upgrade helpers, the API should not be considered completely stable. Most importantly, as we someday deprecate the last of the global variables, options will be added to the method calls (e.g., energy('scf', molecule=mol, options=opt)); Note: Consult How to run Psi4 as Python module after compilation or How to run Psi4 as a Python module from conda installation for assistance in setting up Psi4. Here, we will explore the basics of using Psi4 in the interactive PsiAPI style where it is loaded directly as a Python module by reproducing the section A Psi4 Tutorial from the Psi4 manual in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.; Note: If the newest version of Psi4 (v.1.1a2dev42 or newer) is in your path, feel free to execute each cell as you read along by pressing Shift+Enter when the cell is selected. I. Basic Input Structure¶; Psi4 is now a Python module; so, we need to import it into our Python environment:.

The program correctly guessed all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where not all the electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation on methylene (\(\text{CH}_2\)), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S + 1 = 3\)). In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, Psi4 can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two; integers in the Z-matrix (note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule specification below). In this example, we will also specify the bond length and bond angle as variables (\(R\) and \(A\)), whose values are first stored and then inserted into the geometry specification using Python 3 string formatting. [4]:. #! Sample UHF/6-31G** CH2 Computation. R = 1.075; A = 133.93. ch2 = psi4.geometry(""""""; 0 3; C; H 1 {0}; H 1 {0} 2 {1}; """""".format(R, A); ). psi4.set_options({'reference': 'uhf'}); psi4.energy('scf/6-31g**').

This function takes a Python dictionary as its argument, which is a key-value list which associates a Psi4 keyword with its user-defined value. For open shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree-Fock, or UHF) or restricted orbitals (restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than ROHF). III.

(This information could be used to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.); Because the vibrational frequencies are available, a thermodynamics analysis is automatically performed at the end of the computation. You can see this in the next section of the output file output.dat. The vibrational frequencies are sufficient to obtain vibrational contributions to enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and Gibbs free energy (G). Similarly, the molecular geometry is used to obtain rotational constants, which are then used to obtain rotational contributions to H, S, and G.; Note: Psi4 has several synonyms for the functions called in this example. For instance, psi4.frequency() API will compute molecular vibrational frequencies, and psi4.optimize() API will perform a geometry optimization. IV. Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. Psi4 contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) (Jeziorski:1994:1887). This kind of analysis gives a lot of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and Psi4 makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two dashes, like this:.

[1]:. # Ignore this block -- it's for the documentation build; try:; import os, sys; sys.path.insert(1, os.path.abspath('/home/runner/work/psi4/psi4/code/objdir/stage//usr/local/psi4/lib/')); except ImportError:; pass. # This is the important part; import psi4. Psi4 is now able to be controlled directly from Python. By default, Psi4 will print any output to the screen; this can be changed by giving a file name (with path if not in the current working directory) to the function psi4.set_output_file() API, as a string:. [3]:. psi4.set_output_file('output.dat', False). Additionally, output may",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psiapi.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psiapi.html

This function takes a Python dictionary as its argument, which is a key-value list which associates a Psi4 keyword with its user-defined value. For open shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree-Fock, or UHF) or restricted orbitals (restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than ROHF). III. Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations (as specified by the psi4.energy() API function). Of course there are other kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing psi4.energy() API with; psi4.optimize() API or psi4.frequency() API, respectively.; Let’s take a look at an example of optimizing the H\(_2\)O molecule using Hartree-Fock with a cc-pVDZ basis set.; Now, here comes the real beauty of running Psi4 interactively: above, when we computed the energy of H\(_2\)O with HF/cc-pVDZ, we defined the Psi4 molecule object h2o.

Potential Surface Scans and Counterpoise Correction Made Easy¶; Finally, let’s consider an example which highlights the advantages of being able to interact with Psi4 directly with Python.; Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to generate separate geometries for each distance to be studied. Instead, we can leverage Python loops and string formatting to make our lives simpler. Additionally, let’s suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies. Counterpoise correction involves; computing the dimer energy and then subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard procedure for intermolecular interactions, Psi4 knows about it and has a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to know what method you want to do the couterpoise correction on (here, let’s consider CCSD(T)), and it needs; to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the psi4.geometry() string can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne\(_2\) at a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) interaction energies (in kcal/mol) at each geometry:. [9]:. #!

Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in the ne2_geometry string like we normally would. That’s because we are going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface, by using a Python loop over the list of interatomic distances Rvals.; Before we are able to pass our molecule to Psi4, we need to do two things. First, we must set the value of the intermolecular separation in our Z-matrix (by using Python 3 string formatting) to the particular value of R. Second, we need to turn the Z-matrix string into a Psi4 molecule, by passing it to `psi4.geometry() <http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/api/psi4.driver.geometry.html#psi4.driver.geometry>`__. The; argument bsse_type='cp' tells Psi4 to perform counterpoise (CP) correction on the dimer to compute the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ interaction energy, which is stored in our ecp dictionary at each iteration of our Python loop. Note that we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. Psi4 does it all for us, automatically.; Near the very end of the output file output.dat, the counterpoise correction Python function will print a nice summary of the results of the counterpoise computation (the energies of the dimer, of monomer 1 with the ghost functions of monomer 2, of monomer 2 with the ghost functions of monomer 1, and the overall counterpoise corrected interaction energy):; N-Body: Computing complex (1/2) with fragments (2,) in the basis of fragments (1, 2).; ...; N-Body: Complex Energy (fragments = (2,), basis = (1, 2): -128.70932405488924); ...; N-Body: Computing complex (2/2) with fragments (1,) in the basis of fragments (1, 2).; ...; N-Body: Complex Energy (fragments = (1,), basis = (1, 2): -128.70932405488935); ...; N-Body: Co",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psiapi.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psiapi.html

If the computation does not complete, there is probably a problem with the compilation or installation of the program (see the installation instructions in the main Psi4 manual section Compiling and Installing from Source.; This very simple input is sufficient to run the requested information. Notice we didn’t tell the program some otherwise useful information like the charge of the molecule (0, it’s neutral), the spin multiplicity (1 for a closed-shell molecule with all electrons paired), or the reference wavefunction to use (restricted Hartree-Fock, or RHF, is usually appropriate for a closed-shell molecule). The program correctly guessed all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where not all the electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation on methylene (\(\text{CH}_2\)), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity \(2S + 1 = 3\)). In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we need to tell the program the true value (3).

This function takes a Python dictionary as its argument, which is a key-value list which associates a Psi4 keyword with its user-defined value. For open shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree-Fock, or UHF) or restricted orbitals (restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than ROHF). III. Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations (as specified by the psi4.energy() API function). Of course there are other kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing psi4.energy() API with; psi4.optimize() API or psi4.frequency() API, respectively.; Let’s take a look at an example of optimizing the H\(_2\)O molecule using Hartree-Fock with a cc-pVDZ basis set.; Now, here comes the real beauty of running Psi4 interactively: above, when we computed the energy of H\(_2\)O with HF/cc-pVDZ, we defined the Psi4 molecule object h2o. Since we’re still in the Python shell, as long as you executed that block of code, we can reuse the h2o molecule object in our optimization without redefining it, by adding the molecule=h2o argument to the psi4.optimize(); API function:.

So,; we’ll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors while providing much faster computations (Hohenstein:2010:184111,Hohenstein:2010:014101). Since we’re using density fitting for the SAPT, we might as well also use it for the Hartree-Fock; computations that are performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that by adding 'scf_type': 'df' to the dictionary passed to psi4.set_options().; Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that pair with the primary basis set. Fortunately, Psi4 is usually smart enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given computation. In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set) that Psi4 correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT auxiliary basis for the Hartree-Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set for the SAPT; procedure.; To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to freeze the core electrons by adding 'freeze_core': 'true' to the dictionary passed to psi4.set_options(). The SAPT procedure is invoked by psi4.energy('sapt0/jun-cc-pvdz', molecule=dimer). Here, Psi4 knows to automatically run two monomer computations and a dimer computation and then use these results to perform the SAPT analysis. The various energy components are printed at the end of the output, in addition to; the total SAPT0 interaction energy. An explanation of the various energy components can be found in the review by Jeziorski, Moszynski, and Szalewicz (Jeziorski:1994:1887), and this is discussed in more detail in the SAPT section of the Psi4 manual.; For now, we’ll note that most of the SAPT energy components are negative; this means those are attractive contribut",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psiapi.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psiapi.html

The PSIMRCC; module contained in PSI4 implements the state-specific; multireference coupled-cluster approach of Mukherjee and co-workers; (Mk-MRCC). This method is implemented and shown to be a powerful tool in; [Evangelista:2006:154113] and [Evangelista:2008:124104]. Mk-MRCC is; based on the Jeziorski-Monkhorst ansatz [Jeziorski:1981:1668] for the; wavefunction, \(\Psi\). \[\left| \Psi \right \rangle = \sum_\mu^d e^{\hat{T}^\mu} \left| \Phi_\mu \right\rangle c_\mu \, \text{,}\]; where \(\Phi_\mu\) are the reference determinants,; \(\hat{T}^\mu\) are reference-specific excitation operators, and; \(c_\mu\) are expansion coefficients obtained through diagonalization; of the Mk-MRCC effective Hamiltonian matrix that allows the various; reference determinants to interact. As an example of how this works; the Mk-MRCCSD excitation operators for each reference is contracted; two-body terms. \[\hat{T}^\mu = \hat{T}^\mu_1 + \hat{T}^\mu_2\]; where. \[\hat{T}^\mu_1 = \sum_i^{\textrm{occ}(\mu)} \sum_a^{\textrm{vir}(\mu)} t_i^a (\mu) \hat{a}^\dagger_a \hat{a}_i\]; and. \[\hat{T}^\mu_2 =\frac{1}{4} \sum_i^{\textrm{occ}(\mu)} \sum_a^{\textrm{vir}(\mu)} t_{ij}^{ab} (\mu) \hat{a}^\dagger_b \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_a \hat{a}_i\]; The Mk-MRCC energy is a chosen eigenvalue of the effective Hamiltonian,; \(\textrm{H}^{eff}_{\mu \nu}\). \[\sum_\nu \textrm{H}^{eff}_{\mu \nu} c_\nu =E c_\nu\]; where. \[\textrm{H}^{eff}_{\mu \nu} = \left \langle \Phi_\mu \right | \hat{H}e^{\hat{T}^\nu} \left | \Phi_\nu \right \rangle \, \textrm{.}\]; PSI4 currently implements Mk-MRCC with singles and doubles; [Mk-MRCCSD] and Mk-MRCCSD with perturbative triples [Mk-MRCCSD(T)]; as formulated in [Evangelista:2010:074107].

However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed. See scf4 for analogous Z-matrix; and Cartiesian scans. Tables of Results¶; The Psithon function psi4.driver.p4util.Table has been removed,; as the Python ecosystem provides many more flexible alternatives.

Python Wrappers¶; The Python foundations of the PSI4 driver and Psithon syntax permit; many commonly performed post-processing procedures to be integrated into; the PSI4 suite.; As seen in the neon dimer example from the tutorial section,; the nbody() wrapper provides automatic computation of; counterpoise-corrected interaction energies between two molecules. For; example,; energy('mp2', bsse_type='cp'). will compute the counterpoise-corrected density-fitted MP2 interaction energy; between two molecules.; PSI4 also provides the cbs() wrapper,; which automatically computes a complete-basis-set extrapolation (and; automatically sets up the computations with different basis sets required to; do the extrapolation). For example,:; # all equivalent. energy('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2) and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc-pVT",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html

For example,:; # all equivalent. energy('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2) and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc-pVTZ). cbs() can; be configured behind-the-scenes with explicit arguments, as in the; first example, or the convenience syntax of the equivalent second; example can be used.; Another very useful and powerful feature of PSI4 is the ability; to compute results on entire databases of molecules at a time,; as provided by the database() wrapper. For example,:; database('mp2', 'S22', cp=1, benchmark='S22B'). will perform DF-MP2 counterpoise-corrected interaction energies; (cp=1) on all members of Hobza’s S22 database set of van der Waals; dimers, and then compare the results against the S22B benchmark energies.; Built-in databases include S22, A24, HTBH, HBC6, HSG, S22by5, S66, JSCH,; NCB31, S66by8, and NBC10, among others.; These wrapper functions are discussed separately in; Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation.

To add EFP fragments to a molecule, see Molecule Specification. Job Control Keywords¶; PSI4 comprises a number of C++ modules that each perform; specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module; recognizes specific keywords in the input file which control its function.; These keywords are detailed in Appendix Keywords by Module.; The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to; certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified:; # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around cc-pVDZ, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in set commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords:; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, viz.:; set {; docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]; }. List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening [ is; on the same line as the name of the keyword.; Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the set keyword. Omitting the module; name, or using the name global or globals will result in the keyword being; applied to all modules. For example, in the following input; molecule{; o; h 1 roh; h 1 roh 2 ahoh. roh = 0.957; ahoh = 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1; energy('ccsd'). the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print; level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs cou",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html

Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, any of which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets = [""cc-pVDZ"", ""cc-pVTZ"", ""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of basis_sets is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis_set is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign.; The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water:; molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }. Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2). set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule h2o we can then set the values of R and A within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the set keyword.; Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed.

Psithon: Structuring an Input File¶; To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, PSI4 was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; PSI4 is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; Test Suite and Sample Inputs; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level PSI4 source directory and should; serve as useful examples. Physical Constants¶; For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; ~/.psi4rc file in the current user’s home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the ~/.psi4rc file; UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable UGC available in all PSI4 input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the PSI4 code (which; are obtained from NIST CODATA 2014; are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before ~/.psi4rc is loaded, so that the user’s ~/.psi4rc values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).; The physical constants used within PSI4, which are automatically; made available within all PSI4 input files are in Physical Constants.; In Psithon input files, prepend physical constants with psi_ to; prevent clashes with user-defined variables (e.g., psi_h).

For example,:; # all equivalent. energy('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2) and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc-pVTZ). cbs() can; be configured behind-the-scenes with explicit arguments, as in the; first example, or the convenience syntax of the equivalent second; example can be used.; Another very useful and powerful feature of PSI4 is the ability; to compute results on entire databases of molecules at a time,; as provided by the database() wrapper. For example,:; database('mp2', 'S22', cp=1, benchmark='S22B'). will perform DF-MP2 counterpoise-corrected interaction energies; (cp=1) on all members of Hobza’s S22 database set of van der Waals; dimers, and then compare the results against the S22B benchmark energies.; Built-in databases include S22, A24, HTBH, HBC6, HSG, S22by5, S66, JSCH,; NCB31, S66by8, and NBC10, among others.; These wrapper functions are discussed separately in; Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation.

List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening [ is; on the same line as the name of the keyword.; Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the set keyword.

Python Wrappers¶; The Python foundations of the PSI4 driver and Psithon syntax permit; many commonly performed post-processing procedures to be integrated into; the PSI4 suite.; As seen in the neon dimer example from the tutorial section,; the nbody() wrapper provides automatic computation of; counterpoise-corrected interaction energies between two molecules. For; example,; energy('mp2', bsse_type='cp'). will compute the counterpoise-corrected density-fitted MP2 interaction energy; between two molecules.; PSI4 also provides the cbs() wrapper,; which automatically computes a complete-basis-set extrapolation (and; automatically sets up the computations with different basis sets required to; do the extrapolation). For example,:; # all equivalent. energy('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2) and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc-pVT",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html

For example,:; # all equivalent. energy('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2) and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree–Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc-pVTZ). cbs() can; be configured behind-the-scenes with explicit arguments, as in the; first example, or the convenience syntax of the equivalent second; example can be used.; Another very useful and powerful feature of PSI4 is the ability; to compute results on entire databases of molecules at a time,; as provided by the database() wrapper. For example,:; database('mp2', 'S22', cp=1, benchmark='S22B'). will perform DF-MP2 counterpoise-corrected interaction energies; (cp=1) on all members of Hobza’s S22 database set of van der Waals; dimers, and then compare the results against the S22B benchmark energies.; Built-in databases include S22, A24, HTBH, HBC6, HSG, S22by5, S66, JSCH,; NCB31, S66by8, and NBC10, among others.; These wrapper functions are discussed separately in; Psithon Functions: Invoking a Calculation.

In; PsiAPI mode, access as, e.g., psi4.constants.h. Memory Specification¶; By default, PSI4 assumes that 500 MiB of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 GB of RAM is available; to PSI4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 GB. memory 2000 MB. memory 2000000 kB. Please note that memory can be specified both in IEC binary units (1 KiB = 1024 bytes) and SI units (1 kB = 1000 bytes). PSI4 recognizes and obeys both of them correctly. The units are not case sensitive (Kb and KB are equivalent to kB).; By default, PSI4 performs a “sanity check” when parsing Psithon input files, enforcing a minimum memory requirement of 250 MiB. While it is generally not recomennded to do so, expert users can bypass this check by directly setting the number of bytes availble to PSI4:; # setting available memory to 2 MB; set_memory_bytes(2000000). Please note that this memory setting only governs the maximal memory; usage of the major data structures, and actual total memory usage; is slightly higher. This is usually a negligible amount, except when; setting tiny memory allowances.; One convenient way to override the PSI4 default memory is to place a; memory command in the ~/.psi4rc file (Sec. ~/.psi4rc File). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 GB.; set_memory(2000000000). However, unless you’re assured of having only one job running on a node at; a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with ~/.psi4rc have similar memory; capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a; per-calculation basis.; That same command can be used for P",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html

In; PsiAPI mode, access as, e.g., psi4.constants.h. Memory Specification¶; By default, PSI4 assumes that 500 MiB of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the memory keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 GB of RAM is available; to PSI4:; # all equivalent. memory 2 GB. memory 2000 MB. memory 2000000 kB. Please note that memory can be specified both in IEC binary units (1 KiB = 1024 bytes) and SI units (1 kB = 1000 bytes). PSI4 recognizes and obeys both of them correctly. The units are not case sensitive (Kb and KB are equivalent to kB).; By default, PSI4 performs a “sanity check” when parsing Psithon input files, enforcing a minimum memory requirement of 250 MiB. While it is generally not recomennded to do so, expert users can bypass this check by directly setting the number of bytes availble to PSI4:; # setting available memory to 2 M",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html

PSI Variables¶; To harness the power of Python, PSI4 makes the most pertinent results; of each computation available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of; H2 and H atom:; molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'). molecule h {; H; }. set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'). D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol * (2*h_energy - h2_energy); print ""De=%f"" % D_e. The energy() function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.; Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; PSI Variables by Module lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and PSI Variables by Alpha defines them. These can be; accessed through the get_variable() function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available:; e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command print_variables(). Note that PSI variables; are cleared at the start of each energy(), etc. in an input; file by clean_variables().; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print_variables() command, the; last will include SCF TOTAL ENERGY but not; FCI TOTAL ENERGY.; The entire dictionary of PSI variables can be obtained through; get_variables().

Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, any of which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets = [""cc-pVDZ"", ""cc-pVTZ"", ""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf').

For more elaborate post-processing of computations, adding; return_wfn=True keyword argument additionally returns; Wavefunction.; # power user returns; E, wfn = energy(..., return_wfn=True); E, wfn = optimize(..., return_wfn=True); E, wfn = frequency(..., return_wfn=True); G, wfn = gradient(..., return_wfn=True) # used by optimize(); H, wfn = hessian(..., return_wfn=True) # used by frequency(). # print gradient array and its rms; wfn.gradient.print_out(); print wfn.gradient().rms(). # format output for other programs; molden(wfn, 'mycalc.molden'). # access array in another format; np.array(wfn.hessian()). Loops¶; Python provides many control structures, any of which can be used within PSI4; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:; basis_sets = [""cc-pVDZ"", ""cc-pVTZ"", ""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psithoninput.html
https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psithonmol.html:13815,Availability,reliab,reliable,13815,"r cation, we can specify; SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psithonmol.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psithonmol.html

Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the \(^2B_1\); state of water cation, we can specify; SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments.

In most cases the standard; Schönflies symbol (one of c1, c2, ci, cs, d2,; c2h, c2v, d2h will suffice for symbol.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with \(D_{2h}\) symmetry in \(C_{2v}\), the; \(C_2\) axis can be chosen as either the \(x\), the \(y\), or the \(z\); these can; be specified by requesting the symmetry as c2vx, c2vy, or c2vz, respectively.; Likewise the c2x, c2y, c2z, c2hx, c2hy, and c2hz; labels are valid. For \(C_s\) symmetry the labels csx, csy, and; csz request the \(yz\), \(xz\), and \(xy\) planes be used as the mirror plane,; respectively. If no unique axis is specified, PSI4 will choose an appropriate; subgroup.; Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational; frequencies, might lower the symmetry of the molecule. When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as SOCC, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the \(^2B_1\); state of water cation, we can specify; SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; \(C_s\) (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as:; SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic.

For; example, the geometry for H2 can be specified a number of ways, using the; molecule optional_molecule_name {...} block.; molecule {; H; H 1 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H; H 1 r; r = 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H1; H2 H1 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 0.0; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.9; }. or; molecule {; H 0.0 0.0 -r; H 0.0 0.0 r; r = 0.45; }.

Some caution is required, however. The \(^2A_1\) state can be obtained with; the; SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become; SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The \(^2B_2\) state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are; SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to; SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the \(^2A_1\) state. In this case, the; \(^2A_1\) state is lower in energy, and is not problematic. The distorted; geometries for the \(^2B_2\) state are excited states that are subject to; variational collapse. One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is; to use a multi-state method; in this case it’s easier to run the entire; computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference; procedure. Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments¶; PSI4 has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent; intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted; perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments; are interacting within the complex. PSI4 provides a very simple mechanism; for doing so: simply define the complex’s geometry using the standard; Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two; dashes between nonbonded fragments. For example, to study the interaction; energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule; block:; molecule eneyne {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; }.

The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, PSI4 can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem] database.; For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; PSI4 to search PubChem for a starting structure. The search is actually; performed for compounds whose name contains “benzene”, so multiple; entries will be returned. If the name provided (“benzene” in the above; example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used. If no; exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier; (CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more; specific name. For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a; compound whose name(s) contain “benzene”, but we’re not sure of the exact IUPAC; name, the following input can be used:; molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene*; }. Appending the “*” prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time; of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file:; Chemical ID IUPAC Name; 241 benzene; 7371 benzenesulfonic acid; 91526 benzenesulfonate; 244 phenylmethanol; 727 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane; 240 benzaldehyde; 65723 benzenesulfonohydrazide; 74296 N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide; 289 benzene-1,2-diol; 243 benzoic acid; 7370 ben",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/psithonmol.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/psithonmol.html

Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not; have the correct symmetry. Before starting the computation, PSI4 will; check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible; symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum; symmetry is utilized.; The standard keywords, described in Molecule Keywords, can be; used in conjunction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, etc. . Symmetry¶; For efficiency, PSI4 can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full; point group of the molecule. Concomitantly, a number of quantities, such as; SOCC and DOCC, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible; representations (irreps) of the molecular point group. Ordering of irreps; follows the convention used in Cotton’s Chemical Applications of Group; Theory, as detailed in Table Irreps. We refer to this; convention as “Cotton Ordering” hereafter.

It is; possible to further specify that the overall complex is neutral and spin-singlet; by inserting another charge multiplicity line, separated from the first; molecule block by a – line. If any information is missing, PSI4 will set the; unprovided charges and multiplicities to be consistent with those that are given.; For example, the overall charge must be simply the sum of all fragment charges.; PSI4 further assumes that any unpaired electrons are coupled to yield the highest; possible \(M_s\) value. Psi will also favor neutral, spin-singlet fragments.; For anything complicated, we strongly suggest explicitly providing the charge; and multiplicity of each fragment as well as the total molecular charge and multiplicity. For details and examples, see https://github.com/MolSSI/QCElemental/blob/master/qcelemental/molparse/chgmult.py#L105-L136 .; Having defined a molecule containing fragments like eneyne above, it; is a simple matter to perform calculations on only a subset of the; fragments. For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene; fragment alone (extract_subsets(1) pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms; and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the; ethyne fragment ghosted (extract_subsets(1,2) pulls out fragment 1 as; Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. extract_subsets(2,[1,3]):; mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'). clean(). mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf'). If the molecule contains fragments but is not conveniently ordered for the; -- marker, the auto_fragments() function can be applied, as shown in; pywrap-basis, to return as active molecule the previous; active molecule, only fragmented.

It is; possible to further specify that the overall complex is neutral and spin-singlet; by inserting another charge multiplicity line, separated from the first; molecule block by a – line. If any information is missing, PSI4 will set the; unprovided charges and multiplicities to be consistent with those that are given.; For example, the overall charge must be simply the sum of all fragment charges.; PSI4 further assumes that any unpaired electrons are coupled to yield the highest; possible \(M_s\) value. Psi will also favor neutral, spin-singlet fragments.; For anything complicated, we strongly suggest explicitly providing the charge; and multiplicity of each fragment as well as the total molecular charge and multiplicity. For details and examples, see https://github.com/MolSSI/QCElemental/blob/master/qcelemental/molparse/chgmult.py#L105-L136 .; Having defined a molecule containing fragments like eneyne above, it; is a simple matter to perform calculations on only a subset of the; fragments. For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene; fragment alone (extract_subsets(1) pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms; and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the; ethyne fragment ghosted (extract_subsets(1,2) pulls out fragment 1 as; Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. extract_subsets(2,[1,3]):; mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'). clean(). mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf'). If the molecule contains fragments but is not conveniently ordered for the; -- marker, the auto_fragments() function can be applied, as shown in; pywrap-basis, to return as active molecule the previous; active molecule, only fragmented.

A necessary consideration in constructing a database is the distinction; between reagents and reactions. A reagent is a single molecular system; (may be a dimer) whose geometry you are possession of and whose electronic; energy may be of interest. A reaction is a combination of one or more; reagent energies whose value you are interested in and a reference value; for which you may or may not be in possession of. A few examples follow.; In a database of interaction energies, the reagents are dimers and their; component monomers (usually derived from the dimer geometry), and the; reactions are the dimer less monomers energies. In a database of barrier; heights, the reagents are reactants, products, and transition-state; structures, and the reactions are the transition-states less; minimum-energy structures. Possibly you may have a collection of; structures to simply be acted upon in parallel, in which case the; structures are both the reagents and the reactions. The role of the; database.py file is to collect arrays and dictionaries that define the; geometries of reagents (GEOS), their combination into reactions (RXNM &; ACTV), available reference values for reactions (BIND), and brief comments; for reagents and reactions (TAGL). The journey from reagent geometries to; functional database.py file is largely automated, in a process described; below. Prepare geometry filesAssemble xyz files for all intended reagent systems in a directory.; Follow the rules below for best results. The filename for each xyz; file should be the name of the system. lowercase or MixedCase is; preferable (according to Sherrill lab convention). Avoid dashes and; dots in the name as python won’t allow them. If you’re determined to; have dashes and dots, they must be replaced by other characters in the; process_input line, then translated back in the GEOS section; see; NBC10.py for an example",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.9.x/quickadddatabase.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.9.x/quickadddatabase.html
