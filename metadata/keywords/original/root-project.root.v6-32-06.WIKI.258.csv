TProofNodeInfo * GetMaster(); Get the master node. Only return the master info if it was set; in the config file. TList * GetSubmasters(); Get the list of submaster nodes. TList * GetWorkers(void); Get the list of worker nodes. Bool_t ReadConfigFile(const char* confDir, const char* fileName); Read the PROOF config file and fill the master and worker list. void SetOption(TProofNodeInfo* nodeinfo, const TString& option, const TString& value); Static method to set the node info options. TProofNodeInfo * CreateNodeInfo(const TString& name); Fill out the preliminary TProofNodeInfo structure. EInfoType GetInfoType(const TString& word). TProofResourcesStatic().

This is the ROOT implementation of the Qt object communication; mechanism (see also http://www.troll.no/qt/metaobjects.html). Signals and slots are used for communication between objects.; When an object has changed in some way that might be interesting; for the outside world, it emits a signal to tell whoever is; listening. All slots that are connected to this signal will be; activated (called). It is even possible to connect a signal; directly to another signal (this will emit the second signal; immediately whenever the first is emitted.) There is no limitation; on the number of slots that can be connected to a signal.; The slots will be activated in the order they were connected; to the signal. This mechanism allows objects to be easily reused,; because the object that emits a signal does not need to know; to which objects the signals are connected.; Together, signals and slots make up a powerfull component; programming mechanism.

Source:; header file; source file; viewVC header viewVC source. Sections:; class description; function members; data members; class charts. ROOT; » CORE; » BASE; » TQCommand. class TQCommand: public TList, public TQObject. The Command design pattern is based on the idea, that all editing; in an application is done by creating instances of command objects.; Command objects apply changes to the edited object and then are; stored on a command stack. Furthermore, each command knows how to; undo its changes to bring the edited object back to its previous; state. As long as the application only uses command objects to; change the state of the edited object, it is possible to undo; a sequence of commands by traversing the command stack downwards and; calling the ""undo"" method of each command in turn. It is also; possible to redo a sequence of commands by traversing the command; stack upwards and calling the ""redo"" method of each command. Examples:. 1. Create a new command. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)""; ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 1st parameter - the name of class; 2nd parameter - object; 3rd parameter - the name of do/redo method; 4th parameter - the name of undo method. Since redo,undo methods are the same, undo name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. For objects derived from TObject class name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 2. Setting undo, redo parameters. Color_t old_color = hpx->GetFillColor();; Color_t new_color = 4; // blue color. com->SetRedoArgs(1, new_color);; com->SetUndoArgs(1, old_color);. 1st argument - the number of undo, redo parameters; the other arguments - undo, redo values. Since the number of undo,redo parameters is the same one can use. com->SetArgs(1, new_color, old_color);. 3.

ROOT; » CORE; » BASE; » TQUndoManager. class TQUndoManager: public TQCommand. The Command design pattern is based on the idea, that all editing; in an application is done by creating instances of command objects.; Command objects apply changes to the edited object and then are; stored on a command stack. Furthermore, each command knows how to; undo its changes to bring the edited object back to its previous; state. As long as the application only uses command objects to; change the state of the edited object, it is possible to undo; a sequence of commands by traversing the command stack downwards and; calling the ""undo"" method of each command in turn. It is also; possible to redo a sequence of commands by traversing the command; stack upwards and calling the ""redo"" method of each command. Examples:. 1. Create a new command. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)""; ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 1st parameter - the name of class; 2nd parameter - object; 3rd parameter - the name of do/redo method; 4th parameter - the name of undo method. Since redo,undo methods are the same, undo name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(""TH1"", hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. For objects derived from TObject class name can be omitted, e.g. TQCommand *com = new TQCommand(hpx, ""SetFillColor(Color_t)"");. 2. Setting undo, redo parameters. Color_t old_color = hpx->GetFillColor();; Color_t new_color = 4; // blue color. com->SetRedoArgs(1, new_color);; com->SetUndoArgs(1, old_color);. 1st argument - the number of undo, redo parameters; the other arguments - undo, redo values. Since the number of undo,redo parameters is the same one can use. com->SetArgs(1, new_color, old_color);. 3. Undo, redo method execution. com->Redo(); // execute ",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html534/TQUndoManager.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html534/TQUndoManager.html

When a top level object (eg Event *event) is a tree/graph of many objects,; the normal ROOT Streaming mechanism ensures that only one copy of each object; in the tree/graph is written to the output buffer to avoid circular; dependencies.; However if the object event is split into several files or into several; branches of one or more Trees, normal C++ pointers cannot be used because; each I/O operation will write the referenced objects.; When a TRef is used to point to a TObject *robj, for example in a class with; TRef fRef;; one can do:; fRef = robj; //to set the pointer; This TRef and robj can be written with two different I/O calls; in the same or different files, in the same or different branches of a Tree. If the TRef is read and the referenced object has not yet been read,; the TRef will return a null pointer. As soon as the referenced object; will be read, the TRef will point to it. If the referenced object is; contained in a TTree it can be autoloaded using the TBranchRef mechanism,; which is set up by simply calling TTree::BranchRef(). TRef also supports the complex situation where a TFile is updated; multiple times on the same machine or a different machine. How does it work. A TRef is itself a TObject with an additional transient pointer fPID.; When the statement fRef = robj is executed, the following actions happen:; - The pointer fPID is set to the current TProcessID.; - The current ObjectNumber (see below) is incremented by one.; - robj::fUniqueID is set to ObjectNumber.; - In the fPID object, the element fObjects[ObjectNumber] is set to robj; - ref::fUniqueID is also set to ObjectNumber.; After having set fRef, one can immediatly return the value of robj; using fRef.GetObject(). This function returns directly fObjects[fUniqueID]; from the fPID object. When the TRef is written, the process id number pidf of fPID is written; in addition to the TObject part of TRef (fBits,fUniqueID).; When the TRef is read, its pointer fPID is set to t",MatchSource.WIKI,root/html534/TRef.html,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://root.cern/root/html534/TRef.html
