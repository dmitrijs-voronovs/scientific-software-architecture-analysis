https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/4206#issuecomment-1740442279:61,Deployability,release,release,61,"Glad to see someone asking question on that topic. Since the release of sofapython3, I'm waiting someone having interest on that topic so we can modernize the prefab's using the added feature of sp3 and experience gained since sofapython2. . Short answers to your questions: ; - should they be located in the SofaPython3 plugin?; It is unclear to me about what you are talking about, prefab are already in SofaPython3. Are you in fact talking about the prefab that are in stlib ? ; If this is the case, it make sense to have prefab in SofaPython3 to demonstrate a ""standard"" way of doing a prefab through ""examples"", there could also have a standard prefab library, but I see no problem in having that in stlib or any other third party plugin. That's said, I don't consider the prefab in stlib mature enough for such move, first, because they are still implemented as they were back to python2 time, and up to now, not a lot of people have expressed interest in changing that to move forward; . - should we create many level of abstractions/prefabs?; From the experience in stlib there is always a trade-off between abstraction and usability and the overhead of modularization. But yes, there is always an interest in being able to build prefab from other prefab to make complex systems. . - definition of current prefabs, e.g. ElasticObject using a UniformMass?; Prefab just means you have an ""all-in-one"" object. There is no more constraint except from that. So it the choice of the one that make a prefab to decide prefabricating ""what"".

According to the history of this function in the component HexahedronCompositeFEMMapping, I would say that nobody took the time to implement it. Unfortunately, without this function, the mapping will not be able to map stiffness matrices. In the case of your example, the only contribution of a mapped stiffness matrix would come from the collision. It means that the collision forces don't contribute to the stiffness matrix, i.e. they are considered explicit. The scene may behave correctly even in this case, especially if you don't have collision. If the message bothers you, and if you build SOFA yourself, you can comment it as a temporary solution. Unfortunately, I don't know the components of your scene, so I don't know why it diverges with the liver. You can always try the usual tricks: decrease the time step size, increase the nb of CG iterations, increase the number of elements etc. Does it work with DefaultAnimationLoop? Perhaps the function `applyJT` is important after all?..

I used HOBAK for the implementation, adapting it to SOFA `TetrahedronHyperelasticityFEMForceField`. I implemented only the material. Therefore, everything outside of the material, such as matrix clamping, is not yet implemented. Note that HOBAK has also a test suite, with some similarities with mine (test derivative against finite differences).

There was no reason those two lists existed together. . Moreover, the topological change callback attached to the two `topologySubestIndices` lists was not working as expected. Springs were not removed correctly due to the fact that the `topologySubestIndices` data was not supposed to work with multiple occurrence of the same index. This was corrected in the following PR : https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4738 along with some modifications in the present one (for the callback on the forcefield side). .

If we use the `implicit=""1""` in the UniformVelocityDampingForceField from the [DampingForceField](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/blob/master/examples/Component/SolidMechanics/FEM/DampingForceField.scn) example, we find a vertex point (node ""uniform (green)"") moving according to the following equation of motion:. $$ \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + 0.1 \frac{dx}{dt} = 0 $$. Given the initial conditions:. $$ x(0) = 0 $$. $$ v(0) = \frac{dx}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = 1.0 $$. This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. To solve this, we assume a solution of the form:. $$ x(t) = Ae^{\lambda t} $$ . Taking the IC into account. $$ x(t) = 10 - 10 e^{-0.1 t} $$. Which gives the final position:. $$ x(\infty) = 10 - 10 \cdot 0 = 10 $$. Since the mass is 0.5 in the example .. $$ x(\infty) = \frac{10}{2} = 5$$ . which is now the case with this PR !; Thanks Paul",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4848#issuecomment-2263947900
