Decontracted Basis Sets¶; Decontraction of the basis set can be useful in certain situations. In; order to decontract a given basis set, simply add “-decon” to the name; of the primary basis set (e.g. decontract).; set basis cc-pvdz-decon. Obviously this will add significantly to the computational cost of any given calculation, however it can; be useful when checking the basis set dependence of a particular calculated property or in certain situations; where a large basis set is critical.

PSI4. Installation and Runtime Configuration; Compiling and Installing from Source. Compiling and Installing from Source¶; This section fulfills the duty of every Linux project to have an INSTALL; file detailing how to build it from source. Few (mostly packagers and; sysadmins) are expected to read this file as it is a broad guide to the; many choices in building this project. For a specific, well-tested,; and performance-tuned build path, see psicode.org/installs/latest; (select “source”). For pre-built binaries again well-tested,; performance-tuned, and available for all common operating systems,; see psicode.org/installs/latest (select “conda”). Planning: how to configure Psi4 and invoke CMake¶; PSI4 is built through CMake. An abbreviated build guide can be found; within the source itself .; CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer. Proceed to quick build or; detailed build. How to build and install Psi4, the compact version¶; This section outlines the main steps of configuring, compiling, and; installing PSI4.

How to configure code to use high angular momentum basis sets¶; The Libint integral code handles; arbitrary order angular momentum (AM), but compiling that is; prohibitive. The build process for Libint2 takes longer than; for Libint1, so it’s recommended to use the conda packages. The AM controlling keyword MAX_AM_ERI; has definition changed a little from Libint1.

Unless BUILD_Libint2_GENERATOR; is set to ON, an internal build of Libint2 will download a; pregenerated tarball of at least MAX_AM_ERI AM. If you; want to build completely from generator source, turn on the keyword,; but parts can only run in serial and parts benefit from parallel, so; it’s not recommended. All the AM generation settings would need to be; edited in the above CMakeLists.txt rather than passing them into; the PSI4 build directly.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code.

This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ON",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/build_planning.html

Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

What C and C++ compilers and versions are approved¶; On Linux, the following work nicely. GNU: gcc, g++; Intel: icc, icpc; Clang: clang, clang++. On Mac, the following work nicely. Apple Clang: clang, clang++; Intel: icc, icpc. PSI4 requires full C++11 compliance, meaning, most importantly, GCC; >= 4.9. This compliance is checked for at build-time with file; psi4/cmake/custom_cxxstandard.cmake, so either consult that file or; try a test build to ensure your compiler is approved. Note that Intel; compilers on Linux also rely on GCC, so both icpc and gcc versions are checked.; Intel OneAPI Classic compilers work fine. OneAPI beta compilers build but have; been only minimally tested. How to satisfy the GCC >= 4.9 requirement on Linux without updating the OS. How to obtain C and C++ compilers for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; The easiest compiler to obtain is clang which is a drop-in replacement; for gcc and g++. Just install XCode.

How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies. PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source. Examples. Build with detected compiler from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific (Intel) compiler from PATH. >>> cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort. What Fortran compilers are approved¶; On Linux and Mac, the following work nicely. GNU: gfortran; Intel: ifort. Packages to install for specific OS or package managers:. Ubuntu gfortran; conda gfortran_linux-64 or gfortran_osx-64 to get gfortran. How to obtain a Fortran compiler for Mac without Fink, MacPorts, or Homebrew¶; Xcode does not provide a Fortran compiler. A way to get one is to download; the gfortran_osx-64 conda package. This provides; gfortran compilers for Mac. The version is 4.8.5, which is quite old,; but the Fortran compiler will work. How to configure BLAS/LAPACK for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies.

How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. >>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works. Use it at your own risk and after testing your; particular distribution, including tests run multithreaded,; if you intend to run PSI4 so. Use at least 0.2.15, and; pay attention to how it was compiled - unthreaded seems safe,; openmp-threaded is mostly safe, default pthreaded is not safe.

Notes. Much of PSI4‘s speed and efficiency depends on the corresponding; speed and efficiency of the linked BLAS and LAPACK libraries; (especially the former). Consider the following recommendations:. It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works.

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h.

See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt.

Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation.

If you’re changing the PSI4 repo codebase between compiles, there’s; nothing more to do as CMake will handle the code rebuild deps for you.; If you’re changing the local Add-On repo codebase between compiles,; CMake does not know when libaddon.[a|so|dylib] needs rebuilding. It; is recommended that the PSI4 build be initially configured with; -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON (easier to notice changes). And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn. This should; re-clone the Add-On, rebuild and install it, rebuild any parts of; PSI4 that interface to it, and relink the main core.so.; If you’re modifying the Add-On’s file or directory structure, be; smart and rm all traces of it within {objdir}/stage/,; especially any *.pyc files.; Alternatively and preferentially to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the PSI4 repository. This; is especially useful if you want to avoid full recompiles of the; Add-On at each change to the Add-On’s source. Build the Add-On; library dynamically (-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON) and mind any; “Psi4 wants” in the Add-On’s top-level CMakeLists.txt. Install the; Add-On and note the full path to AddOnConfig.cmake.

How to configure code to use high angular momentum basis sets¶; The Libint integral code handles; arbitrary order angular momentum (AM), but compiling that is; prohibitive. The build process for Libint2 takes longer than; for Libint1, so it’s recommended to use the conda packages. The AM controlling keyword MAX_AM_ERI; has definition changed a little from Libint1. It is used to ensure; that conventional energies can use at least MAX_AM_ERI zeta. See; psi4//external/upstream/libint2/CMakeLists.txt for a fuller; discussion of AM capabilities. Unless BUILD_Libint2_GENERATOR; is set to ON, an internal build of Libint2 will download a; pregenerated tarball of at least MAX_AM_ERI AM. If you; want to build completely from generator source, turn on the keyword,; but parts can only run in serial and parts benefit from parallel, so; it’s not recommended. All the AM generation settings would need to be; edited in the above CMakeLists.txt rather than passing them into; the PSI4 build directly.

How to use conda to get a Psi4 development environment¶; PSI4 has a lot of dependencies, some of which are complicated; to build. Fortunately, conda can supply them all. A conda; package psi4-dev is available to gather the dependencies; and build tools needed to compiler PSI4 from source. Go to; psicode.org/installs/latest, select “source” and “nightly build” along; with Linux/Mac and a Python version. Follow its instructions to create; a conda environment that has a script psi4-path-advisor. Running; psi4-path-advisor --help shows more options. Running the script; without arguments gives a cmake command that supplies paths to dependency; conda packages to CMake’s cache. You can add further cmake options to; this command when you execute it. Once the cmake command has built your; objdir, you can build PSI4. Remember to activate this; conda environment during PSI4 running or development. There are a; few extra options to psi4-path-advisor to set up using conda’s GNU; compilers (on Linux), conda’s Clang compilers (on Mac; less reliably),; or your own Intel compilers backed by conda’s GNU compilers (on Linux).; >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git && cd psi4; >>> conda create -n p4dev psi4-dev python=3.8 -c psi4/label/dev; >>> conda activate p4dev; >>> `psi4-path-advisor --gcc`; >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable. That is, the top line of bin/psi4 is something like; #!/path/to/miniconda/envs/p4deps/bin/python3.5, and that’s the Python; through which PSI4 is running, rather than the Python of which python.; To use a different Python with PSI4 in the short term, just; path/to/desired/python psi4 on the command line to override the; shebang line. To use a different Python with PSI4 in the long term,; edit the shebang line.; If you’re using PSI4 as a Python module, then PSI4 is running; the Python of which python. How to fix “undefined symbol: _Py_FalseStruct”¶; You’re probably loading a Py3-compiled Psi4 in Py2. Switch interpreters; and re-run. A python of proper Py2 or Py3-ness is baked into the PSI4; “executable”, so you’ll see this error only for Psi4 as Python module. How to use gdb and lldb with Psi4¶; Debugging PSI4 has gotten a little confusing now that it’s running through Python. Here’s the syntax; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> lldb -- python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (lldb) run. >>> cd {objdir}; >>> gdb --args python stage/bin/psi4 ../tests/tu1-h2o-energy/input.dat; >>> (gdb) run. How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner. Issue make VERBOSE=1 to display the full; compilation commands and errors. How to highlight git merge conflicts in vi¶; Edit your ~/.vimrc file to include the lines below.

How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. See also the more general scratch documentation. How do I retain specific Psi4 scratch files¶; You can set up a specific path for PSI4 scratch file and keep them; for later use through the psi4_io handler. How to use Psi4 within a PBS queue¶; You will usually need to set up a PBS job script that is setting all; necessary environment variables, making sure the scratch directories are; set up, and invoking the executable. An example PBS script; is provided in the manual, but make sure to also consult your own PBS; documentation for appropriate setup. How to update and rebuild Psi4¶; Obtain code updates as appropriate from Binary Installer,; Clone from GitHub Repository, or Fork from GitHub Repository. Move into; objdir and reissue make or cmake --build ., whereupon CMake may reconfigure but; will only rebuild objects and libraries depending on changed files. It is; scarcely ever necessary for the user to reinvoke cmake to update; objdir based on changes to the PSI4 repository.; Upon switching conda environments, though, one should; make a new objdir since there are many full paths baked into; objdir/CMakeCache.txt.

Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation.

So it’s very possible that; from top-level-psi4-dir source directory, you can call cmake -S.; -Bobjdir without any further arguments, and it will invoke cmake,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory objdir, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; make or Ninja in the new build directory.; Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within core; dependencies and add-on dependencies to plan a set of arguments to cmake tailored to; your computer.

How to see the actual compiling commands (or errors) with cmake¶; CMake by default hides a lot of useful debugging information to make the; compilation cleaner. Issue make VERBOSE=1 to display the full; compilation commands and errors. How to highlight git merge conflicts in vi¶; Edit your ~/.vimrc file to include the lines below. Hitting the F7; key will toggle highlighting of git’s conflict markers.; >>> cat ~/.vimrc; set hlsearch; map <F7> :/\(<<<<<<<\\|=======\\|>>>>>>>\)<CR>. How to handle “runtime library may be hidden” when building with Anaconda Python¶; When building against Ana/Miniconda python (e.g., cmake; -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/conda/bin/python), the warning below often; appears. It is harmless, proceed.; CMake Warning at src/bin/psi4/CMakeLists.txt:58 (add_executable):; Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target psi4 because files in; some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:. runtime library [libm.so.6] in /usr/lib64 may be hidden by files in:; /theoryfs2/common/software/anaconda/lib. Some of these libraries may not be found correctly. How to set up the scratch directory¶; The scratch directory is where Psi4 stores potentially large files during; computation. It should thus be on a local, fast disk to minimize any; computational inefficiencies caused by I/O. The scratch directory is; commonly set up through the PSI_SCRATCH environment variable:; # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/directory/for/scratch/files.

When ctest reports that some (or all) tests have failed, look in your; build directory for file; objdir/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log. It may have a; .tmp extension, depending on whether the last test was interrupted and; a few other factors. Either way, this file should contain CMake’s testing; output, as well as everything that was printed to the screen. How to test a Psi4 installation¶; ctest requires a connection to source files and cmake; machinery and so can only be performed from objdir; (staged installation). To test an installed PSI4 (full or staged; installation), a supplementary test suite is available to be; run via pytest. Running a limited number of “smoke” tests is; generally sufficient to verify an installation. From the executable; # smoke tests only in serial; psi4 --test; # smoke tests only in parallel; psi4 --test -n`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; # most tests; psi4 --test full. From the library (PSI4 must be detectable as a Python; module. See setup at How to configure paths for PsiAPI; if needed.); # smoke tests only; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test('smoke')""; # most tests; python -c ""import psi4; psi4.test()"". From pytest directly. If package pytest-xdist is installed, can run in parallel.; # smoke tests only; pytest {prefix}/lib/{PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/psi4/tests/ -m smoke -n auto; # all tests; pytest {prefix}/lib/{PYMOD_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/psi4/tests/ -n auto. Output looks something like the below. PASSED in green is good; (means test ran correctly); SKIPPED in yellow is good (means that; not all software required for test is available); XPASS or XFAIL; in yellow is fine (unexpected pass or expected fail happens when we; include tests that need particular conditions (e.g., multiple cores); to run correctly); FAILED in red is bad.; test_addons.py::test_gdma PASSED; test_addons.py::test_mrcc SKIPPED; test_addons.py::test_chemps2 PASSED; test_addons.py::test_dftd3 PASSED; test_addons.py::tes",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/build_planning.html

It; is recommended that the PSI4 build be initially configured with; -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON (easier to notice changes). And to trigger; Add-On library rebuild, rm -rf {objdir}/external/upstream/addon/; and rm -rf {objdir}/stage/share/cmake/AddOn. This should; re-clone the Add-On, rebuild and install it, rebuild any parts of; PSI4 that interface to it, and relink the main core.so.; If you’re modifying the Add-On’s file or directory structure, be; smart and rm all traces of it within {objdir}/stage/,; especially any *.pyc files.; Alternatively and preferentially to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the PSI4 repository. This; is especially useful if you want to avoid full recompiles of the; Add-On at each change to the Add-On’s source. Build the Add-On; library dynamically (-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON) and mind any; “Psi4 wants” in the Add-On’s top-level CMakeLists.txt. Install the; Add-On and note the full path to AddOnConfig.cmake. Pass; the path containing that file to PSI4‘s CMake as; -DAddon_DIR=/path/to/config/usually/ending/in/share/cmake/AddON; and build PSI4. The main core.so should be dynamically linked; to your dev AddOn dynamic lib and update automatically when you rebuild; the AddOn lib. Naturally, you may need to delete core.so and remake; as needed. How to use logging in Psi4¶; A log file is generated alongside the output file and has extension; .log. Selected key information is sent to it. The log file contents; are provisional and haphazard, so don’t start relying upon them. It is; tentatively envisioned that log files will have much of the same results as output; files but more as structured data than narrative, nicely formatted data.; In some c",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/build_planning.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/build_planning.html

In practice, they get run; together and linked as ${LAPACK_LIBRARIES} ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}.; Sometimes the CMake’s library search capabilites falter at SONAMEs; (e.g., libblas.so.3 vs. libblas.so), extensions (static; vs. dynamic), or suffixes (e.g., libacml_mp.so vs.; libacml.so). The developers would be interested in hearing; of such problems to expand the math detection capabilities. The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h.

It is NOT wise to use the stock BLAS library provided with many; Linux distributions like RedHat, as it is usually just the completely; unoptimized netlib distribution. The choice of LAPACK is less; critical, and so the unoptimized netlib distribution is acceptable.; Perhaps the best choice, if available, is Intel’s MKL library,; which includes efficient threaded BLAS and LAPACK (as of PSI4; v1.1, earliest known working version is MKL 2013; as of v1.4,; should use at leat MKL 2019). MKL, which is; freely available through conda, is the only threaded BLAS/LAPACK; distribution fully supported by PSI4.; On Mac, the native Accelerate libraries are very nice and would; be recommended but for the potential conflict between PSI4; BLAS and NumPy BLAS. Unless you’ve a special NumPy, avoid!; The open-source LAPACK distributions OpenBLAS (formerly GotoBLAS); mostly works. Use it at your own risk and after testing your; particular distribution, including tests run multithreaded,; if you intend to run PSI4 so.

For maximum parallelism (not Windows): ctest -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`; Run full test suite: ctest; Run about a third of the tests in 5 minutes, the so-called quicktests: ctest -L quick; Run the same subset of tests that continuous integration checks (not the full test suite): ctest -L quick; Run the minimal number of tests to ensure Psi4 and any add-ons in working order: ctest -L smoke; Run tests matching by name: ctest -R testname; Run tests excluding those by name: ctest -E testname; Run tests matching by label: ctest -L testlabel; Run tests excluding those by label: ctest -LE testlabel. Pytest has similar commands:. Run tests in parallel with -n flag (if Python package pytest-xdist installed). For maximum parallelism: pytest -n auto; Run full test suite: pytest; Run the quick tests: pytest -m quick; Run the minimal number of tests to ensure Psi4 and any add-ons in working order: pytest -m smoke; Run tests matching by name: pytest -k testname; Run tests excluding those by name: pytest -k ""not testname""; Run tests matching by label: pytest -m testlabel; Run tests excluding those by label: pytest -m ""not testlabel""; Run tests with complicated filtering by name: pytest -k ""cc and not cc4 and not stdsuite""; Run tests and see test names: pytest -v; Run tests and see test names and sometimes more verbose errors: pytest -vv.

How to run Psi4 as executable after compilation using driver from source¶; When developing python driver code, it can be annoying to keep makeing to test the code.

This is an expert; option for development, and not all functionality will be available.; >>> cd {objdir}; >>> ln -s {top-level-psi4-dir}/{objdir}/stage/lib/psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so ../psi4/core.cpython-{ext_will_vary}.so; >>> python ../psi4/run_psi4.py --inplace input.dat. Why not to set PSIDATADIR¶; PSIDATADIR is an environment variable containing the location of the; text resource parts of the PSI4 codebase (e.g., basis sets,; databases, EFP fragments). It is for developer use only. In PSI4 1.1; and beyond, the program always knows where its resources are, and the; only reason to set this variable is to point to another location.; Previously in PSI4 1.0 and previous, only installed executables knew; the location, so it always needed to be explicitly set when run from the; compilation directory.; At runtime; >>> psi4 -p {top-level-psi4-dir}/psi4/share/psi4.

How to configure a Psi4 build on Cray¶; Cray systems strongly prefer to build static libraries, but PSI4; needs to be dynamic to function as a Python module. Courtesy of @misha; at the forum and various supercomputer guides, building PSI4 on; Cray requires setting environment variables before running cmake.; CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes cmake ... CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE¶; Set to allow PSI4 to build as shared library on Cray supercomputers. CRAY_ADD_RPATH¶; Set to true to allow PSI4 to build on Cray supercomputers. How to configure Fortran compilers for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, a Fortran compiler in unneeded for core; features but may be required for add-ons.; Downstream Dependencies. PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) Fortran Compiler; erd, dkh, gdma, PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran Compiler. CMake Variables. CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER — CMake variable to specify name or full path to Fortran compiler.; CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS — CMake variable to specify any additional custom compiler flags for Fortran source.

The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected. Consult file; psi4/cmake/math/MathLibs.cmake for the library patterns being; sought.; The BLAS/LAPACK interface is standardized, so only libraries, not; headers, need to be detected. The exception is MKL, where the mkl.h; header defines additional functionality; it must be located to use; BLAS threading. How to configure Python for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, Python allows the core compiled C++ code to; be flexibly accessed for manipulation and extension in an interpreted; language.; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 \(\Leftarrow\) Python Interpreter. CMake Variables; Note that in v1.4, PSI4 switched from Numpy-written CMake Python; detection to new CMake-written CMake Python detection. Usually only; Python_EXECUTABLE is now needed to hint Python’s location. See; https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html for full; guidance. Python_EXECUTABLE — specify name or full path to Python interpreter.; Python_LIBRARY — specify path to Python library.; Python_INCLUDE_DIR — specify directory of Python headers. Contains Python.h. Examples. Build with detected Python from PATH. >>> cmake. Build with specific Python. >>> cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/interp/python3.9.

What Python is Psi4 running¶; The Python detected at build-time is embedded into the PSI4; executable.

Gauss¶; Code author: Lori A. Burns; Section author: Lori A. Burns; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, Samples; PSI4 contains code to interface to the Cfour quantum chemistry suite of; John F. Stanton (U. Texas, Austin) and Jürgen Gauss (U. Mainz),; which is available after a license agreement from; http://www.cfour.de/. Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH. If PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error; will be reported. Caution; The p4c4 interface hasn’t been fully adapted for the new March 2014 version. Cfour for PSI4 Users¶. Set memory as usual; Set molecule as usual; Set basis set as usual (Cfour only cares about orbital basis, no fitting; bases); Set the task as usual, indicating Cfour as the intended code by; prepending “c4-” to the method argument. So energy('scf') becomes; energy('c4-scf') and optimize('ccsd(t)') becomes; optimize('c4-ccsd(t)'). Find available methods for; energy() at Energy (CFOUR); and for optimize() at Gradient (CFOUR).; Generally, the p4c4 interface will handle best practices for path of; execution: vcc/ecc, derivative type, etc. The user is still; responsible for setting convergence, frozen core, guess, diis, etc.; For the moment, so-called “best-practices” keywords are summarized at; Best Practices.; For the type of computation intended, find appropriate options at; Keywords.

PSI4 for Cfour Users¶; In the simplest use of the Psi4/Cfour interface, a PSI4 input file; can simply “wrap” a ZMAT file and execute xcfour.

Installation¶; Follow the instructions provided with the Cfour download to install the; executable or to build the source. To by used by PSI4, the program; binary (xcfour) must be found in your PATH or; PSIPATH. The GENBAS file containing basis sets in Cfour; format is not necessary for this interface, but if you prefer to access; basis sets the “Cfour way” using a custom GENBAS file (the distributed; one is included with the interface), it, too, must be in PATH or; PSIPATH. If PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error; will be reported. Caution; The p4c4 interface hasn’t been fully adapted for the new March 2014 version. Cfour for PSI4 Users¶. Set memory as usual; Set molecule as usual; Set basis set as usual (Cfour only cares about orbital basis, no fitting; bases); Set the task as usual, indicating Cfour as the intended code by; prepending “c4-” to the method argument.

Warning; Because p4c4 does not inspect the contents of the cfour {...}; block, once the user specifies a PSI4-style molecule, the; interface cannot judge whether a sandwich mode (drop the PSI4 molecule; and use the cfour block as the entirety of the ZMAT) or a standard mode; (translate the PSI4 molecule and append additional input from the; cfour block) is intended. The latter is what actually occurs. If; there is both a PSI4 molecule and a molecule in the cfour block,; ZMAT will end up with multiple molecules and multiple *CFOUR(...); blocks, and it will not run. Therefore, if mixing sandwich and; standard or pure-PSI4 computations in an input file, place all; the sandwich jobs at the beginning before declaring PSI4; molecules. If necessary, clear the cfour block with cfour {} before; commencing standard P4C4 jobs. Output¶; The output of xcfour invoked from a PSI4 input file is; written to the PSI4 output file as the computation progresses.

Much can be gleaned by just running; inputs and inspecting the ZMAT passed to Cfour, but when questions; arise, here are the specifics, the governing laws. Specifying a piece of input in PSI4 format is entering into; a contract that you mean it. In particular this applies to; molecule (including charge/multiplicity through molecule; optional_molecule_name {...}), memory (through memory; value unit), computational method (through .

Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda. This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH.

Make sure this shows up in your ~/.condarc file. >>> conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/psi4; # check; >>> cat ~/.condarc; channels:; - http://conda.anaconda.org/psi4; - defaults. Install PSI4. You can install into the main conda environment so that whenever commands conda or (Ana/Miniconda’s) python are available, then psi4 is available, too. >>> conda install psi4; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/bin/psi4. Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda. This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The conda activate command (conda >=4.4; December 2017) works in all shells, but if you’re using old source activate that only works for bash; adjust as needed for csh/tcsh.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> conda activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4. Configure environment. Preceding steps have placed conda and psi4 in your PATH, either permanently through rc-files or temporarily in this terminal session. You can keep or undo these changes. For general psi4 use, you must enable the psi4 executable to be found th",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/conda.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/conda.html

Detailed Installation of Miniconda¶; https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html. Detailed Installation of PSI4¶. Subscribe to PSI4. Subscribe to our channel at https://anaconda.org/psi4 that contains the PSI4 package and several dependency packages. Make sure this shows up in your ~/.condarc file. >>> conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/psi4; # check; >>> cat ~/.condarc; channels:; - http://conda.anaconda.org/psi4; - defaults. Install PSI4. You can install into the main conda environment so that whenever commands conda or (Ana/Miniconda’s) python are available, then psi4 is available, too. >>> conda install psi4; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/bin/psi4. Or, you can install into a conda environment that places PSI4 and its dependencies (including python) into a sandbox unaffected by any other software installed in Ana/Miniconda. This is recommended for developers to avoid interference between multiple versions (including github/conda versions) or to test python versions, etc.. In practical terms, installing into a conda environment means you can turn PSI4‘s availability on/off by switching conda environments without turning on/off the whole Ana/Miniconda installation. Below, PSI4 is installed into an environment called p4env. Then the environment is activated, removing the main Ana/Miniconda bin and adding envs/p4env/bin to PATH. The conda activate command (conda >=4.4; December 2017) works in all shells, but if you’re using old source activate that only works for bash; adjust as needed for csh/tcsh.; >>> conda create -n p4env psi4; >>> conda activate p4env; # check; >>> which psi4; /path/to/miniconda/envs/p4env/bin/psi4.

BASIS_FUNCTIONSThis task is useful to produce cube files of the atomic orbital basis; functions \(\chi_\mu(\mathbf{r})\). ESPCalculates the total (nuclear + electronic) electrostatic potential; \(V(\mathbf{r})\). DUAL_DESCRIPTORCalculates the dual descriptor from frontier orbitals:; \(f^2(\mathbf{r})=\rho_{\mathrm{LUMO}}(\mathbf{r})-\rho_{\mathrm{HOMO}}(\mathbf{r})\).; The dual descriptor is a good measure of nucleophilicity and electrophilicity,; containing information essentially equivalent to both Fukui functions combined.; More details on the dual descriptor itself can be found in [Morell:2005:205],; while the current implementation is described in [Martinez-Araya:2015:451].; This feature is currently only supported for closed shell systems. Note; The ESP task requires the user to specify a density-fitting basis; via the DF_BASIS_SCF keyword. Warning; It is important to specify the CUBEPROP_ORBITALS option when; dealing with large molecules to avoid running out of disk space.; For example, using the default grid spacing of; 0.2 Ångström, the size of a single cube file for a molecule like water; is of the order of 1.4 MB. For a molecule with 200 basis functions, the cube; files for all the orbitals occupy more than half a GB. Keywords¶. CUBEPROP_TASKS¶. Properties to compute.

While in the DC-06 and ODC-06 methods \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\) is derived from the density cumulant; in an approximate way (labelled by ‘06’), the DC-12 and ODC-12 methods derive this contribution exactly, and; take full advantage of the N-representability conditions (which is denoted by ‘12’). The corresponding DC and ODC methods; have similar description of the \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_1}\) N-representability, but differ in describing the orbital relaxation:; the former methods account for the relaxation only partially, while the latter fully relax the orbitals.; Both DC-06 and DC-12 methods have similar computational cost, same is true when comparing ODC-06 and ODC-12.",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/dct.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/dct.html

The DCT code can also be used to; compute the \((\lambda_3)\) energy correction that perturbatively accounts; for three-particle correlation effects, similarly to the (T) correction in coupled; cluster theory.

Generally, the use of the simultaneous algorithm together with the; AO_BASIS DISK option is recommended (set by default).; In cases when available memory is insufficient, the use of the AO_BASIS DISK option; is recommended. This will significantly reduce the memory requirements. However, when; used together with the two-step algorithm, this option can significantly; increase the cost of the energy computation.; In cases when the oscillatory convergence is observed before the DIIS; extrapolation is initialized, it is recommended to increase the threshold for; the RMS of the density cumulant or orbital update residual, below which the; DIIS extrapolation starts. This can be done by setting the; DIIS_START_CONVERGENCE option to the value greater than; \(10^{-3}\) by one or two orders of magnitude (e.g. \(10^{-2}\) or; \(10^{-1}\)). This can be particularly useful for computations using the; ODC methods, because it can greatly reduce the number of iterations.; If oscillatory convergence is observed for atoms or molecules with high; symmetry, it is recommended to use the quadratically-convergent algorithm.; When using the quadratically-convergent algorithm fo",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.6.x/dct.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.6.x/dct.html
