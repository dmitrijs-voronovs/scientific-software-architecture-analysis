The XGBoostEvidenceFilter uses a saved classifier model trained with Python code external to the GATK. This poses two main problems:; 1) The external Python code was designed for proof-of-principle and method development, not maintainability or ease of use. Additionally, GATK users and developers are assumed to be familiar with Java, not necessarily Python.; 2) The external Python code must share heterogeneous data with Java for unit/integration tests (supplying test BreakpointEvidence, expected classifier features, and expected classifier probabilities). Currently this is done via JSON files organized to (invertibly) store Pandas or Numpy objects. The resulting code to load these JSON files in on the Java side is complex.; These problems can be resolved by; 1) Replacing external python code by porting to an **experimental** tool in the GATK.; 2) Replacing JSON files with a serialization strategy currently supported by the GATK (e.g. Kryo). Additional benefits can be obtained by ensuring that the classifier-training subroutines are sufficiently general to speed development for other projects that may want to use boosted decision trees for classification.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4922

If a user creates a data source for the `hg19` reference and erroneously uses `b37` contig names, Funcotator will not produce annotations. This is correct behavior. In this case, Funcotator should detect that the data source is not `hg19-compliant` and issue a warning to the user. This can be done by checking the first record in every data source and then making sure that the contig name appears in the hg19 contig name list.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4978

Lets say we have a deletion ATTTCCCGGG -> A, where the position of A is 10. If we have a read that starts with ATTTCCCGGG, the base quality used is at the A. If the read starts with CCCGGG (note that this is informative because the deletion allele doesn't have CCCGGG and thus the read supports the ref even though it doesn't span it) it is assigned the base quality at the first C, etc. Insertions are similar. Suppose we have A -> ATTTCCCGGG. Then a read starting inside the TTTCCCGGG is informative but not spanning and gets annotated with the base quality at its first base.

I first encountered this type of error in a prototype tool I'm writing, so to dig further about what's happening, I run our simplest Spark tool&mdash;`PrintReadsSpark`. `PrintReadsSpark` reports errors when intervals are specified in a BED file (see command given in the stack trace). * Scenario 1: run with a WGS bam and give intervals via `-L PATH_TO_BED_FILE`, error is reported; * Scenario 2: run with the WGS bam and give intervals via `-L chrX:[0-9]+-[0-9]+`, no error; * Scenario 3: run with bam that is shrunk from the WGS bam by including reads only in the union of intervals, then with `-L PATH_TO_BED_FILE`, no error; * Scenario 4: run with bam that is shrunk from the WGS bam by including reads only in the union of intervals, then with `-L chrX:[0-9]+-[0-9]+`, no error; * Scenario 5: download the shrunken bam to local machine and run `PrintReadsSpark` with `-L PATH_TO_BED_FILE`, no error.

The CollectReadCounts and DetermineGermlineContigPloidy were successfull. But for the GermlineCNVCaller I got what I think is a Python ""cannot allocate memory"" error. I tried to specify to the JVM a max memory to allocate ``` --java-options ""-Xmx192G"" ``` , but no improvements.

Therefore it will be great if the whole reference genome for HG38, and maybe HG19 as well, can be included in the tests, so that tool developers spend less time worrying about hassles in moving real events to chr20 and chr21.

Currently, all annotations are of double type, but I've added code that can support all types supported by the TSV code as well. Additional tracks can also be added relatively easily. Currently, allowed annotations and their corresponding types are hardcoded; we could possibly move this information to the SAM-style header in the future. For the Umap hg19 k100 single-read mappability track and the segmental-duplication track used by the Talkowski lab, annotation of 1kb bins on hg19 takes less than a minute with the default feature lookahead (which is exposed as a parameter). I tested using the Umap multi-read mappability track (which is orders of magnitude larger, but is actually what is used in the external script), but this is much slower (documentation indicates that the single-read track should be used to dissuade this). We should evaluate whether or not using the single-read track suffices for filtering.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5162

The first is that rows are emitted into the VCF for all three positions (the variant at A's position, and two `<NON_REF>` lines at the positions for the C and T respectively).

The first set of commits rebase `ll_CollectAllelicCountsSpark` on `master`.; 2. Then there's a commit (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/21e1dcfb88fc6543f6ba3e6095eba512a33f9f8d) to fix up some changes to make `CollectAllelicCountsSpark` work on `master`.; 3.

Currently the matching is done by exact string matching. The limitation is that if I have a site with two rsIDs (as appears in the 1000 Genomes dataset), I can't filter against just one of them. For example, if I want to exclude this site from 1000G participant HG00096 (because it makes my synthetic data generator choke, if you must know):. 3523879:16	68401338	rs554836707;rs56090907	CGTGCGCTGCT	CTGCT,C	100	PASS <snip>. I have to specify `--exclude-ids 'rs554836707;rs56090907'` in my SelectVariants command. I would like to be able to specify just `--exclude-ids rs554836707` or `--exclude-ids rs56090907` with the same result (the site is excluded). Right now if I do use just one like that, the site is not excluded because the pattern fails to match. The reason I want to be able to do that is because there are several other similar sites that I need to exclude, so I make an array of rsIDs to exclude, e.g. provide . ````; Array[String] = [; ""rs575450111"",; ""rs151266607"",; ""rs557010312"",; ""rs564559134"",; ""rs560466806"",; ""rs140802196"",; ""rs554836707"",; ""rs56090907""; ]; ````. as an input to my WDL, which handles it in the command block as . --exclude-ids ${sep=' --exclude-ids ' exclusionList}. Right now I have to use . ````; [; ""'rs575450111;rs151266607'"",; ""'rs557010312;rs564559134'"",; ""'rs560466806;rs140802196'"",; ""'rs554836707;rs56090907'""; ]; ````. which is stylistically ugly and would not cover cases where only one rsID is annotated for whatever reason.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5260

This result is incorrect, since we have suddenly doubled the number of points b/w 1:100-200. #### Expected behavior; Result:; ```; CONTIG START END NUM_POINTS_COPY_RATIO type; 1 100 150 12 centromere; 1 151 200 13 ; ```; Assuming that there are 12 points in 1:100-150 and 13 points in 1:151-200",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5280

Thanks very much for looking into: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5230. I am running into one additional error. Reads that contain an insert spanning the full length of the read are causing an exception in SplitNCigarReads. ### Affected tool(s) or class(es); SplitNCigarReads. ### Affected version(s); - Tested on 4.0.3.0 and also branch: je_splitNCigarReadsSplitError (gatk-4.0.10.0-4-gb0f0ab3). ### Description ; SplitNCigarReads gives an Exception when a read that is entirely an insertion is encountered. By contrast, HaplotypeCaller does not seem to have a problem with these reads.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5299:521,Deployability,pipeline,pipeline,521,"GATK Version 4.0.9.0. What is the issue:; When using the -OBI flag in e.g. ApplyBQSR, GATK uses an inconsistent pattern for adding index extensions. When using BAM format as output:; my_file.bam; my_file.bai. When using CRAM format as output:; my_file.cram; my_file.cram.bai. Since e.g. samtools uses the second pattern for both BAM and CRAM (well, actually they have .crai, but that is a different discssion), I think it would be sensible to adopt that schema. It's not a huge deal, but I tripped over it when writing a pipeline where the user could specify the desired output format - and noticed that there is this odd difference.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5299

For example both tools have the argument `--contamination-fraction-to-filter` which has the description:. ```; Fraction of contamination in sequencing data (for all samples) to aggressively remove. If this fraction is greater is than zero, the caller will aggressively attempt to remove contamination ; through biased down-sampling of reads. Basically, it will ignore the contamination fraction of reads for ; each alternate allele. So if the pileup contains N total bases, then we will try to remove ; (N * contamination fraction) bases for each alternate allele.; ```. This argument definitely doesn't do anything in `FilteMutectCalls` but I also don't think it's hooked up to do anything in `Mutect2` either (at least when I tried giving it a high value I still got the same calls).

Additionally, omitting the genotypes also runs without error:; ```; ##fileformat=VCFv4.1; ##FORMAT=<ID=GT,Number=1,Type=String,Description=""Genotype"">; #CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER	INFO; 22	27658738	rs145982391	G	GGTTT,GGTTTGTTT	.	PASS	.; 22	27658738	rs374358960	GGTTTGTTT	G	.	PASS	.; ```; So it seems to be the combination of the split-record multiallelic and genotypes in `--alleles` file that is problematic here. Probably an edge case by most definitions (and straightforward to work around by either omitting genotypes or condensing multiallelics into a single record) but I figured it was worth pointing out. I should probably also add that many other split multiallelics seem to be processed fine, without crash, e.g.:; ```; ##fileformat=VCFv4.1; ##FORMAT=<ID=GT,Number=1,Type=String,Description=""Genotype"">; #CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER	INFO	FORMAT	HG00096	HG00097	HG00099	HG00100	HG00101	HG00102	HG00103	HG00105	HG00106	HG00107	HG00108	HG00109	HG00110	HG00111	HG00112	HG00113	HG00114	HG00115	HG00116	HG00117	HG00118	HG00119	",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5355

This will cause the parser to fail because it will not be able to get the correct line from the header. This is a bit of a pathological case (I can't currently see a good reason to funcotate a VCF twice), but since this behavior is valid it should be accounted for. The primary issue is how to resolve the two funcotation sets. Ideally we would leave them both in and somehow version them (to preserve all the information). Alternatively we can append to the existing funcotation list.

The offending code lines:. **HaplotypeCallerGenotypingEngine.java ln171**:. ```java; ReadLikelihoods<Allele> readAlleleLikelihoods = readLikelihoods.marginalize(alleleMapper, ; new SimpleInterval(mergedVC).expandWithinContig(ALLELE_EXTENSION, header.getSequenceDictionary()));; if (configuration.isSampleContaminationPresent()) {; readAlleleLikelihoods.contaminationDownsampling(configuration.getSampleContamination());; }. ```; The code above decides the involvement in PL calculations. Notice that ```ALLELE_EXTENSION``` is set to ```2```. . For the AD/DP and so on the code responsible is in **AssemblyBasedCallerGenotypingEngine.java ln366**:. ```; // Otherwise (else part) we need to do it again.; if (configuration.useFilteredReadMapForAnnotations || !configuration.isSampleContaminationPresent()) {; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations = readAlleleLikelihoodsForGenotyping;; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations.filterToOnlyOverlappingReads(loc);; } else {; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations = readHaplotypeLikelihoods.marginalize(alleleMapper, loc);; if (emitReferenceConfidence) {; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations.addNonReferenceAllele(Allele.NON_REF_ALLELE);; }; }. ```. The ```filterToOnlyOverlappingReads(loc)``` is called then the overlap criterion is strict. (e.g. 0bp padding).

Often the GQ should be 99 as the DP >40. This seems to be primarily an issue with homozygous reference calls. .

This seems to be primarily an issue with homozygous reference calls. . The GT is accurate for the high DP sites but the inaccurate GQ is problematic for any genotype level qc on the pVCF. If the site is recoded from 0/0 to './.' for GQ <20, the result is higher missing rate due to the inaccurate GQ=0. . Directly calling the VCF with HaplotypeCaller without the gVCF intermediate gVCF file calculates the correct GQ score. Freebayes also calculates a correct GQ on these samples.; [rs429358_gq_dp.pdf](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/2612419/rs429358_gq_dp.pdf). #### Steps to reproduce.

Call with GT='0/0, GQ=0 and DP >40.; cram 2. Call with GT='0/1' or '1/1' and DP>20. . Create vcf with two approaches:. Pipeline 1. HaplotypeCaller-->vcf. module load gatk/4.0.11.0; gatk HaplotypeCaller -R /restricted/projectnb/casa/ref/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa\; -I gq0_cram.list\; -L chr19:44907684-44909822\; --use-new-qual-calculator\; -O good.vcf.gz. Good GQ scores were also estimated with Freebayes on these samples also. Pipeline 2 HaplotypeCaller --> bvcf--->ImportVCF-->GenotypeVCF-->VCF with 2 samples. gatk HaplotypeCaller -R /restricted/projectnb/casa/ref/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa\; -I $sample.cram\; --use-new-qual-calculator\; -L chr19:44907684-44909822\; -ERC GVCF\; -O bad.g.vcf.gz. Followed by import and GenotypeVCF. . #### Expected behavior; Pipeline 2 should generate accurate GQ scores that match the GQ in the HaplotypeCaller vcf output of pipeline 1. Instead GQ=0. . This is the output for the 57 GQ=0 samples with pipeline 1 which is accurate.

This PR moves the referenced args into `MarkDuplicatesSparkArgumentCollection`, which resolves the compile time and parse time issues, but these args aren't actually honored in the other contexts, so this may not be the right fix.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5538

MT calling takes about 40 minutes in GVCF mode and 5 minutes without ref conf. Ideas for optimization include:; - Reducing the convergence threshold for `alleleFractionsPosterior` method (my initial attempts here didn't make a big improvement); - Using a simplified likelihoods model for reference sites (similar to `lnLikelihoodRatio` used for active region determination); - Keeping LOD calculation from active region determination and only calculating it once,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5561

Although there is no reason for the alignment of haplotypes to the reference to use the same parameters, it seems like we are similarly favoring indels too much. There is a forum discussion to this effect:. https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/23230/gatk-haplotypecaller-mnp-output-problem. Here are the parameters we use:. * match: 200; * substitution: -150; * indel start: -260; * indel extend: -11. These parameters, which are essentially a prior on biological variation, prefer an indel, with a cost of 260, to a SNP, with a cost of 350. This does not seem correct. It almost never comes up because the correct alignment is usually unambiguous, but when it does, shouldn't we break the tie in favor of the SNP?",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564
