Conservative garbage collection is attractive because it does not require any; special compiler support, but it does have problems. In particular, because the; conservative garbage collector cannot *know* that a particular word in the; machine is a pointer, it cannot move live objects in the heap (preventing the; use of compacting and generational GC algorithms) and it can occasionally suffer; from memory leaks due to integer values that happen to point to objects in the; program. In addition, some aggressive compiler transformations can break; conservative garbage collectors (though these seem rare in practice). Accurate garbage collectors do not suffer from any of these problems, but they; can suffer from degraded scalar optimization of the program. In particular,; because the runtime must be able to identify and update all pointers active in; the program, some optimizations are less effective.

LLVM IR Features; ================. This section describes the garbage collection facilities provided by the; :doc:`LLVM intermediate representation <LangRef>`. The exact behavior of these; IR features is specified by the selected :ref:`GC strategy description; <plugin>`. Specifying GC code generation: ``gc ""...""``; -------------------------------------------. .. code-block:: text. define <returntype> @name(...) gc ""name"" { ... }. The ``gc`` function attribute is used to specify the desired GC strategy to the; compiler. Its programmatic equivalent is the ``setGC`` method of ``Function``. Setting ``gc ""name""`` on a function triggers a search for a matching subclass; of GCStrategy. Some collector strategies are built in. You can add others; using either the loadable plugin mechanism, or by patching your copy of LLVM.; It is the selected GC strategy which defines the exact nature of the code; generated to support GC. If none is found, the compiler will raise an error. Specifying the GC style on a per-function basis allows LLVM to link together; programs that use different garbage collection algorithms (or none at all). .. _gcroot:. Identifying GC roots on the stack; ----------------------------------. LLVM currently supports two different mechanisms for describing references in; compiled code at safepoints. ``llvm.gcroot`` is the older mechanism;; ``gc.statepoint`` has been added more recently. At the moment, you can choose; either implementation (on a per :ref:`GC strategy <plugin>` basis). Longer; term, we will probably either migrate away from ``llvm.gcroot`` entirely, or; substantially merge their implementations. Note that most new development; work is focused on ``gc.statepoint``.

Using ``llvm.gcwrite``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. .. code-block:: llvm. void @llvm.gcroot(i8** %ptrloc, i8* %metadata). The ``llvm.gcroot`` intrinsic is used to inform LLVM that a stack variable; references an object on the heap and is to be tracked for garbage collection.; The exact impact on generated code is specified by the Function's selected; :ref:`GC strategy <plugin>`. All calls to ``llvm.gcroot`` **must** reside; inside the first basic block. The first argument **must** be a value referring to an alloca instruction or a; bitcast of an alloca. The second contains a pointer to metadata that should be; associated with the pointer, and **must** be a constant or global value; address. If your target collector uses tags, use a null pointer for metadata. A compiler which performs manual SSA construction **must** ensure that SSA; values representing GC references are stored in to the alloca passed to the; respective ``gcroot`` before every call site and reloaded after every call.; A compiler which uses mem2reg to raise imperative code using ``alloca`` into; SSA form need only add a call to ``@llvm.gcroot`` for those variables which; are pointers into the GC heap. It is also important to mark intermediate values with ``llvm.gcroot``. For; example, consider ``h(f(), g())``. Beware leaking the result of ``f()`` in the; case that ``g()`` triggers a collection. Note, that stack variables must be; initialized and marked with ``llvm.gcroot`` in function's prologue. The ``%metadata`` argument can be used to avoid requiring heap objects to have; 'isa' pointers or tag bits.

Copying; As reachability analysis proceeds, the collector copies objects from one heap; area to another, compacting them in the process. Copying collectors enable; highly efficient ""bump pointer"" allocation and can improve locality of; reference. Incremental; (Including generational collectors.) Incremental collectors generally have all; the properties of a copying collector (regardless of whether the mature heap; is compacting), but bring the added complexity of requiring write barriers. Threaded; Denotes a multithreaded mutator; the collector must still stop the mutator; (""stop the world"") before beginning reachability analysis. Stopping a; multithreaded mutator is a complicated problem. It generally requires highly; platform-specific code in the runtime, and the production of carefully; designed machine code at safe points. Concurrent; In this technique, the mutator and the collector run concurrently, with the; goal of eliminating pause times. In a *cooperative* collector, the mutator; further aids with collection should a pause occur, allowing collection to take; advantage of multiprocessor hosts. The ""stop the world"" problem of threaded; collectors is generally still present to a limited extent. Sophisticated; marking algorithms are necessary. Read barriers may be necessary.

If the ``llvm.gcroot`` intrinsic is eliminated before code generation by a; custom lowering pass, LLVM will compute an empty stack map. This may be useful; for collector plugins which implement reference counting or a shadow stack. .. _init-roots:. Initializing roots to null; ---------------------------. It is recommended that frontends initialize roots explicitly to avoid; potentially confusing the optimizer. This prevents the GC from visiting; uninitialized pointers, which will almost certainly cause it to crash. As a fallback, LLVM will automatically initialize each root to ``null``; upon entry to the function. Support for this mode in code generation is; largely a legacy detail to keep old collector implementations working. Custom lowering of intrinsics; ------------------------------. For GCs which use barriers or unusual treatment of stack roots, the; implementor is responsibly for providing a custom pass to lower the; intrinsics with the desired semantics.

The ``gc`` function attribute is used to specify the desired GC strategy to the; compiler. Its programmatic equivalent is the ``setGC`` method of ``Function``. Setting ``gc ""name""`` on a function triggers a search for a matching subclass; of GCStrategy. Some collector strategies are built in. You can add others; using either the loadable plugin mechanism, or by patching your copy of LLVM.; It is the selected GC strategy which defines the exact nature of the code; generated to support GC.

It is also important to mark intermediate values with ``llvm.gcroot``. For; example, consider ``h(f(), g())``. Beware leaking the result of ``f()`` in the; case that ``g()`` triggers a collection.

Built In GC Strategies; ======================. LLVM includes built in support for several varieties of garbage collectors. The Shadow Stack GC; ----------------------. To use this collector strategy, mark your functions with:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(""shadow-stack"");. Unlike many GC algorithms which rely on a cooperative code generator to compile; stack maps, this algorithm carefully maintains a linked list of stack roots; [:ref:`Henderson2002 <henderson02>`]. This so-called ""shadow stack"" mirrors the; machine stack. Maintaining this data structure is slower than using a stack map; compiled into the executable as constant data, but has a significant portability; advantage because it requires no special support from the target code generator,; and does not require tricky platform-specific code to crawl the machine stack. The tradeoff for this simplicity and portability is:. * High overhead per function call. * Not thread-safe. Still, it's an easy way to get started. After your compiler and runtime are up; and running, writing a :ref:`plugin <plugin>` will allow you to take advantage; of :ref:`more advanced GC features <collector-algos>` of LLVM in order to; improve performance. The shadow stack doesn't imply a memory allocation algorithm. A semispace; collector or building atop ``malloc`` are great places to start, and can be; implemented with very little code. When it comes time to collect, however, your runtime needs to traverse the stack; roots, and for this it needs to integrate with the shadow stack. Luckily, doing; so is very simple. (This code is heavily commented to help you understand the; data structure, but there are only 20 lines of meaningful code.). .. code-block:: c++. /// The map for a single function's stack frame.

Mark-Sweep; When the heap is exhausted, the collector marks reachable objects starting; from the roots, then deallocates unreachable objects in a sweep phase. Copying; As reachability analysis proceeds, the collector copies objects from one heap; area to another, compacting them in the process. Copying collectors enable; highly efficient ""bump pointer"" allocation and can improve locality of; reference. Incremental; (Including generational collectors.) Incremental collectors generally have all; the properties of a copying collector (regardless of whether the mature heap; is compacting), but bring the added complexity of requiring write barriers. Threaded; Denotes a multithreaded mutator; the collector must still stop the mutator; (""stop the world"") before beginning reachability analysis. Stopping a; multithreaded mutator is a complicated problem. It generally requires highly; platform-specific code in the runtime, and the production of carefully; designed machine code at safe points. Concurrent; In this technique, the mutator and the collector run concurrently, with the; goal of eliminating pause times. In a *cooperative* collector, the mutator; further aids with collection should a pause occur, allowing collection to take; advantage of multiprocessor hosts. The ""stop the world"" problem of threaded; collectors is generally still present to a limited extent. Sophisticated; marking algorithms are necessary. Read barriers may be necessary. As the matrix indicates, LLVM's garbage collection infrastructure is already; suitable for a wide variety of collectors, but does not currently extend to; multithreaded programs.

Reading and writing references in the heap; ------------------------------------------. Some collectors need to be informed when the mutator (the program that needs; garbage collection) either reads a pointer from or writes a pointer to a field; of a heap object. The code fragments inserted at these points are called *read; barriers* and *write barriers*, respectively. The amount of code that needs to; be executed is usually quite small and not on the critical path of any; computation, so the overall performance impact of the barrier is tolerable. Barriers often require access to the *object pointer* rather than the *derived; pointer* (which is a pointer to the field within the object). Accordingly,; these intrinsics take both pointers as separate arguments for completeness. In; this snippet, ``%object`` is the object pointer, and ``%derived`` is the derived; pointer:. .. code-block:: llvm. ;; An array type.; %class.Array = type { %class.Object, i32, [0 x %class.Object*] }; ... ;; Load the object pointer from a gcroot.; %object = load %class.Array** %object_addr. ;; Compute the derived pointer.; %derived = getelementptr %object, i32 0, i32 2, i32 %n. LLVM does not enforce this relationship between the object and derived pointer; (although a particular :ref:`collector strategy <plugin>` might). However, it; would be an unusual collector that violated it. The use of these intrinsics is naturally optional if the target GC does not; require the corresponding barrier. The GC strategy used with such a collector; should replace the intrinsic calls with the corresponding ``load`` or; ``store`` instruction",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst

If none of the built in GC strategy descriptions met your needs above, you will; need to define a custom GCStrategy and possibly, a custom LLVM pass to perform; lowering. Your best example of where to start defining a custom GCStrategy; would be to look at one of the built in strategies. You may be able to structure this additional code as a loadable plugin library.; Loadable plugins are sufficient if all you need is to enable a different; combination of built in functionality, but if you need to provide a custom; lowering pass, you will need to build a patched version of LLVM. If you think; you need a patched build, please ask for advice on llvm-dev. There may be an; easy way we can extend the support to make it work for your use case without; requiring a custom build. Collector Requirements; ----------------------. You should be able to leverage any existing collector library that includes the following elements:. #. A memory allocator which exposes an allocation function your compiled; code can call. #. A binary format for the stack map. A stack map describes the location; of references at a safepoint and is used by precise collectors to identify; references within a stack frame on the machine stack.

Implementing a collector plugin; -------------------------------. User code specifies which GC code generation to use with the ``gc`` function; attribute or, equivalently, with the ``setGC`` method of ``Function``. To implement a GC plugin, it is necessary to subclass ``llvm::GCStrategy``,; which can be accomplished in a few lines of boilerplate code. LLVM's; infrastructure provides access to several important algorithms. For an; uncontroversial collector, all that remains may be to compile LLVM's computed; stack map to assembly code (using the binary representation expected by the; runtime library). This can be accomplished in about 100 lines of code. This is not the appropriate place to implement a garbage collected heap or a; garbage collector itself. That code should exist in the language's runtime; library. The compiler plugin is responsible for generating code which conforms; to the binary interface defined by library, most essentially the :ref:`stack map; <stack-map>`. To subclass ``llvm::GCStrategy`` and register it with the compiler:. .. code-block:: c++. // lib/MyGC/MyGC.cpp - Example LLVM GC plugin. #include ""llvm/CodeGen/GCStrategy.h""; #include ""llvm/CodeGen/GCMetadata.h""; #include ""llvm/Support/Compiler.h"". using namespace llvm;. namespace {; class LLVM_LIBRARY_VISIBILITY MyGC : public GCStrategy {; public:; MyGC() {}; };.

This will be added in the future as there is; interest. .. _stack-map:. Computing stack maps; --------------------. LLVM automatically computes a stack map. One of the most important features; of a ``GCStrategy`` is to compile this information into the executable in; the binary representation expected by the runtime library. The stack map consists of the location and identity of each GC root in the; each function in the module. For each root:. * ``RootNum``: The index of the root. * ``StackOffset``: The offset of the object relative to the frame pointer. * ``RootMetadata``: The value passed as the ``%metadata`` parameter to the; ``@llvm.gcroot`` intrinsic. Also, for the function as a whole:. * ``getFrameSize()``: The overall size of the function's initial stack frame,; not accounting for any dynamic allocation. * ``roots_size()``: The count of roots in the function. To access the stack map, use ``GCFunctionMetadata::roots_begin()`` and; -``end()`` from the :ref:`GCMetadataPrinter <assembly>`:. .. code-block:: c++. for (iterator I = begin(), E = end(); I != E; ++I) {; GCFunctionInfo *FI = *I;; unsigned FrameSize = FI->getFrameSize();; size_t RootCount = FI->roots_size();. for (GCFunctionInfo::roots_iterator RI = FI->roots_begin(),; RE = FI->roots_end();; RI != RE; ++RI) {; int RootNum = RI->Num;; int RootStackOffset = RI->StackOffset;; Constant *RootMetadata = RI->Metadata;; }; }. If the ``llvm.gcroot`` intrinsic is eliminated before code generation by a; custom lowering pass, LLVM will compute an empty stack map. This may be useful; for collector plugins which implement reference counting or a shadow stack. .. _init-roots:. Initializing roots to null; ---------------------------. It is recommended that frontends initialize roots explicitly to avoid; potentially confusing the optimizer. This prevents the GC from visiting; uninitialized pointers, which will almost certainly cause it to crash.

The AsmWriter will look; for such a subclass if the ``GCStrategy`` sets ``UsesMetadata``:. .. code-block:: c++. MyGC::MyGC() {; UsesMetadata = true;; }.

Note that LLVM does not currently have analogous APIs to support code generation; in the JIT, nor using the object writers. .. code-block:: c++. // lib/MyGC/MyGCPrinter.cpp - Example LLVM GC printer. #include ""llvm/CodeGen/GCMetadataPrinter.h""; #include ""llvm/Support/Compiler.h"". using namespace llvm;. namespace {; class LLVM_LIBRARY_VISIBILITY MyGCPrinter : public GCMetadataPrinter {; public:; virtual void beginAssembly(AsmPrinter &AP);. virtual void finishAssembly(AsmPrinter &AP);; };.

Built In GC Strategies; ======================. LLVM includes built in support for several varieties of garbage collectors. The Shadow Stack GC; ----------------------. To use this collector strategy, mark your functions with:. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(""shadow-stack"");. Unlike many GC algorithms which rely on a cooperative code generator to compile; stack maps, this algorithm carefully maintains a linked list of stack roots; [:ref:`Henderson2002 <henderson02>`]. This so-called ""shadow stack"" mirrors the; machine stack. Maintaining this data structure is slower than using a stack map; compiled into the executable as constant data, but has a significant portability; advantage because it requires no special support from the target code generator,; and does not require tricky platform-specific code to crawl the machine stack. The tradeoff for this simplicity and portability is:. * High overhead per function call. * Not thread-safe. Still, it's an easy way to get started. After your compiler and runtime are up; and running, writing a :ref:`plugin <plugin>` will allow you to take advantage; of :ref:`more advanced GC features <collector-algos>` of LLVM in order to; improve performance. The shadow stack doesn't imply a memory allocation algorithm. A semispace; collector or building atop ``malloc`` are great places to start, and can be; implemented with very little code. When it comes time to collect, however, your runtime needs to traverse the stack; roots, and for this it needs to integrate with the shadow stack. Luckily, doing; so is very simple. (This code is heavily commented to help you understand the; data structure, but there are only 20 lines of meaningful code.). .. code-block:: c++. /// The map for a single function's stack frame.

The 'Erlang' and 'Ocaml' GCs; -----------------------------. LLVM ships with two example collectors which leverage the ``gcroot``; mechanisms. To our knowledge, these are not actually used by any language; runtime, but they do provide a reasonable starting point for someone interested; in writing an ``gcroot`` compatible GC plugin. In particular, these are the; only in tree examples of how to produce a custom binary stack map format using; a ``gcroot`` strategy. As there names imply, the binary format produced is intended to model that; used by the Erlang and OCaml compilers respectively. .. _statepoint_example_gc:. The Statepoint Example GC; -------------------------. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(""statepoint-example"");. This GC provides an example of how one might use the infrastructure provided; by ``gc.statepoint``. This example GC is compatible with the; :ref:`PlaceSafepoints` and :ref:`RewriteStatepointsForGC` utility passes; which simplify ``gc.statepoint`` sequence insertion. If you need to build a; custom GC strategy around the ``gc.statepoints`` mechanisms, it is recommended; that you use this one as a starting point. This GC strategy does not support read or write barriers. As a result, these; intrinsics are lowered to normal loads and stores. The stack map format generated by this GC strategy can be found in the; :ref:`stackmap-section` using a format documented :ref:`here; <statepoint-stackmap-format>`. This format is intended to be the standard; format supported by LLVM going forward. The CoreCLR GC; -------------------------. .. code-block:: c++. F.setGC(""coreclr"");. This GC leverages the ``gc.statepoint`` mechanism to support the; `CoreCLR <https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr>`__ runtime. Support for this GC strategy is a work in progress.

More specifically:. * ``llvm.gcread`` calls are replaced with the corresponding ``load``; instruction. * ``llvm.gcwrite`` calls are replaced with the corresponding ``store``; instruction. * No safe points are added to the code. * The stack map is not compiled into the executable. Using the LLVM makefiles, this code; can be compiled as a plugin using a simple makefile:. .. code-block:: make. # lib/MyGC/Makefile.

Introduction; ============. This document seeks to dispel the mystery and confusion surrounding LLVM's; `GetElementPtr <LangRef.html#getelementptr-instruction>`_ (GEP) instruction.; Questions about the wily GEP instruction are probably the most frequently; occurring questions once a developer gets down to coding with LLVM. Here we lay; out the sources of confusion and show that the GEP instruction is really quite; simple. Address Computation; ===================. When people are first confronted with the GEP instruction, they tend to relate; it to known concepts from other programming paradigms, most notably C array; indexing and field selection. GEP closely resembles C array indexing and field; selection, however it is a little different and this leads to the following; questions. What is the first index of the GEP instruction?; -----------------------------------------------. Quick answer: The index stepping through the second operand. The confusion with the first index usually arises from thinking about the; GetElementPtr instruction as if it was a C index operator. They aren't the; same. For example, when we write, in ""C"":. .. code-block:: c++. AType *Foo;; ...; X = &Foo->F;. it is natural to think that there is only one index, the selection of the field; ``F``. However, in this example, ``Foo`` is a pointer. That pointer; must be indexed explicitly in LLVM. C, on the other hand, indices through it; transparently. To arrive at the same address location as the C code, you would; provide the GEP instruction with two index operands. The first operand indexes; through the pointer; the second operand indexes the field ``F`` of the; structure, just as if you wrote:. .. code-block:: c++. X = &Foo[0].F;.

With ptrtoint, you have to pick an integer type.

The; function argument ``P`` will be the second operand of each of these GEP; instructions. The third operand indexes through that pointer. The fourth; operand will be the field offset into the ``struct munger_struct`` type, for; either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field. So, in LLVM assembly the ``munge`` function; looks like:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @munge(ptr %P) {; entry:; %tmp = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 1, i32 0; %tmp1 = load i32, ptr %tmp; %tmp2 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 2, i32 1; %tmp3 = load i32, ptr %tmp2; %tmp4 = add i32 %tmp3, %tmp1; %tmp5 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 0, i32 0; store i32 %tmp4, ptr %tmp5; ret void; }.

Can I do type-based alias analysis on LLVM IR?; ----------------------------------------------. You can't do type-based alias analysis using LLVM's built-in type system,; because LLVM has no restrictions on mixing types in addressing, loads or stores. LLVM's type-based alias analysis pass uses metadata to describe a different type; system (such as the C type system), and performs type-based aliasing on top of; that.

If the GEP lacks the ``inbounds`` keyword, the value is the result from; evaluating the implied two's complement integer computation. However, since; there's no guarantee of where an object will be allocated in the address space,; such values have limited meaning. If the GEP has the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value is ``poison``; if the GEP overflows (i.e. wraps around the end of the address space). As such, there are some ramifications of this for inbounds GEPs: scales implied; by array/vector/pointer indices are always known to be ""nsw"" since they are; signed values that are scaled by the element size. These values are also; allowed to be negative (e.g. ""``gep i32, ptr %P, i32 -1``"") but the pointer; itself is logically treated as an unsigned value. This means that GEPs have an; asymmetric relation between the pointer base (which is treated as unsigned) and; the offset applied to it (which is treated as signed). The result of the; additions within the offset calculation cannot have signed overflow, but when; applied to the base pointer, there can be signed overflow.

Why do struct member indices always use ``i32``?; ------------------------------------------------. The specific type i32 is probably just a historical artifact, however it's wide; enough for all practical purposes, so there's been no need to change it. It; doesn't necessarily imply i32 address arithmetic; it's just an identifier which; identifies a field in a struct. Requiring that all struct indices be the same; reduces the range of possibilities for cases where two GEPs are effectively the; same but have distinct operand types. What's an uglygep?; ------------------. Some LLVM optimizers operate on GEPs by internally lowering them into more; primitive integer expressions, which allows them to be combined with other; integer expressions and/or split into multiple separate integer expressions. If; they've made non-trivial changes, translating back into LLVM IR can involve; reverse-engineering the structure of the addressing in order to fit it into the; static type of the original first operand. It isn't always possibly to fully; reconstruct this structure; sometimes the underlying addressing doesn't; correspond with the static type at all. In such cases the optimizer instead will; emit a GEP with the base pointer casted to a simple address-unit pointer, using; the name ""uglygep"".

First, there's the array type which comes from the (static) type of the first; operand to the GEP. Indices greater than the number of elements in the; corresponding static array type are valid. There is no problem with out of; bounds indices in this sense. Indexing into an array only depends on the size of; the array element, not the number of elements. A common example of how this is used is arrays where the size is not known.; It's common to use array types with zero length to represent these. The fact; that the static type says there are zero elements is irrelevant; it's perfectly; valid to compute arbitrary element indices, as the computation only depends on; the size of the array element, not the number of elements. Note that zero-sized; arrays are not a special case here. This sense is unconnected with ``inbounds`` keyword. The ``inbounds`` keyword is; designed to describe low-level pointer arithmetic overflow conditions, rather; than high-level array indexing rules. Analysis passes which wish to understand array indexing should not assume that; the static array type bounds are respected. The second sense of being out of bounds is computing an address that's beyond; the actual underlying allocated object. With the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value of the GEP is ``poison`` if the; address is outside the actual underlying allocated object and not the address; one-past-the-end. Without the ``inbounds`` keyword, there are no restrictions on computing; out-of-bounds addresses. Obviously, performing a load or a store requires an; address of allocated and sufficiently aligned memory.

The second sense of being out of bounds is computing an address that's beyond; the actual underlying allocated object. With the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value of the GEP is ``poison`` if the; address is outside the actual underlying allocated object and not the address; one-past-the-end. Without the ``inbounds`` keyword, there are no restrictions on computing; out-of-bounds addresses. Obviously, performing a load or a store requires an; address of allocated and sufficiently aligned memory. But the GEP itself is only; concerned with computing addresses. Can array indices be negative?; ------------------------------. Yes. This is basically a special case of array indices being out of bounds. Can I compare two values computed with GEPs?; --------------------------------------------. Yes. If both addresses are within the same allocated object, or; one-past-the-end, you'll get the comparison result you expect. If either is; outside of it, integer arithmetic wrapping may occur, so the comparison may not; be meaningful. Can I do GEP with a different pointer type than the type of the underlying object?; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Yes. There are no restrictions on bitcasting a pointer value to an arbitrary; pointer type. The types in a GEP serve only to define the parameters for the; underlying integer computation. They need not correspond with the actual type of; the underlying object. Furthermore, loads and stores don't have to use the same types as the type of; the underlying object. Types in this context serve only to specify memory size; and alignment. Beyond that there are merely a hint to the optimizer indicating; how the value will likely be used. Can I cast an object's address to integer and add it to null?; -------------------------------------------------------------. You can compute an address that way, but if you use GEP to do the add, you can't; use that pointer to actually acce",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst

Can I do type-based alias analysis on LLVM IR?; ----------------------------------------------. You can't do type-based alias analysis using LLVM's built-in type system,; because LLVM has no restrictions on mixing types in addressing, loads or stores. LLVM's type-based alias analysis pass uses metadata to describe a different type; system (such as the C type system), and performs type-based aliasing on top of; that. Further details are in the; `language reference <LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_. What happens if a GEP computation overflows?; --------------------------------------------. If the GEP lacks the ``inbounds`` keyword, the value is the result from; evaluating the implied two's complement integer computation. However, since; there's no guarantee of where an object will be allocated in the address space,; such values have limited meaning. If the GEP has the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value is ``poison``; if the GEP overflows (i.e. wraps around the end of the address space). As such, there are some ramifications of this for inbounds GEPs: scales implied; by array/vector/pointer indices are always known to be ""nsw"" since they are; signed values that are scaled by the element size. These values are also; allowed to be negative (e.g. ""``gep i32, ptr %P, i32 -1``"") but the pointer; itself is logically treated as an unsigned value. This means that GEPs have an; asymmetric relation between the pointer base (which is treated as unsigned) and; the offset applied to it (which is treated as signed). The result of the; additions within the offset calculation cannot have signed overflow, but when; applied to the base pointer, there can be signed overflow. How can I tell if my front-end is following the rules?; ------------------------------------------------------. There is currently no checker for the getelementptr rules. Currently, the only; way to do this is to manually check each place in your front-end where; GetElementPtr operators are cre",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst

The; function argument ``P`` will be the second operand of each of these GEP; instructions. The third operand indexes through that pointer. The fourth; operand will be the field offset into the ``struct munger_struct`` type, for; either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field. So, in LLVM assembly the ``munge`` function; looks like:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @munge(ptr %P) {; entry:; %tmp = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 1, i32 0; %tmp1 = load i32, ptr %tmp; %tmp2 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 2, i32 1; %tmp3 = load i32, ptr %tmp2; %tmp4 = add i32 %tmp3, %tmp1; %tmp5 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct, ptr %P, i32 0, i32 0; store i32 %tmp4, ptr %tmp5; ret void; }.

For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. %MyStruct = external global { ptr, i32 }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { ptr, i32 }, ptr %MyStruct, i64 0, i32 1. The GEP above yields a ``ptr`` by indexing the ``i32`` typed field of the; structure ``%MyStruct``. When people first look at it, they wonder why the ``i64; 0`` index is needed. However, a closer inspection of how globals and GEPs work; reveals the need. Becoming aware of the following facts will dispel the; confusion:. #. The type of ``%MyStruct`` is *not* ``{ ptr, i32 }`` but rather ``ptr``.; That is, ``%MyStruct`` is a pointer (to a structure), not a structure itself. #. Point #1 is evidenced by notic",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst

Point #1 is evidenced by noticing the type of the second operand of the GEP; instruction (``%MyStruct``) which is ``ptr``. #. The first index, ``i64 0`` is required to step over the global variable; ``%MyStruct``. Since the second argument to the GEP instruction must always; be a value of pointer type, the first index steps through that pointer. A; value of 0 means 0 elements offset from that pointer. #. The second index, ``i32 1`` selects the second field of the structure (the; ``i32``). What is dereferenced by GEP?; ----------------------------. Quick answer: nothing. The GetElementPtr instruction dereferences nothing. That is, it doesn't access; memory in any way. That's what the Load and Store instructions are for. GEP is; only involved in the computation of addresses. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, ptr }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, ptr }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1; %arr = load ptr, ptr %idx; %idx = getelementptr [40 x i32], ptr %arr, i64 0, i64 17. In this example, we have a global variable, ``@MyVar``, which is a pointer to; a structure containing a pointer. Let's assume that this inner pointer points; to an array of type ``[40 x i32]``. The above IR will first compute the address; of the inner pointer, then load the pointer, and then compute the address of; the 18th array element. This cannot be expressed in a single GEP instruction, because it requires; a memory dereference in between. However, the following example would work; fine:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, [40 x i32 ] }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, [40 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1, i64 17. In this case, the structure does not contain a pointer and the GEP instruction; can index through the global variable, into the second field of the structure; and access the 18th ``i32`` in the array there.

Why don't GEP x,0,0,1 and GEP x,1 alias?; ----------------------------------------. Quick Answer: They compute different address locations.

However,; ``idx2`` computes the address of *the next* structure after ``@MyVar``, that is; ``MyVar+40``, because it indexes past the ten 4-byte integers in ``MyVar``.; Obviously, in such a situation, the pointers don't alias. Why do GEP x,1,0,0 and GEP x,1 alias?; -------------------------------------. Quick Answer: They compute the same address location. These two GEP instructions will compute the same address because indexing; through the 0th element does not change the address. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: llvm. @MyVar = global { [10 x i32] }; %idx1 = getelementptr { [10 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 1, i32 0, i64 0; %idx2 = getelementptr { [10 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 1.

The design of GEP has the following goals, in rough unofficial order of; priority:. * Support C, C-like languages, and languages which can be conceptually lowered; into C (this covers a lot). * Support optimizations such as those that are common in C compilers.

In each case the second operand is the pointer through which the GEP instruction; starts. The same is true whether the second operand is an argument, allocated; memory, or a global variable. To make this clear, let's consider a more obtuse example:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global i32; ...; %idx1 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 0; %idx2 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 1; %idx3 = getelementptr i32, ptr @MyVar, i64 2. These GEP instructions are simply making address computations from the base; address of ``MyVar``. They compute, as follows (using C syntax):. .. code-block:: c++. idx1 = (char*) &MyVar + 0; idx2 = (char*) &MyVar + 4; idx3 = (char*) &MyVar + 8. Since the type ``i32`` is known to be four bytes long, the indices 0, 1 and 2; translate into memory offsets of 0, 4, and 8, respectively. No memory is; accessed to make these computations because the address of ``@MyVar`` is passed; directly to the GEP instructions. The obtuse part of this example is in the cases of ``%idx2`` and ``%idx3``. They; result in the computation of addresses that point to memory past the end of the; ``@MyVar`` global, which is only one ``i32`` long, not three ``i32``\s long.; While this is legal in LLVM, it is inadvisable because any load or store with; the pointer that results from these GEP instructions would trigger undefined; behavior (UB). Why is the extra 0 index required?; ----------------------------------. Quick answer: there are no superfluous indices. This question arises most often when the GEP instruction is applied to a global; variable which is always a pointer type. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. %MyStruct = external global { ptr, i32 }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { ptr, i32 }, ptr %MyStruct, i64 0, i32 1.

However, a closer inspection of how globals and GEPs work; reveals the need. Becoming aware of the following facts will dispel the; confusion:. #. The type of ``%MyStruct`` is *not* ``{ ptr, i32 }`` but rather ``ptr``.; That is, ``%MyStruct`` is a pointer (to a structure), not a structure itself. #. Point #1 is evidenced by noticing the type of the second operand of the GEP; instruction (``%MyStruct``) which is ``ptr``. #. The first index, ``i64 0`` is required to step over the global variable; ``%MyStruct``. Since the second argument to the GEP instruction must always; be a value of pointer type, the first index steps through that pointer. A; value of 0 means 0 elements offset from that pointer. #. The second index, ``i32 1`` selects the second field of the structure (the; ``i32``). What is dereferenced by GEP?; ----------------------------. Quick answer: nothing. The GetElementPtr instruction dereferences nothing. That is, it doesn't access; memory in any way. That's what the Load and Store instructions are for. GEP is; only involved in the computation of addresses. For example, consider this:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, ptr }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, ptr }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 1; %arr = load ptr, ptr %idx; %idx = getelementptr [40 x i32], ptr %arr, i64 0, i64 17. In this example, we have a global variable, ``@MyVar``, which is a pointer to; a structure containing a pointer. Let's assume that this inner pointer points; to an array of type ``[40 x i32]``. The above IR will first compute the address; of the inner pointer, then load the pointer, and then compute the address of; the 18th array element. This cannot be expressed in a single GEP instruction, because it requires; a memory dereference in between. However, the following example would work; fine:. .. code-block:: text. @MyVar = external global { i32, [40 x i32 ] }; ...; %idx = getelementptr { i32, [40 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst

In this case, the structure does not contain a pointer and the GEP instruction; can index through the global variable, into the second field of the structure; and access the 18th ``i32`` in the array there. Why don't GEP x,0,0,1 and GEP x,1 alias?; ----------------------------------------. Quick Answer: They compute different address locations. If you look at the first indices in these GEP instructions you find that they; are different (0 and 1), therefore the address computation diverges with that; index. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: llvm. @MyVar = external global { [10 x i32] }; %idx1 = getelementptr { [10 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 0, i32 0, i64 1; %idx2 = getelementptr { [10 x i32] }, ptr @MyVar, i64 1. In this example, ``idx1`` computes the address of the second integer in the; array that is in the structure in ``@MyVar``, that is ``MyVar+4``. However,; ``idx2`` computes the address of *the next* structure after ``@MyVar``, that is; ``MyVar+40``, because it indexes past the ten 4-byte integers in ``MyVar``.; Obviously, in such a situation, the pointers don't alias.

If you really need this functionality, you can do the arithmetic with explicit; integer instructions, and use inttoptr to convert the result to an address. Most; of GEP's special aliasing rules do not apply to pointers computed from ptrtoint,; arithmetic, and inttoptr sequences. Can I compute the distance between two objects, and add that value to one address to compute the other address?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. As with arithmetic on null, you can use GEP to compute an address that way, but; you can't use that pointer to actually access the object if you do, unless the; object is managed outside of LLVM. Also as above, ptrtoint and inttoptr provide an alternative way to do this which; do not have this restriction. Can I do type-based alias analysis on LLVM IR?; ----------------------------------------------. You can't do type-based alias analysis using LLVM's built-in type system,; because LLVM has no restrictions on mixing types in addressing, loads or stores. LLVM's type-based alias analysis pass uses metadata to describe a different type; system (such as the C type system), and performs type-based aliasing on top of; that. Further details are in the; `language reference <LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_. What happens if a GEP computation overflows?; --------------------------------------------.

Why do struct member indices always use ``i32``?; ------------------------------------------------. The specific type i32 is probably just a historical artifact, however it's wide; enough for all practical purposes, so there's been no need to change it. It; doesn't necessarily imply i32 address arithmetic; it's just an identifier which; identifies a field in a struct. Requiring that all struct indices be the same; reduces the range of possibilities for cases where two GEPs are effectively the; same but have distinct operand types. What's an uglygep?; ------------------. Some LLVM optimizers operate on GEPs by internally lowering them into more; primitive integer expressions, which allows them to be combined with other; integer expressions and/or split into multiple separate integer expressions. If; they've made non-trivial changes, translating back into LLVM IR can involve; reverse-engineering the structure of the addressing in order to fit it into the; static type of the original first operand. It isn't always possibly to fully; reconstruct this structure; sometimes the underlying addressing doesn't; correspond with the static type at all. In such cases the optimizer instead will; emit a GEP with the base pointer casted to a simple address-unit pointer, using; the name ""uglygep"". This isn't pretty, but it's just as valid, and it's; sufficient to preserve the pointer aliasing guarantees that GEP provides. Summary; =======. In summary, here's some things to always remember about the GetElementPtr; instruction:. #. The GEP instruction never accesses memory, it only provides pointer; computations. #. The second operand to the GEP instruction is always a pointer and it must be; indexed. #. There are no superfluous indices for the GEP instruction. #.

Further details are in the; `language reference <LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_. What happens if a GEP computation overflows?; --------------------------------------------. If the GEP lacks the ``inbounds`` keyword, the value is the result from; evaluating the implied two's complement integer computation. However, since; there's no guarantee of where an object will be allocated in the address space,; such values have limited meaning. If the GEP has the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value is ``poison``; if the GEP overflows (i.e. wraps around the end of the address space). As such, there are some ramifications of this for inbounds GEPs: scales implied; by array/vector/pointer indices are always known to be ""nsw"" since they are; signed values that are scaled by the element size. These values are also; allowed to be negative (e.g. ""``gep i32, ptr %P, i32 -1``"") but the pointer; itself is logically treated as an unsigned value. This means that GEPs have an; asymmetric relation between the pointer base (which is treated as unsigned) and; the offset applied to it (which is treated as signed). The result of the; additions within the offset calculation cannot have signed overflow, but when; applied to the base pointer, there can be signed overflow. How can I tell if my front-end is following the rules?; ------------------------------------------------------. There is currently no checker for the getelementptr rules. Currently, the only; way to do this is to manually check each place in your front-end where; GetElementPtr operators are created. It's not possible to write a checker which could find all rule violations; statically. It would be possible to write a checker which works by instrumenting; the code with dynamic checks though.

Introduction; ============. This document seeks to dispel the mystery and confusion surrounding LLVM's; `GetElementPtr <LangRef.html#getelementptr-instruction>`_ (GEP) instruction.; Questions about the wily GEP instruction are probably the most frequently; occurring questions once a developer gets down to coding with LLVM. Here we lay; out the sources of confusion and show that the GEP instruction is really quite; simple. Address Computation; ===================. When people are first confronted with the GEP instruction, they tend to relate; it to known concepts from other programming paradigms, most notably C array; indexing and field selection. GEP closely resembles C array indexing and field; selection, however it is a little different and this leads to the following; questions. What is the first index of the GEP instruction?; -----------------------------------------------. Quick answer: The index stepping through the second operand. The confusion with the first index usually arises from thinking about the; GetElementPtr instruction as if it was a C index operator. They aren't the; same. For example, when we write, in ""C"":. .. code-block:: c++. AType *Foo;; ...; X = &Foo->F;. it is natural to think that there is only one index, the selection of the field; ``F``. However, in this example, ``Foo`` is a pointer. That pointer; must be indexed explicitly in LLVM. C, on the other hand, indices through it; transparently. To arrive at the same address location as the C code, you would; provide the GEP instruction with two index operands. The first operand indexes; through the pointer; the second operand indexes the field ``F`` of the; structure, just as if you wrote:. .. code-block:: c++. X = &Foo[0].F;.

Sometimes this question gets rephrased as:. .. _GEP index through first pointer:. *Why is it okay to index through the first pointer, but subsequent pointers; won't be dereferenced?*. The answer is simply because memory does not have to be accessed to perform the; computation. The second operand to the GEP instruction must be a value of a; pointer type. The value of the pointer is provided directly to the GEP; instruction as an operand without any need for accessing memory. It must,; therefore be indexed and requires an index operand. Consider this example:. .. code-block:: c++. struct munger_struct {; int f1;; int f2;; };; void munge(struct munger_struct *P) {; P[0].f1 = P[1].f1 + P[2].f2;; }; ...; struct munger_struct Array[3];; ...; munge(Array);. In this ""C"" example, the front end compiler (Clang) will generate three GEP; instructions for the three indices through ""P"" in the assignment statement. The; function argument ``P`` will be the second operand of each of these GEP; instructions. The third operand indexes through that pointer. The fourth; operand will be the field offset into the ``struct munger_struct`` type, for; either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field.

I'm writing a backend for a target which needs custom lowering for GEP. How do I do this?; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. You don't. The integer computation implied by a GEP is target-independent.; Typically what you'll need to do is make your backend pattern-match expressions; trees involving ADD, MUL, etc., which are what GEP is lowered into. This has the; advantage of letting your code work correctly in more cases. GEP does use target-dependent parameters for the size and layout of data types,; which targets can customize. If you require support for addressing units which are not 8 bits, you'll need to; fix a lot of code in the backend, with GEP lowering being only a small piece of; the overall picture. How does VLA addressing work with GEPs?; ---------------------------------------. GEPs don't natively support VLAs. LLVM's type system is entirely static, and GEP; address computations are guided by an LLVM type. VLA indices can be implemented as linearized indices. For example, an expression; like ``X[a][b][c]``, must be effectively lowered into a form like; ``X[a*m+b*n+c]``, so that it appears to the GEP as a single-dimensional array; reference. This means if you want to write an analysis which understands array indices and; you want to support VLAs, your code will have to be prepared to reverse-engineer; the linearization. One way to solve this problem is to use the ScalarEvolution; library, which always presents VLA and non-VLA indexing in the same manner. .. _Rules:. Rules; =====. What happens if an array index is out of bounds?; ------------------------------------------------. There are two senses in which an array index can be out of bounds.

Configure and build LLVM and Clang:. * ``cd llvm-project``; * ``cmake -S llvm -B build -G <generator> [options]``. Some common build system generators are:. * ``Ninja`` --- for generating `Ninja <https://ninja-build.org>`_; build files. Most llvm developers use Ninja.; * ``Unix Makefiles`` --- for generating make-compatible parallel makefiles.; * ``Visual Studio`` --- for generating Visual Studio projects and; solutions.; * ``Xcode`` --- for generating Xcode projects. * See the `CMake docs; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html>`_; for a more comprehensive list.

In; any of the examples below, simply replace each of these names with the; appropriate pathname on your local system. All these paths are absolute:. ``SRC_ROOT``. This is the top level directory of the LLVM source tree. ``OBJ_ROOT``. This is the top level directory of the LLVM object tree (i.e. the tree where; object files and compiled programs will be placed. It can be the same as; SRC_ROOT). Unpacking the LLVM Archives; ---------------------------. If you have the LLVM distribution, you will need to unpack it before you can; begin to compile it. LLVM is distributed as a number of different; subprojects. Each one has its own download which is a TAR archive that is; compressed with the gzip program. The files are as follows, with *x.y* marking the version number:. ``llvm-x.y.tar.gz``. Source release for the LLVM libraries and tools. ``cfe-x.y.tar.gz``. Source release for the Clang frontend. .. _checkout:. Checkout LLVM from Git; ----------------------. You can also checkout the source code for LLVM from Git. .. note::.

These; are intended to run quickly and cover a lot of territory without being exhaustive. ``test-suite``; --------------. A comprehensive correctness, performance, and benchmarking test suite; for LLVM.

More detailed information is in; the `Command Guide <CommandGuide/index.html>`_. ``bugpoint``. ``bugpoint`` is used to debug optimization passes or code generation backends; by narrowing down the given test case to the minimum number of passes and/or; instructions that still cause a problem, whether it is a crash or; miscompilation. See `<HowToSubmitABug.html>`_ for more information on using; ``bugpoint``. ``llvm-ar``. The archiver produces an archive containing the given LLVM bitcode files,; optionally with an index for faster lookup. ``llvm-as``. The assembler transforms the human readable LLVM assembly to LLVM bitcode. ``llvm-dis``. The disassembler transforms the LLVM bitcode to human readable LLVM assembly. ``llvm-link``. ``llvm-link``, not surprisingly, links multiple LLVM modules into a single; program. ``lli``. ``lli`` is the LLVM interpreter, which can directly execute LLVM bitcode; (although very slowly...). For architectures that support it (currently x86,; Sparc, and PowerPC), by default, ``lli`` will function as a Just-In-Time; compiler (if the functionality was compiled in), and will execute the code; *much* faster than the interpreter. ``llc``. ``llc`` is the LLVM backend compiler",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst

'``opt -help``' is a good way to get a list of the; program transformations available in LLVM. ``opt`` can also run a specific analysis on an input LLVM bitcode; file and print the results. Primarily useful for debugging; analyses, or familiarizing yourself with what an analysis does. ``llvm/utils``; --------------. Utilities for working with LLVM source code; some are part of the build process; because they are code generators for parts of the infrastructure. ``codegen-diff``. ``codegen-diff`` finds differences between code that LLC; generates and code that LLI generates.

If you are having problems building or using LLVM, or if you have any other; general questions about LLVM, please consult the `Frequently Asked; Questions <FAQ.html>`_ page. If you are having problems with limited memory and build time, please try; building with ninja instead of make. Please consider configuring the; following options with cmake:. * -G Ninja; Setting this option will allow you to build with ninja instead of make.; Building with ninja significantly improves your build time, especially with; incremental builds, and improves your memory usage. * -DLLVM_USE_LINKER; Setting this option to lld will significantly reduce linking time for LLVM; executables on ELF-based platforms, such as Linux. If you are building LLVM; for the first time and lld is not available to you as a binary package, then; you may want to use the gold linker as a faster alternative to GNU ld. * -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE; Controls optimization level and debug information of the build. This setting; can affect RAM and disk usage, see :ref:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE <cmake_build_type>`; for more information. * -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS; This option defaults to ON for Debug builds and defaults to OFF for Release; builds. As mentioned in the previous option, using the Release build type and; enabling assertions may be a good alternative to using the Debug build type. * -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS; Set this equal to number of jobs you wish to run simultaneously. This is; similar to the -j option used with make, but only for link jobs. This option; can only be used with ninja. You may wish to use a very low number of jobs,; as this will greatly reduce the amount of memory used during the build; process. If you have limited memory, you may wish to set this to 1. * -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD; Set this equal to the tar",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst

For stand-alone builds, you must have an llvm install that is configured; properly to be consumable by stand-alone builds of the other projects.; This could be a distro provided LLVM install, or you can build it yourself,; like this:. .. code-block:: console. cmake -G Ninja -S path/to/llvm-project/llvm -B $builddir \; -DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON \; -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/llvm/install/prefix \; < other options >. ninja -C $builddir install. Once llvm is installed, to configure a project for a stand-alone build, invoke CMake like this:. .. code-block:: console. cmake -G Ninja -S path/to/llvm-project/$subproj \; -B $buildir_subproj \; -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=/path/to/lit \; -DLLVM_ROOT=/path/to/llvm/install/prefix. Notice that:. * The stand-alone build needs to happen in a folder that is not the; original folder where LLVMN was built; (`$builddir!=$builddir_subproj`).; * ``LLVM_ROOT`` should point to the prefix of your llvm installation,; so for example, if llvm is installed into ``/usr/bin`` and; ``/usr/lib64``, then you should pass ``-DLLVM_ROOT=/usr/``.; * Both the ``LLVM_ROOT`` and ``LLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT`` options are; required to do stand-alone builds for all sub-project",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst

To use LLVM modules on Win32-based system, you may configure LLVM; with ``-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=On``. Note that Debug builds require a lot of time and disk space. An LLVM-only build; will need about 1-3 GB of space. A full build of LLVM and Clang will need around; 15-20 GB of disk space. The exact space requirements will vary by system. (It; is so large because of all the debugging information and the fact that the; libraries are statically linked into multiple tools). If you are space-constrained, you can build only selected tools or only; selected targets. The Release build requires considerably less space. The LLVM suite *may* compile on other platforms, but it is not guaranteed to do; so. If compilation is successful, the LLVM utilities should be able to; assemble, disassemble, analyze, and optimize LLVM bitcode. Code generation; should work as well, although the generated native code may not work on your; platform. Software; --------. Compiling LLVM requires that you have several software packages installed. The; table below lists those required packages. The Package column is the usual name; for the software package that LLVM depends on.

Once you have a GCC toolchain, configure your build of LLVM to use the new; toolchain for your host compiler and C++ standard library. Because the new; version of libstdc++ is not on the system library search path, you need to pass; extra linker flags so that it can be found at link time (``-L``) and at runtime; (``-rpath``). If you are using CMake, this invocation should produce working; binaries:. .. code-block:: console. % mkdir build; % cd build; % CC=$HOME/toolchains/bin/gcc CXX=$HOME/toolchains/bin/g++ \; cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_LINK_FLAGS=""-Wl,-rpath,$HOME/toolchains/lib64 -L$HOME/toolchains/lib64"".

This means you need to tweak the -rpath linker flag. This method will add an absolute path to the rpath of all executables. That's; fine for local development. If you want to distribute the binaries you build; so that they can run on older systems, copy ``libstdc++.so.6`` into the; ``lib/`` directory. All of LLVM's shipping binaries have an rpath pointing at; ``$ORIGIN/../lib``, so they will find ``libstdc++.so.6`` there. Non-distributed; binaries don't have an rpath set and won't find ``libstdc++.so.6``. Pass; ``-DLLVM_LOCAL_RPATH=""$HOME/toolchains/lib64""`` to cmake to add an absolute; path to ``libstdc++.so.6`` as above. Since these binaries are not distributed,; having an absolute local path is fine for them. When you build Clang, you will need to give *it* access to modern C++; standard library in order to use it as your new host in part of a bootstrap.; There are two easy ways to do this, either build (and install) libc++ along; with Clang and then use it with the ``-stdlib=libc++`` compile and link flag,; or install Clang into the same prefix (``$HOME/toolchains`` above) as GCC.; Clang will look within its own prefix for libstdc++ and use it if found. You; can also add an explicit prefix for Clang to look in for a GCC toolchain with; the ``--gcc-toolchain=/opt/my/gcc/prefix`` flag, passing it to both compile and; link commands when using your just-built-Clang to bootstrap. .. _Getting Started with LLVM:.

Once you have LLVM configured, you can build it by entering the *OBJ_ROOT*; directory and issuing the following command:. .. code-block:: console. % make. If the build fails, please `check here`_ to see if you are using a version of; GCC that is known not to compile LLVM. If you have multiple processors in your machine, you may wish to use some of the; parallel build options provided by GNU Make. For example, you could use the; command:. .. code-block:: console. % make -j2. There are several special targets which are useful when working with the LLVM; source code:. ``make clean``. Removes all files generated by the build. This includes object files,; generated C/C++ files, libraries, and executables. ``make install``. Installs LLVM header files, libraries, tools, and documentation in a hierarchy; under ``$PREFIX``, specified with ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, which; defaults to ``/usr/local``. ``make docs-llvm-html``. If configured with ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_SPHINX=On``, this will generate a directory; at ``OBJ_ROOT/docs/html`` which contains the HTML formatted documentation. Cross-Compiling LLVM; --------------------. It is possible to cross-compile LLVM itself. That is, you can create LLVM; executables and libraries to be hosted on a platform different from the platform; where they are built (a Canadian Cross build). To generate build files for; cross-compiling CMake provides a variable ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` which can; define compiler flags and variables used during the CMake test operations. The result of such a build is executables that are not runnable on the build; host but can be executed on the target.

Check :doc:`HowToCrossCompileLLVM` and `Clang docs on how to cross-compile in general; <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html>`_ for more information; about cross-compiling. The Location of LLVM Object Files; ---------------------------------. The LLVM build system is capable of sharing a single LLVM source tree among; several LLVM builds. Hence, it is possible to build LLVM for several different; platforms or configurations using the same source tree. * Change directory to where the LLVM object files should live:. .. code-block:: console. % cd OBJ_ROOT. * Run ``cmake``:. .. code-block:: console. % cmake -G ""Unix Makefiles"" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release SRC_ROOT. The LLVM build will create a structure underneath *OBJ_ROOT* that matches the; LLVM source tree. At each level where source files are present in the source; tree there will be a corresponding ``CMakeFiles`` directory in the *OBJ_ROOT*.; Underneath that directory there is another directory with a name ending in; ``.dir`` under which you'll find object files for each source. For example:. .. code-block:: console. % cd llvm_build_dir; % find lib/Support/ -name APFloat*; lib/Support/CMakeFiles/LLVMSupport.dir/APFloat.cpp.o.

If you are space-constrained, you can build only selected tools or only; selected targets. The Release build requires considerably less space.

Once you have a GCC toolchain, configure your build of LLVM to use the new; toolchain for your host compiler and C++ standard library. Because the new; version of libstdc++ is not on the system library search path, you need to pass; extra linker flags so that it can be found at link time (``-L``) and at runtime; (``-rpath``).

If you fail to set rpath, most LLVM binaries will fail on startup with a message; from the loader similar to ``libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not; found``. This means you need to tweak the -rpath linker flag. This method will add an absolute path to the rpath of all executables. That's; fine for local development. If you want to distribute the binaries you build; so that they can run on older systems, copy ``libstdc++.so.6`` into the; ``lib/`` directory. All of LLVM's shipping binaries have an rpath pointing at; ``$ORIGIN/../lib``, so they will find ``libstdc++.so.6`` there. Non-distributed; binaries don't have an rpath set and won't find ``libstdc++.so.6``. Pass; ``-DLLVM_LOCAL_RPATH=""$HOME/toolchains/lib64""`` to cmake to add an absolute; path to ``libstdc++.so.6`` as above.

The Location of LLVM Object Files; ---------------------------------. The LLVM build system is capable of sharing a single LLVM source tree among; several LLVM builds. Hence, it is possible to build LLVM for several different; platforms or configurations using the same source tree. * Change directory to where the LLVM object files should live:. .. code-block:: console. % cd OBJ_ROOT. * Run ``cmake``:. .. code-block:: console. % cmake -G ""Unix Makefiles"" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release SRC_ROOT. The LLVM build will create a structure underneath *OBJ_ROOT* that matches the; LLVM source tree. At each level where source files are present in the source; tree there will be a corresponding ``CMakeFiles`` directory in the *OBJ_ROOT*.; Underneath that directory there is another directory with a name ending in; ``.dir`` under which you'll find object files for each source. For example:. .. code-block:: console. % cd llvm_build_dir; % find lib/Support/ -name APFloat*; lib/Support/CMakeFiles/LLVMSupport.dir/APFloat.cpp.o.

This contains all of the tools, libraries, and header; files needed to process intermediate representations and converts it into; object files. Tools include an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and; bitcode optimizer. It also contains basic regression tests. C-like languages use the `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_ front end. This; component compiles C, C++, Objective C, and Objective C++ code into LLVM bitcode; -- and from there into object files, using LLVM. Other components include:; the `libc++ C++ standard library <https://libcxx.llvm.org>`_,; the `LLD linker <https://lld.llvm.org>`_, and more.

To use LLVM modules on Win32-based system, you may configure LLVM; with ``-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=On``. Note that Debug builds require a lot of time and disk space. An LLVM-only build; will need about 1-3 GB of space. A full build of LLVM and Clang will need around; 15-20 GB of disk space. The exact space requirements will vary by system. (It; is so large because of all the debugging information and the fact that the; libraries are statically linked into multiple tools). If you are space-constrained, you can build only selected tools or only; selected targets. The Release build requires considerably less space.

Once you have a GCC toolchain, configure your build of LLVM to use the new; toolchain for your host compiler and C++ standard library. Because the new; version of libstdc++ is not on the system library search path, you need to pass; extra linker flags so that it can be found at link time (``-L``) and at runtime; (``-rpath``). If you are using CMake, this invocation should produce working; binaries:. .. code-block:: console. % mkdir build; % cd build; % CC=$HOME/toolchains/bin/gcc CXX=$HOME/toolchains/bin/g++ \; cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_LINK_FLAGS=""-Wl,-rpath,$HOME/toolchains/lib64 -L$HOME/toolchains/lib64"". If you fail to set rpath, most LLVM binaries will fail on startup with a message; from the loader similar to ``libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not; found``. This means you need to tweak the -rpath linker flag. This method will add an absolute path to the rpath of all executables. That's; fine for local development. If you want to distribute the binaries you build; so that they can run on older systems, copy ``libstdc++.so.6`` into the; ``lib/`` directory. All of LLVM's shipping binaries have an rpath pointing at; ``$ORIGIN/../lib``, so they will find ``libstdc++.so.6`` there. Non-distributed; binaries don't have an rpath set and won't find ``libstdc++.so.6``. Pass; ``-DLLVM_LOCAL_RPATH=""$HOME/toolchains/lib64""`` to cmake to add an absolute; path to ``libstdc++.so.6`` as above. Since these binaries are not distributed,; having an absolute local path is fine for them.

Common Problems; ===============. If you are having problems building or using LLVM, or if you have any other; general questions about LLVM, please consult the `Frequently Asked; Questions <FAQ.html>`_ page. If you are having problems with limited memory and build time, please try; building with ninja instead of make. Please consider configuring the; following options with cmake:. * -G Ninja; Setting this option will allow you to build with ninja instead of make.; Building with ninja significantly improves your build time, especially with; incremental builds, and improves your memory usage. * -DLLVM_USE_LINKER; Setting this option to lld will significantly reduce linking time for LLVM; executables on ELF-based platforms, such as Linux. If you are building LLVM; for the first time and lld is not available to you as a binary package, then; you may want to use the gold linker as a faster alternative to GNU ld. * -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE; Controls optimization level and debug information of the build. This setting; can affect RAM and disk usage, see :ref:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE <cmake_build_type>`; for more information. * -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS; This option defaults to ON for Debug builds and defaults to OFF for Release; builds. As mentioned in the previous option, using the Release build type and; enabling assertions may be a good alternative to using the Debug build type. * -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS; Set this equal to number of jobs you wish to run simultaneously. This is; similar to the -j option used with make, but only for link jobs. This option; can only be used with ninja. You may wish to use a very low number of jobs,; as this will greatly reduce the amount of memory used during the build; process. If you have limited memory, you may wish to set this to 1. * -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD; Set this equal to the target you wish to build.

To enforce this language version, we check the most; popular host toolchains for specific minimum versions in our build systems:. * Clang 5.0; * Apple Clang 10.0; * GCC 7.4; * Visual Studio 2019 16.7. Anything older than these toolchains *may* work, but will require forcing the; build system with a special option and is not really a supported host platform.; Also note that older versions of these compilers have often crashed or; miscompiled LLVM. For less widely used host toolchains such as ICC or xlC, be aware that a very; recent version may be required to support all of the C++ features used in LLVM. We track certain versions of software that are *known* to fail when used as; part of the host toolchain. These even include linkers at times. **GNU ld 2.16.X**. Some 2.16.X versions of the ld linker will produce very long; warning messages complaining that some ""``.gnu.linkonce.t.*``"" symbol was; defined in a discarded section. You can safely ignore these messages as they are; erroneous and the linkage is correct. These messages disappear using ld 2.17. **GNU binutils 2.17**: Binutils 2.17 contains `a bug; <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3111>`__ which causes huge link; times (minutes instead of seconds) when building LLVM.

Host C++ Toolchain, both Compiler and Standard Library; ------------------------------------------------------. LLVM is very demanding of the host C++ compiler, and as such tends to expose; bugs in the compiler. We also attempt to follow improvements and developments in; the C++ language and library reasonably closely. As such, we require a modern; host C++ toolchain, both compiler and standard library, in order to build LLVM.

If you fail to set rpath, most LLVM binaries will fail on startup with a message; from the loader similar to ``libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not; found``. This means you need to tweak the -rpath linker flag. This method will add an absolute path to the rpath of all executables. That's; fine for local development. If you want to distribute the binaries you build; so that they can run on older systems, copy ``libstdc++.so.6`` into the; ``lib/`` directory. All of LLVM's shipping binaries have an rpath pointing at; ``$ORIGIN/../lib``, so they will find ``libstdc++.so.6`` there. Non-distributed; binaries don't have an rpath set and won't find ``libstdc++.so.6``. Pass; ``-DLLVM_LOCAL_RPATH=""$HOME/toolchains/lib64""`` to cmake to add an absolute; path to ``libstdc++.so.6`` as above. Since these binaries are not distributed,; having an absolute local path is fine for them. When you build Clang, you will need to give *it* access to modern C++; standard library in order to use it as your new host in part of a bootstrap.; There are two easy ways to do this, either build (and install) libc++ along; with Clang and then use it with the ``-stdlib=libc++`` compile and link flag,; or install Clang into the same prefix (``$HOME/toolchains`` above) as GCC.; Clang will look within its own prefix for libstdc++ and use it if found. You; can also add an explicit prefix for Clang to look in for a GCC toolchain with; the ``--gcc-toolchain=/opt/my/gcc/prefix`` flag, passing it to both compile and; link commands when using your just-built-Clang to bootstrap. .. _Getting Started with LLVM:.

The LLVM build will create a structure underneath *OBJ_ROOT* that matches the; LLVM source tree. At each level where source files are present in the source; tree there will be a corresponding ``CMakeFiles`` directory in the *OBJ_ROOT*.; Underneath that directory there is another directory with a name ending in; ``.dir`` under which you'll find object files for each source. For example:. .. code-block:: console. % cd llvm_build_dir; % find lib/Support/ -name APFloat*; lib/Support/CMakeFiles/LLVMSupport.dir/APFloat.cpp.o. Optional Configuration Items; ----------------------------. If you're running on a Linux system that supports the `binfmt_misc; <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/binfmt_misc>`_; module, and you have root access on the system, you can set your system up to; execute LLVM bitcode files directly. To do this, use commands like this (the; first command may not be required if you are already using the module):. .. code-block:: console. % mount -t binfmt_misc none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc; % echo ':llvm:M::BC::/path/to/lli:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register; % chmod u+x hello.bc (if needed); % ./hello.bc.

This section mostly applies to Linux and older BSDs. On macOS, you should; have a sufficiently modern Xcode, or you will likely need to upgrade until you; do. Windows does not have a ""system compiler"", so you must install either Visual; Studio 2019 (or later), or a recent version of mingw64. FreeBSD 10.0 and newer; have a modern Clang as the system compiler. However, some Linux distributions and some other or older BSDs sometimes have; extremely old versions of GCC. These steps attempt to help you upgrade you; compiler even on such a system. However, if at all possible, we encourage you; to use a recent version of a distribution with a modern system compiler that; meets these requirements. Note that it is tempting to install a prior; version of Clang and libc++ to be the host compiler, however libc++ was not; well tested or set up to build on Linux until relatively recently. As; a consequence, this guide suggests just using libstdc++ and a modern GCC as the; initial host in a bootstrap, and then using Clang (and potentially libc++). The first step is to get a recent GCC toolchain installed. The most common; distribution on which users have struggled with the version requirements is; Ubuntu Precise, 12.04 LTS. For this distribution, one easy option is to install; the `toolchain testing PPA`_ and use it to install a modern GCC. There is; a really nice discussions of this on the `ask ubuntu stack exchange`_ and a; `github gist`_ with updated commands. However, not all users can use PPAs and; there are many other distributions, so it may be necessary (or just useful, if; you're here you *are* doing compiler development after all) to build and install; GCC from source.

This will create an '``llvm-project``' directory in the current directory and; fully populate it with all of the source code, test directories, and local; copies of documentation files for LLVM and all the related subprojects. Note; that unlike the tarballs, which contain each subproject in a separate file, the; git repository contains all of the projects together. If you want to get a specific release (as opposed to the most recent revision),; you can check out a tag after cloning the repository. E.g., `git checkout; llvmorg-6.0.1` inside the ``llvm-project`` directory created by the above; command. Use `git tag -l` to list all of them. Sending patches; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

This can dramatically speed up |; | | debug builds. |; +-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+. To configure LLVM, follow these steps:. #. Change directory into the object root directory:. .. code-block:: console. % cd OBJ_ROOT. #. Run the ``cmake``:. .. code-block:: console. % cmake -G ""Unix Makefiles"" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path; [other options] SRC_ROOT. Compiling the LLVM Suite Source Code; ------------------------------------. Unlike with autotools, with CMake your build type is defined at configuration.; If you want to change your build type, you can re-run cmake with the following; invocation:. .. code-block:: console. % cmake -G ""Unix Makefiles"" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type> SRC_ROOT. Between runs, CMake preserves the values set for all options. CMake has the; following build types defined:. Debug. These builds are the default. The build system will compile the tools and; libraries unoptimized, with debugging information, and asserts enabled. Release. For these builds, the build system will compile the tools and libraries; with optimizations enabled and not generate debug info. CMakes default; optimization level is -O3. This can be configured by setting the; ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE`` variable on the CMake command line. RelWithDebInfo. These builds are useful when debugging. They generate optimized binaries with; debug information. CMakes default optimization level is -O2. This can be; configured by setting the ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO`` variable on the; CMake command line. Once you have LLVM configured, you can build it by entering the *OBJ_ROOT*; directory and issuing the following command:. .. code-block:: console. % make. If the build fails, please `check here`_ to see if you are using a version of; GCC that is known not to compile LLVM. If you have multiple processors in your machine, you may wish to use some of the; parallel build options provided by ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst

There are several special targets which are useful when working with the LLVM; source code:. ``make clean``. Removes all files generated by the build. This includes object files,; generated C/C++ files, libraries, and executables. ``make install``. Installs LLVM header files, libraries, tools, and documentation in a hierarchy; under ``$PREFIX``, specified with ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, which; defaults to ``/usr/local``. ``make docs-llvm-html``. If configured with ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_SPHINX=On``, this will generate a directory; at ``OBJ_ROOT/docs/html`` which contains the HTML formatted documentation. Cross-Compiling LLVM; --------------------. It is possible to cross-compile LLVM itself. That is, you can create LLVM; executables and libraries to be hosted on a platform different from the platform; where they are built (a Canadian Cross build). To generate build files for; cross-compiling CMake provides a variable ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` which can; define compiler flags and variables used during the CMake test operations. The result of such a build is executables that are not runnable on the build; host but can be executed on the target. As an example the following CMake; invocation can generate build files targeting iOS. This will work on macOS; with the latest Xcode:. .. code-block:: console. % cmake -G ""Ninja"" -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=""armv7;armv7s;arm64""; -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<PATH_TO_LLVM>/cmake/platforms/iOS.cmake; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=Off -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=Off; -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=Off -DLLVM_ENABLE_BACKTRACES=Off [options]; <PATH_TO_LLVM>. Note: There are some additional flags that need to be passed when building for; iOS due to limitations in the iOS SDK.

A comprehensive correctness, performance, and benchmarking test suite; for LLVM.

The following is a brief introduction; to the most important tools. More detailed information is in; the `Command Guide <CommandGuide/index.html>`_. ``bugpoint``. ``bugpoint`` is used to debug optimization passes or code generation backends; by narrowing down the given test case to the minimum number of passes and/or; instructions that still cause a problem, whether it is a crash or; miscompilation. See `<HowToSubmitABug.html>`_ for more information on using; ``bugpoint``. ``llvm-ar``. The archiver produces an archive containing the given LLVM bitcode files,; optionally with an index for faster lookup. ``llvm-as``. The assembler transforms the human readable LLVM assembly to LLVM bitcode. ``llvm-dis``. The disassembler transforms the LLVM bitcode to human readable LLVM assembly. ``llvm-link``. ``llvm-link``, not surprisingly, links multiple LLVM modules into a single; program. ``lli``. ``lli`` is the LLVM interpreter, which can directly execute LLVM bitcode; (although very slowly...). For architectures that support it (currently x86,; Sparc, and PowerPC), by default, ``lli`` will function as a Just-In-Time; compiler (if the functionality was compiled in), and will execute the code; *much* faster than the interpreter. ``llc``. ``llc`` is the LLVM backend compiler",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GettingStarted.rst

Please consider configuring the; following options with cmake:. * -G Ninja; Setting this option will allow you to build with ninja instead of make.; Building with ninja significantly improves your build time, especially with; incremental builds, and improves your memory usage. * -DLLVM_USE_LINKER; Setting this option to lld will significantly reduce linking time for LLVM; executables on ELF-based platforms, such as Linux. If you are building LLVM; for the first time and lld is not available to you as a binary package, then; you may want to use the gold linker as a faster alternative to GNU ld. * -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE; Controls optimization level and debug information of the build. This setting; can affect RAM and disk usage, see :ref:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE <cmake_build_type>`; for more information. * -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS; This option defaults to ON for Debug builds and defaults to OFF for Release; builds. As mentioned in the previous option, using the Release build type and; enabling assertions may be a good alternative to using the Debug build type. * -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS; Set this equal to number of jobs you wish to run simultaneously. This is; similar to the -j option used with make, but only for link jobs. This option; can only be used with ninja. You may wish to use a very low number of jobs,; as this will greatly reduce the amount of memory used during the build; process. If you have limited memory, you may wish to set this to 1. * -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD; Set this equal to the target you wish to build. You may wish to set this to; X86; however, you will find a full list of targets within the; llvm-project/llvm/lib/Target directory. * -DLLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN; Set this to ON to generate a fully optimized tablegen during your build.

To improve speed, try running a; parallel build. That's done by default in Ninja; for ``make``, use the; option ``-j NN``, where ``NN`` is the number of parallel jobs, e.g. the; number of available CPUs. * A basic CMake and build/test invocation which only builds LLVM and no other; subprojects:. ``cmake -S llvm -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug``. ``ninja -C build check-llvm``. This will setup an LLVM build with debugging info, then compile LLVM and; run LLVM tests. * For more detailed information on CMake options, see `CMake <CMake.html>`__. * If you get build or test failures, see `below`_.

Stand-alone Builds; ------------------. Stand-alone builds allow you to build a sub-project against a pre-built; version of the clang or llvm libraries that is already present on your; system. You can use the source code from a standard checkout of the llvm-project; (as described above) to do stand-alone builds, but you may also build; from a :ref:`sparse checkout<workflow-multicheckout-nocommit>` or from the; tarballs available on the `releases <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/>`_; page. For stand-alone builds, you must have an llvm install that is configured; properly to be consumable by stand-alone builds of the other projects.; This could be a distro provided LLVM install, or you can build it yourself,; like this:. .. code-block:: console. cmake -G Ninja -S path/to/llvm-project/llvm -B $builddir \; -DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON \; -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/llvm/install/prefix \; < other options >. ninja -C $builddir install.

This section mostly applies to Linux and older BSDs. On macOS, you should; have a sufficiently modern Xcode, or you will likely need to upgrade until you; do. Windows does not have a ""system compiler"", so you must install either Visual; Studio 2019 (or later), or a recent version of mingw64. FreeBSD 10.0 and newer; have a modern Clang as the system compiler. However, some Linux distributions and some other or older BSDs sometimes have; extremely old versions of GCC. These steps attempt to help you upgrade you; compiler even on such a system. However, if at all possible, we encourage you; to use a recent version of a distribution with a modern system compiler that; meets these requirements. Note that it is tempting to install a prior; version of Clang and libc++ to be the host compiler, however libc++ was not; well tested or set up to build on Linux until relatively recently. As; a consequence, this guide suggests just using libstdc++ and a modern GCC as the; initial host in a bootstrap, and then using Clang (and potentially libc++). The first step is to get a recent GCC toolchain installed. The most common; distribution on which users have struggled with the version requirements is; Ubuntu Precise, 12.04 LTS. For this distribution, one easy option is to install; the `toolchain testing PPA`_ and use it to install a modern GCC. There is; a really nice discussions of this on the `ask ubuntu stack exchange`_ and a; `github gist`_ with updated commands. However, not all users can use PPAs and; there are many other distributions, so it may be necessary (or just useful, if; you're here you *are* doing compiler development after all) to build and install; GCC from source.

First, create a simple C file, name it 'hello.c':. .. code-block:: c. #include <stdio.h>. int main() {; printf(""hello world\n"");; return 0;; }. #. Next, compile the C file into a native executable:. .. code-block:: console. % clang hello.c -o hello. .. note::. Clang works just like GCC by default. The standard -S and -c arguments; work as usual (producing a native .s or .o file, respectively). #. Next, compile the C file into an LLVM bitcode file:. .. code-block:: console. % clang -O3 -emit-llvm hello.c -c -o hello.bc. The -emit-llvm option can be used with the -S or -c options to emit an LLVM; ``.ll`` or ``.bc`` file (respectively) for the code. This allows you to use; the `standard LLVM tools <CommandGuide/index.html>`_ on the bitcode file. #. Run the program in both forms. To run the program, use:. .. code-block:: console. % ./hello. and. .. code-block:: console. % lli hello.bc. The second examples shows how to invoke the LLVM JIT, :doc:`lli; <CommandGuide/lli>`. #.

Finally, configure LLVM using CMake:. .. code-block:: bat. cmake -S llvm\llvm -B build -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 -Thost=x64; exit. ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` specifies any additional LLVM projects you want to; build while ``LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD`` selects the compiler targets. If; ``LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD`` is omitted by default all targets are built; slowing compilation and using more disk space.; See the :doc:`LLVM CMake guide <CMake>` for detailed information about; how to configure the LLVM build. The ``cmake`` command line tool is bundled with Visual Studio but its GUI is; not. You may install `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_ to use its GUI to change; CMake variables or modify the above command line. * Once CMake is installed then the simplest way is to just start the; CMake GUI, select the directory where you have LLVM extracted to, and; the default options should all be fine.

Creating Pull Requests; ----------------------; Keep in mind that when creating a pull request, it should generally only contain one; self-contained commit initially.; This makes it easier for reviewers to understand the introduced changes and; provide feedback. It also helps maintain a clear and organized commit history; for the project. If you have multiple changes you want to introduce, it's; recommended to create separate pull requests for each change. Create a local branch per commit you want to submit and then push that branch; to your `fork <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks>`_; of the llvm-project and; `create a pull request from the fork <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_.; As GitHub uses the first line of the commit message truncated to 72 characters; as the pull request title, you may have to edit to reword or to undo this; truncation. Creating Pull Requests with GitHub CLI; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; With the CLI it's enough to create the branch locally and then run:. ::. gh pr create. When prompted select to create and use your own fork and follow; the instructions to add more information needed. .. note::. When you let the GitHub CLI create a fork of llvm-project to; your user, it will change the git ""remotes"" so that ""origin"" points; to your fork and ""upstream"" points to the main llvm-project repository. Updating Pull Requests; ----------------------; In order to update your pull request, the only thing you need to do is to push; your new commits to the branch in your fork.

And make sure you push to the remote that's pointing to your fork. Rebasing Pull Requests and Force Pushes; ---------------------------------------; In general, you should avoid rebasing a Pull Request and force pushing to the; branch that's the root of the Pull Request during the review. This action will; make the context of the old changes and comments harder to find and read. Sometimes, a rebase might be needed to update your branch with a fix for a test; or in some dependent code.

Landing your change; -------------------; When your PR has been accepted you can use the web interface to land your change.; If you have created multiple commits to address feedback at this point you need; to consolidate those commits into one commit. There are two different ways to; do this:. `Interactive rebase <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode>`_; with fixup's. This is the recommended method since you can control the final; commit message and inspect that the final commit looks as you expect.

Use the button `Squash and merge` in GitHub's web interface, if you do this; remember to review the commit message when prompted. Afterwards you can select the option `Delete branch` to delete the branch; from your fork. You can also merge via the CLI by switching to your branch locally and run:. ::. gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch.

Introduction; ============. Building with link time optimization requires cooperation from; the system linker. LTO support on Linux systems is available via the; `gold linker`_ which supports LTO via plugins. This is the same mechanism; used by the `GCC LTO`_ project. The LLVM gold plugin implements the gold plugin interface on top of; :ref:`libLTO`. The same plugin can also be used by other tools such as; ``ar`` and ``nm``. Note that ld.bfd from binutils version 2.21.51.0.2; and above also supports LTO via plugins. However, usage of the LLVM; gold plugin with ld.bfd is not tested and therefore not officially; supported or recommended. As of LLVM 15, the gold plugin will ignore bitcode from the ``.llvmbc``; section inside of ELF object files. However, LTO with bitcode files; is still supported. .. _`gold linker`: http://sourceware.org/binutils; .. _`GCC LTO`: http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LinkTimeOptimization; .. _`gold plugin interface`: http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/whopr/driver. .. _lto-how-to-build:.

If gold is already installed at; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold``, one option is to simply make that the default by; backing up your existing ``/usr/bin/ld`` and creating a symbolic link; with ``ln -s /usr/bin/ld.gold /usr/bin/ld``. Alternatively, you can build; with clang's ``-fuse-ld=gold`` or add ``-fuse-ld=gold`` to LDFLAGS, which will; cause the clang driver to invoke ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` directly. If you have gold installed, check for plugin support by running; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold -plugin``. If it complains ""missing argument"" then; you have plugin support. If not, and you get an error such as ""unknown option"",; then you will either need to build gold or install a version with plugin; support. * Download, configure and build gold with plugin support:. .. code-block:: bash. $ git clone --depth 1 git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git binutils; $ mkdir build; $ cd build; $ ../binutils/configure --enable-gold --enable-plugins --disable-werror; $ make all-gold. That should leave you with ``build/gold/ld-new`` which supports; the ``-plugin`` option. Running ``make`` will additionally build; ``build/binutils/ar`` and ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GoldPlugin.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GoldPlugin.rst

Notably, we only choose a very small percentage of allocations; to sample, and apply guard pages to these sampled allocations only. The sampling; is small enough to allow us to have very low performance overhead. There is a small, tunable memory overhead that is fixed for the lifetime of the; process. This is approximately ~40KiB per process using the default settings,; depending on the average size of your allocations. GWP-ASan vs. ASan; =================. Unlike `AddressSanitizer <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html>`_,; GWP-ASan does not induce a significant performance overhead. ASan often requires; the use of dedicated canaries to be viable in production environments, and as; such is often impractical. GWP-ASan is only capable of finding a subset of the memory issues detected by; ASan. Furthermore, GWP-ASan's bug detection capabilities are only probabilistic.; As such, we recommend using ASan over GWP-ASan in testing, as well as anywhere; else that guaranteed error detection is more valuable than the 2x execution; slowdown/binary size bloat. For the majority of production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful. Design; ======. **Please note:** The implementation of GWP-ASan is largely in-flux, and these; details are subject to change. There are currently other implementations of; GWP-ASan, such as the implementation featured in; `Chromium <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/gwp_asan/>`_. The; long-term support goal is to ensure feature-parity where reasonable, and to; support compiler-rt as the reference implementation. Allocator Support; -----------------. GWP-ASan is not a replacement for a traditional allocator. Instead, it works by; inserting stubs into a supporting allocator to redirect allocations to GWP-ASan; when they're chosen to be sampled. These stubs are generally implemented in the; implementation of ``malloc()``, ``free()`` and ``realloc()``. The stubs are; extremely",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GwpAsan.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GwpAsan.rst

Buffer Underflow/Overflow Detection; -----------------------------------. We gain buffer-overflow and buffer-underflow detection through these guard; pages. When a memory access overruns the allocated buffer, it will touch the; inaccessible guard page, causing memory exception. This exception is caught and; handled by the internal crash handler. Because each allocation is recorded with; metadata about where (and by what thread) it was allocated and deallocated, we; can provide information that will help identify the root cause of the bug. Allocations are randomly selected to be either left- or right-aligned to provide; equal detection of both underflows and overflows. Use after Free Detection; ------------------------. The guarded allocation pool also provides use-after-free detection. Whenever a; sampled allocation is deallocated, we map its guarded slot as inaccessible. Any; memory accesses after deallocation will thus trigger the crash handler, and we; can provide useful information about the source of the error. Please note that the use-after-free detection for a sampled allocation is; transient. To keep memory overhead fixed while still detecting bugs, deallocated; slots are randomly reused to guard future allocations. Usage; =====. GWP-ASan already ships by default in the; `Scudo Hardened Allocator <https://llvm.org/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.html>`_,; so building with ``-fsanitize=scudo`` is the quickest and easiest way to try out; GWP-ASan. Options; -------. GWP-ASan's configuration is managed by the supporting allocator. We provide a; generic configuration management library that is used by Scudo. It allows; several aspects of GWP-ASan to be configured through the following methods:. - When the GWP-ASan library is compiled, by setting; ``-DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS`` to the options string you want set by default.; If you're building GWP-ASan as part of a compiler-rt/LLVM build, add it during; cmake configure time (e",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GwpAsan.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GwpAsan.rst

Introduction; ============. GWP-ASan is a sampled allocator framework that assists in finding use-after-free; and heap-buffer-overflow bugs in production environments. It informally is a; recursive acronym, ""**G**\WP-ASan **W**\ill **P**\rovide **A**\llocation; **SAN**\ity"". GWP-ASan is based on the classic; `Electric Fence Malloc Debugger <https://linux.die.net/man/3/efence>`_, with a; key adaptation. Notably, we only choose a very small percentage of allocations; to sample, and apply guard pages to these sampled allocations only. The sampling; is small enough to allow us to have very low performance overhead. There is a small, tunable memory overhead that is fixed for the lifetime of the; process. This is approximately ~40KiB per process using the default settings,; depending on the average size of your allocations. GWP-ASan vs. ASan; =================. Unlike `AddressSanitizer <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html>`_,; GWP-ASan does not induce a significant performance overhead. ASan often requires; the use of dedicated canaries to be viable in production environments, and as; such is often impractical. GWP-ASan is only capable of finding a subset of the memory issues detected by; ASan. Furthermore, GWP-ASan's bug detection capabilities are only probabilistic.; As such, we recommend using ASan over GWP-ASan in testing, as well as anywhere; else that guaranteed error detection is more valuable than the 2x execution; slowdown/binary size bloat. For the majority of production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful.

The; long-term support goal is to ensure feature-parity where reasonable, and to; support compiler-rt as the reference implementation. Allocator Support; -----------------. GWP-ASan is not a replacement for a traditional allocator. Instead, it works by; inserting stubs into a supporting allocator to redirect allocations to GWP-ASan; when they're chosen to be sampled. These stubs are generally implemented in the; implementation of ``malloc()``, ``free()`` and ``realloc()``. The stubs are; extremely small, which makes using GWP-ASan in most allocators fairly trivial.; The stubs follow the same general pattern (example ``malloc()`` pseudocode; below):. .. code:: cpp. #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; gwp_asan::GuardedPoolAllocator GWPASanAllocator;; #endif. void* YourAllocator::malloc(..) {; #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; if (GWPASanAllocator.shouldSample(..)); return GWPASanAllocator.allocate(..);; #endif. // ... the rest of your allocator code here.; }. Then, all the supporting allocator needs to do is compile with; ``-DINSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS`` and link against the GWP-ASan library! For; performance reasons, we strongly recommend static linkage of the GWP-ASan; library. Guarded Allocation Pool; -----------------------. The core of GWP-ASan is the guarded allocation pool. Each sampled allocation is; backed using its own *guarded* slot, which may consist of one or more accessible; pages. Each guarded slot is surrounded by two *guard* pages, which are mapped as; inaccessible. The collection of all guarded slots makes up the *guarded; allocation pool*. Buffer Underflow/Overflow Detection; -----------------------------------. We gain buffer-overflow and buffer-underflow detection through these guard; pages.

Allocator Support; -----------------. GWP-ASan is not a replacement for a traditional allocator. Instead, it works by; inserting stubs into a supporting allocator to redirect allocations to GWP-ASan; when they're chosen to be sampled. These stubs are generally implemented in the; implementation of ``malloc()``, ``free()`` and ``realloc()``. The stubs are; extremely small, which makes using GWP-ASan in most allocators fairly trivial.; The stubs follow the same general pattern (example ``malloc()`` pseudocode; below):. .. code:: cpp. #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; gwp_asan::GuardedPoolAllocator GWPASanAllocator;; #endif. void* YourAllocator::malloc(..) {; #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; if (GWPASanAllocator.shouldSample(..)); return GWPASanAllocator.allocate(..);; #endif. // ... the rest of your allocator code here.; }. Then, all the supporting allocator needs to do is compile with; ``-DINSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS`` and link against the GWP-ASan library! For; performance reasons, we strongly recommend static linkage of the GWP-ASan; library. Guarded Allocation Pool; -----------------------. The core of GWP-ASan is the guarded allocation pool. Each sampled allocation is; backed using its own *guarded* slot, which may consist of one or more accessible; pages. Each guarded slot is surrounded by two *guard* pages, which are mapped as; inaccessible. The collection of all guarded slots makes up the *guarded; allocation pool*. Buffer Underflow/Overflow Detection; -----------------------------------. We gain buffer-overflow and buffer-underflow detection through these guard; pages. When a memory access overruns the allocated buffer, it will touch the; inaccessible guard page, causing memory exception. This exception is caught and; handled by the internal crash handler. Because each allocation is recorded with; metadata about where (and by what thread) it was allocated and deallocated, we; can provide information that will",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GwpAsan.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GwpAsan.rst

Notably, we only choose a very small percentage of allocations; to sample, and apply guard pages to these sampled allocations only. The sampling; is small enough to allow us to have very low performance overhead. There is a small, tunable memory overhead that is fixed for the lifetime of the; process. This is approximately ~40KiB per process using the default settings,; depending on the average size of your allocations. GWP-ASan vs. ASan; =================. Unlike `AddressSanitizer <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html>`_,; GWP-ASan does not induce a significant performance overhead. ASan often requires; the use of dedicated canaries to be viable in production environments, and as; such is often impractical. GWP-ASan is only capable of finding a subset of the memory issues detected by; ASan. Furthermore, GWP-ASan's bug detection capabilities are only probabilistic.; As such, we recommend using ASan over GWP-ASan in testing, as well as anywhere; else that guaranteed error detection is more valuable than the 2x execution; slowdown/binary size bloat. For the majority of production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful.

There are currently other implementations of; GWP-ASan, such as the implementation featured in; `Chromium <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/gwp_asan/>`_. The; long-term support goal is to ensure feature-parity where reasonable, and to; support compiler-rt as the reference implementation. Allocator Support; -----------------. GWP-ASan is not a replacement for a traditional allocator. Instead, it works by; inserting stubs into a supporting allocator to redirect allocations to GWP-ASan; when they're chosen to be sampled.

Options; -------. GWP-ASan's configuration is managed by the supporting allocator. We provide a; generic configuration management library that is used by Scudo. It allows; several aspects of GWP-ASan to be configured through the following methods:. - When the GWP-ASan library is compiled, by setting; ``-DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS`` to the options string you want set by default.; If you're building GWP-ASan as part of a compiler-rt/LLVM build, add it during; cmake configure time (e.g. ``cmake ... -DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=""...""``). If; you're building GWP-ASan outside of compiler-rt, simply ensure that you; specify ``-DGWP_ASAN_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=""...""`` when building; ``optional/options_parser.cpp``). - By defining a ``__gwp_asan_default_options`` function in one's program that; returns the options string to be parsed. Said function must have the following; prototype: ``extern ""C"" const char* __gwp_asan_default_options(void)``, with a; default visibility. This will override the compile time define;. - Depending on allocator support (Scudo has support for this mechanism): Through; an environment variable, containing the options string to be parsed. In Scudo,; this is through `SCUDO_OPTIONS=GWP_ASAN_${OPTION_NAME}=${VALUE}` (e.g.; `SCUDO_OPTIONS=GWP_ASAN_SampleRate=100`). Options defined this way will; override any definition made through ``__gwp_asan_default_options``. The options string follows a syntax similar to ASan, where distinct options; can be assigned in the same string, separated by colons. For example, using the environment variable:. .. code:: console.

Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time. With multiple workers, it is tempting to try to configure a shared cache; between the workers. Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc.. For builders without, incremental may be your best; option, but is likely to require higher ongoing involvement from the; sponsor. Enable batch builds; As a last resort, you can configure your builder to batch build requests.; This makes the build failure notifications markedly less actionable, and; should only be done once all other reasonable measures have been taken. Leave it on the staging buildmaster; While most of this section has been biased towards builders intended for; the main buildmaster, it is worth highlighting that builders can run; indefinitely on the staging buildmaster. Such a builder may still be; useful for the sponsoring organization, without concern of negatively; impacting the broader community.

The goal; In 2020, the monorepo had just under 35 thousand commits. This works; out to an average of 4 commits per hour. Already, we can see that a; builder must cycle in less than 15 minutes to have a hope of being; useful. However, those commits are not uniformly distributed. They; tend to cluster strongly during US working hours. Looking at a couple; of recent (Nov 2021) working days, we routinely see ~10 commits per; hour during peek times, with occasional spikes as high as ~15 commits; per hour. Thus, as a rule of thumb, we should plan for our builder to; complete ~10-15 builds an hour. Resource Appropriately; At 10-15 builds per hour, we need to complete a new build on average every; 4 to 6 minutes. For anything except the fastest of hardware/build configs,; this is going to be well beyond the ability of a single machine. In buildbot; terms, we likely going to need multiple workers to build requests in parallel; under a single builder configuration. For some rough back of the envelope; numbers, if your build config takes e.g. 30 minutes, you will need something; on the order of 5-8 workers. If your build config takes ~2 hours, you'll; need something on the order of 20-30 workers. The rest of this section; focuses on how to reduce cycle times. Restrict what you build and test; Think hard about why you're setting up a bot, and restrict your build; configuration as much as you can. Basic functionality is probably; already covered by other bots, and you don't need to duplicate that; testing. You only need to be building and testing the *unique* parts; of the configuration. (e.g. For a multi-stage clang builder, you probably; don't need to be enabling every target or building all the various utilities.). It can sometimes be worthwhile splitting a single builder into two or more,; if you have multiple distinct purposes for the same builder.

Check the existing build configurations to make sure the one you are; interested in is not covered yet or gets built on your computer much; faster than on the existing one. We prefer faster builds so developers; will get feedback sooner after changes get committed. #. The computer you will be registering with the LLVM buildbot; infrastructure should have all dependencies installed and be able to; build your configuration successfully. Please check what degree; of parallelism (-j param) would give the fastest build. You can build; multiple configurations on one computer. #. Install buildbot-worker (currently we are using buildbot version 2.8.4).; This specific version can be installed using ``pip``, with a command such; as ``pip3 install buildbot-worker==2.8.4``. #. Create a designated user account, your buildbot-worker will be running under,; and set appropriate permissions. #. Choose the buildbot-worker root directory (all builds will be placed under; it), buildbot-worker access name and password the build master will be using; to authenticate your buildbot-worker. #. Create a buildbot-worker in context of that buildbot-worker account.

Buildmasters; ============. There are two buildmasters running. * The main buildmaster at `<https://lab.llvm.org/buildbot>`_. All builders; attached to this machine will notify commit authors every time they break; the build.; * The staging buildmaster at `<https://lab.llvm.org/staging>`_. All builders; attached to this machine will be completely silent by default when the build; is broken. This buildmaster is reconfigured every two hours with any new; commits from the llvm-zorg repository. In order to remain connected to the main buildmaster (and thus notify; developers of failures), a builbot must:. * Be building a supported configuration. Builders for experimental backends; should generally be attached to staging buildmaster.; * Be able to keep up with new commits to the main branch, or at a minimum; recover to tip of tree within a couple of days of falling behind. Additionally, we encourage all bot owners to point their bots towards the; staging master during maintenance windows, instability troubleshooting, and; such. Roles & Expectations; ====================. Each buildbot has an owner who is the responsible party for addressing problems; which arise with said buildbot. We generally expect the bot owner to be; reasonably responsive. For some bots, the ownership responsibility is split between a ""resource owner""; who provides the underlying machine resource, and a ""configuration owner"" who; maintains the build configuration. Generally, operational responsibility lies; with the ""config owner"".

https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst:1200,Safety,recover,recover,1200,"===========. Introduction; ============. This document contains information about adding a build configuration and; buildbot-worker to private worker builder to LLVM Buildbot Infrastructure. Buildmasters; ============. There are two buildmasters running. * The main buildmaster at `<https://lab.llvm.org/buildbot>`_. All builders; attached to this machine will notify commit authors every time they break; the build.; * The staging buildmaster at `<https://lab.llvm.org/staging>`_. All builders; attached to this machine will be completely silent by default when the build; is broken. This buildmaster is reconfigured every two hours with any new; commits from the llvm-zorg repository. In order to remain connected to the main buildmaster (and thus notify; developers of failures), a builbot must:. * Be building a supported configuration. Builders for experimental backends; should generally be attached to staging buildmaster.; * Be able to keep up with new commits to the main branch, or at a minimum; recover to tip of tree within a couple of days of falling behind. Additionally, we encourage all bot owners to point their bots towards the; staging master during maintenance windows, instability troubleshooting, and; such. Roles & Expectations; ====================. Each buildbot has an owner who is the responsible party for addressing problems; which arise with said buildbot. We generally expect the bot owner to be; reasonably responsive. For some bots, the ownership responsibility is split between a ""resource owner""; who provides the underlying machine resource, and a ""configuration owner"" who; maintains the build configuration. Generally, operational responsibility lies; with the ""config owner"". We do expect ""resource owners"" - who are generally; the contact listed in a workers attributes - to proxy requests to the relevant; ""config owner"" in a timely manner. Most issues with a buildbot should be addressed directly with a bot owner; via email.

You only need to be building and testing the *unique* parts; of the configuration. (e.g. For a multi-stage clang builder, you probably; don't need to be enabling every target or building all the various utilities.). It can sometimes be worthwhile splitting a single builder into two or more,; if you have multiple distinct purposes for the same builder. As an example,; if you want to both a) confirm that all of LLVM builds with your host; compiler, and b) want to do a multi-stage clang build on your target, you; may be better off with two separate bots. Splitting increases resource; consumption, but makes it easy for each bot to keep up with commit flow.; Additionally, splitting bots may assist in triage by narrowing attention to; relevant parts of the failing configuration. In general, we recommend Release build types with Assertions enabled. This; generally provides a good balance between build times and bug detection for; most buildbots. There may be room for including some debug info (e.g. with; `-gmlt`), but in general the balance between debug info quality and build; times is a delicate one. Use Ninja & LLD; Ninja really does help build times over Make, particularly for highly; parallel builds. LLD helps to reduce both link times and memory usage; during linking significantly.

Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time. With multiple workers, it is tempting to try to configure a shared cache; between the workers. Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc.. For builders without, incremental may be your best; option, but is likely to require higher ongoing involvement from the; sponsor. Enable batch builds; As a last resort, you can configure your builder to batch build requests.; This makes the build failure notifications markedly less actionable, and; should only be done once all other reasonable measures have been taken. Leave it on the staging buildmaster; While most of this section has been biased towards builders intended for; the main buildmaster, it is worth highlighting that builders can run; indefinitely on the staging buildmaster. Such a builder may still be; useful for the sponsoring organization, without concern of negatively; impacting the broader community. The sponsoring organization simply; has to take on the responsibility of all bisection and triage. ; ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToAddABuilder.rst

In the Itanium C++ ABI the first member of an object is a pointer to the vtable; for its class. The vtable is often emitted into the object file with the key function; and must be imported for classes marked dllimport. The pointers must be globally; unique. Unfortunately, the COFF/PE file format does not provide a mechanism to; store a runtime address from another DLL into this pointer (although runtime; addresses are patched into the IAT). Therefore, the compiler must emit some code,; that runs after IAT patching but before anything that might use the vtable pointers,; and sets the vtable pointer to the address from the IAT. For the special case of; the references to vtables for __cxxabiv1::__class_type_info from typeinto objects; there is no declaration available to the compiler so this can't be done.

SJLJ exceptions, ""-fsjlj-exceptions"", are the only currently supported model. link.exe (the MS linker) is unsuitable as it doesn't support auto-importing which; is currently required to link correctly. However, if that limitation is removed; then there are no other known issues with using link.exe. Currently, there is a lack of a usable Windows compiler driver for Windows Itanium.; A reasonable work-around is to build clang with a windows-msvc default target and; then override the triple with e.g. ""-Xclang -triple -Xclang x86_64-unknown-windows-itanium"".; The linker can be specified with: ""-fuse-ld=lld"". In the Itanium C++ ABI the first member of an object is a pointer to the vtable; for its class. The vtable is often emitted into the object file with the key function; and must be imported for classes marked dllimport. The pointers must be globally; unique. Unfortunately, the COFF/PE file format does not provide a mechanism to; store a runtime address from another DLL into this pointer (although runtime; addresses are patched into the IAT). Therefore, the compiler must emit some code,; that runs after IAT patching but before anything that might use the vtable pointers,; and sets the vtable pointer to the address from the IAT.

Build a final release Clang (along with whatever other binaries you need); using the profile collected from your benchmark. In more detailed steps:. 1. Configure a Clang build as you normally would. It's highly recommended that; you use the Release configuration for this, since it will be used to build; another Clang. Because you need Clang and supporting libraries, you'll want; to build the ``all`` target (e.g. ``ninja all`` or ``make -j4 all``). 2. Configure a Clang build as above, but add the following CMake args:. - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_INSTRUMENTED=IR`` -- This causes us to build everything; with instrumentation.; - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=No`` -- A few projects have bad interactions when; built with profiling, and aren't necessary to build. This flag turns them; off.; - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 1.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang++`` - Same as above. In this build directory, you simply need to build the ``clang`` target (and; whatever supporting tooling your benchmark requires). 3. As mentioned above, this has two steps: gathering profile data, and then; massaging it into a useful form:. a. Build your benchmark using the Clang generated in step 2. The 'standard'; benchmark recommended is to run ``check-clang`` and ``check-llvm`` in your; instrumented Clang's build directory, and to do a full build of Clang/LLVM; using your instrumented Clang. So, create yet another build directory,; with the following CMake arguments:. - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage2/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 2.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage2/clang++`` - Same as above. If your users are fans of debug info, you may want to consider using; ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`` instead of; ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release``. This will grant better coverage of; debug info pieces of clang, but will take longer to complete and will; result in a much larger build directory. It's recommended to build the ``",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.rst

This will grant better coverage of; debug info pieces of clang, but will take longer to complete and will; result in a much larger build directory. It's recommended to build the ``all`` target with your instrumented Clang,; since more coverage is often better. b. You should now have a few ``*.profraw`` files in; ``path/to/stage2/profiles/``. You need to merge these using; ``llvm-profdata`` (even if you only have one! The profile merge transforms; profraw into actual profile data, as well). This can be done with; ``/path/to/stage1/llvm-profdata merge; -output=/path/to/output/profdata.prof path/to/stage2/profiles/*.profraw``. 4. Now, build your final, PGO-optimized Clang. To do this, you'll want to pass; the following additional arguments to CMake. - ``-DLLVM_PROFDATA_FILE=/path/to/output/profdata.prof`` - Use the PGO; profile from the previous step.; - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 1.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang++`` - Same as above. From here, you can build whatever targets you need. .. note::; You may see warnings about a mismatched profile in the build output. These; are generally harmless. To silence them, you can add; ``-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS='-Wno-backend-plugin'; -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-Wno-backend-plugin'`` to your CMake invocation. Congrats! You now have a Clang built with profile-guided optimizations, and you; can delete all but the final build directory if you'd like. If this worked well for you and you plan on doing it often, there's a slight; optimization that can be made: LLVM and Clang have a tool called tblgen that's; built and run during the build process. While it's potentially nice to build; this for coverage as part of step 3, none of your other builds should benefit; from building it. You can pass the CMake option; ``-DLLVM_NATIVE_TOOL_DIR=/path/to/stage1/bin``; to steps 2 and onward to avoid these useless rebuilds.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.rst

If you; wish to use lld to link the tests then add ``""-fuse-ld=lld``. Once cmake has completed the tests can be built and run using; ``ninja check-builtins``. Troubleshooting; ===============. The cmake try compile stage fails; ---------------------------------; At an early stage cmake will attempt to compile and link a simple C program to; test if the toolchain is working. This stage can often fail at link time if the ``--sysroot=`` and; ``--gcc-toolchain=`` options are not passed to the compiler. Check the; ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` and ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET`` flags. It can be useful to build a simple example outside of cmake with your toolchain; to make sure it is working. For example: ``clang --target=arm-linux-gnueabi -march=armv7a --gcc-toolchain=/path/to/gcc-toolchain --sysroot=/path/to/gcc-toolchain/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc helloworld.c``. Clang uses the host header files; --------------------------------; On debian based systems it is possible to install multiarch support for; arm-linux-gnueabi and arm-linux-gnueabihf. In many cases clang can successfully; use this multiarch support when ``--gcc-toolchain=`` and ``--sysroot=`` are not supplied.; Unfortunately clang adds ``/usr/local/include`` before; ``/usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf`` leading to errors when compiling the hosts; header files. The multiarch support is not sufficient to build the builtins you will need to; use a separate arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain. No target passed to clang; -------------------------; If clang is not given a target it will typically use the host target, this will; not understand the Arm assembly language files resulting in error messages such; as ``error: unknown directive .syntax unified``. You can check the clang invocation in the error message to see if there is no; ``--target`` or if it is set incorrectly. The cause is usually; ``CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS`` not containing ``--target`` or ``CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER_TARGET`` not being pr",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToCrossCompileBuiltinsOnArm.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToCrossCompileBuiltinsOnArm.rst

Prerequisites; =============. In this use case we'll be using cmake on a Debian-based Linux system,; cross-compiling from an x86_64 host to a hard-float Armv7-A target. We'll be; using as many of the LLVM tools as we can, but it is possible to use GNU; equivalents. * ``A build of LLVM/clang for the llvm-tools and llvm-config``; * ``A clang executable with support for the ARM target``; * ``compiler-rt sources``; * ``The qemu-arm user mode emulator``; * ``An arm-linux-gnueabihf sysroot``. In this example we will be using ninja. See https://compiler-rt.llvm.org/ for more information about the dependencies; on clang and LLVM. See https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html for information about obtaining; the source for LLVM and compiler-rt. Note that the getting started guide; places compiler-rt in the projects subdirectory, but this is not essential and; if you are using the BaremetalARM.cmake cache for v6-M, v7-M and v7-EM then; compiler-rt must be placed in the runtimes directory. ``qemu-arm`` should be available as a package for your Linux distribution. The most complicated of the prerequisites to satisfy is the arm-linux-gnueabihf; sysroot. In theory it is possible to use the Linux distributions multiarch; support to fulfill the dependencies for building but unfortunately due to; /usr/local/include being added some host includes are selected. The easiest way; to supply a sysroot is to download the arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain. This can; be found at:; * https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads for gcc 8 and above; * https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/ for gcc 4.9 to 7.3. Building compiler-rt builtins for Arm; =====================================; We will be doing a standalone build of compiler-rt using the following cmake; options. * ``path",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToCrossCompileBuiltinsOnArm.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToCrossCompileBuiltinsOnArm.rst

The ``build-c-flags`` need to be sufficient to pass the C-make compiler check,; compile compiler-rt, and if you are running the tests, compile and link the; tests. When cross-compiling with clang we will need to pass sufficient; information to generate code for the Arm architecture we are targeting. We will; need to select the Arm target, select the Armv7-A architecture and choose; between using Arm or Thumb.; instructions. For example:. * ``--target=arm-linux-gnueabihf``; * ``-march=armv7a``; * ``-mthumb``. When using a GCC arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain the following flags are; needed to pick up the includes and libraries:. * ``--gcc-toolchain=/path/to/dir/toolchain``; * ``--sysroot=/path/to/toolchain/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc``. In this example we will be adding all of the command line options to both; ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` and ``CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS``. There are cmake flags to pass some of; these options individually which can be used to simplify the ``build-c-flags``:. * ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET=""arm-linux-gnueabihf""``; * ``-DCMAKE_ASM_COMPILER_TARGET=""arm-linux-gnueabihf""``; * ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/dir/toolchain``; * ``-DCMAKE_SYSROOT=/path/to/dir/toolchain/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc``. Once cmake has completed the builtins can be built with ``ninja builtins``.

However, if you're using Clang, the driver might not be up-to-date with your; specific Linux distribution, version or GCC layout, so you'll need to fudge. In addition to the ones above, you'll also need:. * ``--target=arm-linux-gnueabihf`` or whatever is the triple of your cross GCC.; * ``'--sysroot=/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf'``, ``'--sysroot=/opt/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabihf'``; or whatever is the location of your GCC's sysroot (where /lib, /bin etc are).; * Appropriate use of ``-I`` and ``-L``, depending on how the cross GCC is installed,; and where are the libraries and headers.

TODO: Add MIPS and other platforms to this document. Cross-Compiling from x86_64 to ARM; ==================================. In this use case, we'll be using CMake and Ninja, on a Debian-based Linux; system, cross-compiling from an x86_64 host (most Intel and AMD chips; nowadays) to a hard-float ARM target (most ARM targets nowadays). The packages you'll need are:. * ``cmake``; * ``ninja-build`` (from backports in Ubuntu); * ``gcc-4.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf``; * ``gcc-4.7-multilib-arm-linux-gnueabihf``; * ``binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf``; * ``libgcc1-armhf-cross``; * ``libsfgcc1-armhf-cross``; * ``libstdc++6-armhf-cross``; * ``libstdc++6-4.7-dev-armhf-cross``. Configuring CMake; -----------------. For more information on how to configure CMake for LLVM/Clang,; see :doc:`CMake`. The CMake options you need to add are:. * ``-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=<target-system>``; * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-dir>``; * ``-DLLVM_HOST_TRIPLE=arm-linux-gnueabihf``; * ``-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=ARM``. Note: ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` is always set automatically when ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` is set. Don't put ``-DCMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING=TRUE`` in your options. Also note that ``LLVM_HOST_TRIPLE`` specifies the triple of the system; that the cross built LLVM is going to run on - the flag is named based; on the autoconf build/host/target nomenclature. (This flag implicitly sets; other defaults, such as ``LLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE``.). If you're compiling with GCC, you can use architecture options for your target,; and the compiler driver will detect everything that it needs:. * ``-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-march=armv7-a -mcpu=cortex-a9 -mfloat-abi=hard'``. However, if you're using Clang, the driver might not be up-to-date with your; specific Linux distribution, version or GCC layout, so you'll need to fudge.

Configuring CMake; -----------------. For more information on how to configure CMake for LLVM/Clang,; see :doc:`CMake`. The CMake options you need to add are:. * ``-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=<target-system>``; * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-dir>``; * ``-DLLVM_HOST_TRIPLE=arm-linux-gnueabihf``; * ``-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=ARM``. Note: ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` is always set automatically when ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` is set. Don't put ``-DCMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING=TRUE`` in your options. Also note that ``LLVM_HOST_TRIPLE`` specifies the triple of the system; that the cross built LLVM is going to run on - the flag is named based; on the autoconf build/host/target nomenclature. (This flag implicitly sets; other defaults, such as ``LLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE``.). If you're compiling with GCC, you can use architecture options for your target,; and the compiler driver will detect everything that it needs:. * ``-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-march=armv7-a -mcpu=cortex-a9 -mfloat-abi=hard'``. However, if you're using Clang, the driver might not be up-to-date with your; specific Linux distribution, version or GCC layout, so you'll need to fudge. In addition to the ones above, you'll also need:. * ``--target=arm-linux-gnueabihf`` or whatever is the triple of your cross GCC.; * ``'--sysroot=/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf'``, ``'--sysroot=/opt/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabihf'``; or whatever is the location of your GCC's sysroot (where /lib, /bin etc are).; * Appropriate use of ``-I`` and ``-L``, depending on how the cross GCC is installed,; and where are the libraries and headers. You may also want to set the ``LLVM_NATIVE_TOOL_DIR`` option - pointing; at a directory with prebuilt LLVM tools (``llvm-tblgen``, ``clang-tblgen``; etc) for the build host, allowing you to them reuse them if available.; E.g. ``-DLLVM_NATIVE_TOOL_DIR=<path-to-native-llv",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToCrossCompileLLVM.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToCrossCompileLLVM.rst

This section describes a few administrative tasks that need to be done for the; release process to begin. Specifically, it involves:. * Updating version numbers,. * Creating the release branch, and. * Tagging release candidates for the release team to begin testing. Create Release Branch; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Branch the Git trunk using the following procedure:. #. Remind developers that the release branching is imminent and to refrain from; committing patches that might break the build. E.g., new features, large; patches for works in progress, an overhaul of the type system, an exciting; new TableGen feature, etc. #. Verify that the current git trunk is in decent shape by; examining nightly tester and buildbot results. #.

Tagging the LLVM Release Candidates; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Tag release candidates:. ::. $ git tag -sa llvmorg-X.Y.Z-rcN. The Release Manager must supply pre-packaged source tarballs for users. This can; be done with the export.sh script in utils/release. Tarballs, release binaries, or any other release artifacts must be uploaded to; GitHub. This can be done using the github-upload-release.py script in utils/release. ::. $ github-upload-release.py upload --token <github-token> --release X.Y.Z-rcN --files <release_files>. ::. $ ./export.sh -release X.Y.Z -rc $RC. This will generate source tarballs for each LLVM project being validated, which; can be uploaded to github for further testing. Build The Binary Distribution; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Creating the binary distribution requires following the instructions; :doc:`here <ReleaseProcess>`. That process will perform both Release+Asserts and Release builds but only; pack the Release build for upload. You should use the Release+Asserts sysroot,; normally under ``final/Phase3/Release+Asserts/llvmCore-3.8.1-RCn.install/``,; for test-suite and run-time benchmarks, to make sure nothing serious has; passed through the net. For compile-time benchmarks, use the Release version. The minimum required version of the tools you'll need are :doc:`here <GettingStarted>`. Release Qualification Criteria; ------------------------------. There are no official release qualification criteria. It is up to the; the release manager to determine when a release is ready. The release manager; should pay attention to the results of community testing, the number of outstanding; bugs, and then number of regressions when determining whether or not to make a; release. The community values time based releases, so releases should not be delayed for; too long unless there are critical issues remaining.

Community Testing; -----------------. Once all testing has been completed and appropriate bugs filed, the release; candidate tarballs are put on the website and the LLVM community is notified. We ask that all LLVM developers test the release in any the following ways:. #. Download ``llvm-X.Y``, ``llvm-test-X.Y``, and the appropriate ``clang``; binary. Build LLVM. Run ``make check`` and the full LLVM test suite (``make; TEST=nightly report``). #. Download ``llvm-X.Y``, ``llvm-test-X.Y``, and the ``clang`` sources. Compile; everything.

Run the :doc:`release process <ReleaseProcess>`, if your platform is; *different* than that which is officially supported, and report back errors; only if they were not reported by the official release tester for that; architecture. We also ask that the OS distribution release managers test their packages with; the first candidate of every release, and report any *new* errors in GitHub.; If the bug can be reproduced with an unpatched upstream version of the release; candidate (as opposed to the distribution's own build), the priority should be; release blocker. During the first round of testing, all regressions must be fixed before the; second release candidate is tagged.

Release Patch Rules; -------------------. Below are the rules regarding patching the release branch:. #.

Copy and commit the ``llvm/docs`` and ``LICENSE.txt`` files into this new; directory. #. Update the ``releases/download.html`` file with links to the release; binaries on GitHub. #. Update the ``releases/index.html`` with the new release and link to release; documentation. #. After you push the changes to the www-releases repo, someone with admin; access must login to prereleases-origin.llvm.org and manually pull the new; changes into /data/www-releases/. This is where the website is served from. #. Finally checkout the llvm-www repo and update the main page; (``index.html`` and sidebar) to point to the new release and release; announcement. Announce the Release; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Create a new post in the `Announce Category <https://discourse.llvm.org/c/announce>`_; once all the release tasks are complete. For X.1.0 releases, make sure to include a; link to the release notes in the post. For X.1.1+ releases, generate a changelog; using this command and add it to the post. ::. $ git log --format=""- %aN: [%s (%h)](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/%H)"" llvmorg-X.1.N-1..llvmorg-X.1.N.

Introduction; ============. This document contains information about successfully releasing LLVM ---; including sub-projects: e.g., ``clang`` and ``compiler-rt`` --- to the public.; It is the Release Manager's responsibility to ensure that a high quality build; of LLVM is released. If you're looking for the document on how to test the release candidates and; create the binary packages, please refer to the :doc:`ReleaseProcess` instead. .. _timeline:. Release Timeline; ================. LLVM is released on a time based schedule --- with major releases roughly; every 6 months. In between major releases there may be dot releases.; The release manager will determine if and when to make a dot release based; on feedback from the community. Typically, dot releases should be made if; there are large number of bug-fixes in the stable branch or a critical bug; has been discovered that affects a large number of users. Unless otherwise stated, dot releases will follow the same procedure as; major releases. Annual Release Schedule; -----------------------. Here is the annual release schedule for LLVM.

Introduction; ============. This document contains information about successfully releasing LLVM ---; including sub-projects: e.g., ``clang`` and ``compiler-rt`` --- to the public.; It is the Release Manager's responsibility to ensure that a high quality build; of LLVM is released. If you're looking for the document on how to test the release candidates and; create the binary packages, please refer to the :doc:`ReleaseProcess` instead. .. _timeline:. Release Timeline; ================. LLVM is released on a time based schedule --- with major releases roughly; every 6 months. In between major releases there may be dot releases.; The release manager will determine if and when to make a dot release based; on feedback from the community. Typically, dot releases should be made if; there are large number of bug-fixes in the stable branch or a critical bug; has been discovered that affects a large number of users. Unless otherwise stated, dot releases will follow the same procedure as; major releases. Annual Release Schedule; -----------------------. Here is the annual release schedule for LLVM.

Background; ==========. LLVM avoids using C++'s built in RTTI. Instead, it pervasively uses its; own hand-rolled form of RTTI which is much more efficient and flexible,; although it requires a bit more work from you as a class author. A description of how to use LLVM-style RTTI from a client's perspective is; given in the `Programmer's Manual <ProgrammersManual.html#isa>`_. This; document, in contrast, discusses the steps you need to take as a class; hierarchy author to make LLVM-style RTTI available to your clients. Before diving in, make sure that you are familiar with the Object Oriented; Programming concept of ""`is-a`_"". .. _is-a: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-a. Basic Setup; ===========. This section describes how to set up the most basic form of LLVM-style RTTI; (which is sufficient for 99.9% of the cases). We will set up LLVM-style; RTTI for this class hierarchy:. .. code-block:: c++. class Shape {; public:; Shape() {}; virtual double computeArea() = 0;; };. class Square : public Shape {; double SideLength;; public:; Square(double S) : SideLength(S) {}; double computeArea() override;; };. class Circle : public Shape {; double Radius;; public:; Circle(double R) : Radius(R) {}; double computeArea() override;; };. The most basic working setup for LLVM-style RTTI requires the following; steps:. #. In the header where you declare ``Shape``, you will want to ``#include; ""llvm/Support/Casting.h""``, which declares LLVM's RTTI templates. That; way your clients don't even have to think about it. .. code-block:: c++. #include ""llvm/Support/Casting.h"". #. In the base class, introduce an enum which discriminates all of the; different concrete classes in the hierarchy, and stash the enum value; somewhere in the base class. Here is the code after introducing this change:. .. code-block:: c++. ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst

The code of the ``isa<>`` test in this code will eventually boil; down---after template instantiation and some other machinery---to a; check roughly like ``Circle::classof(S)``. For more information, see; :ref:`classof-contract`. The argument to ``classof`` should always be an *ancestor* class because; the implementation has logic to allow and optimize away; upcasts/up-``isa<>``'s automatically. It is as though every class; ``Foo`` automatically has a ``classof`` like:. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo {; [...]; template <class T>; static bool classof(const T *,; ::std::enable_if<; ::std::is_base_of<Foo, T>::value; >::type* = 0) { return true; }; [...]; };. Note that this is the reason that we did not need to introduce a; ``classof`` into ``Shape``: all relevant classes derive from ``Shape``,; and ``Shape`` itself is abstract (has no entry in the ``Kind`` enum),; so this notional inferred ``classof`` is all we need. See `Concrete; Bases and Deeper Hierarchies`_ for more information about how to extend; this example to more general hierarchies. Although for this small example setting up LLVM-style RTTI seems like a lot; of ""boilerplate"", if your classes are doing anything interesting then this; will end up being a tiny fraction of the code. Concrete Bases and Deeper Hierarchies; =====================================. For concrete bases (i.e. non-abstract interior nodes of the inheritance; tree), the ``Kind`` check inside ``classof`` needs to be a bit more; complicated. The situation differs from the example above in that. * Since the class is concrete, it must itself have an entry in the ``Kind``; enum because it is possible to have objects with this class as a dynamic; type. * Since the class has children, the check inside ``classof`` must take them; into account.

The underlying implementation of isa/cast/dyn_cast is all controlled through a; struct called ``CastInfo``. ``CastInfo`` provides 4 methods, ``isPossible``,; ``doCast``, ``castFailed``, and ``doCastIfPossible``. These are for ``isa``,; ``cast``, and ``dyn_cast``, in order. You can control the way your cast is; performed by creating a specialization of the ``CastInfo`` struct (to your; desired types) that provides the same static methods as the base ``CastInfo``; struct. This can be a lot of boilerplate, so we also have what we call Cast Traits.; These are structs that provide one or more of the above methods so you can; factor out common casting patterns in your project. We provide a few in the; header file ready to be used, and we'll show a few examples motivating their; usage. These examples are not exhaustive, and adding new cast traits is easy; so users should feel free to add them to their project, or contribute them if; they're particularly useful!. Value to value casting; ----------------------; In this case, we have a struct that is what we call 'nullable' - i.e. it is; constructible from ``nullptr`` and that results in a value you can tell is; invalid. .. code-block:: c++. class SomeValue {; public:; SomeValue(void *ptr) : ptr(ptr) {}; void *getPointer() const { return ptr; }; bool isValid() const { return ptr != nullptr; }; private:; void *pt",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst

Background; ==========. LLVM avoids using C++'s built in RTTI. Instead, it pervasively uses its; own hand-rolled form of RTTI which is much more efficient and flexible,; although it requires a bit more work from you as a class author. A description of how to use LLVM-style RTTI from a client's perspective is; given in the `Programmer's Manual <ProgrammersManual.html#isa>`_. This; document, in contrast, discusses the steps you need to take as a class; hierarchy author to make LLVM-style RTTI available to your clients. Before diving in, make sure that you are familiar with the Object Oriented; Programming concept of ""`is-a`_"". .. _is-a: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-a. Basic Setup; ===========. This section describes how to set up the most basic form of LLVM-style RTTI; (which is sufficient for 99.9% of the cases). We will set up LLVM-style; RTTI for this class hierarchy:. .. code-block:: c++. class Shape {; public:; Shape() {}; virtual double computeArea() = 0;; };. class Square : public Shape {; double SideLength;; public:; Square(double S) : SideLength(S) {}; double computeArea() override;; };. class Circle : public Shape {; double Radius;; public:; Circle(double R) : Radius(R) {}; double computeArea() override;; };. The most basic working setup for LLVM-style RTTI requires the following; steps:. #. In the header where you declare ``Shape``, you will want to ``#include; ""llvm/Support/Casting.h""``, which declares LLVM's RTTI templates. That; way your clients don't even have to think about it. .. code-block:: c++. #include ""llvm/Support/Casting.h"". #. In the base class, introduce an enum which discriminates all of the; different concrete classes in the hierarchy, and stash the enum value; somewhere in the base class.

You will usually want to keep the ``Kind`` member encapsulated and; private, but let the enum ``ShapeKind`` be public along with providing a; ``getKind()`` method. This is convenient for clients so that they can do; a ``switch`` over the enum. A common naming convention is that these enums are ""kind""s, to avoid; ambiguity with the words ""type"" or ""class"" which have overloaded meanings; in many contexts within LLVM. Sometimes there will be a natural name for; it, like ""opcode"". Don't bikeshed over this; when in doubt use ``Kind``. You might wonder why the ``Kind`` enum doesn't have an entry for; ``Shape``. The reason for this is that since ``Shape`` is abstract; (``computeArea() = 0;``), you will never actually have non-derived; instances of exactly that class (only subclasses). See `Concrete Bases; and Deeper Hierarchies`_ for information on how to deal with; non-abstract bases. It's worth mentioning here that unlike; ``dynamic_cast<>``, LLVM-style RTTI can be used (and is often used) for; classes that don't have v-tables. #. Next, you need to make sure that the ``Kind`` gets initialized to the; value corresponding to the dynamic type of the class. Typically, you will; want to have it be an argument to the constructor of the base class, and; then pass in the respective ``XXXKind`` from subclass constructors.

A Bug to be Aware Of; --------------------. The example just given opens the door to bugs where the ``classof``\s are; not updated to match the ``Kind`` enum when adding (or removing) classes to; (from) the hierarchy. Continuing the example above, suppose we add a ``SomewhatSpecialSquare`` as; a subclass of ``Square``, and update the ``ShapeKind`` enum like so:. .. code-block:: c++. enum ShapeKind {; SK_Square,; SK_SpecialSquare,; SK_OtherSpecialSquare,; + SK_SomewhatSpecialSquare,; SK_Circle; }. Now, suppose that we forget to update ``Square::classof()``, so it still; looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. static bool classof(const Shape *S) {; // BUG: Returns false when S->getKind() == SK_SomewhatSpecialSquare,; // even though SomewhatSpecialSquare ""is a"" Square.; return S->getKind() >= SK_Square &&; S->getKind() <= SK_OtherSpecialSquare;; }. As the comment indicates, this code contains a bug. A straightforward and; non-clever way to avoid this is to introduce an explicit ``SK_LastSquare``; entry in the enum when adding the first subclass(es). For example, we could; rewrite the example at the beginning of `Concrete Bases and Deeper; Hierarchies`_ as:. .. code-block:: c++. enum ShapeKind {; SK_Square,; + SK_SpecialSquare,; + SK_OtherSpecialSquare,; + SK_LastSquare,; SK_Circle; }; ...; // Square::classof(); - static bool classof(const Shape *S) {; - return S->getKind() == SK_Square;; - }; + static bool classof(const Shape *S) {; + return S->getKind() >= SK_Square &&; + S->getKind() <= SK_LastSquare;; + }. Then, adding new subclasses is easy:. .. code-block:: c++. enum ShapeKind {; SK_Square,; SK_SpecialSquare,; SK_OtherSpecialSquare,; + SK_SomewhatSpecialSquare,; SK_LastSquare,; SK_Circle; }.

For; now, we assume that the types we want to cast *to* all provide ``classof``. So; we can use some provided cast traits like so:. .. code-block:: c++. template <typename T>; struct CastInfo<T, SomeValue>; : CastIsPossible<T, SomeValue>, NullableValueCastFailed<T>,; DefaultDoCastIfPossible<T, SomeValue, CastInfo<T, SomeValue>> {; static T doCast(SomeValue v) {; return T(v.getPointer());; }; };. Pointer to value casting; ------------------------; Now given the value above ``SomeValue``, maybe we'd like to be able to cast to; that type from a char pointer type. So what we would do in that case is:. .. code-block:: c++. template <typename T>; struct CastInfo<SomeValue, T *>; : NullableValueCastFailed<SomeValue>,; DefaultDoCastIfPossible<SomeValue, T *, CastInfo<SomeValue, T *>> {; static bool isPossible(const T *t) {; return std::is_same<T, char>::value;; }; static SomeValue doCast(const T *t) {; return SomeValue((void *)t);; }; };. This would enable us to cast from a ``char *`` to a SomeValue, if we wanted to. Optional value casting; ----------------------; When your types are not constructible from ``nullptr`` or there isn't a simple; way to tell when an object is invalid, you may want to use ``std::optional``.; In those cases, you probably want something like this:. .. code-block:: c++. template <typename T>; struct CastInfo<T, SomeValue> : OptionalValueCast<T, SomeValue> {};. That cast trait requires that ``T`` is constructible from ``const SomeValue &``; but it enables casting like so:. .. code-block:: c++. SomeValue someVal = ...;; std::optional<AnotherValue> valOr = dyn_cast<AnotherValue>(someVal);. With the ``_if_present`` variants, you can even do optional chaining like this:. .. code-block:: c++. std::optional<SomeValue> someVal = ...;; std::optional<AnotherValue> valOr = dyn_cast_if_present<AnotherValue>(someVal);. and ``valOr`` will be ``std::nullopt`` if either ``someVal`` cannot be converted *or*; if ``someVal`` was also ``std::nullopt``.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst

This document describes what you can do to increase the odds of; getting it fixed quickly. 🔒 If you believe that the bug is security related, please follow :ref:`report-security-issue`. 🔒. Basically you have to do two things at a minimum. First, decide whether the; bug `crashes the compiler`_ or if the compiler is `miscompiling`_ the program; (i.e., the compiler successfully produces an executable, but it doesn't run; right).

Jump ahead to :ref:`front-end bugs; <frontend-crash>`. * ``-emit-llvm``: If ``clang`` crashes with this option (which disables; the code generator), you found a middle-end optimizer bug. Jump ahead to; :ref:`middle-end bugs <middleend-crash>`. * Otherwise, you have a backend code generator crash. Jump ahead to :ref:`code; generator bugs <backend-crash>`. .. _frontend-crash:.

The bug description should contain the following information:. * All information necessary to reproduce the problem.; * The reduced test-case that triggers the bug.; * The location where you obtained LLVM (if not from our Git; repository). Thanks for helping us make LLVM better!. .. _crashes the compiler:. Crashing Bugs; =============. More often than not, bugs in the compiler cause it to crash---often due to; an assertion failure of some sort. The most important piece of the puzzle; is to figure out if it is crashing in the Clang front-end or if it is one of; the LLVM libraries (e.g. the optimizer or code generator) that has; problems. To figure out which component is crashing (the front-end, middle-end; optimizer, or backend code generator), run the ``clang`` command line as you; were when the crash occurred, but with the following extra command line; options:. * ``-emit-llvm -Xclang -disable-llvm-passes``: If ``clang`` still crashes when; passed these options (which disable the optimizer and code generator), then; the crash is in the front-end. Jump ahead to :ref:`front-end bugs; <frontend-crash>`. * ``-emit-llvm``: If ``clang`` crashes with this option (which disables; the code generator), you found a middle-end optimizer bug. Jump ahead to; :ref:`middle-end bugs <middleend-crash>`. * Otherwise, you have a backend code generator crash. Jump ahead to :ref:`code; generator bugs <backend-crash>`. .. _frontend-crash:. Front-end bugs; --------------. On a ``clang`` crash, the compiler will dump a preprocessed file and a script; to replay the ``clang`` command. For example, you should see something like. .. code-block:: text.
