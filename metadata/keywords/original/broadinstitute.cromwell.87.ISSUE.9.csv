https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5546:1079,Usability,clear,clears,1079,"While investigating the Dockerhub outage [0][1] and the Quay outage [2] we found that Cromwell can get into a bad state that interferes with Docker hash lookups. Rebooting Cromwell fixes the problem. On Friday 6/12 I was demoing the repro scenario I've been working on and I mentioned that I can't easily go from a ""broken Quay"" to a ""working Quay"" scenario because I have to restart Cromwell to pick up the DNS change... _restart Cromwell to pick up the DNS change_. _restart Cromwell to pick up the DNS change?_. _restart Cromwell to pick up the DNS change!!!_. Yesterday 6/15 I discovered that the JVM has a DNS cache with an infinite TTL [3]. Lowering this to a reasonable value allowed my test scenario to work without restarting the JVM, which it didn't before. Here is my theory:; 1. A Docker repo starts taking on water and engineers scramble to fix it; 2. They make infrastructure changes that change DNS records.; 3. Cromwell's retained DNS record breaks the ability to communicate with the repo indefinitely, even after the outage is resolved.; 4. Restarting Cromwell clears the cache.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5579:926,Availability,avail,available,926,"Due to ambiguity in the explanation of how to pose questions rather than issues I will post this question (with the same text) here too and see whether it will get removed or answered. This question is the same as [the one I posted a week ago on biostars](https://www.biostars.org/p/448662/). I would like to apologize in advance for any ignorance regarding the documentation that I might have missed. It is not my intention to ask for what I would have known if I had read the documentation better, I am merely trying to grasp the concepts that are abstracted in the Cromwell metadata as described by [the paragraph about metadata in the Cromwell docs](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/SubWorkflows/). When executing a workflow written in WDL and executed with Cromwell (the scientific workflow engine) one can extract metadata out of the Cromwell database. Within this metadata, the following ""executionEvents"" are available for each ""workflow.task"" in the ""calls"" objects. Pending; Requesting ExecutionToken; WaitingFor ValueStore; PreparingJob; CallCache Reading; RunningJob; Updating CallCache; Updating JobStore. From the documentation:; [Call Caching](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cromwell_features/CallCaching/) allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so that it doesn't have to re-compute results, saving both time and money. The main purpose of the [Job Store table](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/bitesize/workflowExecution/workflowSubworkflowAndJobStores/#job-store-job_store_entry) is to support resuming execution of a workflow when Cromwell is restarted by recovering the outputs of completed jobs.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5582:752,Usability,clear,clearly,752,"Hi everyone, this is as far as I can get on my own trying to introduce SQLite support into Cromwell. I have highlighted reasons to support Sqlite on Cromwell elsewhere. This is as far as I could get without help:. + Migration scheme correctly implemented. All the necessary tables with all the correct constraints (foreign key, unique, primary key) are created on startup.; + Updated upstream liquibase in order to allow unique constraints to be defined properly.; + Made sure all the types were converted in SQLite types (TEXT, INTEGER, BLOB etc.); + Updated the testing to understand SQLite types properly. So far so good. Unfortunately the testing does not recognize the foreign key, primary key or unique constraints, even though they are defined (clearly visible in the sqlitebrowser). . Since the testing is just testing, I also decided to run cromwell with a workflow, but that does not work: ; ```; [ERROR] [07/20/2020 14:01:02.134] [cromwell-system-akka.dispatchers.engine-dispatcher-50] [akka://cromwell-system/user/cromwell-service/WorkflowStoreActor/WorkflowStoreEngineActor] Error trying to fetch new workflows; org.sqlite.SQLiteException: [SQLITE_ERROR] SQL error or missing database (near ""for"": syntax error); at org.sqlite.core.DB.newSQLException(DB.java:1010); at org.sqlite.core.DB.newSQLException(DB.java:1022); at org.sqlite.core.DB.throwex(DB.java:987); at org.sqlite.core.NativeDB.prepare_utf8(Native Method); at org.sqlite.core.NativeDB.prepare(NativeDB.java:134); at org.sqlite.core.DB.prepare(DB.java:264); at org.sqlite.core.CorePreparedStatement.<init>(CorePreparedStatement.java:45); at org.sqlite.jdbc3.JDBC3PreparedStatement.<init>(JDBC3PreparedStatement.java:30); at org.sqlite.jdbc4.JDBC4PreparedStatement.<init>(JDBC4PreparedStatement.java:19); at org.sqlite.jdbc4.JDBC4Connection.prepareStatement(JDBC4Connection.java:35); at org.sqlite.jdbc3.JDBC3Connection.prepareStatement(JDBC3Connection.java:241); at org.sqlite.jdbc3.JDBC3Connection.prepareStatement(JDBC3Conne",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5582

I have no idea what `serviceusage.services.use` is and how to activate it. The tutorial is also very weirdly written. It seems like there used to be a tutorial about JES/PAPIv1 and then it got updated with a notice for PAPIv2. It is completely unclear whether the user is supposed to use JES/PAPIv1 or PAPIv2.
