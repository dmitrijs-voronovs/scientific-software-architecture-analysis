To this end, salmon provides the ability to index both the transcriptome as well as decoy seuqence that can be considered during mapping and quantification. The decoy sequence accounts for reads that might otherwise be (spuriously) attributed to some annotated transcript. This [tutorial](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/) provides a step-by-step guide on how to efficiently index the reference transcriptome and genome to produce a decoy-aware index. Specifically, there are 3 possible ways in which the salmon index can be created:. * cDNA-only index : salmon_index - https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/getting_started/. This method will result in the smallest index and require the least resources to build, but will be the most prone to possible spurious alignments. * SA mashmap index: salmon_partial_sa_index - (regions of genome that have high sequence similarity to the transcriptome) - Details can be found in [this README](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/README.md) and using [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/master/scripts/generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh). While running mashmap can require considerable resources, the resulting decoy files are fairly small. This will result in an index bigger than the cDNA-only index, but still mucch smaller than the full genome index below.

While running mashmap can require considerable resources, the resulting decoy files are fairly small. This will result in an index bigger than the cDNA-only index, but still mucch smaller than the full genome index below. It will confer many, though not all, of the benefits of using the entire genome as a decoy sequence. * SAF genome index: salmon_sa_index - (the full genome is used as decoy) - The tutorial for creating such an index can be found [here](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/). This will result in the largest index, but likely does the best job in avoiding spurious alignments to annotated transcripts. . **Facing problems with Indexing?**, Check if anyone else already had this problem in the issues section or fill the index generation [request form](https://forms.gle/3baJc5SYrkSWb1z48). ### **NOTE**:; If you are generating an index to be used for single-cell or single-nucleus quantification with [alevin-fry](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry), then we recommend you consider building a spliced+intron (_splici_) reference. This serves much of the purpose of a decoy-aware index when quantifying with alevin-fry, while also providing the capability to attribute splicing status to mapped fragments.

Single-cell protocol specific notes; ------------------------------------. In cases where single-cell protocol supports variable length cellbarcodes, alevin adds nucleotide padding to make the lengths uniform.; Furthermore, the padding scheme ensures that there are no collisions added in the process. The padding scheme is as follows:. 1. sci-RNA-seq3: The barcode is composed of 9-10 bp hairpin adaptor and 10 bp reverse transcription index making it 19-20 bp long. If the bacode is 20 bp long, alevin adds *A* and it adds *AC* if it is 19 bp long. Thus, the length of barcode in the output is 21 bp.; 2. inDropV2: 8-11 bp barcode1 along with 8 bp barcode2 makes up the barcode.

Integrability,protocol,protocols,".. _FragLibType:. Fragment Library Types; ======================. There are numerous library preparation protocols for RNA-seq that result in; sequencing reads with different characteristics. For example, reads can be; single end (only one side of a fragment is recorded as a read) or paired-end; (reads are generated from both ends of a fragment). Further, the sequencing; reads themselves may be unstranded or strand-specific. Finally, paired-end; protocols will have a specified relative orientation. To characterize the; various different typs of sequencing libraries, we've created a miniature; ""language"" that allows for the succinct description of the many different types; of possible fragment libraries. For paired-end reads, the possible; orientations, along with a graphical description of what they mean, are; illustrated below:. .. image:: ReadLibraryIllustration.png. The library type string consists of three parts: the relative orientation of; the reads, the strandedness of the library, and the directionality of the; reads. The first part of the library string (relative orientation) is only provided if; the library is paired-end. The possible options are:. ::. I = inward; O = outward; M = matching. The second part of the read library string specifies whether the protocol is; stranded or unstranded; the options are:. ::. S = stranded; U = unstranded. If the protocol is unstranded, then we're done. The final part of the library; string specifies the strand from which the read originates in a strand-specific; protocol — it is only provided if the library is stranded (i.e. if the; library format string is of the form S). The possible values are:. ::. F = read 1 (or single-end read) comes from the forward strand; R = read 1 (or single-end read) comes from the reverse strand.

The final part of the library; string specifies the strand from which the read originates in a strand-specific; protocol — it is only provided if the library is stranded (i.e. if the; library format string is of the form S). The possible values are:. ::. F = read 1 (or single-end read) comes from the forward strand; R = read 1 (or single-end read) comes from the reverse strand. So, for example, if you wanted to specify a fragment library of strand-specific; paired-end reads, oriented toward each other, where read 1 comes from the; forward strand and read 2 comes from the reverse strand, you would specify ``-l; ISF`` on the command line. This designates that the library being processed has; the type ""ISF"" meaning, **I**\ nward (the relative orientation), **S**\ tranded; (the protocol is strand-specific), **F**\ orward (read 1 comes from the forward; strand). The single end library strings are a bit simpler than their pair-end counter; parts, since there is no relative orientation of which to speak. Thus, the; only possible library format types for single-end reads are ``U`` (for; unstranded), ``SF`` (for strand-specific reads coming from the forward strand); and ``SR`` (for strand-specific reads coming from the reverse strand). A few more examples of some library format strings and their interpretations are:. ::. IU (an unstranded paired-end library where the reads face each other). ::. SF (a stranded single-end protocol where the reads come from the forward strand). ::. OSR (a stranded paired-end protocol where the reads face away from each other,; read1 comes from reverse strand and read2 comes from the forward strand). .. note:: Correspondence to TopHat library types .

Availability,avail,available,"Salmon; ===============. Salmon is a tool for **wicked-fast** transcript quantification from RNA-seq; data. It requires a set of target transcripts (either from a reference or; *de-novo* assembly) to quantify. All you need to run Salmon is a FASTA file; containing your reference transcripts and a (set of) FASTA/FASTQ file(s); containing your reads. Optionally, Salmon can make use of pre-computed; alignments (in the form of a SAM/BAM file) to the transcripts rather than the; raw reads. The **mapping**-based mode of Salmon runs in two phases; indexing and; quantification. The indexing step is independent of the reads, and only needs to; be run once for a particular set of reference transcripts. The quantification; step, obviously, is specific to the set of RNA-seq reads and is thus run more; frequently. For a more complete description of all available options in Salmon,; see below. .. note:: Selective alignment. Selective alignment, first introduced by the ``--validateMappings`` flag; in salmon, and now the default mapping strategy (in version 1.0.0; forward), is a major feature enhancement introduced in recent versions of; salmon. When salmon is run with selective alignment, it adopts a; considerably more sensitive scheme that we have developed for finding the; potential mapping loci of a read, and score potential mapping loci using; the chaining algorithm introduced in minimap2 [#minimap2]_. It scores and; validates these mappings using the score-only, SIMD, dynamic programming; algorithm of ksw2 [#ksw2]_. Finally, we recommend using selective; alignment with a *decoy-aware* transcriptome, to mitigate potential; spurious mapping of reads that actually arise from some unannotated; genomic locus that is sequence-similar to an annotated transcriptome. The; selective-alignment algorithm, the use of a decoy-aware transcriptome, and; the influence of running salmon with different mapping and alignment; strategies is covered in detail in the paper `Alignment and mapping met",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/source/salmon.rst,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/v1.10.1/doc/source/salmon.rst

While this extra memory usage should normally be minor,; it can nonetheless be controlled with the ``--reduceGCMemory`` option.; This option replaces the per-nucleotide GC count with a rank-select; capable bit vector, reducing the memory overhead from 4-bytes per; nucleotide to ~1.25 bits, while being only marginally slower). """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; ``--posBias``; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Passing the ``--posBias`` flag to Salmon will enable modeling of a; position-specific fragment start distribution. This is meant to model; non-uniform coverage biases that are sometimes present in RNA-seq data; (e.g. 5' or 3' positional bias). Currently, a small and fixed number; of models are learned for different length classes of transcripts, as; is done in Roberts et al. [#roberts]_. *Note*: The positional bias; model is relatively new, and is still undergoing testing. It replaces; the previous `--useFSPD` option, which is now deprecated. This; feature should be considered as *experimental* in the current release.

When evaluating the bias models (the GC-fragment model specifically),; Salmon must consider the probability of generating a fragment of every; possible length (with a non-trivial probability) from every position; on every transcript. This results in a process that is quadratic in; the length of the transcriptome --- though each evaluation itself is; efficient and the process is highly parallelized. It is possible to speed this process up by a multiplicative factor by; considering only every *i*:sup:`th` fragment length, and interpolating; the intermediate results. The ``--biasSpeedSamp`` option allows the; user to set this sampling factor. Larger values speed up effective; length correction, but may decrease the fidelity of bias modeling.; However, reasonably small values (e.g. 10 or less) should have only a; minor effect on the computed effective lengths, and can c",MatchSource.DOCS,doc/source/salmon.rst,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/v1.10.1/doc/source/salmon.rst

However, we find that throwing more than a ; few threads at file decompression does not result in increased processing; speed. Thus, alignment-based Salmon will only ever allocate up to 4 threads; to file decompression, with the rest being allocated to quantification.; If these threads are starved, they will sleep (the quantification threads ; do not busy wait), but there is a point beyond which allocating more threads; will not speed up alignment-based quantification. We find that allocating ; 8 --- 12 threads results in the maximum speed, threads allocated above this; limit will likely spend most of their time idle / sleeping. For quasi-mapping-based Salmon, the story is somewhat different.; Generally, performance continues to improve as more threads are made; available. This is because the determination of the potential mapping; locations of each read is, generally, the slowest step in; quasi-mapping-based quantification.

Using Salmon; ------------. As mentioned above, there are two ""modes"" of operation for Salmon.

The second mode simply requires you to provide a; FASTA file of the transcriptome and a ``.sam`` or ``.bam`` file containing a; set of alignments. .. note:: Read / alignment order. Salmon, like eXpress [#express]_, uses a streaming inference method to perform ; transcript-level quantification.

Safety,avoid,avoids,"scriptomic alignments. Salmon expects that the alignment files provided are with respect to the; transcripts given in the corresponding FASTA file. That is, Salmon expects; that the reads have been aligned directly to the transcriptome (like RSEM,; eXpress, etc.) rather than to the genome (as does, e.g. Cufflinks). If you; have reads that have already been aligned to the genome, there are; currently 3 options for converting them for use with Salmon. First, you; could convert the SAM/BAM file to a FAST{A/Q} file and then use the; lightweight-alignment-based mode of Salmon described below. Second, given the converted; FASTA{A/Q} file, you could re-align these converted reads directly to the; transcripts with your favorite aligner and run Salmon in alignment-based; mode as described above. Third, you could use a tool like `sam-xlate <https://github.com/mozack/ubu/wiki>`_; to try and convert the genome-coordinate BAM files directly into transcript ; coordinates. This avoids the necessity of having to re-map the reads. However,; we have very limited experience with this tool so far. .. topic:: Multiple alignment files; ; If your alignments for the sample you want to quantify appear in multiple ; .bam/.sam files, then you can simply provide the Salmon ``-a`` parameter ; with a (space-separated) list of these files. Salmon will automatically ; read through these one after the other quantifying transcripts using the ; alignments contained therein. However, it is currently the case that these; separate files must (1) all be of the same library type and (2) all be; aligned with respect to the same reference (i.e. the @SQ records in the ; header sections must be identical). Description of some important options; -------------------------------------. Salmon exposes a number of useful optional command-line parameters to the user.; The particularly important ones are explained here, but you can always run; ``salmon quant -h`` to see them all.

Security,validat,validateMappings,"Salmon; ===============. Salmon is a tool for **wicked-fast** transcript quantification from RNA-seq; data. It requires a set of target transcripts (either from a reference or; *de-novo* assembly) to quantify. All you need to run Salmon is a FASTA file; containing your reference transcripts and a (set of) FASTA/FASTQ file(s); containing your reads. Optionally, Salmon can make use of pre-computed; alignments (in the form of a SAM/BAM file) to the transcripts rather than the; raw reads. The **mapping**-based mode of Salmon runs in two phases; indexing and; quantification. The indexing step is independent of the reads, and only needs to; be run once for a particular set of reference transcripts. The quantification; step, obviously, is specific to the set of RNA-seq reads and is thus run more; frequently. For a more complete description of all available options in Salmon,; see below. .. note:: Selective alignment. Selective alignment, first introduced by the ``--validateMappings`` flag; in salmon, and now the default mapping strategy (in version 1.0.0; forward), is a major feature enhancement introduced in recent versions of; salmon.

This means that multiple threads can be effectively used; to aid in BAM decompression. However, we find that throwing more than a ; few threads at file decompression does not result in increased processing; speed. Thus, alignment-based Salmon will only ever allocate up to 4 threads; to file decompression, with the rest being allocated to quantification.; If these threads are starved, they will sleep (the quantification threads ; do not busy wait), but there is a point beyond which allocating more threads; will not speed up alignment-based quantification. We find that allocating ; 8 --- 12 threads results in the maximum speed, threads allocated above this; limit will likely spend most of their time idle / sleeping. For quasi-mapping-based Salmon, the story is somewhat different.; Generally, performance continues to improve as more threads are made; available.

The use of selective alignment implies the use of range factorization, as mapping; scores become very meaningful with this option. Selective alignment can; improve the accuracy, sometimes considerably, over the faster, but; less-precise mapping algorithm that was previously used. Also, there are a number of ; options and flags that allow the user to control details about how the scoring is ; carried out, including setting match, mismatch, and gap scores, and choosing the minimum ; score below which an alignment will be considered invalid, and therefore not used for the; purposes of quantification. .
