This is supported in MechanicalMatrixMapper because there is a check that the topology changed compared to the previous time step. In that case, the matrix intersections is invalidated and it triggers a new computation of the intersection.; Other cases are not supported. For example, @Camille-K experienced the issue: the mapping jacobian matrix structure changed because of a user interaction, moving a frame from a beam to another.; More generally, it could be profitable to have a generic mechanism detecting that a matrix structure changed.",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/2687

Otherwise, the strainDisplacementMatrix that was computed during the initialization in the initLarge() is taken.; That leads to the issue that the following computations of strain and stress use an old version of the strainDisplacementMatrix that does not correspond to the current displacements; I think that in the computeForce-method, the method `computeStrainDisplacement(J, elementIndex, A, B, C)` should be called, no matter if the material is anisotropic or not. **Steps to reproduce**; The `_anisotropicMaterial` flag must be set to false (which is the default). Then, if I print the strainDisplacementMatrix `J` in the computeForce-method, afterwards call `computeStrainDisplacement(J, elementIndex, A, B, C)` and print `J` again, the two outputs differ.

That shows that an old, not updated version of the strainDisplacementMatrix is used in the following computations. **Expected behavior**; The strainDisplacementMatrix should always be updated. ---------------------------------------------. ### Environment. **Context**. - System: Windows 10; - Version of SOFA: v21.12 branch at commit [baa0c04] (latest commit)",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/2704

CompressedRowSparseMatrixMat3x3d is faster because it manipulates blocks of 3x3, which is the best strategy in this case. Unfortunately, Eigen manipulates scalars only.; To be fair, EigenSparseMatrixd must be compared to CompressedRowSparseMatrixd. We notice a slight speed up with EigenSparseMatrixd . I wanted to use Eigen::BlockSparseMatrix to have blocks of 3x3, but as an unsupported module, it does not compile with Eigen 3.4. I increased the resolution of the grid: MBKBuild becomes slower than CompressedRowSparseMatrixd, and MBKSolve stays faster than CompressedRowSparseMatrixd. Due to the slow down in MBKBuild, EigenSparseMatrixd is not very interesting in this example.

Unfortunately, Eigen manipulates scalars only.; To be fair, EigenSparseMatrixd must be compared to CompressedRowSparseMatrixd. We notice a slight speed up with EigenSparseMatrixd . I wanted to use Eigen::BlockSparseMatrix to have blocks of 3x3, but as an unsupported module, it does not compile with Eigen 3.4.

The wrappers are courtesy of @jnbrunet, from https://github.com/jnbrunet/caribou, and have been adapted to SOFA + missing functions for CGLinearSolver. `eigen::EigenMatrix` has the interface of `BaseMatrix`, so it can be used as a matrix storing the linear system, in a linear solver.; An example is provided in `CGLinearSolver`. Performances:.

CompressedRowSparseMatrixMat3x3d is faster because it manipulates blocks of 3x3, which is the best strategy in this case. Unfortunately, Eigen manipulates scalars only.; To be fair, EigenSparseMatrixd must be compared to CompressedRowSparseMatrixd. We notice a slight speed up with EigenSparseMatrixd . I wanted to use Eigen::BlockSparseMatrix to have blocks of 3x3, but as an unsupported module, it does not compile with Eigen 3.4. I increased the resolution of the grid: MBKBuild becomes slower than CompressedRowSparseMatrixd, and MBKSolve stays faster than CompressedRowSparseMatrixd.

Eventually, the needle is **inserted into a blood vessel** in the retina. And the eyeball and blood vessel should be deformable during the collision and insertion process.

The target would be that in a simulation environment, the needle is controlled by haptic devices to approach the eyeballs. (This part is already finished [here](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/2786)) And then the needle would **penetrate the outer surface** of the eyeball and then continue approaching the retinal. Eventually, the needle is **inserted into a blood vessel** in the retina. And the eyeball and blood vessel should be deformable during the collision and insertion process. I have learned some tutorials on SOFA, the dentist-surgery simulation included. And I guess the difficult point may be the insertion process right? From one [post](https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/forum/topic/needle-insertion-into-soft-tissue/) in forum, I found the plugin [Cosserat plugin](https://github.com/SofaDefrost/plugin.Cosserat) is mentioned.

Some time ago when it was defined using Data<> filed the data was loaded directly during init step. Now it is defined using createSofaData() method and initialized slightly later. On the other hand, in the scenes where the issue appears this dataset is used in Indices2ValuesMapper component (using @ link system), the output of which, in its turn, is used in TetrahedronFEMForceField (the same @links). So, without initialization, during init step, the ForceField just crashes. **Steps to reproduce**; runSofa -l libSofaPython3.so test_scene.py. ########## SIG 11 - SIGSEGV: segfault ##########; sofa::helper::BackTrace::sig(int); sofa::component::forcefield::TetrahedronFEMForceField<sofa::defaulttype::StdVectorTypes<sofa::type::Vec<3u, double>, sofa::type::Vec<3u, double>, double> >::init(); sofa::simulation::InitVisitor::processNodeTopDown(sofa::simulation::Node*); sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode::executeVisitorTopDown(sofa::simulation::Visitor*, std::__cxx11::list<sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode*, std::allocator<sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode*> >&, std::map<sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode*, sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode::StatusStruct, std::less<sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode*>, std::allocator<std::pair<sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode* const, sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode::StatusStruct> > >&, sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode*); sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode::executeVisitorTopDown(sofa::simulation::Visitor*, std::__cxx11::list<sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode*, std::allocator<sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode*> >&, std::map<sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode*, sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode::StatusStruct, std::less<sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode*>, std::allocator<std::pair<sofa::simulation::graph::DAGNode* const, sofa::simulation::graph::D",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/2897

https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2907:1574,Availability,failure,failures,1574,"(without the tests....). Main problem is the linear solvers using CSPARSE, which only handles double.; Actually, SparseCholesky was using buffers of float with pointers of double (which obviously causes a crash).; SparseLU is more convenient, it tried to use SReal, and make the compilation failing directly. There were at least two way to solve this problem:; - disable in the CMakeLists directly (if floating_point is float); - do not compile the instance templated on float (effectivement does not compile the two solvers). I chose the latter to keep them visible in the base code, but I totally agree with the former solution (but requires to access to the Cmake variable SOFA_FLOATING_POINT from Sofa.Config in the CMakefile of S.C.LS.Direct).
