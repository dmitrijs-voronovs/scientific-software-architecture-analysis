Embarrassing Parallelism¶; Many of the tasks automated by Python wrappers consist of a number of; independent PSI4 calculations and are thus suited to an embarrassingly; parallel mode of operation. In Psithon, these have been dubbed sow/reap; procedures and have the following general structure. Prepare an input file, simply adding mode='sow' to the; argument list of an available Python function. Run this quick job to; produce input files for lengthier calculations.; According to the instructions in the output file of the above step,; run the generated input files in any order on any variety of computers; and architectures. This is the time-intensive portion of the; calculation.; The ‘sow’ stage also produces a master input file (with a; mode='reap' directive). When all the jobs in the above step are; completed, place their output files in the same location as the; master input, and run this last, quick job to collect the results. Sow/reap procedures are governed by the mode keyword, choices being; 'continuous', 'sow', and 'reap'. Only 'sow' is likely to; be used by the user, as 'continuous' is always the default, and; input files with 'reap' are autogenerated.; Available at present for Database and finite difference operation; of Optimize.

Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt.; #! Optimize H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. memory 250 mb. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'). This should perform a series of gradient computations. The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After about 4 cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; ----------------------------------------------------------------------; Step Energy Delta(E) MAX force MAX Delta(q); ----------------------------------------------------------------------; 1 -76.026653665892 -76.026653665892 1.52e-02 1.52e-02; 2 -76.026907793199 -0.000254127307 9.55e-03 9.55e-03; 3 -76.027052927171 -0.000145133972 4.47e-04 4.47e-04; 4 -76.027053472137 -0.000000544965 1.16e-04 1.16e-04; ----------------------------------------------------------------------.

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, first we must set up an input; using the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We can easily get the optimized geometry; from the previous computation. Looking at the output from running the; previous example, we see that the OH bond length is about 0.9463 Ångstroms,; and the bond angle is about 104.575 degrees. It’s good to give this many; digits (or more) to make sure there’s not significant roundoff error in the; geometry when running a frequency computation.

Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary.” We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want.

Optimize H2O HF/cc-pVDZ. memory 250 mb. molecule h2o {; O ; H 1 0.96; H 1 0.96 2 104.5; }. set basis cc-pVDZ; optimize('scf'). This should perform a series of gradient computations. The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After about 4 cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; ----------------------------------------------------------------------; Step Energy Delta(E) MAX force MAX Delta(q); ----------------------------------------------------------------------; 1 -76.026653665892 -76.026653665892 1.52e-02 1.52e-02; 2 -76.026907793199 -0.000254127307 9.55e-03 9.55e-03; 3 -76.027052927171 -0.000145133972 4.47e-04 4.47e-04; 4 -76.027053472137 -0.000000544965 1.16e-04 1.16e-04; ----------------------------------------------------------------------. To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, first we must set up an input; using the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY. We can easily get the optimized geometry; from the previous computation. Looking at the output from running the; previous example, we see that the OH bond length is about 0.9463 Ångstroms,; and the bond angle is about 104.575 degrees. It’s good to give this many; digits (or ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b2/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b2/tutorial-1.html

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.17; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z; O 0.000 0.000 -0.067; H 0.000 0.416 0.536; H 0.000 -0.416 0.536. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate. (This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

Notice we have a couple of new keywords in the molecule specification.; no_reorient tells the program not to reorient the molecule; to a different coordinate system (this is important for SAPT to make; sure the same coordinate frame is used for the computations of the two; monomers and for the dimer). The next keyword tells PSI4 to run; in C1 point-group symmetry (i.e., without using symmetry), even if a; higher symmetry is detected. SAPT computations know to turn off; symmetry and fix orientation even without the user specifying these; molecule keywords.; Here’s the second half of the input:; set globals {; basis jun-cc-pVDZ; scf_type DF; freeze_core True; }. energy('sapt0').

This; will set all of these options as “global” options (meaning that they are; visible to all parts of the program). Most common PSI4 options can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (e.g., we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (e.g., set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8).; Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (i.e., SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs] with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse functions ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b2/tutorial-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b2/tutorial-1.html

Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations.

The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After about 4 cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!. As indicated; in the following table (printed by the optimizer at the end of the; computation), the energy decreases with each step,; and the maximum force on each atom also decreases with each step (in; principle these numbers could increase in some iterations, but here they do; not).; ----------------------------------------------------------------------; Step Energy Delta(E) MAX force MAX Delta(q); ----------------------------------------------------------------------; 1 -76.026653665892 -76.026653665892 1.52e-02 1.52e-02; 2 -76.026907793199 -0.000254127307 9.55e-03 9.55e-03; 3 -76.027052927171 -0.000145133972 4.47e-04 4.47e-04; 4 -76.027053472137 -0.000000544965 1.16e-04 1.16e-04; ----------------------------------------------------------------------.

It is not surprising that the electrostatic; contribution is dominant, because the geometry chosen for this example has the; acetylene perpendicular to the ethylene, with the acetylene hydrogen; pointing directly at the double bond in ethylene; this will be attractive; because the H atoms in acetylene bear a partial positive charge, while the; electron-rich double bond in ethylene bears a partial negative charge.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. But most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules.

We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}.

Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis¶; The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the energy() function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations. These can be specified by replacing; energy() with optimize() or frequency(), respectively.; Here’s an example of optimizing the H2O molecule using Hartree–Fock with; a cc-pVDZ basis set (located in; tu3-h2o-opt.; #!

The gradient points; which way is downhill in energy, and the optimizer then modifies the; geometry to follow the gradient. After about 4 cycles, the geometry should; converge with a message like Optimization is complete!.

That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary.” We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index. Note we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately.

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.17; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z; O 0.000 0.000 -0.067; H 0.000 0.416 0.536; H 0.000 -0.416 0.536. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate. (This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

Notice we have a couple of new keywords in the molecule specification.; no_reorient tells the program not to reorient the molecule; to a different coordinate system (this is important for SAPT to make; sure the same coordinate frame is used for the computations of the two; monomers and for the dimer). The next keyword tells PSI4 to run; in C1 point-group symmetry (i.e., without using symmetry), even if a; higher symmetry is detected. SAPT computations know to turn off; symmetry and fix orientation even without the user specifying these; molecule keywords.; Here’s the second half of the input:; set globals {; basis jun-cc-pVDZ; scf_type DF; freeze_core True; }. energy('sapt0').

And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in PSI4. Here’s the input; (available as tu6-cp-ne2).; #!

The program correctly guessed; all of these options for us. We can change the default behavior through; additional keywords.; Let’s consider what we would do for an open-shell molecule, where; not all electrons are paired. For example, let’s run a computation; on methylene (CH2), whose ground electronic state has two unpaired; electrons (triplet electronic state, or a spin multiplicity ).; In this case, the default spin multiplicity (1) is not correct, so we; need to tell the program the true value (3). Like many programs, PSI4; can get the charge and multiplicity as the first two integers in the; Z-matrix. Note the line with 0 3 at the beginning of the molecule; specification below.

Notice that the symmetry type of the normal modes is specified (A1, A1,; B2). The program also prints out the normal modes in terms of Cartesian; coordinates of each atom. For example, the normal mode at 1776 cm-1; is:; Frequency: 1776.17; Force constant: 0.1194; X Y Z; O 0.000 0.000 -0.067; H 0.000 0.416 0.536; H 0.000 -0.416 0.536. where the table shows the displacements in the X, Y, and Z dimensions for; each atom along the normal mode coordinate. (This information could be used; to animate the vibrational frequency using visualization software.). Analysis of Intermolecular Interactions¶; Now let’s consider something a little more interesting. PSI4; contains code to analyze the nature of intermolecular interactions; between two molecules, via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory; (SAPT) [Jeziorski:1994:1887]. This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }.

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases.

This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index.

One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. But most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0].; Let’s also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) corrected energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, PSI4 knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let’s; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what’s monomer A and what’s monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; molecule block can be used to separate monomers.; So, we’re going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne2 at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let’s print out a table; of the interatomic distances we’ve considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in kcal mol-1) at each geometry.

The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array. The next line,; ecp[R] = cp('ccsd(t)'), computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ecp dictionary with R as; the index. Note we didn’t need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn’t need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. The built-in; Psithon function cp() does it all for us, automatically.; And that’s it! The only remaining part of the example input is a little table; of the different R values and the CP-corrected CCSD(T) energies, converted from; atomic units (hartree) to kcal mol-1 by multiplying by the; automatically-defined conversion factor psi_hartree2kcalmol, which is; defined in Sec. Scratch Files and the ~/.psi4rc File. Notice the loop over to create; the table looks just like the loop over R to run the different; computations, and the CP-corrected energies ecp[R] are accessed the same; way they were stored. The print line at the end just specifies some; formatting for the printed table (first element is a floating point number 3; spaces wide with one digit after the decimal, and the second element is a; floating point number 10 spaces wide with 6 digits after the decimal); the; format strings are the same as in the C programming language. For tables more; complicated than the simple one used here, Psithon has built-in support for; tables (see the next section).; The following section goes over Psithon in much more detail, but; hopefully this example already makes it clear that many complex tasks; can be done very easily in PSI4.

This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and PSI4; makes these computations easier than ever.; For a SAPT computation, the input needs to provide information on two; distinct molecules. This is very easy, we just give a Z-matrix or set of; Cartesian coordinates for each molecule, and separate the two with two; dashes, like this:; # Example SAPT computation for ethene*ethine (i.e., ethylene*acetylene),; # test case 16 from the S22 database. molecule dimer {; 0 1; C 0.000000 -0.667578 -2.124659; C 0.000000 0.667578 -2.124659; H 0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 -1.232253 -2.126185; H -0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; H 0.923621 1.232253 -2.126185; --; 0 1; C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503; C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240; H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352; H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929; units angstrom. no_reorient; symmetry c1; }. Notice we have a couple of new keywords in the molecule specification.; no_reorient tells the program not to reorient the molecule; to a different coordinate system (this is important for SAPT to make; sure the same coordinate frame is used for the computations of the two; monomers and for the dimer). The next keyword tells PSI4 to run; in C1 point-group symmetry (i.e., without using symmetry), even if a; higher symmetry is detected. SAPT computations know to turn off; symmetry and fix orientation even without the user specifying these; molecule keywords.; Here’s the second ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b2/tutorial.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b2/tutorial.html

First, you can see the molecule block has a couple dashes to; separate the monomers from each other. Also note we’ve used a Z-matrix to; specify the geometry, and we’ve used a variable (R) as the; interatomic distance. We have not specified the value of R in; the molecule block like we normally would. That’s because we’re; going to vary it during the scan across the potential energy surface.; Below the molecule block, you can see the Rvals array; specified. This is a Python array holding the interatomic distances we; want to consider. In Python, arrays are surrounded by square brackets, and; elements are separated by commas.; The next lines, set basis aug-cc-pVDZ and set freeze_core True,; are familiar from previous test cases. Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ecp = {}. This is Python’s way of initializing; a “dictionary.” We’re going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the R values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file.; The next section, beginning with for R in Rvals:, loops over the; interatomic distances, R, in our array Rvals. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, dimer.R = R,; sets the Z-matrix variable R of the molecule called dimer; to the R value extracted from the Rvals array.

ADC: Ab Initio Polarization Propagator¶; Code author: Masaaki Saitow; Section author: Masaaki Saitow; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, ADC; The ADC code seeks the pole structure of the polarization; propagator, which is equivalent to the correlated excitation energy,; in terms of the second order algebraic-diagrammatic construction; (ADC(2)) scheme. Originally, the ADC scheme was derived in purely; the diagrammatic language by Schirmer [Schirmer:1982] and later,; a sophisticated algebraic scheme was developed [Trofimov:2006]; by Trofimov et al. In general by n-th order ADC theory, the; excited state is treated at completely equivalent level to the; Møller–Plesset perturbation expansion of the same order.; Hence the ADC(2); can be described as MP2 theory for the excited state and the relation; to such other response theories as CC2-LR, CIS(D) and CIS(D:math:_n) has; been addressed [Haettig:2002] by Hattig et al. In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as . In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation. As a consequence,; the pre-factor in the polynomial scaling becomes far larger than that; of the CIS(D) even though the quasi-degeneracy of the excited state is; properly accounted for in the ADC(2) model.; In PSI4 the quite efficient and flexible integral-transformation; library named libtrans is newly equipped and utilized in the; producti",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/adc-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/adc-1.html

Originally, the ADC scheme was derived in purely; the diagrammatic language by Schirmer [Schirmer:1982] and later,; a sophisticated algebraic scheme was developed [Trofimov:2006]; by Trofimov et al. In general by n-th order ADC theory, the; excited state is treated at completely equivalent level to the; Møller–Plesset perturbation expansion of the same order.; Hence the ADC(2); can be described as MP2 theory for the excited state and the relation; to such other response theories as CC2-LR, CIS(D) and CIS(D:math:_n) has; been addressed [Haettig:2002] by Hattig et al. In the ADC theory,; the residue calculus of the propagator is translated into the eigenvalue; problem with respect to the correlated response matrix, also known as the; shifted-Hamiltonian. The σ-vectors (Hamiltonian-vector products); are constructed several times in the simultaneous expansion method (SEM); to solve the eigenvalue problem, and each σ-vector construction; has a computational cost that scales as . In addition,; the tensorial form of the σ-vector resembles to that of the; doubles correction in the CIS(D) energetic equation. As a consequence,; the pre-factor in the polynomial scaling becomes far larger than that; of the CIS(D) even though the quasi-degeneracy of the excited state is; properly accounted for in the ADC(2) model.; In PSI4 the quite efficient and flexible integral-transformation; library named libtrans is newly equipped and utilized in the; producti",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/4.0b3/adc.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/4.0b3/adc.html

Using the ADC(2) code¶; A complete list of keywords related to ADC(2) computations is provided in; Appendix ADC. Some sample inputs are provided in; psi4/samples, in directories starting with the name adc. The most; important keyword is ROOTS_PER_IRREP, which is an array; giving the number of excited states desired for each irreducible; representation. Implementation¶; Some very essential points are emphasized for understanding of the; nature and the limitations of the theory. The ADC(2) response matrix,; denoted as , is expanded in the single (S) and double (D); excitation manifolds as. where the superscript on each matrix block indicates the order of; the fluctuation. Instead of solving the above equation explicitly,; the large D manifold is treated effectively as. This form of the ADC(2) equation requires 7 – 10 iterations for; convergence on only one root. But thanks to Newton-Raphson; acceleration,. the computational time reduces to shorter than half of the simple iterative; procedure. Construction of the denominator of the second term in the above; equation is less computationally expensive than contruction of one $sigma$-vector with respect to the effective response matrix. The non-iterative excitation energy stated above is calculated as a diagonal element of the Davidson mini-Hamiltonian matrix in the SEM as,. where and denote the CIS; excitation energy and wave function, respectively. The explicit form of the; σ-vector is provided in a note accompanying the source code,; in the file psi4/src/bin/adc/sigma.pdf. Table Of Contents.
