https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455447346:6,Usability,clear,clear,6,"To be clear, my thought is to change this patch so it can be used (even if with effort) to generate a valid CML file using the low-level API (as well as the other formats which don't need a header/footer) and keep the existing pybel code valid for the formats which it does support. I don't plan to touch the pybel code with this patch. Some other patch will change it to generate valid CML output, which it doesn't currently do.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455447346

The problem was that OBConversion::Write() always set SetOneObjectOnly() so there was no way it could be used to generate CML output. The CML writer looked at Index and IsLast to see if it was a single-molecule or multi-molecule output. If the former, it wrote <molecule> element. If the latter it wrote a <cml> element containing 2 or more <molecule> elements. Another problem was that it needs to Index++ before calling WriteMolecule(), as that's the only way for the initialization code check (Index==1) to be correct *and* for GetOutputIndex() to reflect the number of molecules written. That in turn means that WriteFile() and WriteString() need to set Index=0 before calling Write(). In addition, I updated WriteString() so it saves/restores more state, and I added the new testobconversion_writers.py test program to the list of test cases for ""make test"". Finally, I include a 2-molecule CML test case, to ensure that it is possible to use the updated Writer API implementation to create the correct output.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455598175

In Open Babel, two additions were made with respect to the official MOL2. See: https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FileFormats/Sybyl_Mol2_format.html?highlight=mol2. 1. Explicit declaration of the formal charges in the UNITY_ATOM_ATTR section (part of the official MOL2 specifications). No inference of the formal charge based on the atom types. Below, the atom number 4 has one custom attribute, namely its ""charge"" (Open Babel custom keyword for ""formal charge"") is 1.

Using `find_package` to search for a globally installed one and only building the local library if it can't find a global library and it's asked for? RDKit does this now (unfortunately the openbabel stuff I added was based off the old way of doing this).,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2015#issuecomment-522232899

In total, there are 12 fragments such fragments in the file:; ```; CC1=CC2=N3C1=Cc1cc(c4n1*13N3=C(C=c5n1c(=C2)cc5C)C(=CC3=C4)C)C; CC1=CC2=Cc3n4*56N2=C1C=c1cc(c(=CC2=N6C(=Cc4cc3C)C=C2C)n51)C; C1=CC2=N3C1=Cc1ccc4n1*13N3=C(C=CC3=C4)C=c3n1c(=C2)cc3; C=C1CCCC2(C1CCC2)C; OC1CC(=CC(C1)(C)C)C; OC1C(O)COCC1O; O=C1NC2C(N1)CSC2; OC1COCC1O; O=C1ccC(=O)N1; OC1COCC1; C1=CC=C[NH2]=C1; [O-]*(=O)(=O)[O-]; ```. Detecting this in `OBBuilder::LoadFragments()` and throwing an error would also make it easier to debug this in the future.

That has been skipped indeed but that is not the whole picture because it has ""fragments"", which are all put on the side (because they are interpreted as subgraphs) and they look like this:. <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1336337/78694834-274e8780-78f5-11ea-81e5-270f3ccb412d.png"" width=""350""/>. All of these are fragments that **""match""** the location of my odd results. The reason there are so many hydrogens here is because I have first called `.addh()`. That function, finds a nitrogen that does not appear to be bonded with anything (the N3 of residue 85) and adds 3 hydrogens around it. It is easy to overcome the assymetric reporting of bonds as I now first build a Networkx graph that has `OBAtom` at its nodes and `OBBond` at its edges and then perform search on **that** graph. I am not sure how easy it would be to overcome this lack of bonds though. . All I can think of at the moment is check if NCCO are grouped under a residue but the residue's subgraph is disconnected. If it is disconnected, then......it would take some guessing as to where these bonds must be added. Unless there is a systematic way to infer which bonds are missing (?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2156#issuecomment-610311498

The problem is that this might give a different result (as reading an InChI doesn't always sufficiently preserve the original structure).

Many; chemicals, including amino acids, are described -- including SMILES; and InChi -- in Wikipedia; these particular descriptors are; mentioned in the top right / top left ""biographic box"" (depending; if your script runs from left to right, or right to left). + With this dictionary in hand, check if your input SMILES structures; may be fully described by this reference. A potential pitfall is; how these amino acids are described in terms of a charge; (protonated / neuter amino group) in your reference SMILES about; individual amino acids / in the SMILES string. + Identify if / how OpenBabel / rdkit may linearly ""digest"" the; SMILES string, similar to reading the primary protein structure; about the consecution of amino acids only, and iteratively state; the single letter (FASTA) code. (A dictionary-based string; substitution would be more efficient and easier to maintain than; 20+ subsequent if-clauses.) This is based for on RDKit's; capability to identify structure pattern; Jan Jensen's beginner's; tutorial [1] showcases this for using Python in Jupyter notebook; about individual amino acids.

However, getting the `.formula` attribute calls `GetFormula()`, which calls `GetSpacedFormula(1, """")`, forcing explicit hydrogens, so the output should be the same regardless of the state of Hydrogens. [The third parameter is a boolean for implicit hydrogens, but it defaults to True.]. However, there is a deficiency when deciding to use implicit hydrogens. When you make `C.[Ru]` a molecule, there are no proper bonds (`mol.OBMol.NumBonds()` gives 0). Therefore, the below line turns off the implicit hydrogen mode.; https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/blob/c3143e6235788ddd2c0a9d8298ad4873a5dbc81d/src/mol.cpp#L1015.

This issue is taken care of by https://github.com/conda-forge/openbabel-feedstock/pull/22. If you run `conda update -c conda-forge openbabel` and make sure you get a version of `3.1.1-py39hfc62d72_2` or later the BABEL_DATADIR is set automatically on activation of the conda environment.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2372#issuecomment-920725060

https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2377#issuecomment-871298303:0,Deployability,UPDATE,UPDATE,0,"UPDATE: I decided to change the docker image from Debian Buster to Ubuntu Focal and tried to compile a static build once more. The same issue with trying to create a static link to libboost_iostreams.so happened again. UPDATE 2: Instead of compiling both static and shared boost libraries, I just compiled the static libraries. Instead of trying to link to libboost_iostreams.so, it ended up giving ""lz not found"". So it is still not picking up on using the static library that was compiled. . Next, tried using the following command line. cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$BOOST_PATH \; 		-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$OPENBABEL_CMAKE_PREFIX \; 		-DZLIB_ROOT=$ZLIB_PATH \; 		-DBUILD_SHARED=OFF \; 		-DCMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES="".a"" \; 		-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=""-static"" \. Still getting usr/bin/ld: attempted static link of dynamic object `/smina/boost/lib/libboost_iostreams.so.1.76.0'. I don't know where to go from here. FINAL UPDATE: I found the problem, it wasn't finding the Boost libraries I had compiled previously. I solved it by replacing ```-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$BOOST_PATH ``` with ```-DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=$SBOOST_PATH/gcc```, gcc being the directory I put my stage binaries from compiling Boost. It compiled just fine afterwards.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2377#issuecomment-871298303
