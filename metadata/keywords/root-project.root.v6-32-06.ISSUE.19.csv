https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16750:1422,Performance,perform,performance,1422,"For our users, it's important to fix certain parameters in the likelihood easily with any overhead. So far, this didn't work when using gradients from AD, because the gradients were only produced for the parameters that are floating at the time where the likelihood is created. However, it has no additional runtime overhead in backwards AD mode to simply generate the gradient for **all** parameters, and then filter out the right elements in the the RooMinimizer-related code. This is what is implemented in the second commit of this PR. Some changes in the RooAbsMinimizerFcn were necessary to do this filtering: so far it didn't store any information on all the parameters in order. It only stored two separate lists for floating and constant parameters. The first commit in this PR adds the necessary data members (`_allParams` and `_allParamsInit`) to the RooAbsMinimizerFcn for the filtering of parameters. Furthermore, the previous datamembers that stored the parameters separately are removed to avoid duplication and possible desync of information. On this occasion, the parameter management was completely rewritten to be more concise and robust. This will also help later when we integrate the discrete profiling from CMS combine, where changing the state and filtering of minimization parameters is also relevant. It was validated with the ATLAS and CMS likelihoods from ICHEP 2024 that this PR results in no performance regression, even though we are now generating the gradient for more parameters (roughly up to two times more, because for every floating nuisance parameter there is usually one constant global observable that constrains it).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16750

The [attached macro](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17592119/bugDemo.txt) reproduces the issue. Save it `bugDemo.C` and run it. The correct behavior is to always print `true`, but we get some `false`. The code first constructs two trees with an `index` branch.

The two files containing the entry number as merged into a chain and attached as a friend to the empty tree. Iterating over the long tree yields the correct value of `index` until the 10th entry, than a constant 9 (the last value in the first file). Correct behavior is 0 to 20.

See:; https://github.com/wlav/cppyy/issues/272. This code path is used for implicit conversion from other `ctypes` pointer types to `void*`, which is not strictly required. One can always do an explicit cast: `ctypes.cast(my_ptr, ctypes.c_void_p )`.
