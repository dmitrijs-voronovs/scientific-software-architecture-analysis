Here is a line from the script that is generated, a bit below the line that reads `echo '*** LOCALIZING INPUTS ***'`. ```; /usr/local/aws-cli/v2/current/bin/aws s3 cp --no-progress s3://bucket-name/test/somewhere containing spaces/filename.txt /tmp/scratch/bucket-name/test/somewhere%20containing%20spaces/filename.txt; ```. This leads to `aws s3 cp` to fail with an error message like this:; ```; Unknown options: spaces/filename.txt,/tmp/scratch/bucket-name/test/somewhere%20containing%20spaces/filename.txt; ```. ### Expected result.

During one run, I accidentally passed in a file of BioSample accessions which had two spaces before each accession, eg; ```; SAMEA104027315; SAMEA104027345; SAMEA104027406; SAMEA104164787; SAMEA104172469; SAMEA104172474; SAMEA104172508; SAMEA104221066; SAMEA104362398; SAMEA104394395; SAMEA104394505; SAMEA104414628; SAMEA104446901; ```. The workflow is scattered per BioSample, so one instance of the scattered task takes in ` SAMEA104027315` as the input `biosample_accession` (type String). The task writes a file like this:. ```; echo ""~{biosample_accession}"" >> ~{biosample_accession}_pull_results.txt; ```; eg ` SAMEA104027315_pull_results.txt`. The workflow output section contains:. ```; String results = read_string(""~{biosample_accession}_pull_results.txt""); ```. eg ` SAMEA104027315_pull_results.txt`, same as what's in the command section. .

Because Job Manager breaks on large scatters, and to save money on compute credits, I decided to stop the workflow early rather than let it keep going to find out if the workflow log would eventually show an errors.

This workflow takes in a bunch of BioSample accessions, downloads their associated run FASTQs, and processes them. https://dockstore.org/workflows/github.com/aofarrel/myco/myco_sra:4.1.2?tab=files. During one run, I accidentally passed in a file of BioSample accessions which had two spaces before each accession, eg; ```; SAMEA104027315; SAMEA104027345; SAMEA104027406; SAMEA104164787; SAMEA104172469; SAMEA104172474; SAMEA104172508; SAMEA104221066; SAMEA104362398; SAMEA104394395; SAMEA104394505; SAMEA104414628; SAMEA104446901; ```. The workflow is scattered per BioSample, so one instance of the scattered task takes in ` SAMEA104027315` as the input `biosample_accession` (type String). The task writes a file like this:. ```; echo ""~{biosample_accession}"" >> ~{biosample_accession}_pull_results.txt; ```; eg ` SAMEA104027315_pull_results.txt`. The workflow output section contains:. ```; String results = read_string(""~{biosample_accession}_pull_results.txt""); ```. eg ` SAMEA104027315_pull_results.txt`, same as what's in the command section. .

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7165:725,Testability,log,logic,725,Addresses [WX-1110](https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/browse/WX-1110). PR adds a new endpoint to fetch failed tasks on a workflow via workflow id. For tasks that execute with a scatter and/or multiple attempts this means that the latest attempt and/or latest scatter index with a `Failed` status will be returned. No workflow/sub-workflow specific data (outside of the root workflow id) is returned in the response in an attempt to keep the payload light. Aspects of note: JDBC driver handles `SerialClob` and query syntax differently between `PostgreSQL` and `non-PostgreSQL` databases. As a result the query used is formatted differently to fit the DB specific expectations. Response is built using the already existing logic contained in `MetadataBuilderActor` (though new event listeners were added for the new endpoint flow). Food for thought (and for documentation purposes): I discovered that currently existing JDBC behavior adds `SerialClob` objects in the `pg_largeobject` table and supplies the OID as the value in `METADATA_ENTRY.METADATA_VALUE`. Considering the number of key-value pairs on the metadata json response I'm curious about capacity concerns.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7167:309,Safety,detect,detect,309,"Based on a post I made on the openWDL slack; was asked to make a ticket here. ## quick summary; Cromwell handles `/` in strings inconsistently. In some cases, it is dropped without throwing an error, in other cases it will cause an error immediately. If the string is in the WDL file itself, womtool does not detect any issues with it but it will not be handled as expected as runtime. ## use case and how to reproduce; [goleft indexcov ](https://github.com/brentp/goleft/tree/master/indexcov#indexcov) defaults to this value for --excludePattern:; `""^chrEBV$|_random$|Un_|^HLA|_alt$|hap$""`. So I set `String excludePattern = ""^chrEBV$|_random$|Un_|^HLA|_alt$|hap$""` in my WDL. That passes miniwdl check and womtool. But... * Terra will accept `^chrEBV$|^NC|_random$|Un_|^HLA\-|_alt$|hap\d$ `as a variable default or as hardcoded variable, but will handle it incorrectly -- it will not error, but it will be changed into `^chrEBV$|^NC|_random$|Un_|^HLA-|_alt$|hapd$`; * Terra will not accept `^chrEBV$|^NC|_random$|Un_|^HLA\-|_alt$|hap\d$` as an input variable via JSON; it will fail to import; * Terra will not accept `^chrEBV$|^NC|_random$|Un_|^HLA\-|_alt$|hap\d$` as an input variable if entered manually; it will throw token recognition error in the workflow menu and not allow you to submit; * Terra will accept the escaped version `^chrEBV$|^NC|_random$|Un_|^HLA\\-|_alt$|hap\\d$` as an input if entered manually or hardcoded, and will interpret it as `^chrEBV$|^NC|_random$|Un_|^HLA\-|_alt$|hap\d$`. Only tested via Terra-Cromwell, as I was previously told local-Cromwell is a lower development priority. ## expected behavior; 1. A user inputting a string as a variable vs that exact same string being a hardcoded default should be handled the same way.; 2. If Cromwell is supposed to handle `/` by requiring they be escaped as `//`, that should be documented if it isn't already.; 3. womtool should throw a warning when it sees a hardcoded variable/default with a `/` inside of it, and that wa",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7167

Instead, Cromwell fails at runtime -- even if it is actually impossible for that optional variable to be undefined. [A working example is available](https://github.com/aofarrel/myco/commit/e7f9ba6951d1b0fe5b3c1a650835312dd2b6e68f), but it is a complex WDL, so a more basic example is listed below. ## background; WDL doesn't really have a proper understanding of mutual exclusivity, so it doesn't realize that anything under a ""is optional variable X defined?"" block can only happen if optional variable X is defined. In other words, if variant_caller.errorcode has type Array[String?], the following code block is invalid, and womtool correctly flags it as such:. ```; if(defined(variant_caller.errorcode)) { ; 	Array[String] not_optional_error_code = variant_caller.errorcode; }; ```. > Failed to process declaration 'Array[String] varcall_error_if_earlyQC_filtered = variant_call_after_earlyQC_filtering.errorcode' (reason 1 of 1): Cannot coerce expression of type 'Array[String?]' to 'Array[String]'. The normal workaround for this is to use select_first() with a bogus fallback value, since the `defined` check means that fallback value will never be selected. ```; if(defined(variant_caller.errorcode)) { ; 	Array[String] not_optional_error_code = select_first([variant_caller.errorcode, [""according to all known laws of aviation""]]); }; ```. The same holds true if I only care about the first (index 0) variable in the array. That's the case for me, since the actual workflow I'm working on will be run on Terra data tables, eg each instance of the workflow only gets one sample but dozens of instances of the workflow will be created.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7248:628,Availability,down,down,628,"Call caching works sometimes for me but not all the time. I find it especially strange when working on a scatter job and some of the scatter jobs get a cache hit but others get a cache miss. . I have queried the METADATA_ENTRY table for the two workflows and all the call cache entries look identical. . Here is my process:. 1. I queried METADATA_ENTRY with this WHERE condition: `(WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UUID ='29791b64-b47a-44ba-aff0-7ab48bc10677' or WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UUID ='5de042e3-7a03-4c77-8972-f0e4cd010e4b') and CALL_FQN = 'sampleLevelWorkflow_WGS.align' and JOB_SCATTER_INDEX =0`; 2. I sort by METADATA_KEY; 3. Then I go down the list and compare the hashes for the two workflows for each METADATA_KEY. Here is a case where workflow 29791b64 is a restart of 5de042e3. (Workflow 5de042e3 is itself a restart but I don't think that is important here.)

I find it especially strange when working on a scatter job and some of the scatter jobs get a cache hit but others get a cache miss. . I have queried the METADATA_ENTRY table for the two workflows and all the call cache entries look identical. . Here is my process:. 1. I queried METADATA_ENTRY with this WHERE condition: `(WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UUID ='29791b64-b47a-44ba-aff0-7ab48bc10677' or WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UUID ='5de042e3-7a03-4c77-8972-f0e4cd010e4b') and CALL_FQN = 'sampleLevelWorkflow_WGS.align' and JOB_SCATTER_INDEX =0`; 2. I sort by METADATA_KEY; 3. Then I go down the list and compare the hashes for the two workflows for each METADATA_KEY. Here is a case where workflow 29791b64 is a restart of 5de042e3.

https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/7248:1079,Security,hash,hashes,1079,"ing on a scatter job and some of the scatter jobs get a cache hit but others get a cache miss. . I have queried the METADATA_ENTRY table for the two workflows and all the call cache entries look identical. . Here is my process:. 1. I queried METADATA_ENTRY with this WHERE condition: `(WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UUID ='29791b64-b47a-44ba-aff0-7ab48bc10677' or WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UUID ='5de042e3-7a03-4c77-8972-f0e4cd010e4b') and CALL_FQN = 'sampleLevelWorkflow_WGS.align' and JOB_SCATTER_INDEX =0`; 2. I sort by METADATA_KEY; 3. Then I go down the list and compare the hashes for the two workflows for each METADATA_KEY. Here is a case where workflow 29791b64 is a restart of 5de042e3. (Workflow 5de042e3 is itself a restart but I don't think that is important here.)
