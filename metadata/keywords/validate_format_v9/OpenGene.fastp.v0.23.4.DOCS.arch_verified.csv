You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

Availability," should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # duplication rate and deduplication; For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. ## duplication rate evaluation; By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time.

## Now analyze ONLY the following content:

**Content to evaluate:**  
 should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # duplication rate and deduplication; For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. ## duplication rate evaluation; By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time. Please refer to following table:. | dup_calc_accuracy level | hash buffer number | buffer size | memory usage | speed | |; |- | - | - | - | - | - |; | 1 | 1 | 1G | 1G | ultra-fast | default for no-dedup mode |; | 2 | 1 | 2G | 2G | fast | |; | 3 | 2 | 2G | 4G | fast | default for dedup|; | 4 | 2 | 4G | 8G | fast | |; | 5 | 2 | 8G | 12G | fast | |; | 6 | 3 | 8G | 24G | moderate | |. ## deduplication; Since `v0.22.0`, fastp supports deduplication for FASTQ data.

**Content to evaluate:**  
GGGGGGCCCC'; complexity = 3/(51-1) = 6%; ```; The threshold for low complexity filter can be specified by `-Y` or `--complexity_threshold`. It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required. ## Other filter; New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT`

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing text content. Your task is to evaluate whether the given **target content** should be filtered out, based on whether it consists of meaningful human-written prose or instead mainly contains programmatic or technical artifacts like logs or code.

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

**Content to evaluate:**  
 PE data, the front/tail trimming settings are given with `-F, --trim_front2` and `-T, --trim_tail2`. But if these options are not specified, they will be as same as read1 options, which means `trim_front2 = trim_front1` and `trim_tail2 = trim_tail1`.; * If you want to trim the reads to maximum length, you can specify `-b, --max_len1` for read1, and `-B, --max_len2` for read2. If `--max_len1` is specified but `--max_len2` is not, `--max_len2` will be same as `--max_len1`. For example, if `--max_len1` is specified and read1 is longer than `--max_len1`, `fastp` will trim read1 at its tail to make it as long as `--max_len1`. Please note that the trimming for `--max_len` limitation will be applied at the last step. Following are fastp's processing steps that may orderly affect the read lengthes:; ```; 1, UMI preprocessing (--umi); 2, global trimming at front (--trim_front); 3, global trimming at tail (--trim_tail); 4, quality pruning at 5' (--cut_front); 5, quality pruning by sliding window (--cut_right); 6, quality pruning at 3' (--cut_tail); 7, trim polyG (--trim_poly_g, enabled by default for NovaSeq/NextSeq data); 8, trim adapter by overlap analysis (enabled by default for PE data); 9, trim adapter by adapter sequence (--adapter_sequence, --adapter_sequence_r2.

The complexity is defined as the percentage of base that is different from its next base (base[i] != base[i+1]).

If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you ",MatchSource.DOCS,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md:12101,adapt,adapters,12101,README.md,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md,1,['adapt'],['adapters'],"

This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters.

ce the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:; ```; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1; AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2; AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT; >polyA; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA; ```. The adapter sequence in this file should be at least 6bp long, otherwise it will be skipped. And you can give whatever you want to trim, rather than regular sequencing adapters (i.e. polyA). `fastp` first trims the auto-detected adapter or the adapter sequences given by `--adapter_sequence | --adapter_sequence_r2`, then trims the adapters given by `--adapter_fasta` one by one.

This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly clea

For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*

However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection.

**Content to evaluate:**  
some applications like small RNA sequencing, you may want to discard the long reads. You can specify `--length_limit` to discard the reads longer than `length_limit`. The default value 0 means no limitation. ## low complexity filter; Low complexity filter is disabled by default, and you can enable it by `-y` or `--low_complexity_filter`. The complexity is defined as the percentage of base that is different from its next base (base[i] != base[i+1]). For example:; ```; # a 51-bp sequence, with 3 bases that is different from its next base; seq = 'AAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGCCCC'; complexity = 3/(51-1) = 6%; ```; The threshold for low complexity filter can be specified by `-Y` or `--complexity_threshold`. It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required. ## Other filter; New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required. ## Other filter; New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters.

But if these options are not specified, they will be as same as read1 options, which means `trim_front2 = trim_front1` and `trim_tail2 = trim_tail1`.; * If you want to trim the reads to maximum length, you can specify `-b, --max_len1` for read1, and `-B, --max_len2` for read2. If `--max_len1` is specified but `--max_len2` is not, `--max_len2` will be same as `--max_len1`. For example, if `--max_len1` is specified and read1 is longer than `--max_len1`, `fastp` will trim read1 at its tail to make it as long as `--max_len1`. Please note that the trimming for `--max_len` limitation will be applied at the last step. Following are fastp's processing steps that may orderly affect the read lengthes:; ```; 1, UMI preprocessing (--umi); 2, global trimming at front (--trim_front); 3, global trimming at tail (--trim_tail); 4, quality pruning at 5' (--cut_front); 5, quality pruning by sliding window (--cut_right); 6, quality pruning at 3' (--cut_tail); 7, trim polyG (--trim_poly_g, enabled by default for NovaSeq/NextSeq data); 8, trim adapter by overlap analysis (enabled by default for PE data); 9, trim adapter by adapter sequence (--adapter_sequence, --adapter_sequence_r2.

This feature is enabled for NextSeq/NovaSeq data by default, and you can specify `-g` or `--trim_poly_g` to enable it for any data, or specify `-G` or `--disable_trim_poly_g` to disable it. NextSeq/NovaSeq data is detected by the machine ID in the FASTQ records.  . A minimum length can be set with `<poly_g_min_len>` for `fastp` to detect polyG. This value is 10 by default.

If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contain

- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*

### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

Commonly for Illumina platforms, UMIs can be integrated in two different places: `index` or head of `read`.  ; To enable UMI processing, you have to enable `-U` or `--umi` option in the command line, and specify `--umi_loc` to specify the UMI location, it can be one of:; * `index1` the first index is used as UMI.

If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection.

For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

If `--max_len1` is specified but `--max_len2` is not, `--max_len2` will be same as `--max_len1`. For example, if `--max_len1` is specified and read1 is longer than `--max_len1`, `fastp` will trim read1 at its tail to make it as long as `--max_len1`. Please note that the trimming for `--max_len` limitation will be applied at the last step. Following are fastp's processing steps that may orderly affect the read lengthes:; ```; 1, UMI preprocessing (--umi); 2, global trimming at front (--trim_front); 3, global trimming at tail (--trim_tail); 4, quality pruning at 5' (--cut_front); 5, quality pruning by sliding window (--cut_right); 6, quality pruning at 3' (--cut_tail); 7, trim polyG (--trim_poly_g, enabled by default for NovaSeq/NextSeq data); 8, trim adapter by overlap analysis (enabled by default for PE data); 9, trim adapter by adapter sequence (--adapter_sequence, --adapter_sequence_r2. For PE data, this step is skipped if last step succeeded); 10, trim polyX (--trim_poly_x); 11, trim to max length (---max_len); ```. # polyG tail trimming; For Illumina NextSeq/NovaSeq data, `polyG` can happen in read tails since `G` means no signal in the Illumina two-color systems. `fastp` can detect the polyG in read tails and trim them. This feature is enabled for NextSeq/NovaSeq data by default, and you can specify `-g` or `--trim_poly_g` to enable it for any data, or specify `-G` or `--disable_trim_poly_g` to disable it. NextSeq/NovaSeq data is detected by the machine ID in the FASTQ records.  . A minimum length can be set with `<poly_g_min_len>` for `fastp` to detect polyG. This value is 10 by default.

The complexity is defined as the percentage of base that is different from its next base (base[i] != base[i+1]).

It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required. ## Other filter; New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you ",MatchSource.DOCS,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md:12101,adapt,adapters,12101,README.md,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md,1,['adapt'],['adapters'],"

The adapter sequence in this file should be at least 6bp long, otherwise it will be skipped. And you can give whatever you want to trim, rather than regular sequencing adapters (i.e. polyA). `fastp` first trims the auto-detected adapter or the adapter sequences given by `--adapter_sequence | --adapter_sequence_r2`, then trims the adapters given by `--adapter_fasta` one by one.

by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection.

For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

some applications like small RNA sequencing, you may want to discard the long reads. You can specify `--length_limit` to discard the reads longer than `length_limit`. The default value 0 means no limitation. ## low complexity filter; Low complexity filter is disabled by default, and you can enable it by `-y` or `--low_complexity_filter`. The complexity is defined as the percentage of base that is different from its next base (base[i] != base[i+1]). For example:; ```; # a 51-bp sequence, with 3 bases that is different from its next base; seq = 'AAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGCCCC'; complexity = 3/(51-1) = 6%; ```; The threshold for low complexity filter can be specified by `-Y` or `--complexity_threshold`. It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required. ## Other filter; New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue. # adapters; Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since

This feature is enabled for NextSeq/NovaSeq data by default, and you can specify `-g` or `--trim_poly_g` to enable it for any data, or specify `-G` or `--disable_trim_poly_g` to disable it. NextSeq/NovaSeq data is detected by the machine ID in the FASTQ records.  . A minimum length can be set with `<poly_g_min_len>` for `fastp` to detect polyG. This value is 10 by default. # polyX tail trimming; This feature is similar as polyG tail trimming, but is disabled by default. Use `-x` or `--trim_poly_x` to enable it. A minimum length can be set with `<poly_x_min_len>` for `fastp` to detect polyX. This value is 10 by default. When `polyG tail trimming` and `polyX tail trimming` are both enabled, fastp will perform `polyG trimming` first, then perform `polyX trimming`. This setting is useful for trimming the tails having `polyX (i.e. polyA) ` before `polyG`. `polyG` is usually caused by sequencing artifacts, while `polyA` can be commonly found from the tails of mRNA-Seq reads. # unique molecular identifier (UMI) processing; UMI is useful for duplication elimination and error correction based on generating consensus of reads originated from a same DNA fragment. It's usually used in deep sequencing applications like ctDNA sequencing. Commonly for Illumina platforms, UMIs can be integrated in two different places: `index` or head of `read`.  ; To enable UMI processing, you have to enable `-U` or `--umi` option in the command line, and specify `--umi_loc` to specify the UMI location, it can be one of:; * `index1` the first index is used as UMI.

Performance,"SE data, and `--cut_front` or `--cut_right` may also interfere deduplication for PE data. The deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs.***. If `--cut_right` is enabled, then there is no need to enable `--cut_tail`, since the former is more aggressive. If `--cut_right` is enabled together with `--cut_front`, `--cut_front` will be performed first before `--cut_right` to avoid dropping whole reads due to the low quality starting bases. Please be noted that `--cut_front` will interfere deduplication for both PE/SE data, and `--cut_tail` will interfere deduplication for SE data, since the deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs. If you don't set window size and mean quality threshold for these function respectively, `fastp` will use the values from `-W, --cut_window_size` and `-M, --cut_mean_quality `. # base correction for PE data; `fastp` perform `overlap analysis` for PE data, which try to find an overlap of each pair of reads. If an proper overlap is found, it can correct mismatched base pairs in overlapped regions of paired end reads, if one base is with high quality while the other is with ultra low quality. If a base is corrected, the quality of its paired base will be assigned to it so that they will share the same quality.  . This function is not enabled by default, specify `-c` or `--correction` to enable it. This function is based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_percent_limit (default 20%)`. Please note that the reads should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # global trimming; `fastp` supports global trimming, which means trim all reads in the front or the tail. This function is useful since sometimes you want to drop some cycles of a sequencing run.

Performance,"ng of FASTQ files (i.e. alignment in parallel), `fastp` supports splitting the output into multiple files. The splitting can work with two different modes: `by limiting file number` or `by limiting lines of each file`. These two modes cannot be enabled together.  . The file names of these split files will have a sequential number prefix, adding to the original file name specified by `--out1` or `--out2`, and the width of the prefix is controlled by the `-d` or `--split_prefix_digits` option. For example, `--split_prefix_digits=4`, `--out1=out.fq`, `--split=3`, then the output files will be `0001.out.fq`,`0002.out.fq`,`0003.out.fq`. ## splitting by limiting file number; Use `-s` or `--split` to specify how many files you want to have. `fastp` evaluates the read number of a FASTQ by reading its first ~1M reads. This evaluation is not accurate so the file sizes of the last several files can be a little differnt (a bit bigger or smaller). For best performance, it is suggested to specify the file number to be a multiple of the thread number. ## splitting by limiting the lines of each file; Use `-S` or `--split_by_lines` to limit the lines of each file. The last files may have smaller sizes since usually the input file cannot be perfectly divided. The actual file lines may be a little greater than the value specified by `--split_by_lines` since `fastp` reads and writes data by blocks (a block = 1000 reads). # overrepresented sequence analysis; Overrepresented sequence analysis is disabled by default, you can specify `-p` or `--overrepresentation_analysis` to enable it. For consideration of speed and memory, `fastp` only counts sequences with length of 10bp, 20bp, 40bp, 100bp or (cycles - 2 ). By default, fastp uses 1/20 reads for sequence counting, and you can change this settings by specifying `-P` or `--overrepresentation_sampling` option. For example, if you set `-P 100`, only 1/100 reads will be used for counting, and if you set `-P 1`, all reads will be used but it w",MatchSource.DOCS,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md:24561,perform,performance,24561,README.md,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md,1,['perform'],['performance'],"

## Instructions:
For each input, return:
1. `to_eliminate`: true or false — should this content be eliminated?
2. `reasoning`: Brief explanation of why the decision was made.


### Eliminate content that is not intended for human interpretation and consists primarily of:
- Code snippets or program structure  
  *(e.g., `if/else`, `for` loops, braces, language-specific syntax or keywords)*
- Program output, logs, or error traces  
  *(e.g., timestamps, error codes, stack traces, unit test results)*
- Configuration files, scripts, or build system output  
  *(e.g., YAML, JSON, Makefiles, shell scripts, compiler output)*
- Version control metadata or commit messages  
  *(e.g., git logs, diffs, merge info, file paths with change indicators)*
- API documentation or technical interface definitions  
  *(e.g., method signatures, parameter tables, annotations, formal docstrings)*

### Keep content that:
- Does **not** fall primarily into any of the elimination categories
- Is written for human readers — including **natural language, explanation, commentary, or analysis**
- Includes **scientific, academic, or technical discussions**, even if highly formal or specialized  
  *(e.g., discussions of model architecture, training benchmarks, research outcomes, biological findings, or engineering analysis)*
- May contain structured or technical vocabulary, **as long as it is not formatted primarily like code or machine output**
- Reflects **communication intended for developers or users**, such as thoughtful suggestions, analysis, or critiques

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``.

Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:; ```; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1; AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2; AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT; >polyA; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA; ```. The adapter sequence in this file should be at least 6bp long, otherwise it will be skipped. And you can give whatever you want to trim, rather than regular sequencing adapters (i.e. polyA). `fastp` first trims the auto-detected adapter or the adapter sequences given by `--adapter_sequence | --adapter_sequence_r2`, then trims the adapters given by `--adapter_fasta` one by one. The sequence distribution of trimmed adapters can be found at the HTML/JSON reports. # per read cutting by quality score; `fastp` supports per read sliding window cutting by evaluating the mean quality scores in the sliding window.

This feature is enabled for NextSeq/NovaSeq data by default, and you can specify `-g` or `--trim_poly_g` to enable it for any data, or specify `-G` or `--disable_trim_poly_g` to disable it. NextSeq/NovaSeq data is detected by the machine ID in the FASTQ records.  . A minimum length can be set with `<poly_g_min_len>` for `fastp` to detect polyG. This value is 10 by default. # polyX tail trimming; This feature is similar as polyG tail trimming, but is disabled by default. Use `-x` or `--trim_poly_x` to enable it. A minimum length can be set with `<poly_x_min_len>` for `fastp` to detect polyX. This value is 10 by default. When `polyG tail trimming` and `polyX tail trimming` are both enabled, fastp will perform `polyG trimming` first, then perform `polyX trimming`. This setting is useful for trimming the tails having `polyX (i.e. polyA) ` before `polyG`. `polyG` is usually caused by sequencing artifacts, while `polyA` can be commonly found from the tails of mRNA-Seq reads. # unique molecular identifier (UMI) processing; UMI is useful for duplication elimination and error correction based on generating consensus of reads originated from a same DNA fragment.

If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

erged, `read1` passes filters but `read2` doesn't.; * `--unpaired2` will be the reads that cannot be merged, `read2` passes filters but `read1` doesn't.; * `--include_unmerged` can be enabled to make reads of `--out1`, `--out2`, `--unpaired1` and `--unpaired2` redirected to `--merged_out`. So you will get a single output file. This option is disabled by default. `--failed_out` can still be given to store the reads (either merged or unmerged) failed to passing filters. In the output file, a tag like `merged_xxx_yyy`will be added to each read name to indicate that how many base pairs are from read1 and from read2, respectively. For example, `; @NB551106:9:H5Y5GBGX2:1:22306:18653:13119 1:N:0:GATCAG merged_150_15`; means that 150bp are from read1, and 15bp are from read2. `fastp` prefers the bases in read1 since they usually have higher quality than read2. Same as the [base correction feature](#base-correction-for-pe-data), this function is also based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_percent_limit (default 20%)`. Please note that the reads should meet these three conditions simultaneously. # duplication rate and deduplication; For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. ## duplication rate evaluation; By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the

Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.; * For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.; * For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The m",MatchSource.DOCS,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md:12326,detect,detection,12326,README.md,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.23.4/README.md,1,['detect'],['detection'],"

ile lines may be a little greater than the value specified by `--split_by_lines` since `fastp` reads and writes data by blocks (a block = 1000 reads). # overrepresented sequence analysis; Overrepresented sequence analysis is disabled by default, you can specify `-p` or `--overrepresentation_analysis` to enable it. For consideration of speed and memory, `fastp` only counts sequences with length of 10bp, 20bp, 40bp, 100bp or (cycles - 2 ). By default, fastp uses 1/20 reads for sequence counting, and you can change this settings by specifying `-P` or `--overrepresentation_sampling` option. For example, if you set `-P 100`, only 1/100 reads will be used for counting, and if you set `-P 1`, all reads will be used but it will be extremely slow. The default value 20 is a balance of speed and accuracy. `fastp` not only gives the counts of overrepresented sequence, but also gives the information that how they distribute over cycles. A figure is provided for each detected overrepresented sequence, from which you can know where this sequence is mostly found. # merge paired-end reads; For paired-end (PE) input, fastp supports stiching them by specifying the `-m/--merge` option. In this `merging` mode:. * `--merged_out` shouuld be given to specify the file to store merged reads, otherwise you should enable `--stdout` to stream the merged reads to STDOUT. The merged reads are also filtered.; * `--out1` and `--out2` will be the reads that cannot be merged successfully, but both pass all the filters.; * `--unpaired1` will be the reads that cannot be merged, `read1` passes filters but `read2` doesn't.; * `--unpaired2` will be the reads that cannot be merged, `read2` passes filters but `read1` doesn't.; * `--include_unmerged` can be enabled to make reads of `--out1`, `--out2`, `--unpaired1` and `--unpaired2` redirected to `--merged_out`.

However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:; ```; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1; AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2; AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT; >polyA; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA; ``

But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.; * For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.; * For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.; * The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.; * `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:; ```; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1; AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA; >Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2; AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT; >polyA; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA; ```. The adapter sequence in this file should be at least 6bp long, otherwise it will be skipped. And you can give whatever you want to trim, rather than regular sequencing adapters (i.e. polyA). `fastp` first trims the auto-detected adapter or the adapter sequences given by `--adapter_sequence | --adapter_sequence_r2`,

## Now analyze ONLY the following content:

**Content to evaluate:**  
n; For both SE and PE data, fastp supports evaluating its duplication rate and removing duplicated reads/pairs. fastp considers one read as duplicated only if its all base pairs are identical as another one. This meas if there is a sequencing error or an N base, the read will not be treated as duplicated. ## duplication rate evaluation; By default, fastp evaluates duplication rate, and this module may use 1G memory and take 10% ~ 20% more running time. If you don't need the duplication rate information, you can set `--dont_eval_duplication` to disable the duplication evaluation. But please be noted that, if deduplication (`--dedup`) option is enabled, then `--dont_eval_duplication` option is ignored. fastp uses a hash algorithm to find the identical sequences. Due to the possible hash collision, about 0.01% of the total reads may be wrongly recognized as deduplicated reads. Normally this may not impact the downstream analysis. The accuracy of calculating duplication can be improved by increasing the hash buffer number or enlarge the buffer size. The option `--dup_calc_accuracy` can be used to specify the level (1 ~ 6). The higher level means more memory usage and more running time. Please refer to following table:. | dup_calc_accuracy level | hash buffer number | buffer size | memory usage | speed | |; |- | - | - | - | - | - |; | 1 | 1 | 1G | 1G | ultra-fast | default for no-dedup mode |; | 2 | 1 | 2G | 2G | fast | |; | 3 | 2 | 2G | 4G | fast | default for dedup|; | 4 | 2 | 4G | 8G | fast | |; | 5 | 2 | 8G | 12G | fast | |; | 6 | 3 | 8G | 24G | moderate | |. ## deduplication; Since `v0.22.0`, fastp supports deduplication for FASTQ data. Specify `-D` or `--dedup` to enable this option. When `--dedup` is enabled, the `dup_calc_accuracy` level is default to `3`, and it can be changed to any value of 1 ~ 6. # all options; ```shell; usage: fastp -i <in1> -o <out1> [-I <in1> -O <out2>] [options...]; options:; # I/O options; -i, --in1 read1 input file name (string); -o, --o

Currently; accepted format specifiers are ``%u``, ``%d``, ``%x`` and ``%X``. If absent,; the format specifier defaults to ``%u``. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG:]], 0x[[#%.8X,ADDR:]]. would match ``mov r5, 0x0000FEFE`` and set ``REG`` to the value ``5`` and; ``ADDR`` to the value ``0xFEFE``. Note that due to the precision it would fail; to match ``mov r5, 0xFEFE``. As a result of the numeric variable definition being optional, it is possible; to only check that a numeric value is present in a given format.

### Example 3
**Content:** I've been testing the latest updates on our scientific computing framework, and I'm impressed by the improvements in performance. The new parallelization strategy has reduced our simulation times by about 30% on our cluster. However, I noticed that memory usage spikes significantly when handling large datasets. Perhaps we could explore more efficient data structures or caching mechanisms to mitigate this issue? @TeamLead, would it be possible to allocate some resources to investigate this further?

### Example 4
**Content:** I've been experimenting with the GPU acceleration patches in this PR, and the results are promising. We're seeing a significant boost in matrix operations, which is crucial for our machine learning models. However, I encountered some inconsistencies when running on different GPU architectures.

### Example 5
**Content:** I've been exploring the energy efficiency improvements in our latest scientific computing framework, and I'm excited about the potential savings. By implementing parallelization strategies and optimizing data structures, we've reduced energy consumption by approximately 25% on our cluster. However, I think we could further enhance this by integrating tools like EnergyMeter to monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time. Additionally, exploring autotuning frameworks like ytopt could help balance performance and energy efficiency across different hardware configurations. @DevTeam, would it be feasible to allocate resources for integrating these tools and conducting a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis?

This can be seen in the above example; the; second ``MemoryUse`` in ``if.end`` has an operand of ``1``, which is a; ``MemoryDef`` from the entry block. This is done to make walking,; value numbering, etc, faster and easier.; As of `this revision <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121381>`_, the default was; changed to not optimize uses at build time, in order to provide the option to; reduce compile-time if the walking is not necessary in a pass. Most users call; the new API ``ensureOptimizedUses()`` to keep the previous behavior and do a; one-time optimization of ``MemoryUse``\ s, if this was not done before.; New pass users are recommended to call ``ensureOptimizedUses()``. Initially it was not possible to optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s in the same way, as we; restricted ``MemorySSA`` to one operand per access.; This was changed and ``MemoryDef``\ s now keep two operands.; The first one, the defining access, is; always the previous ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` in the same basic block, or; the last one in a dominating predecessor if the current block doesn't have any; other accesses writing to memory. This is needed for walking Def chains.; The second operand is the optimized access, if there was a previous call on the; walker's ``getClobberingMemoryAccess(MA)``.
