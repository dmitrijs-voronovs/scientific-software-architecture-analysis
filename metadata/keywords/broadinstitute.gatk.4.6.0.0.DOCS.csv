This reference contains some alterations from the baseline reference from the Genome Reference Consortium. These alterations largely consist of contig name changes, however there are *known sequence differences on some contigs as well*. . Anecdotally the changes are for bases for which there was low confidence. Those low confidence bases were then masked out in the `b37` reference to be the `IUPAC` symbol for any base.

This is due to the pre-packaged Gencode data sources being for those two references. **Any reference genome with published Gencode data sources can be used.**. <a name=""1.4.1""></a>; #### 1.4.1 - hg19 vs b37 Reference; The Broad Institute uses an alternate hg19 reference known as b37 for our sequencing. UCSC uses the baseline hg19 reference. These references are similar but different. . Due to the Gencode data source being published by UCSC, the data sources all use the hg19 reference for hg19 data (as opposed to b37). Funcotator detects when user data is from the b37 reference and forces the use of the hg19 data sources in this case. The user is warned when this occurs. Generally speaking this is OK, but due to the differences in the sequence data it is possible that some erroneous data will be created. . This effect has not yet been quantified, but in most cases should not be appreciable. For details, see [this forum post](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/dsde/discussion/23390/grch37-hg19-b37-humang1kv37-human-reference-discrepancies ""this forum post""). <a name=""1.5""></a>; #### 1.5 - Comparisons with Oncotator; Oncotator is an older functional annotation tool developed by The Broad Institute.

It analyzes given variants for their function (as retrieved from a set of data sources) and produces the analysis in a specified output file. Funcotator reads in a VCF file, labels each variant with one of twenty-three distinct variant classifications, produces gene information (e.g. affected gene, predicted variant amino acid sequence, etc.), and associations to information in datasources. Default supported datasources include GENCODE (gene information and protein change prediction), dbSNP, gnomAD, and COSMIC (among others). The corpus of datasources is extensible and user-configurable and includes cloud-based datasources supported with Google Cloud Storage. Funcotator produces either a Variant Call Format (VCF) file (with annotations in the INFO field) or a Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) file. Funcotator allows the user to add their own annotations to variants based on a set of data sources. Each data source can be customized to annotate a variant based on several matching criteria. This allows a user to create their own custom annotations easily, without modifying any Java code. ## Setup . To run the Funcotator WDL you must have access to a cromwell server that can run your job. Once your cromwell instance is active, you will need to generate input arguments to pass to funcotator.wdl. These arguments re passed in as a JSON file (see below for a non-working example).

These parameters are ignored if you do not run Funcotator.; - Several fields in a TCGA MAF cannot be generated by M2 and Funcotator, such as all fields relating to validation alleles.

To run on a Dataproc cluster it is straightforward to run workflows; locally (the computation takes place on the cluster, of course),; or using a hosted Cromwell backend.
