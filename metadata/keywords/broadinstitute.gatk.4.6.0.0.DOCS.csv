For a tutorial, see the GitHub guides on [forking a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [sending a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/be-social/). If applicable, include the issue number in the pull request name.; * Make sure that your code passes all our tests. You can run the tests with `./gradlew test` in the root directory.; * Add tests for all new code you've written. We prefer unit tests but high quality integration tests that use small amounts of data are acceptable.; * Follow the [**General guidelines for GATK4 developers**](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk#general-guidelines-for-gatk4-developers). We tend to do fairly close readings of pull requests, and you may get a lot of comments. Some things to consider:; * Write tests for all new code.; * Document all classes and public methods.; * For all public methods, check validity of the arguments and throw `IllegalArgumentException` if invalid.; * Use braces for control constructs, `if`, `for` etc.; * Make classes, variables, parameters etc `final` unless there is a strong reason not to.; * Give your operators some room. Not `a+b` but `a + b` and not `foo(int a,int b)` but `foo(int a, int b)`.; * Generally speaking, stick to the [Google Java Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

Comment on the issue to indicate you're interested in contibuting code and for sharing your questions and ideas. To contribute a patch:; * Break your work into small, single-purpose patches if possible. It’s much harder to merge in a large change with a lot of disjoint features.; * Submit the patch as a GitHub pull request against the master branch. For a tutorial, see the GitHub guides on [forking a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [sending a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/be-social/). If applicable, include the issue number in the pull request name.; * Make sure that your code passes all our tests. You can run the tests with `./gradlew test` in the root directory.; * Add tests for all new code you've written. We prefer unit tests but high quality integration tests that use small amounts of data are acceptable.; * Follow the [**General guidelines for GATK4 developers**](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk#general-guidelines-for-gatk4-developers). We tend to do fairly close readings of pull requests, and you may get a lot of comments. Some things to consider:; * Write tests for all new code.; * Document all classes and public methods.; * For all public methods, check validity of the arguments and throw `IllegalArgumentException` if invalid.; * Use braces for control constructs, `if`, `for` etc.; * Make classes, variables, parameters etc `final` unless there is a strong reason not to.; * Give your operators some room. Not `a+b` but `a + b` and not `foo(int a,int b)` but `foo(int a, int b)`.; * Generally speaking, stick to the [Google Java Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

Newer versions of Funcotator require minimum versions of data sources in order to run. If a new version of Funcotator is run with an older version of the data sources, an error will be thrown prompting the user to download a new release of the data sources. . Similarly newer releases of the data source packages are not reverse compatible with older versions of Funcotator. However, in this case Funcotator may or may not throw an error or warning. To ensure compatibility when upgrading Funcotator, always download the latest data sources release. Similarly, when updating data sources make sure to update Funcotator to the latest version. <a name=""1.2"">",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/funcotator/forum_info/forum_post_tutorial.md,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/4.6.0.0/docs/funcotator/forum_info/forum_post_tutorial.md

UCSC uses the baseline hg19 reference. These references are similar but different. . Due to the Gencode data source being published by UCSC, the data sources all use the hg19 reference for hg19 data (as opposed to b37). Funcotator detects when user data is from the b37 reference and forces the use of the hg19 data sources in this case. The user is warned when this occurs. Generally speaking this is OK, but due to the differences in the sequence data it is possible that some erroneous data will be created. . This effect has not yet been quantified, but in most cases should not be appreciable.

This repo contains the scripts for creating and pushing two docker images:; - gatkbase -- a basic docker image that we do not expect to change very often. The GATK4 docker image uses this one (``FROM``); - gatk4 -- the official docker image for GATK4. The instructions in this document pertain to this image, unless otherwise stated. ``scripts/docker/gatkbase/build_docker_base_cloud.sh`` and ``scripts/docker/gatkbase/build_docker_base_locally.sh`` are scripts to create the gatkbase docker image. ; ``build_docker.sh`` is a script to create the full gatk4 docker image.; ``build_docker_remote.sh`` is a script to create the full gatk4 docker image using google cloud build remotely. This is useful if you can't build the docker image locally (for example if you have an M1 Macbook) NOTE: this requires the user first specify their project with the command `gcloud config set project <PROJECT>` to a project that has access to google cloud build. . ## GATK4 Docker image.

It analyzes given variants for their function (as retrieved from a set of data sources) and produces the analysis in a specified output file. Funcotator reads in a VCF file, labels each variant with one of twenty-three distinct variant classifications, produces gene information (e.g. affected gene, predicted variant amino acid sequence, etc.), and associations to information in datasources. Default supported datasources include GENCODE (gene information and protein change prediction), dbSNP, gnomAD, and COSMIC (among others). The corpus of datasources is extensible and user-configurable and includes cloud-based datasources supported with Google Cloud Storage. Funcotator produces either a Variant Call Format (VCF) file (with annotations in the INFO field) or a Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) file. Funcotator allows the user to add their own annotations to variants based on a set of data sources. Each data source can be customized to annotate a variant based on several matching criteria. This allows a user to create their own custom annotations easily, without modifying any Java code. ## Setup . To run the Funcotator WDL you must have access to a cromwell server that can run your job. Once your cromwell instance is active, you will need to generate input arguments to pass to funcotator.wdl. These arguments re passed in as a JSON file (see below for a non-working example). Once a JSON file has been created you can submit your job to a cromwell server directly (i.e. using a tool such as Cromshell) or through Terra/FireCloud. ## WDL Input Parameters.

It analyzes given variants for their function (as retrieved from a set of data sources) and produces the analysis in a specified output file. Funcotator reads in a VCF file, labels each variant with one of twenty-three distinct variant classifications, produces gene information (e.g. affected gene, predicted variant amino acid sequence, etc.), and associations to information in datasources. Default supported datasources include GENCODE (gene information and protein change prediction), dbSNP, gnomAD, and COSMIC (among others). The corpus of datasources is extensible and user-configurable and includes cloud-based datasources supported with Google Cloud Storage. Funcotator produces either a Variant Call Format (VCF) file (with annotations in the INFO field) or a Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) file. Funcotator allows the user to add their own annotations to variants based on a set of data sources. Each data source can be customized to annotate a variant based on several matching criteria. This allows a user to create their own custom annotations easily, without modifying any Java code. ## Setup . To run the Funcotator WDL you must have access to a cromwell server that can run your job. Once your cromwell instance is active, you will need to generate input arguments to pass to funcotator.wdl. These arguments re passed in as a JSON file (see below for a non-working example). Once a JSON file has been created you can submit your job to a cromwell server directly (i.e. using a tool such as Cromshell) or through Terra/FireCloud. ## WDL Input Parameters.

Funcotator allows the user to add their own annotations to variants based on a set of data sources. Each data source can be customized to annotate a variant based on several matching criteria. This allows a user to create their own custom annotations easily, without modifying any Java code. By default the M2 WDL runs Funcotator for functional annotation and produce a TCGA MAF from the M2 VCF. There are several notes and caveats; - Several parameters should be passed in to populate the TCGA MAF metadata fields. Default values are provided, though we recommend that you specify the values. These parameters are ignored if you do not run Funcotator.; - Several fields in a TCGA MAF cannot be generated by M2 and Funcotator, such as all fields relating to validation alleles. These will need to be populated by a downstream process created by the user.; - Funcotator does not enforce the TCGA MAF controlled vocabulary, since it is often too restrictive for general use. This is up to the user to specify correctly.; *Therefore, we cannot guarantee that a TCGA MAF generated here will pass the TCGA Validator*. If you are unsure about the ramifications of this statement, then it probably does not concern you.; - More information about Funcotator can be found at: https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/dsde/discussion/11193/funcotator-information-and-tutorial/ . ### Parameter descriptions. #### mutect2_multi_sample.

Funcotator reads in a VCF file, labels each variant with one of twenty-three distinct variant classifications, produces gene information (e.g. affected gene, predicted variant amino acid sequence, etc.), and associations to information in datasources. Default supported datasources include GENCODE (gene information and protein change prediction), dbSNP, gnomAD, and COSMIC (among others). The corpus of datasources is extensible and user-configurable and includes cloud-based datasources supported with Google Cloud Storage. Funcotator produces either a Variant Call Format (VCF) file (with annotations in the INFO field) or a Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) file. Funcotator allows the user to add their own annotations to variants based on a set of data sources. Each data source can be customized to annotate a variant based on several matching criteria. This allows a user to create their own custom annotations easily, without modifying any Java code. By default the M2 WDL runs Funcotator for functional annotation and produce a TCGA MAF from the M2 VCF. There are several notes and caveats; - Several parameters should be passed in to populate the TCGA MAF metadata fields. Default values are provided, though we recommend that you specify the values. These parameters are ignored if you do not run Funcotator.; - Several fields in a TCGA MAF cannot be generated by M2 and Funcotator, such as all fields relating to validation alleles.

Funcotator (**FUNC**tional ann**OTATOR**) is a functional annotation tool in the core GATK toolset and was designed to handle both somatic and germline use cases. It analyzes given variants for their function (as retrieved from a set of data sources) and produces the analysis in a specified output file. Funcotator reads in a VCF file, labels each variant with one of twenty-three distinct variant classifications, produces gene information (e.g. affected gene, predicted variant amino acid sequence, etc.), and associations to information in datasources. Default supported datasources include GENCODE (gene information and protein change prediction), dbSNP, gnomAD, and COSMIC (among others). The corpus of datasources is extensible and user-configurable and includes cloud-based datasources supported with Google Cloud Storage. Funcotator produces either a Variant Call Format (VCF) file (with annotations in the INFO field) or a Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) file. Funcotator allows the user to add their own annotations to variants based on a set of data sources. Each data source can be customized to annotate a variant based on several matching criteria.
