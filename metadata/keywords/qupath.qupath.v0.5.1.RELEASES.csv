This release contains many small-but-important fixes and updates requested over the past month. Most noticeably, it is now possible to export annotation and detection measurements more easily from within scripts. Additionally, this release adds **a new command for detecting subcellular spots and clusters**. This has been written in a particularly general way, so that it can be applied to up to 2 chromogenic stains (brightfield) or any number of fluorescence stains that QuPath can handle.
