Many thanks for the persistent feedback -- it wasn't a ""leak"" but more a ; ""stupid memory use"" issue that I eventually was able to find with your ; example file. Best,; -Geoff.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: o the lack of documentation in the original OpenBabel code. It appears that the notions of ""implicit hydrogens"" and ""implicit valence"" aren't documented, and it seems to be used to mean different things depending on who was writing code, where the molecule came from, and where it's going. * In some cases, the number of hydrogens is assumed to be the ImplicitHydrogen count (regardless of whether there are other explicit hydrogens). * In some cases, if there is at least one explicit hydrogen, the ImplicitHydrogen count is ignored and the total H count is just the explicit hydrogens. * In some cases, the total H count seems to be the implicit count plus the explicit hydrogens. In my humble opinion, the fundamental problem begins here:. void SetImplicitValence(int val); void IncrementImplicitValence(); void DecrementImplicitValence(). In my view, there is no such thing as ""implicit valence"". Valence is a well-defined property of an atom. Worse, the notion of ""implicit valence"" is never clearly documented, leading to different interpretations. On the other hand, for pragmatic reasons, we often choose to leave hydrogens out of our data structures, and have the notion of ""implicit hydrogens"", the number of hydrogens we would have to add to make our data structure match the molecule of interest. But -- and here's the problem -- it's almost impossible to deduce the actual hydrogen count from the valence, because the valence rules are built into different parsers and can be different depending on the parser. The obvious solution is to get rid of ""implicit valence"", and have either ""actual hydrogen count"" or ""actual valence"" on the OBAtom object, to handle cases where an atom is not in its normal valence state, or where the element's valence is not obvious.

Besides, I found the following behavior to be rather puzzling:; <pre><code>obabel -:""OC(=O)c1ccccc1"" -omol2 --gen3D -p 7.4 -O obabel_firstpass.mol2; obabel -imol2 obabel_firstpass.mol2 -omol2 -p 7.4 -O obabel_secondpass.mol2; </code></pre>The molecule obabel_secondpass.mol2 has correct typing and charge (~-1).; The following code replicates the behavior of obabel commands above, generating the proper molecule only at the second pass:; <pre><code>; # Python Obabel/Pybel test; import pybel; ob = pybel.ob; from sys import argv; fp = open('benzoicAcid.smi', 'w'); fp.write('OC(=O)c1ccccc1 benzoicAcid\n'); fp.close(); """"""read SMI and generate Mol2 (first pass)""""""; obc = ob.OBConversion(); obc.SetInAndOutFormats('smi', 'mol2'); obc.OpenInAndOutFiles('benzoicAcid.smi', 'wrong.mol2'); mol = ob.OBMol(); notatend = obc.Read(mol); while notatend:; """"""pybel shortcut""""""; pmol = pybel.Molecule(mol); pmol.make3D(); mol = pmol.OBMol; mol.CorrectForPH(); mol.AddHydrogens(); obc.Write(mol); """"""XXX write molecule with wrong carboxylic atom typing: O.3 and O.2""""""; print ""Atoms count (first pass):"", mol.NumAtoms(); mol = ob.OBMol(); notatend = obc.Read(mol); """""" re-read the wrong molecule""""""; obc = ob.OBConversion(); obc.SetInAndOutFormats('mol2', 'mol2'); obc.OpenInAndOutFiles('op.mol2', 'right.mol2'); mol = ob.OBMol(); notatend = obc.Read(mol); while notatend:; """"""pybel shortcut""""""; pmol = pybel.Molecule(mol); #pmol.make3D(); mol = pmol.OBMol; mol.Cor

Usability,simpl,simple,"Thanks, Noel. I agree that it's probably not a bug, although it does mean you are interpreting SMILES strings differently to Daylight, which may not be what people expect. Do you know how other software handles these H's?. For my original purpose, a better query would be something like [Nv2H1], which is unambiguous (obviously once the other bug has been fixed). Coming from a background where our compounds are (nearly) always stored as SMILES, I'd probably been using the Dn descriptor a little lazily. If you can (almost) guarantee no explicit H's, it's phenomenally useful for generating simple queries for e.g. primary amines, pyridones etc. that are independent of tautomeric / protomeric state.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: Thanks, Noel. I agree that it's probably not a bug, although it does mean you are interpreting SMILES strings differently to Daylight, which may not be what people expect. Do you know how other software handles these H's?. For my original purpose, a better query would be something like [Nv2H1], which is unambiguous (obviously once the other bug has been fixed). Coming from a background where our compounds are (nearly) always stored as SMILES, I'd probably been using the Dn descriptor a little lazily. If you can (almost) guarantee no explicit H's, it's phenomenally useful for generating simple queries for e.g. primary amines, pyridones etc. that are independent of tautomeric / protomeric state.

Usability,simpl,simple,"To be honest I kind of agree with you on the whole Dn thing - using queries that rely on explicit vs implicit H's does just sound like a bad idea. Perhaps I shouldn't have waxed quite so lyrical in my previous response. I have been caught out a couple of times even in a SMILES + Daylight environment - deuterated compounds being one example.... To answer your question, if you do make the assumption that all H's are implicit, then a query for a primary amine is as simple as [ND1][CX4], and you can capture both pyridone tautomers with [nD2]c~[OD1]. ""Dn"" becomes a synonym for ""is bonded to n heavy atoms"", which can come in very handy. But to reiterate, on reflection I think this is slightly sloppy querying on my part, and I certainly wouldn't suggest changing the way OB works just so that these queries work as expected. (Though I'd be interested to know how many other people use similar kinds of queries). I do think it would be worth finding out what some of the other major software vendors do with the H descriptor in a SMILES string though, even if this is just a matter of internal representation. To put it another way, if everybody else does it the same way Daylight does, is there a good reason OB is different?. Anyway, thanks for making me think this through a bit more rigorously!.

Availability,avail,available,"Dear Sir,; Thank you very much for answering and helping me. ; recently, several chemoinformatic tools has been developed to either cluster existing reactions using molecular fingerprint and machinery learning techniques, or produce new reactions for a set of molecules using the concept of generalized reaction rules. these methods are dependant on molecular fingerprints or mol files. as far as I know, the concept of aromaticity is only available in canonical SMILES structure not in molecular fingerprint or mol file. so when we convert an aromatic SMILES to these kind of molecular descriptor, we only consider one tautomer out of all possible structures. that is why I was looking for a function to produce all valence tautomers. I could generate kekule forms by writing the following c++ function:. pair<string,string> getKekulizedSmiles(const vector<string>& newVector, int i); {; string canSmiles;; string kekSmiles;; OBMol mol;; OBConversion conv;; canSmiles = newVector[i];; if (! conv.SetInAndOutFormats(""smi"", ""smi"")); {; cout<<""Formats not available\n"";; }; conv.ReadString(&mol,canSmiles);; conv.SetOptions(""xC"", OBConversion::OUTOPTIONS);; conv.SetOptions(""xk"", OBConversion::OUTOPTIONS);; kekSmiles = conv.WriteString(&mol, true);; return {canSmiles, kekSmiles};; }. though, I still don't know what does '-xk' do. :)).

Content: Dear Sir,; Thank you very much for answering and helping me. ; recently, several chemoinformatic tools has been developed to either cluster existing reactions using molecular fingerprint and machinery learning techniques, or produce new reactions for a set of molecules using the concept of generalized reaction rules. these methods are dependant on molecular fingerprints or mol files. as far as I know, the concept of aromaticity is only available in canonical SMILES structure not in molecular fingerprint or mol file. so when we convert an aromatic SMILES to these kind of molecular descriptor, we only consider one tautomer out of all possible structures. that is why I was looking for a function to produce all valence tautomers. I could generate kekule forms by writing the following c++ function:. pair<string,string> getKekulizedSmiles(const vector<string>& newVector, int i); {; string canSmiles;; string kekSmiles;; OBMol mol;; OBConversion conv;; canSmiles = newVector[i];; if (! conv.SetInAndOutFormats(""smi"", ""smi"")); {; cout<<""Formats not available\n"";; }; conv.ReadString(&mol,canSmiles);; conv.SetOptions(""xC"", OBConversion::OUTOPTIONS);; conv.SetOptions(""xk"", OBConversion::OUTOPTIONS);; kekSmiles = conv.WriteString(&mol, true);; return {canSmiles, kekSmiles};; }. though, I still don't know what does '-xk' do. :)).

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: Your are right! A user can handle the functionality by himself, that's what I did in my own code to fix the bug. From another side, I think that convenience is important part of any libraries API. Users used to have such functionality: dictionaries in python, boost property tree etc. all of them have get(<default>) methods in API. I hope, that the solution I've proposed can be safe and convenient solution for users of your package (feedback is very welcome).

Content: > Can an atom with a hydrogen and a lone pair be stereogenic? This is related to stereocenter perception. Let me ping @johnmay on this. I'm pretty sure there are cases of this related to S (maybe not N), but I think John can clear this up. Possible but unlikely, I can't think of any sane Sp3 that would exhibit this.

Performance,cache,cached,"Let me explain (but not excuse) what's happening here. We have some code to short circuit InChI to InChIKey conversion. Basically on reading an InChI (and only an InChI), the InChI is stored as an attribute of the molecule. Any subsequent requests for the InChI just use this stored value rather than recalculating it. Without this short circuit, the conversion would be done by reading an InChI into an OBMol, converting the OBMol into an InChI and then subsequently into an InChIKey. The problem is that this might give a different result (as reading an InChI doesn't always sufficiently preserve the original structure). Modifying the molecule in-between clearly invalidates the InChI, but we don't have a mechanism internally to intercept modifications, so this is left to the user. If you ""print(inchi.data)"" you will see the offending data item. Deleting this (""del inchi.data['inchi']"") removes the cached value. In general I don't like automagic stuff like this, as it breaks code in complicated and unexpected ways.

I am just starting to understand the OB library. ; I am using it mainly to handle (programmatic) reads from files now, since it supports so many formats. Once in memory it is difficult to understand the ownership of stuff, so I am using it as read-only objects to avoid messing with it (constness is also strange in the library, it is used for somethings and not others). > Yeah, `obabel` opens a few hundred thousand files / streams with no leaks. The code for `obabel` is online:; > int count = Conv.FullConvert(FileList, OutputFileName, OutputFileList);; > ; > > does it make sense to load libraries on the fly and each time a Read operation is performed?; > ; > No, it doesn't, but you don't need to read the way you wrote the code. The compiler and `openbabel` are just doing exactly what you asked. What I mean is that using `dl_open` for something that is already in the library seems to be an overkill, but I am probably missing something. What object is actually loaded with `dl_open`, is it because each format has to be treated as plugin, because they are too many?. > ; > * Move `OBConversion` out of the loop. First rule of optimization is move things out of loops that aren't _required_ to be in loops. A variable inside the loop is created / destroyed every iteration. Yes, there is a question of efficiency that one has to take into account and there a question of leaks.; The `for` loop was only to show that there is systematic leak and not a one off (e.g. static) leak. Moving the conversion out of scopes is many times the solution (for efficiency) but it has a design cost. (To the point that eventually one needs to make everything global).; Not to mention that it starts messing with the thread safety of the program. > ; > * The docs note that `ReadFile` retains the stream object, which is a small leak. . Ah, ok, so it is not purely a problem with `dl_open` then?. In any case, I didn't appreciate until that some compromised were made

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds. I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file. It equally helps you to build something in a reproducible way (share with a colleague, your script is written in partial fulfillment of a class, etc.). Regarding the GUI of openbabel: you don't have to use it. Like every GUI, the developers selected some functionality which now is presented in a hierarchy assumed to be logical and useful. If there is only one, or a few of structures to interconvert into an other file format, the GUI *can* be useful. The access from the CLI however is *more suitable* (or, the only reasonable way) to interact with openbabel to *pipe* and *tee* input, output, error streams with a script, or programs (grep, sed, awk; an other instance of openbabel; something written by you, etc.).

I suppose I was low-key wondering how I was getting results, given that I didn't think MMFF94 supported radicals either, but the geometry guesses I looked at were fine for my application and I assumed obabel had some special way of handling these radicals. So I guess now I'm not sure what's going on, and why most radicals work (or ""work"") but the aforementioned one does not. For what it's worth, I don't actually need perfect geometries for my application because my next step is to feed them to a more accurate optimization. In fact for my purposes I could even obtain the geometry of the anion from obabel and let the more accurate optimization fine-tune the anion to the radical. So getting this perfect isn't immediately crucial to me but I am now curious what obabel is actually doing (and if you have a recommendation for the best way to process radicals in obabel to generate a good starting guess for a more accurate method, I'm all ears). P.S. It's wonderful to hear from you! I think I went for a run with you and Alán when you both visited UCLA!

There are instances where an additional information is provided, encoded in color, on an isosurface, e.g. ![b818330a-f12](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/assets/19709084/e28f7ec1-763f-4f26-b91f-7b815ea9d3d0).

Deployability,configurat,configuration,"@arebruvold No, it is not twisted. However the configuration of the N=N double bond is not explicitly defined and a crossed double bond conventionally indicates you refer either i) to a mixture of (*E*) and (*Z*) difluorodiazene, or ii) you know there is the N=N double bond, but don't assign its configuration (perhaps by lack of information). For writing a .mol/.mol2/.sdf file with atomic coordinates the situation is even worse than for an illustration: imagine you construct a physical model of this molecule and now don't know where to put the fluorine atoms. In this particular case, you might better describe either the (*E*) configuration with `F\N=N\F`, or the (*Z*) isomer by `F\N=N/F`. Don't forget CIP rules assign a non-bonding (here implicit) electron pair a priority `0`, i.e. even lower than for an atom of hydrogen. Daylight compiled a set of references to learn more about (basic) SMILES' rules, see the [tutorial](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smiles/index.html) and its links to theory and static examples. Because SMILES and subsequently SMARTS can be very helpful to search in databases, I recommend to complement your study with the two blog posts by Noel O'Boyle [SMARTS for dummies](https://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2018/11/smarts-for-dummies.html), its sequel [Smarts for Dummies Part II ](https://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2023/02/smarts-for-dummies-part-ii.html) and the interactive [test pad](https://baoilleach.github.io/smartersmarts-js/) (requires only a web browser, JavaScript enabled). Finally, Marvin by ChemAxon introduced [extended SMILES](https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/formats_chemaxon-extended-smiles-and-smarts-cxsmiles-and-cxsmarts.md) as a format to retain additional information some programs equally can process, too (e.g. [Marvin JS](https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.com/latest/); [CDK depict](https://www.simolecule.com/cdkdepict/depict.html), [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/RDKit_Book.html#cxsmiles-cxsmarts-extensions)).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2699#issuecomment-2127061510,"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

Content: > Open Babel already reads multiple coordinate sets from an XYZ (or others). On the command-line, it's the option `--readconformer`; > ; > You just need [`OBMol::AddConformer`](http://openbabel.org/api/3.0/classOpenBabel_1_1OBMol.shtml#a7b80e7015d000221e0cc92fd3cf6f9e4). Thanks @ghutchis. I need to make this work in python rather than command line I'm afraid though. I have been attempting to use OBMol.AddConformer(conf) where conf is a swig double * created from GetConformer or CopyConformer, but it's giving me some lovely memory errors. Example:. ```; def test_multipleconf(self):; obconversion = ob.OBConversion(); obconversion.SetInFormat(""xyz""); obmol = ob.OBMol(); notatend = obconversion.ReadFile(obmol, ""met_enkaph_movie.xyx""); obmol_master = ob.OBMol(); obconversion.ReadFile(obmol_master, ""met_enkaph_movie.xyx""); while notatend:; print(obmol.GetConformer(0)); temp = obmol.GetConformer(0); obmol_master.AddConformer(temp); obmol = ob.OBMol(); notatend = obconversion.Read(obmol); ```.
