DeepVariant is composed of three programs: `make_examples`, `call_variants`, and; `postprocess_variants`. More details about each program are described in detail; in the [Inputs and outputs](#inputs-and-outputs) section. ## Inputs and outputs. ### General notes. * Sharded files are a single logical collection of files with a common naming; convention. For example, we talk about `filename@10` as a single 10-way; sharded file named `filename`.

First, the reference genome FASTA, passed in using the `--ref` flag, must be; indexed and can either be uncompressed or compressed with bgzip. Second, the BAM file provided to `--reads` should be aligned to a ""compatible""; version of the genome reference provided as the `--ref`. By compatible here we; mean the BAM and FASTA share at least a reasonable set of common contigs, as; DeepVariant will only process contigs shared by both the BAM and reference. As; an example, suppose you have a BAM file mapped to b37 + decoy FASTA and you; provide just the vanilla b37 fasta to `make_examples`. DeepVariant will only; process variants on the shared contigs, effectively excluding the hs37d5 contig; present in the BAM but not in the reference. The BAM file must be also sorted and indexed. It must exist on disk, so you; cannot pipe it into DeepVariant. Duplicate marking may be performed, in our; analyses there is almost no difference in accuracy except at lower (<20x); coverages. Finally, we recommend that you do not perform BQSR. Running BQSR has; a small decrease on accuracy. It is not necessary to do any form of indel; realignment, though there is not a difference in DeepVariant accuracy either; way.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: res its input files to satisfy a few basic requirements to; be processed correctly. First, the reference genome FASTA, passed in using the `--ref` flag, must be; indexed and can either be uncompressed or compressed with bgzip. Second, the BAM file provided to `--reads` should be aligned to a ""compatible""; version of the genome reference provided as the `--ref`. By compatible here we; mean the BAM and FASTA share at least a reasonable set of common contigs, as; DeepVariant will only process contigs shared by both the BAM and reference. As; an example, suppose you have a BAM file mapped to b37 + decoy FASTA and you; provide just the vanilla b37 fasta to `make_examples`. DeepVariant will only; process variants on the shared contigs, effectively excluding the hs37d5 contig; present in the BAM but not in the reference. The BAM file must be also sorted and indexed. It must exist on disk, so you; cannot pipe it into DeepVariant. Duplicate marking may be performed, in our; analyses there is almost no difference in accuracy except at lower (<20x); coverages. Finally, we recommend that you do not perform BQSR. Running BQSR has; a small decrease on accuracy. It is not necessary to do any form of indel; realignment, though there is not a difference in DeepVariant accuracy either; way. Third, if you are providing `--regions` or other similar arguments these should; refer to contigs present in the reference genome. These arguments accept; space-separated lists, so all of the follow examples are valid arguments for; `--regions` or similar arguments:. * `--regions chr20` => only process all of chromosome 20; * `--regions chr20:10,000,000-11,000,000` => only process 10-11mb of chr20; * `--regions ""chr20 chr21""` => only process chromosomes 20 and 21.

Shuffling the `tensorflow.Example`s is an important step for training a model.; In our training logic, we shuffle examples globally using a preprocessing step. First, if you have run this step before, and want to rerun it, you might want to; consider cleaning up previous data first to avoid confusion:. ```bash; # (Optional) Clean up existing files.; gsutil -m rm -f ""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/training_set.with_label.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; gsutil rm -f ""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/training_set.dataset_config.pbtxt""; gsutil -m rm -f ""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/validation_set.with_label.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; gsutil rm -f ""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/validation_set.dataset_config.pbtxt""; gsutil rm -f ""${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/example_info.json""; ```. Here we provide examples for running on; [Cloud Dataflow Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/dataflow/); and also [DirectRunner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/).; Beam can also use other runners, such as; [Spark Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/spark/).

This chart shows quality scores from all; rows of the VCF file, including RefCalls. ### Genotype quality. These numbers come from the GQ sub-column, listed in the FORMAT column of the; VCF file. An important distinction here is that if the variant-caller is very; sure that the variant is there, but not sure if it is heterozygous or; homozygous, the QUAL score can be very high, but the genotype quality score (GQ); can be low. GQ is on a Phred scale, calculated as -10*log10(probability that the; genotype is wrong). Any entries without a GQ are ignored. ### Variant allele frequency for all genotypes. The histograms show the variant allele frequency (VAF) distributions for; different genotypes. Black guiding lines are shown to indicate the theoretical; VAF for the main genotypes.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: lls. Any entries without a DP are ignored. ### Quality score. This is the QUAL column of the VCF file. See the [VCF specification] for how; this is calculated, but in short, a high QUAL score indicates a low probability; that the call shown in ALT is wrong. This chart shows quality scores from all; rows of the VCF file, including RefCalls. ### Genotype quality. These numbers come from the GQ sub-column, listed in the FORMAT column of the; VCF file. An important distinction here is that if the variant-caller is very; sure that the variant is there, but not sure if it is heterozygous or; homozygous, the QUAL score can be very high, but the genotype quality score (GQ); can be low. GQ is on a Phred scale, calculated as -10*log10(probability that the; genotype is wrong). Any entries without a GQ are ignored. ### Variant allele frequency for all genotypes. The histograms show the variant allele frequency (VAF) distributions for; different genotypes. Black guiding lines are shown to indicate the theoretical; VAF for the main genotypes. For example heterozygous variants should have about; as many variant-supporting as reference-supporting reads, for a VAF of 0.5. The; reference calls will not usually show a VAF as low as 0 because otherwise they; wouldn’t have been flagged as candidates in the first place. The genotypes are; based on the GT sub-column and consolidated. For example, 0/1 and 0/2 both; become Het (0/x). 1/1 and 3/3 are Hom (x/x).

For example, when following the; [quick start](deepvariant-quick-start.md), including `--runtime_report; --logging_dir=/output/logs` would produce the following runtime profiling output; file and visual report:. ```; /output/logs/make_examples_runtime_by_region/make_examples_runtime-00000-of-00001.tsv; /output/logs/make_examples_runtime_by_region_report.html; ```. ### Running stages individually. If you are using make_examples itself without the run_deepvariant script, supply; make_examples with `--runtime_by_region=` a filename (.tsv). If the examples are; sharded then the runtime profile should be sharded into the same number of; shards, e.g. when using `examples@64` then runtimes could be `runtimes@64.tsv`.
