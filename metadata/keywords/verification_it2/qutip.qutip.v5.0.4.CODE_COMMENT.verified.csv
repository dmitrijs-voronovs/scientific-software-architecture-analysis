Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: ficients. For function based coefficients, the function signature must be either:. * ``f(t, ...)`` where the other arguments are supplied as ordinary; ""pythonic"" arguments (e.g. ``f(t, w, a=5)``); * ``f(t, args)`` where the arguments are supplied in a ""dict"" named; ``args``. By default the signature style is controlled by the; ``qutip.settings.core[""function_coefficient_style""]`` setting, but it; may be overriden here by specifying either ``function_style=""pythonic""``; or ``function_style=""dict""``. *Examples*:. - pythonic style function signature::. def f1_t(t, w):; return np.exp(-1j * t * w). coeff1 = coefficient(f1_t, args={""w"": 1.}). - dict style function signature::. def f2_t(t, args):; return np.exp(-1j * t * args[""w""]). coeff2 = coefficient(f2_t, args={""w"": 1.}). For string based coeffients, the string must be a compilable python code; resulting in a complex. The following symbols are defined:. sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, pi,; sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh,; exp, log, log10, erf, zerf, sqrt,; real, imag, conj, abs, norm, arg, proj,; numpy as np,; scipy.special as spe (python interface); and cython_special (scipy cython interface). *Examples*::. coeff = coefficient('exp(-1j*w1*t)', args={""w1"":1.}). 'args' is needed for string coefficient at compilation.; It is a dict of (name:object). The keys must be a valid variables string. Compilation options can be passed as ""compile_opt=CompilationOptions(...)"". For numpy array format, the array must be an 1d of dtype float or complex.; A list of times (float64) at which the coeffients must be given (tlist).; The coeffients array must have the same len as the tlist.; The time of the tlist do not need to be equidistant, but must be sorted.; By default, a cubic spline interpolation will be used to compute the; coefficient at time t.
