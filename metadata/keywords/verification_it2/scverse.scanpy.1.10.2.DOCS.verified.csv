It's often easier to read the test results with them hidden via the `--disable-pytest-warnings` argument. ## Writing tests. You can refer to the [existing test suite](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/tree/main/scanpy/tests) for examples.; If you haven't written tests before, Software Carpentry has an [in-depth guide](https://katyhuff.github.io/2016-07-11-scipy/testing/01-basics.html) on the topic. We highly recommend using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) when contributing code.; This not only ensures you have tests written, it often makes implementation easier since you start out with a specification for your function. Consider parameterizing your tests using the `pytest.mark.parameterize` and `pytest.fixture` decorators.; Documentation on these can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html), but we'd also recommend searching our test suite for existing usage. ### What to test. If you're not sure what to tests about your function, some ideas include:. - Are there arguments which conflict with each other? Check that if they are both passed, the function throws an error (see `pytest.raises` [in the pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions).; - Ar
