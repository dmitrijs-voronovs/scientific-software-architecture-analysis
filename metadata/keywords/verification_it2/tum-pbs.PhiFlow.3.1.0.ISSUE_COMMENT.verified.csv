Content: Hi,. thanks for your help. I am trying to learn how to use Phiflow and haven't done calculus for a while, so sorry if some of questions might seem trivial. I am trying to set up a simulation for a 1D wave equation using Neumann boundary conditions, with a Gaussian bell as initial starting conditions. My code for a normal finite element simulation is as follows:. ```; import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; import copy. #Initial Condition; sigma = 0.5; c = 1. #Domain Specification; x_length = 5.; dx = 0.1; nx = int(x_length / dx). #Time Specification; t_length = 250; dt = 0.1; nt = int(t_length / dt). #Arrays for calculating solution; u_n_plus_1 = np.zeros(nx); u_n = np.zeros(nx); u_n_minus_1 = np.zeros(nx). #Initial conditions; for x in range(len(u_n)):; u_n[x] = np.exp(-0.5*((x*dx - x_length/2)/sigma)**2); u_n[0] = 0; u_n[-1] = 0. u_n_minus_1 = copy.deepcopy(u_n). u_n_hist = []; u_n_hist.append(u_n). ## Time Stepping; for t in range(1, nt):; for x in range(1, nx-1):; u_n_plus_1[x] = 2*u_n[x] - u_n_minus_1[x] + (c * dt / dx)**2 * (u_n[x+1] - 2*u_n[x] + u_n[x-1]). u_n_minus_1 = copy.deepcopy(u_n); u_n = copy.deepcopy(u_n_plus_1). u_n_hist.append(u_n). fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2); axs[0, 0].plot(u_n_hist[0]); axs[0, 1].plot(u_n_hist[int(nt/4)]); axs[1, 0].plot(u_n_hist[int(3*nt/4)]); axs[1, 1].plot(u_n_hist[-1]). axs[0, 0].set_title(""Initial Condition""); axs[0, 1].set_title(""T = "" + str(int(nt/4)*dx)); axs[1, 0].set_title(""T = "" + str(3*int(nt/4)*dx)); axs[1, 1].set_title(""T = "" + str(t_length)). plt.tight_layout(); plt.show(); ```. Now, I'm trying to replicate [this](https://physicsbaseddeeplearning.org/physicalloss-code.html) in the PBDL book, i.e. build a NN that takes in ```x``` and ```t``` as inputs and returns ```u```. As a first step, I thought of getting a Phiflow only simulation running, then adding a NN later. To that end, I'm trying to get a Phiflow only simulation going with the following code:. ```; from phi.flow import *; import numpy as np
