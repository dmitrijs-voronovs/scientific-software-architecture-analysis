Each :class:`.Job` has; an image in which to execute commands and settings for storage,; memory, and CPU. A :class:`.BashJob` is a subclass of :class:`.Job`; that runs bash commands while a :class:`.PythonJob` executes Python; functions. .. autosummary::; :toctree: api/batch/; :nosignatures:; :template: class.rst. batch.Batch; job.Job; job.BashJob; job.PythonJob. Resources; ~~~~~~~~~. A :class:`.Resource` is an abstract class that represents files in a :class:`.Batch` and; has two subtypes: :class:`.ResourceFile` and :class:`.ResourceGroup`. A single file is represented by a :class:`.ResourceFile` which has two subtypes:; :class:`.InputResourceFile` and :class:`.JobResourceFile`. An InputResourceFile is used; to specify files that are inputs to a :class:`.Batch`. These files are not generated as outputs from a; :class:`.Job`. Likewise, a JobResourceFile is a file that is produced by a job. JobResourceFiles; generated by one job can be used in subsequent job, creating a dependency between the jobs. A :class:`.ResourceGroup` represents a collection of files that should be treated as one unit. All files; share a common root, but each file has its own extension. A :class:`.PythonResult` stores the output from running a :class:`.PythonJob`. .. autosummary::; :toctree: api/resource/; :nosignatures:; :template: class.rst. resource.Resource; resource.ResourceFile; resource.InputResourceFile; resource.JobResourceFile; resource.ResourceGroup; resource.PythonResult.

Effectively 70KB for React + React-Dom + Webpack tooling + all page js compares quite favorably with a jquery-only solution, while being faster than jQuery (https://github.com/jonmiles/react-performance-tests, https://medium.com/thothzocial-engineering/rendering-speed-performance-challenge-with-famous-front-end-framework-196c876a68af), far easier to manage, and with a much large ecosystem (and jquery-only solution would do nothing for universal rendering). The React side should drop this year substantially. They are also interested in writing a compiler to completely remove the vdom, compiling to optimized javascript or maybe web assembly. That may be something interesting to us as well.

I want to use the same metrics for measuring error as [here](http://quantiles.github.io/) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov divergence and total variation distance between the true and estimated CDFs, which are both simple to compute). As a first sanity check, we should get numbers in the same ballpark as they did (worse at first, because we started with a very naive algorithm).; * Make improvements to the algorithm, evaluating the gains in the benchmarks.; * When we feel we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, we can pick a conservative upper error bound and turn that into an automated test.; * Also once we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, figure out how to communicate that to users. One thought is to offer a few default choices of parameters, and for each document memory usage, empirical error from our benchmarks, and a theoretical upper bound on the error (of the form ""with probability > .99 the estimated q quantile element will have true quantile q ± .001""). This allows users to make an informed decision based on their use case. That looks like a lot, but I think those are all relatively simple.

Content: Thanks @danking for helping with this, and for the nudge to finally get it implemented!. Some more next steps:; * Make a benchmarking setup to collect data on performance and accuracy. I want to use the same metrics for measuring error as [here](http://quantiles.github.io/) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov divergence and total variation distance between the true and estimated CDFs, which are both simple to compute). As a first sanity check, we should get numbers in the same ballpark as they did (worse at first, because we started with a very naive algorithm).; * Make improvements to the algorithm, evaluating the gains in the benchmarks.; * When we feel we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, we can pick a conservative upper error bound and turn that into an automated test.; * Also once we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, figure out how to communicate that to users. One thought is to offer a few default choices of parameters, and for each document memory usage, empirical error from our benchmarks, and a theoretical upper bound on the error (of the form ""with probability > .99 the estimated q quantile element will have true quantile q ± .001""). This allows users to make an informed decision based on their use case. That looks like a lot, but I think those are all relatively simple.

In Dataproc versions 1.5.74, 2.0.48, and 2.1.0, Dataproc introduced ""memory protection"" which is a euphemism for a newly aggressive OOMKiller. When the OOMKiller kills the JVM driver process, there is no hs_err_pid...log file, no exceptional log statements, and no clean shutdown of any sockets. The process is simply SIGTERM'ed and then SIGKILL'ed. From Hail 0.2.83 through Hail 0.2.109 (released February 2023), Hail was pinned to Dataproc 2.0.44. From Hail 0.2.15 onwards, `hailctl dataproc`, by default, reserves 80% of the advertised memory of the driver node for the use of the Hail Query Driver JVM process. For example, Google advertises that an n1-highmem-8 has 52 GiB of RAM, so Hail sets the `spark:spark.driver.memory` property to `41g` (we always round down).

The paper starts by computing. $$\Psi \coloneqq \frac{1}{p}XX^T.$$. Next the paper eigendecomposes $\Psi$:. $$\Psi = U \Sigma^2 U^T,$$. where $U$ are the eigenvectors and $\Sigma^2$ is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues along the diagonal. Then the paper computes a $p \times n$ matrix $W$ called the **SNP weight matrix**:. $$W \coloneqq X^T U.$$. Suppose that there are $n_r$ individuals in the related set and let $Y$ be the $n_r \times p$ standardized genotype matrix for the related individuals. The paper computes the principal components associated with the related samples with. $$ \frac{1}{p} Y W (\Sigma^2)^{-1}.$$. ### Simplifications. The first simplification that I noticed is that we can do away with the $\frac{1}{p}$ terms. Because $\Psi$ is scaled by $p^{-1}$, the inverse of the eigenvalues, $(\Sigma^2)^{-1}$ is scaled by $p$, which cancels out the $1/p$ term in the calculation of the principal components for the related individuals. From here on, let us redefine $\Sigma^2$ as the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $XX^T$ (not $\frac{1}{p} XX^T$). Next, by examining the relationship between singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigendecomposition ([Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Relation_to_eigenvalue_decomposition)), I realized that it is not necessary to compute $\Psi$.

With time-consuming calculations it is often necessary to store the results to files on disk, so it can be post-processed and archived.

97,Modifiability,flexible,flexible,"@arnelg and @cgranade, you are both raising good points here. I'm not exactly sure what the best solution for this particular issue is, but do tend to agree with @arnelg that we do not want functions that perform unexpected actions, if possible, and that explicit is better than implicit. However, ultimately, it has to be the docstrings that should resolve any ambiguities, because not all functions can be intuitive to everyone, since we all have different backgrounds and expectations. So if the current behaviour is clearly described in the docstring, it should also be an acceptable solution I think. But one important thing that @arnelg also alluded to is that if at some point we expect that we might want to use `composite(S, O)` to mean something different than `composite(S, to_super(O))`, then we should better not implement the operator-to-superoperator promotion implicitly in `composite` now. Since the `composite` function is brand new it might be a good idea at this point to avoid doing these implicit assumptions on how it will be used until various use-cases has been explored in more details. I absolutely agree that it is great to have discussions about these kind of design issues, and it's great that you both have taken an interest in this particular issue.

126,Modifiability,inherit,inherited,"Thanks for the feedback. I am very keen to spend some time making the control modules more QuTiP like in style. In particular trying to utilise QuTiP elements, e.g. maintaining Qobjs throughout the code. I am however focussed on trying to get some results out using the library, so it will probably be a month of so before I can start on this. ; Re the documentation, there is some theory in the first of our notebooks example-pulse_optim-Hadamard, however it could be a lot more detailed and better presented.

Content: Thanks for the feedback. I am very keen to spend some time making the control modules more QuTiP like in style. In particular trying to utilise QuTiP elements, e.g. maintaining Qobjs throughout the code. I am however focussed on trying to get some results out using the library, so it will probably be a month of so before I can start on this. ; Re the documentation, there is some theory in the first of our notebooks example-pulse_optim-Hadamard, however it could be a lot more detailed and better presented.

The other parts (like `brmesolve`) just don't work if Cython isn't there. The MKL tests would become very short; by my reckoning, MKL is only used by `steadystate` and `countstat`. OpenMP is much more pervasive, as `sesolve`, `mesolve` and `brmesolve` all use it, and parts which depend on those are generally the slowest tests. The short tests could just become `pytest -m ""not slow""`? That's not super speedy, but it takes about half the time, maybe. If you want more, then a good starting point is `pytest --durations=0` which will tell us which tests are the slowest (perhaps that was what you already did when marking the slow ones?).

727,Testability,test,test,"y.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal`. This lets us get the full eigensystem of `T`, which is related to that of `G` by dividing the eigenvalues by the scaling factor, and multiplying the eigenvectors by `P` to transform them into the correct basis.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: When no options and no e_ops are given, the solver should store the states, otherwise nothing is done. Since the default value si `store_states=False`, the solver don't know that the value was explicitly given or the default. We should have `store_states=None` as the default. This allow us to respect an explicit False while keeping the expected behaviour when no options are given. I will make this change in the v5 solver (And make sure no Options are modified). `tlist` was never meant to control time dependence, it represent the time at which the solver look at the state (+ first and last times). I added array support as coefficient as a shortcut to Cubic_Spline and I used the already existing tlist, but this is clearly a limitation and in v5 they will be controlled independently.

I completely agree with your approach. I’m simply trying to push for this to be something that will come out in a reasonable timeframe and not be something forgotten. > We've got to be concerned with backwards and forwards compatibility; what if a user wants to install and use QuTiP and a different library in the same environment without using them together, but can't even have them coexist because of version incompatibilities in optional conversion features?. I do understand your point, and I see how you want to be backward and forward compatible, however I don’t think that my proposal would break different tools in the same environment. What I propose would simply prevent `qutip.Qobj(otherlibraryobject)` from working (with an explicative error message) if `otherlibrary` does not support the same qobj interface version.

I completely agree with your approach. I’m simply trying to push for this to be something that will come out in a reasonable timeframe and not be something forgotten. > We've got to be concerned with backwards and forwards compatibility; what if a user wants to install and use QuTiP and a different library in the same environment without using them together, but can't even have them coexist because of version incompatibilities in optional conversion features?. I do understand your point, and I see how you want to be backward and forward compatible, however I don’t think that my proposal would break different tools in the same environment. What I propose would simply prevent `qutip.Qobj(otherlibraryobject)` from working (with an explicative error message) if `otherlibrary` does not support the same qobj interface version.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: The equation for `d_{2,i}` for `ssesolve` seems to be missing a 1/2 term. I checked two sources: Quantum Measurement and Control, Wiseman and Milburn (equation 4.76, page 162), and [the development notebook for SSE](https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/development/development-ssesolve-tests.ipynb). In both cases, the expression for d_{2, i} for the SSE is: . <img width=""278"" alt=""Untitled"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39472087/145735966-85d0c932-a247-42e7-91e1-98fc0f6d0c49.png"">. For the stochastic master equation, I also found a different expression for `d_{2,i}`. Both book (equations 4.24 and 4.72 in pages 152 and 161, respectively) and development notebook, state that it should be written:. <img width=""483"" alt=""d2master"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39472087/145737189-9e3996a5-186a-47e3-9e2f-7e365e00e5ea.png"">. To test the current qutip implementation, I tried to replicate the results of both [SSE](https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/development/development-ssesolve-tests.ipynb) and [SME](https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/development/development-smesolve-tests.ipynb) development notebooks. The results obtained with QuTiP homodyne and heterodyne methods were similar to the results obtained with the d_1 and d_2 implemented 'by hand' in the notebooks, which used the expressions I listed above. In my tests, I used QuTiP 4.5.2. The equations above are also the current reported equations in the [stochastic solver documentation](https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-stochastic.html).

The philosophy here is, if the user can get the `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor` to work, then they can also use `mpi_pmap` in qutip. However, I did show in the tutorial notebook explicitly as an example how it works on the RIKEN cluster, and I refer to the mpi4py users guide. That being said, we do want to set up an automated test for this, and we do want to understand what went wrong in our initial attempts to set up those tests. The two main problems we encountered were (a) if mpi4py is installed with pip, all mpi_pmap calls hang; (b) if it is installed with conda, test_map_pass_error hangs sometimes.; The difference between pip and conda comes from the fact that mpi4py requires an MPI implementation. If we use mpi4py's GH workflow to install it with pip, it installs MPICH, and with conda, it installs OpenMPI by default. I noticed that in both cases where mpi_pmap hangs, there *are* error messages, but they are captured by pytest and then never printed because the program hangs... Regarding problem (a), in short, it looks like an MPICH bug to me. I thus decided to use OpenMPI instead, and added `conda install ""openmpi<5"" mpi4py` to just one of our test runs (the python 3.12 one). Regarding problem (b), the problem was that we requested more processes than the default number of slots available. With OpenMPI, the default number of slots available is the number of physical cpu cores (which seems to be 2 on the machine running our tests, leaving only one slot for a worker process). In the `parallel` module, if num_cpus is not provided, it defaults to `available_cpu_count()` (which is 4 on this machine, since there are 4 logical cpus). We could try to find a better default value for num_cpus for mpi_pmap, but I feel like writing that well would require deeper MPI knowledge than I have.

Modifying these, or any other parameters, is quite simple:; >>> qutip.settings.auto_tidyup = False. These settings will be used for the current QuTiP session only and will need to be modified again when restarting QuTiP. If running QuTiP from a script file, then place the qutip.setings.xxxx commands immediately after from qutip import * at the top of the script file.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: MRES method and optional preconditioner. LGMRES; ‘iterative-lgmres’; Solve using the LGMRES method and optional preconditioner. BICGSTAB; ‘iterative-bicgstab’; Solve using the BICGSTAB method and optional preconditioner. SVD; ‘svd’; Steady-state solution via the dense SVD of the Liouvillian. The function qutip.steadystate.steadystate can take either a Hamiltonian and a list of collapse operators as input, generating internally the corresponding Liouvillian super operator in Lindblad form, or alternatively, a Liouvillian passed by the user. When possible, we recommend passing the Hamiltonian and collapse operators to qutip.steadystate.steadystate, and letting the function automatically build the Liouvillian (in Lindblad form) for the system.; As of QuTiP 3.2, the direct and power methods can take advantage of the Intel Pardiso LU solver in the Intel Math Kernel library that comes with the Anacoda (2.5+) and Intel Python distributions. This gives a substantial increase in performance compared with the standard SuperLU method used by SciPy. To verify that QuTiP can find the necessary libraries, one can check for INTEL MKL Ext: True in the QuTiP about box (qutip.about). Using the Steadystate Solver¶; Solving for the steady state solution to the Lindblad master equation for a general system with qutip.steadystate.steadystate can be accomplished using:; >>> rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops). where H is a quantum object representing the system Hamiltonian, and c_ops is a list of quantum objects for the system collapse operators. The output, labeled as rho_ss, is the steady-state solution for the systems. If no other keywords are passed to the solver, the default ‘direct’ method is used, generating a solution that is exact to machine precision at the expense of a large memory requirement. The large amount of memory need for the direct LU decomposition method stems from the large bandwidth of the system Liouvillian and the correspondingly large fill-in (extra nonzero elements)

Introduction¶; When studying the dynamics of a two-level system, it is often convent to visualize the state of the system by plotting the state-vector or density matrix on the Bloch sphere. In QuTiP, we have created two different classes to allow for easy creation and manipulation of data sets, both vectors and data points, on the Bloch sphere. The qutip.Bloch class, uses Matplotlib to render the Bloch sphere, where as qutip.Bloch3d uses the Mayavi rendering engine to generate a more faithful 3D reconstruction of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch and Bloch3d Classes¶; In QuTiP, creating a Bloch sphere is accomplished by calling either:; In [1]: b = Bloch(). which will load an instance of the qutip.Bloch class, or using:; >>> b3d = Bloch3d(). that loads the qutip.Bloch3d version. Before getting into the details of these objects, we can simply plot the blank Bloch sphere associated with these instances via:; In [2]: b.show(). or. In addition to the show() command, the Bloch class has the following functions:; As an example, we can add a single data point:; In [3]: pnt = [1/np.sqrt(3),1/np.sqrt(3),1/np.sqrt(3)]. In [4]: b.add_points(pnt). In [5]: b.show(); <Figure size 500x500 with 1 Axes>. and then a single vector:; In [6]: vec = [0,1,0]. In [7]: b.add_vectors(vec).

In [11]: b.show(); <Figure size 500x500 with 1 Axes>. Notice that when we add more than a single vector (or data point), a different color will automatically be applied to the later data set (mod 4). In total, the code for constructing our Bloch sphere with one vector, one state, and a single data point is:; In [12]: b = Bloch().

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: MRES method and optional preconditioner. LGMRES; ‘iterative-lgmres’; Solve using the LGMRES method and optional preconditioner. BICGSTAB; ‘iterative-bicgstab’; Solve using the BICGSTAB method and optional preconditioner. SVD; ‘svd’; Steady-state solution via the dense SVD of the Liouvillian. The function qutip.steadystate.steadystate can take either a Hamiltonian and a list of collapse operators as input, generating internally the corresponding Liouvillian super operator in Lindblad form, or alternatively, a Liouvillian passed by the user. When possible, we recommend passing the Hamiltonian and collapse operators to qutip.steadystate.steadystate, and letting the function automatically build the Liouvillian (in Lindblad form) for the system.; As of QuTiP 3.2, the direct and power methods can take advantage of the Intel Pardiso LU solver in the Intel Math Kernel library that comes with the Anacoda (2.5+) and Intel Python distributions. This gives a substantial increase in performance compared with the standard SuperLU method used by SciPy. To verify that QuTiP can find the necessary libraries, one can check for INTEL MKL Ext: True in the QuTiP about box (qutip.about). Using the Steadystate Solver¶; Solving for the steady state solution to the Lindblad master equation for a general system with qutip.steadystate.steadystate can be accomplished using:; >>> rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops). where H is a quantum object representing the system Hamiltonian, and c_ops is a list of quantum objects for the system collapse operators. The output, labeled as rho_ss, is the steady-state solution for the systems. If no other keywords are passed to the solver, the default ‘direct’ method is used, generating a solution that is exact to machine precision at the expense of a large memory requirement. The large amount of memory need for the direct LU decomposition method stems from the large bandwidth of the system Liouvillian and the correspondingly large fill-in (extra nonzero elements)

Although QuTiP has a simple; compiler, many may want to try their own compiler which is more compatible; with their quantum device.

This will include a study of existing; libraries, such as qiskit.pulse and OpenPulse 1, comparing them with; qutip.qip.pulse module and building a more general and comprehensive; description of the pulse.; More examples of quantum system in the qutip.qip.device module. The circuit; simulation and compilation depend strongly on the physical system. At the; moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to; include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system 2,; Ion trap system 3 or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of; control Hamiltonian and a compiler that finds the control pulse of a quantum; gate. More involved noise models can also be added based on the physical; system.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: 20,; enhanced them in capabilities and features, allowing the simulation both at the; level of gates and at the level of time evolution. To connect them, a compiler; is implemented to compile quantum gates into the Hamiltonian model. We would; like to further enhance this feature in QuTiP and the connection with other; libraries. Expected outcomes¶. APIs to import and export pulses to other libraries. Quantum compiler is a; current research topic in quantum engineering. Although QuTiP has a simple; compiler, many may want to try their own compiler which is more compatible; with their quantum device. Allowing importation and exportation of control; pulses will make this much easier. This will include a study of existing; libraries, such as qiskit.pulse and OpenPulse 1, comparing them with; qutip.qip.pulse module and building a more general and comprehensive; description of the pulse.; More examples of quantum system in the qutip.qip.device module. The circuit; simulation and compilation depend strongly on the physical system. At the; moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to; include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system 2,; Ion trap system 3 or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of; control Hamiltonian and a compiler that finds the control pulse of a quantum; gate. More involved noise models can also be added based on the physical; system. This part is going to involve some physics and study of commonly used; hardware platforms. The related code can be found in qutip.qip.device and; qutip.qip.compiler. Skills¶. Git, Python and familiarity with the Python scientific computing stack; quantum information processing and quantum computing (quantum circuit formalism). Difficulty¶. Medium. Mentors¶.

In QuTiP there are two facilities for storing data: Quantum objects can be stored to files and later read back as python pickles, and numerical data (vectors and matrices) can be exported as plain text files in for example CSV (comma-separated values), TSV (tab-separated values), etc. The former method is preferred when further calculations will be performed with the data, and the latter when the calculations are completed and data is to be imported into a post-processing tool (e.g. for generating figures). Storing and loading QuTiP objects¶; To store and load arbitrary QuTiP related objects (qutip.Qobj, qutip.solver.Result, etc.) there are two functions: qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload. The function qutip.fileio.qsave takes an arbitrary object as first parameter and an optional filename as second parame

Given how Scanpy is set up and used, I could also imagine that, upon growing, it will become in some parts even more a thin wrapper for packages that should be optionally installed (it is already a thin wrapper for `igraph`, `louvain` and `MulticoreTSNE`, where Scanpy simply makes the usage more convenient by unifying visualization etc. and efficient by reusing input parameters that have previously been computed and used in other parts of Scanpy - right now, essentially all the preprocessing, the neighborhood relations and graph stuff). . What do you think?

189,Usability,learn,learn,"I think you're right that Keras doesn't do in-place modifications (it's just building a computation graph there so there is nothing to modify). And the scikit-learn example is a bit different because it's a class method (although it would also make sense for `log1p` to be a class method, given that it only needs to exist for `AnnData` objects). Your rationale for the Scanpy structure makes a lot of sense for the reasons you mentioned, but to me functional programming means immutable objects and functions that return their result with no side effects. Of course, memory constraints come into play here and immutability isn't viable, but the ""return your result"" part is still possible. Personally I don't mind the possibility of multiple references to one object and so I prefer the option of either assigning the result or chaining functions together. In such a library it's easy to switch between an in-place or copying workflow, to inspect intermediate output if desired.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: I think you're right that Keras doesn't do in-place modifications (it's just building a computation graph there so there is nothing to modify). And the scikit-learn example is a bit different because it's a class method (although it would also make sense for `log1p` to be a class method, given that it only needs to exist for `AnnData` objects). Your rationale for the Scanpy structure makes a lot of sense for the reasons you mentioned, but to me functional programming means immutable objects and functions that return their result with no side effects. Of course, memory constraints come into play here and immutability isn't viable, but the ""return your result"" part is still possible. Personally I don't mind the possibility of multiple references to one object and so I prefer the option of either assigning the result or chaining functions together. In such a library it's easy to switch between an in-place or copying workflow, to inspect intermediate output if desired. This behavior is what `numpy.log1p` itself is doing here, for that matter–with an `out` argument it still returns the array. Anyway, obviously it's your call on how to design Scanpy, but I thought I'd give my perspective. Looking forward to see where you go with it.

We maintain backwards compat by still reexporting it in `scanpy.api`. The canonical way of calling these extension will be by importing `import scanpy.ext as sce` and people can use that extension namespace and call everything in the same way that they are used to. Users can look up extension tools on docs site like [this](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html). It will also be clear to users that these extensions will require installing additional packages, which don't come with the default scanpy. Of course, all of this needs none of the ""extension mechanisms"" mentioned above.

Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: I think the current approach - a very simple interface as in `scanpy/tools/phate.py` and a bunch of others is the easiest way to go for the developer. So, I'd say we make a submodule `.ext` with the `.tools`, `.plotting`, `.preprocessing` substructure in it. We move things like `phate.py` into `scanpy/ext/tools`. We maintain backwards compat by still reexporting it in `scanpy.api`. The canonical way of calling these extension will be by importing `import scanpy.ext as sce` and people can use that extension namespace and call everything in the same way that they are used to. Users can look up extension tools on docs site like [this](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html). It will also be clear to users that these extensions will require installing additional packages, which don't come with the default scanpy. Of course, all of this needs none of the ""extension mechanisms"" mentioned above. But people really don't want to write actual ""scanpy extensions""; they want to write their own packages and have them interface with scanpy so that convenient calls are enabled without the need to adapt to new conventions. For the scanpy users, the cool things is that a large number of tools can be quickly tested out. If you don't mind, @fidelram and @flying-sheep, @Koncopd would go along and make this modest change.

437,Modifiability,variab,variability,"@falexwolf I try to answer where I can. I should probably have clarified a bit above. I would argue that most real data DE tests benefit from accounting for technical covariates. For example, you should probably not perform batch correction on your data and then do a wilcoxon rank sum test, but instead take the normalized (and log transformed) data or the raw counts and include a batch covariate in the test. This also holds for technical covariates that describe the complexity of the data (such as size factors or n_genes). Often these factors are not sufficiently accounted for by simple normalization techniques (especially for plate-based data), and are thus included in the DE testing framework. This is done in MAST (and MAST performs better with this `detRate` covariate in the Soneson & Robinson paper you cite above), and it is also done in a recent negative binomial DE test from [Mayer et al, Nature 2018](http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature25999). When you are not able to fit the background variability in your model, you will have a lower sensitivity. Accounting for covariates is obviously not possible with t-tests or wilcoxon rank sum tests. Hence my statement about lower sensitivity. They did perform comparatively well in the DE method comparison, which is why I'd argue that they're useful for first pass exploratory applications (and marker gene detection when you don't want to use more fancy approaches like [this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/05/463265)).

Content: @falexwolf I try to answer where I can. I should probably have clarified a bit above. I would argue that most real data DE tests benefit from accounting for technical covariates. For example, you should probably not perform batch correction on your data and then do a wilcoxon rank sum test, but instead take the normalized (and log transformed) data or the raw counts and include a batch covariate in the test. This also holds for technical covariates that describe the complexity of the data (such as size factors or n_genes). Often these factors are not sufficiently accounted for by simple normalization techniques (especially for plate-based data), and are thus included in the DE testing framework. This is done in MAST (and MAST performs better with this `detRate` covariate in the Soneson & Robinson paper you cite above), and it is also done in a recent negative binomial DE test from [Mayer et al, Nature 2018](http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature25999). When you are not able to fit the background variability in your model, you will have a lower sensitivity. Accounting for covariates is obviously not possible with t-tests or wilcoxon rank sum tests. Hence my statement about lower sensitivity. They did perform comparatively well in the DE method comparison, which is why I'd argue that they're useful for first pass exploratory applications (and marker gene detection when you don't want to use more fancy approaches like [this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/05/463265)). However, if you can account for technical covariates, that's probably a good approach to use. Also, according to the comparison paper you mention, there are not more false positives when using MAST or limma compared to t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

1545,Integrability,message,messages,"Hi @adamgayoso , thanks for the comment, your raised very fair points. I disagree on couple of them but I think it's a very healthy discussion: . > then it does belong in scanpy more formally I think. In that sense, it sets a strange precedent about what belongs inside the main scanpy, versus external. the discussion on whether to include this in `scanpy.external` or `scanpy.core` was carried out here: https://github.com/berenslab/umi-normalization/issues/1 , two key take home messages from that were (imho):; - the simplicity of the method, in terms of codebase, and its scalability makes it suitable to be hosted in `core`.; - it is not strictly a new method, but has several connections with previous [sctransform](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1) and [glm-pca](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1861-6) (also, not sure on what basis you said that ""`glm-pca` is supposed to be better"", would be genuinely curious to see some evaluations). > This is just a general comment, but is it a bit rushed to include the analytic pearson residuals method in the main scanpy module given that the method has only been described in a preprint?. I also disagree about peer-review being a gold standard about legitimacy of the method: I find it a bit unusual in light of the ever-lasting discussion of peer-review flaws in academia, and I personally use non-peer-reviewed computational tools all the time.

2096,Usability,intuit,intuitive,"My priority are intuitive semantics so people can add or bump dependencies without 100% understanding the algorithm of the minimum dependency script. So I can think of options:. 1. Each version must be fully specified (`>=1.2.0`, not `>=1.2`). The script installs exactly the specified minimum version. Implementation: Would be quickly done now, just check the job run and change `matplotlib>=3.6` to `matplotlib>=3.6.3` and so on. Effect: whenever we bump something, we probably need to bump more things, which might sometimes be painful. The minimum versions will be more accurate, as we know that the exact versions specified successfully run out test suite. 4. We maintain a list of all dependencies we have together with data about which version segment denotes the patch version (i.e. for semver it’s the third, for calendar ver, it’s nothing), then modify versions based on that knowledge (e.g. semver `>=1.2.3` → `>=1.2.3, <1.3`). Implementation: Each newly added dependency needs to be added to that list. Effect: This would be basically a more powerful (able to specify minimum patch) and obvious version of what you’re doing now (explicit data instead of the presence of a patch version indicating if something is semver or not). In both versions, there’s no hidden semantics in `>=1.2` that would distinguish it from `>=1.2.0`, which is what I’m after. What does your experience while implementing this so far say to these?

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: My priority are intuitive semantics so people can add or bump dependencies without 100% understanding the algorithm of the minimum dependency script. So I can think of options:. 1. Each version must be fully specified (`>=1.2.0`, not `>=1.2`). The script installs exactly the specified minimum version. Implementation: Would be quickly done now, just check the job run and change `matplotlib>=3.6` to `matplotlib>=3.6.3` and so on. Effect: whenever we bump something, we probably need to bump more things, which might sometimes be painful. The minimum versions will be more accurate, as we know that the exact versions specified successfully run out test suite. 4. We maintain a list of all dependencies we have together with data about which version segment denotes the patch version (i.e. for semver it’s the third, for calendar ver, it’s nothing), then modify versions based on that knowledge (e.g. semver `>=1.2.3` → `>=1.2.3, <1.3`). Implementation: Each newly added dependency needs to be added to that list. Effect: This would be basically a more powerful (able to specify minimum patch) and obvious version of what you’re doing now (explicit data instead of the presence of a patch version indicating if something is semver or not). In both versions, there’s no hidden semantics in `>=1.2` that would distinguish it from `>=1.2.0`, which is what I’m after. What does your experience while implementing this so far say to these? Any other ideas?
