The primary keys of Cromwell's job store tables have been refactored to use a `BIGINT` datatype in place of the previous; `INT` datatype. Cromwell will not be usable during the time the Liquibase migration for this refactor is running.; In the Google Cloud SQL with SSD environment this migration runs at a rate of approximately 40,000 `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY`; rows per second. In deployments with millions or billions of `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY` rows the migration may require; a significant amount of downtime so please plan accordingly. The following SQL could be used to estimate the number of; rows in this table:. ```; SELECT table_rows FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'cromwell' AND table_name = 'JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY';; ```. #### Execution Directory Layout (cache copies). When an attempt to copy a cache result is made, you'll now see a `cacheCopy` directory in the call root directory. ; This prevents them clashing with the files staged to the same directory for attempt 1 if the cache copy fails (see also: Bug Fixes).

Deployability,configurat,configuration,"All call caching keys are now in a `callCaching` stanza. `Call cache read result` has moved here and is now `result`. The `allowResultReuse` and `effectiveCallCachingMode` have moved here. The `hit` boolean is a simple indication of whether or not it was a hit, with no additional information. An example using the new format is:; ```; ""callCaching"": {; ""hit"": false,; ""effectiveCallCachingMode"": ""ReadAndWriteCache"",; ""result"": ""Cache Miss"",; ""allowResultReuse"": true; }; ```. ### Config Changes. * Added a field `insert-batch-size` to the `database` stanza which defines how many values from a batch insert will be processed at a time. This value defaults to 2000. ; * Moved the config value `services.MetadataService.metadata-summary-refresh-interval` to `services.MetadataService.config.metadata-summary-refresh-interval`; * Added ability to override the default zone(s) used by JES via the config structure by setting `genomics.default-zones` in the JES configuration; * The cromwell server TCP binding timeout is now configurable via the config key `webservice.binding-timeout`, defaulted; to the previous value `5s` (five seconds) via the reference.conf.; * For MySQL users, a massive scalability improvement via batched DB writing of internal metadata events. Note that one must add `rewriteBatchedStatements=true` to their JDBC URL in their config in order to take advantage of this. ### General Changes. * Cromwell's WDL parser now recognizes empty array literals correctly, e.g. `Array[String] emptyArray = []`.; * Cromwell now applies default labels automatically to JES pipeline runs.; * Added support for new WDL functions:; * `length: (Array[X]) => Integer` - report the length of the specified array; * `prefix: (String, Array[X]) => Array[String]` - generate an array consisting of each element of the input array prefixed; by a specified `String`.

You are an expert in evaluating and categorizing quality attributes in software engineering. You possess the necessary skills to distinguish sentences that clearly relate to a given quality attribute from those that do not. 

Evaluate whether the content accurately aligns with its associated quality attribute, given the context provided. Your goal is to determine if the content makes sense in relation to the quality attribute description or if it is a false positive.

Data:

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: - The deprecated parse, validate, inputs and highlight functionality from the command line tool has been removed in favor of wdltool (https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdltool); - Workflow options can now include a `defaultRuntimeOptions` section, so that the same runtime attribute is not needed in every single WDL task. E.g.:. ```; {; ""defaultRuntimeOptions"": {; ""docker"": ""ubuntu:latest""; }; }; ```; - Changed the JES runtime attributes `defaultDisks` and `defaultZones` to be simply `disks` and `zones` respectively.; - Liquibase scripts now run automatically. Non-persistent, in-memory databases are not affected. However Cromwell will; not start if it detects evidence of manually run liquibase migrations in a persistent database. Instead, before Cromwell; will start cleanly, the database should backed up, and then this SQL should be manually executed:. ``` sql; update DATABASECHANGELOG; set MD5SUM = null,; FILENAME = substr(FILENAME, instr(FILENAME, ""src/main/migrations/"") + length(""src/main/migrations/"")); where FILENAME like '%src/main/migrations/%'; ```; - Added Preemptible VMs support for JES. This has impacts on the API Endpoint responses as a Call/Shard can now be attempted multiple times. Each attempt will have its own entry.; - Added custom thread pool to workaround Slick [deadlocks](https://github.com/slick/slick/issues/1274). The thread pool; size defaults to the Slick configuration value `db.numThreads`, but may be increased up to Slick's; `db.maxConnections`, via a new property `actionThreadPoolSize`.; - Added support for [size](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl/blob/develop/SPEC.md#float-sizefile-string) WDL standard library function.; - Allow for runtime attribute values to be interpreted as full expressions.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.

Output your response as a JSON object in the following format:
{
  ""false_positive"": <boolean>,
  ""reasoning"": ""<str>""
}
",False,"The content clearly aligns with the Usability quality attribute by discussing enhancements in ease of use, runtime flexibility, and user experience improvements."
