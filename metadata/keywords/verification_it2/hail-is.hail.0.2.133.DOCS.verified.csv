These are long-lived namespaces for developing new features.; Each developer has their own namespace. It's name is the same as the developer's; hail username. For a services project, you can push your branch to GitHub and then run what we; call a “dev deploy”. The command to invoke a dev deploy is. ```bash; HAIL_DEFAULT_NAMESPACE=default hailctl dev deploy -b <github_user_name>/hail:<branch_name> -s <step1>,<step2>,...; ```. Dev deploy creates a batch that deploys the build steps specified by the `-s` in; your Kubernetes dev namespace. For example, if we want to test; whether the Batch tests still pass, we would specify -s test_batch.

Content: . Every CI; pipeline for a PR creates a namespace and deletes it when the tests finish.; - Dev namespaces. These are long-lived namespaces for developing new features.; Each developer has their own namespace. It's name is the same as the developer's; hail username. For a services project, you can push your branch to GitHub and then run what we; call a “dev deploy”. The command to invoke a dev deploy is. ```bash; HAIL_DEFAULT_NAMESPACE=default hailctl dev deploy -b <github_user_name>/hail:<branch_name> -s <step1>,<step2>,...; ```. Dev deploy creates a batch that deploys the build steps specified by the `-s` in; your Kubernetes dev namespace. For example, if we want to test; whether the Batch tests still pass, we would specify -s test_batch. This will; run all the dependent steps for testing Batch such as creating credentials,; a live Auth service, a MySQL database for Batch, and a live Batch deployment.

In order to keep the `hail-is/hail` repo clean, we ask that contributors develop; features in branches on a personal fork. The first step then is to [fork; the repository](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/fork). Once you've done so, clone the repository from your fork. This will set up a; local copy of your fork with a single remote called `origin`. In this document,; we will refer to `origin` as your developer fork, and `upstream` as `hail-is/hail`.; You can check which origins you have configured by running `git remote -v`. While feature branches will live on your fork, those branches are still going to want; to be based on the latest changes in `hail-is/hail:main`. So we will add the; upstream repository as another remote so we can pull in those changes. ```bash; git remote add upstream https://github.com/hail-is/hail.git; ```.

When starting a new feature branch, retrieve the latest changes from; upstream and checkout a branch based on those changes:. ```bash; git fetch upstream; git checkout -b <feature_branch> upstream/main; ```. ## While developing a feature. `hail-is/hail:main` moves quickly, and it is likely that it will have progressed; significantly while you work on a feature.

Content: different field of study: genomics. > [The] Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard was launched in 2004 to improve human health by using; > genomics to advance our understanding of the biology and treatment of human disease, and to help; > lay the groundwork for a new generation of therapies. Genetics and genomics may seem similar to a software engineer's ear; however, genetics is the study; of heredity whereas genomics is the study of the genome.[^1] The [history of; genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_genetics) is deeply intertwined with statistics; which perhaps explains some of the distinction from genomics whose history lies more firmly in; biology. The history of genetics is also deeply intertwined with; [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_eugenics) and; [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism). Sadly, this continues today (see: [James; Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson)). The team Zulip channel and private messages; are both valid forums for discussing these issues. The Neale Lab manifests the Broad's credo by studying the relationship between human disease and; human genetics. This is sometimes called ""genetic epidemiology"". One common; statistical-epidemiological study design is the case-control study. A case-control study involves; two groups of people. The ""case"" group has been diagnosed with the disease.

We started the Hail project to; re-enable simple and interactive (i.e. fast) analysis of these large datasets. Hail was a command-line program that used Apache Spark to run analysis on partitioned genetic; datasets simultaneously using hundreds of computer cores. To use Hail, a user needs an Apache Spark; cluster. Most Hail users use Google Dataproc Spark clusters. The essential feature of a human genetic dataset is a two-dimensional matrix of human; genotypes. Every genotype has the property ""number of alternate alleles"". This property

This section is not complete. * is.hail.annotation: For historical reasons, a Hail Query runtime; value (e.g. an int, array, string, etc.) is called an annotation.; In the JVM, there are two representations of runtime values: as JVM; objects or as a pointer to explicitly managed memory off the Java; heap called a region value. Annotation also sometimes refer to just; the JVM object representation. Explicitly managed off-(Java-)heap; values are also referred to as ""unsafe"". * is.hail.asm4s: The Hail Query optimizer generates JVM bytecode to; implement queries. asm4s is a high-level Scala interface for; generating JVM bytecode. * is.hail.lir: lir is a low-level intermediate representation (IR) for; JVM bytecode. The high-level asm4s interface is implemented in; terms of lir. lir can generate raw JVM bytecode that can be loaded; into the interpreter and invoked via reflection. * is.hail.types: Hail Query has several different notions of types.; For values, there are three kinds of type: virtual, physical and; encoded types. Virtual types are usual-visible types like int,; array and string. Physical types are implementations of virtual; types. For example, arrays might be stored densely or sparsely.; Encoded types specify how to (de)serialize types for reading and; writing. There also higher-level types for Tables, MatrixTables and; BlockMatrices. * is.hail.expr: expr is a large, disorganized package that contains; the

Content: # Hail development tools. This document describes and links tools used by the Hail compiler team.; The document is written for the most common operating system used by; the team, macOS. ## General tools. ##### Homebrew - macOS package manager. Homebrew is hard to live without. Use it to install many of the other tools; used by the team. https://brew.sh/. ##### git - version control. It's nice to have a relatively recent version of git. Install this with; brew:. brew install git. It will probably be necessary to change system paths so that the; installed git is available before system git, as [described here](https://ajahne.github.io/blog/tools/2018/06/11/how-to-upgrade-git-mac.html). Once this is working, you should fork the hail-is/hail repository into; your own user space, then clone the repository locally:. git clone https://github.com/username/hail.git. Then add a remote for the main repository to pull in changes:. git remote add hi https://github.com/hail-is/hail.git. ##### Zulip - dev / user chat. We use Zulip for development discussion and conversations with users; (though not typically for user support). Get it here:. https://zulip.com/. Our Zulip server is https://hail.zulipchat.com. ##### Anaconda - manage Python installations and packages. https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos. After installing Anaconda, you should create a new dev environment; for Hail with:. conda create --name hail python=3.9. and. conda activate hail. (put the latter in a shell .rc file so this is done on shell startup). ##### IntelliJ IDEA - IDE for java/scala/python. https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/.

Energy Efficiency,reduce,reduced-round,"om number generation is inspired by [1], but several details differ. At a high level, the idea is:; * Assign to each random function invocation some unique identifier. In general we can't bound the size of the identifier. We use arrays of longs.; * Use a construction of a psuedo-random function to map unique identifiers to random streams of bits. Intuitively, it's as if we used the identifier to seed a stateful RNG. The key property is that random function invocations with distinct identifiers produce independent random results, while invocations with the same identifier always produce the same result. Thus random function invocations are actually pure functions, with no side effects, which gives the compiler great freedom to optimize queries without affecting the results. Psuedo-random functions are important building blocks in cryptography, and so they are very well studied, with many different practical constructions. We use the PMAC message authentication code, which depends on a tweakable block cipher, for which we use a reduced-round Threefish. Either or both of these pieces could be replaced with little effort, e.g. to improve performance. # Threefish/Threefry:; We use the Threefish [2] block cipher, modified to use 20 rounds for efficiency (the full Threefish4x64 uses 72 rounds), as suggested by [3] (although we make use of the Threefish tweak). Reference implementation is `Threefry.encrypt`. `threefish4x64` takes:; * key `K = (k_0, ..., k_3)`: 4 words; * tweak `T = (t_0, t_1)`: 2 words; * plaintext `P = (p_0, ..., p_3)`: 4 words. Intutively, this is a function taking a key and tweak as input, and returning a permutation on the space of all 256-bit blocks. The security claim is that if the key is chosen randomly, then for any choice of tweak, the resulting permutation ""looks like"" a uniformly chosen random permutation. Like most (all?) block ciphers, it is constructed as a sequence of simpler permutations.

Quality Attribute: Energy Efficiency
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance. This involves monitoring, allocation, and adaptation of resources.
Content: om number generation is inspired by [1], but several details differ. At a high level, the idea is:; * Assign to each random function invocation some unique identifier. In general we can't bound the size of the identifier. We use arrays of longs.; * Use a construction of a psuedo-random function to map unique identifiers to random streams of bits. Intuitively, it's as if we used the identifier to seed a stateful RNG. The key property is that random function invocations with distinct identifiers produce independent random results, while invocations with the same identifier always produce the same result. Thus random function invocations are actually pure functions, with no side effects, which gives the compiler great freedom to optimize queries without affecting the results. Psuedo-random functions are important building blocks in cryptography, and so they are very well studied, with many different practical constructions. We use the PMAC message authentication code, which depends on a tweakable block cipher, for which we use a reduced-round Threefish.

Either or both of these pieces could be replaced with little effort, e.g. to improve performance. # Threefish/Threefry:; We use the Threefish [2] block cipher, modified to use 20 rounds for efficiency (the full Threefish4x64 uses 72 rounds), as suggested by [3] (although we make use of the Threefish tweak). Reference implementation is `Threefry.encrypt`. `threefish4x64` takes:; * key `K = (k_0, ..., k_3)`: 4 words; * tweak `T = (t_0, t_1)`: 2 words; * plaintext `P = (p_0, ..., p_3)`: 4 words. Intutively, this is a function taking a key and tweak as input, and returning a permutation on the space of all 256-bit blocks. The security claim is that if the key is chosen randomly, then for any choice of tweak, the resulting permutation ""looks like"" a uniformly chosen random permutation.

Content: # GSA Key Rotation. Every identity in batch, user or robot, has a corresponding Google Service; Account (GSA). A service or user job can authenticate with Google as; a specific service account with a Service Account Key. When a new user is; created, `auth` creates a service account, requests a key for that account, and; stores the key as a Kubernetes secret with the name `<username>-gsa-key`. Service account keys are confidential and should be rotated at least every 90; days to mitigate the danger of attack if a key is leaked. The key rotation; strategy consists of two parts:. 1. For each Google service account whose newest key is at least 60 days old,; create a new key and update the Kubernetes secret to reflect the new value.; 2. For each Google service account whose newest key is older than 30 days old,; delete all but the newest key. Step 1 ensures that all keys stored in k8s secrets are no more than two months old,; while Step 2 ensures that any key that is not in use is deleted.; Step 2 does **not** act on service accounts that just underwent Step 1 because; the old keys might still be in use by active pods/jobs.

Content:  work it accepts. Alerts in the #grafana Zulip stream fire when the Batch Driver or workers log errors. You can follow these alerts to the; corresponding metric at [grafana.hail.is](grafana.hail.is). The upper-left corner of the panels for the alerts should have a link to; the logs in Google Logging. Other than error logs, CPU usage is the best measure of Batch's remaining capacity. CPU usage for the Batch Driver and the database; are displayed on the [performance panel](https://grafana.hail.is/d/TVytxvb7z/performance) of Grafana[^1]. [^1]: CPU utilization is listed as a percentage of its *limit*, and at time of writing the CPU limit for the Batch Driver is set; to `1.5vCPU`. As such, 60% utilization is using almost a full core, which is all we can reasonably expect from a single python process. The goal is to operate the Batch Driver around 95% CPU. When Batch becomes overwhelmed, CPU is saturated and request latency increases.; New requests from workers inject work into the system, but time out and are retried, creating a bad feedback loop. Driver CPU usage is driven largely job scheduling and job completion.; Floods of job completion, the main source of traffic from workers -> driver, are controlled by rate limits in the `internal-gateway`.; Altering the rate limit at full load is the most direct way to modulate system throughput. You can reduce load on the system in one of two ways:; 1. Gradual load shedding: Reduce the maximum cluster size to below its current size. As instances; die off naturally, the Driver will not replenish them, and load will ease over time. You can also; manually kill off `preemptible` instances if necessary to improve cluster health.; 2.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: //github.com/hail-is/hail-rfcs/pull/1>`_. Proposed Change Specification; =============================. Experience tells us that the majority of time spent on expensive and; scientifically interesting queries is within the tasks generated by; :code:`CollectDistributedArray` (:code:`CDA`).; This is because many of the table operations in hail's :code:`IR` are lowered; into one or more :code:`CDA` operations.; Consequently, we focus our attention on caching the intermediate results of; these tasks. :code:`CDA` can be thought of as a distributed map-reduce operation, from some; input ""context"" for each partition in a table (eg, the path to the file; where the partition is serialised), a computation on that partition, and some; combiner for the results of those computations.; For what follows, let an *activation* be a particular invocation of a; :code:`CDA` pipeline (implemented via :code:`collectDArray`). At a high-level, when the driver performs an *activation*, it will look in its; *execution cache* to see if it had successfully performed that *activation*; in the past.; The *cache* contains the results for all the successful partition computations.; The driver compares the tasks for each partition with the results in the cache; and removes those tasks that have already been completed.; It then executes any remaining work and updates the execution cache with their; results.; If all the work completes successfully, the driver returns the now-cached; results to be used in the the rest of the query.; The driver will cache the results of successful *activations* only.; Failed *activations* (ie. those that errored) will be handled in the usual way,; potentially failing the query. We require two things to determine if the driver had successfully executed an; operation:. 1. a way of looking up *activations* in a *cache*, and; 2. then design of the execution cache itself. Semantic Hashing; ----------------; To lookup operations in the cache, we need a way of producing an ide

An; expression's type can also be accessed with :meth:`.Expression.dtype`. >>> a.dtype; dtype('array<int32>'). Hail arrays can be indexed and sliced like Python lists or :mod:`numpy` arrays:. >>> a[1]; <Int32Expression of type int32>. >>> a[1:-1]; <ArrayNumericExpression of type array<int32>>. In addition to constructor methods like :func:`~hail.expr.functions.array` and :func:`.bool`,; Hail expressions can also be constructed with the :func:`.literal` method,; which will impute the type of of the expression. >>> hl.literal([0,1,2]); <ArrayNumericExpression of type array<int32>>. Boolean Logic; =============. Unlike Python, a Hail :class:`.BooleanExpression` cannot be used with the Python; keywords ``and``, ``or``, and ``not``. The Hail substitutes are ``&``, ``|``,; and ``~``. >>> s1 = hl.int32(3) == 4; >>> s2 = hl.int32(3) != 4. >>> s1 & s2; <BooleanExpression of type bool>. >>> s1 | s2; <BooleanExpression of type bool>. >>> ~s1; <BooleanExpression of type bool>. Remember that you can use :func:`~hail.expr.eval

Deployability,update,update,"rray<str>; ----------------------------------------. Common Operations; =================. Like tables, Hail provides a number of methods for manipulating data in a; matrix table. **Filter**. :class:`.MatrixTable` has three methods to filter based on expressions:. - :meth:`.MatrixTable.filter_rows`; - :meth:`.MatrixTable.filter_cols`; - :meth:`.MatrixTable.filter_entries`. Filter methods take a :class:`.BooleanExpression` argument. These expressions; are generated by applying computations to the fields of the matrix table:. >>> filt_mt = mt.filter_rows(hl.len(mt.alleles) == 2). >>> filt_mt = mt.filter_cols(hl.agg.mean(mt.GQ) < 20). >>> filt_mt = mt.filter_entries(mt.DP < 5). These expressions can compute arbitrarily over the data: the :meth:`.MatrixTable.filter_cols`; example above aggregates entries per column of the matrix table to compute the; mean of the `GQ` field, and removes columns where the result is smaller than 20. **Annotate**. :class:`.MatrixTable` has four methods to add new fields or update existing fields:. - :meth:`.MatrixTable.annotate_globals`; - :meth:`.MatrixTable.annotate_rows`; - :meth:`.MatrixTable.annotate_cols`; - :meth:`.MatrixTable.annotate_entries`. Annotate methods take keyword arguments where the key is the name of the new; field to add and the value is an expression specifying what should be added. The simplest example is adding a new global field `foo` that just contains the constant; 5. >>> mt_new = mt.annotate_globals(foo = 5); >>> print(mt_new.globals.dtype.pretty()); struct {; foo: int32; }. Another example is adding a new row field `call_rate` which computes the fraction; of non-missing entries `GT` per row:. >>> mt_new = mt.annotate_rows(call_rate = hl.agg.fraction(hl.is_defined(mt.GT))). Annotate methods are also useful for updating values. For example, to update the; GT entry field to be missing if `GQ` is less than 20, we can do the following:. >>> mt_new = mt.annotate_entries(GT = hl.or_missing(mt.GQ >= 20, mt.GT)). **Select",MatchSource.DOCS,hail/python/hail/docs/overview/matrix_table.rst,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/tree/0.2.133/hail/python/hail/docs/overview/matrix_table.rst,"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

Content: --------------; Table Overview; --------------. A :class:`.Table` is the Hail equivalent of a SQL table, a Pandas Dataframe, an; R Dataframe, a dyplr Tibble, or a Spark Dataframe. It consists of rows of data; conforming to a given schema where each column (row field) in the dataset is of; a specific type. Import; ======. Hail has functions to create tables from a variety of data sources.; The most common use case is to load data from a TSV or CSV file, which can be; done with the :func:`.import_table` function. >>> ht = hl.import_table(""data/kt_example1.tsv"", impute=True). Examples of genetics-specific import methods are; :func:`.import_locus_intervals`, :func:`.import_fam`, and :func:`.import_bed`.; Many Hail methods also return tables. An example of a table is below. We recommend `ht` as a variable name for; tables, referring to a ""Hail table"". >>> ht.show(); +-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+; | ID | HT | SEX | X | Z | C1 | C2 | C3 |; +-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+; | int32 | int32 | str | int32 | int32 | int32 | int32 | int32 |; +-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+; | 1 | 65 | ""M"" | 5 | 4 | 2 | 50 | 5 |; | 2 | 72 | ""M"" | 6 | 3 | 2 | 61 | 1 |; | 3 | 70 | ""F"" | 7 | 3 | 10 | 81 | -5 |; | 4 | 60 | ""F"" | 8 | 2 | 11 | 90 | -10 |; +-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+. Global Fields; =============. In addition to row fields, Hail tables also have global fields. You can think of; globals as extra fields in the table whose values are identical for every row.; For example, the same table above with the global field ``G = 5`` can be thought; of as. .. code-block:: text. +-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+; | ID | HT | SEX | X | Z | C1 | C2 | C3 | G |; +-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+; | int32 | int32 | str | int32 | int32 | int32 | int32 | int32 | int32 |; +-------+-------+-----+-------+

Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content: .. _sec-cookbook-random_forest:. ===================; Random Forest Model; ===================. Introduction; ------------. We want to use a random forest model to predict regional mutability of; the genome (at a scale of 50kb) using a series of genomic features. Specifically,; we divide the genome into non-overlapping 50kb windows and we regress; the observed/expected variant count ratio (which indicates the mutability; of a specific window) against a number of genomic features measured on each; corresponding window (such as replication timing, recombination rate, and; various histone marks). For each window under investigation, we fit the; model using all the rest of the windows and then apply the model to; that window to predict its mutability as a function of its genomic features. To perform this analysis with Batch, we will first use a :class:`.PythonJob`; to execute a Python function directly for each window of interest. Next,; we will add a mechanism for checkpointing files as the number of windows; of interest is quite large (~52,000). Lastly, we will add a mechanism to batch windows; into groups of 10 to amortize the amount of time spent copying input; and output files compared to the time of the actual computation per window; (~30 seconds). Batch Code; ----------. ~~~~~~~; Imports; ~~~~~~~. We import all the modules we will need. The random forest model code comes; from the `sklearn` package. .. code-block:: python. import hailtop.batch as hb; import hailtop.fs as hfs; from hailtop.utils import grouped; import pandas as pd; from typing import List, Optional, Tuple; import argparse; import sklearn. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~; Random Forest Function; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: Hail is an open-source, scalable framework for exploring and analyzing genetic data. Starting from sequencing or microarray data in VCF and other formats, Hail can, for example:. generate variant annotations like call rate, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value, and population-specific allele count; generate sample annotations like mean depth, imputed sex, and TiTv ratio; load variant and sample annotations from text tables, JSON, VCF, VEP, and locus interval files; generate new annotations from existing annotations and the genotypes, and use these to filter samples, variants, and genotypes; find Mendelian violations in trios, analyze genetic similarity between samples via the GRM and IBD matrix, and compute sample scores and variant loadings using PCA; perform association analyses using linear, logistic, and linear mixed regression, and estimate heritability
