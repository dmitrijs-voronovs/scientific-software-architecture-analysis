Content: aking Changes; * MMseqs2 now saves a lot on IO by not merging result datafiles; There is still a single `.index` file, but the corresponding data files are split into multiple parts (as many as threads were used previously); * MMseqs2 now uses the VTML80 [1,2] substitution matrix to speed up the prefiltering (changeable by `--seed-sub-mat`), the final alignment is still computed with the Blosum62 (still changeable by `--sub-mat`); * All databases have now a `.dbtype` file; * MMseqs2 Docker image is now based on Debian instead of Alpine; * Changed Orf header format to be more space efficent. The new format is now `orignIdentifer startPos(-/+)len flag`; * `prefilter` returns ungapped-alignment scores instead of e-values ; * `createindex` the file extention is now `.idx` instead of the previous `.[s]k[6,7]` format. ## Features; * Support for tblastx-style nucl-nucl translated searches; `mmseqs search nuclDB1 nuclDb2 aln tmp --search-mode 2`; * Support for nucleotide searches; `mmseqs search nuclDB1 nuclDb2 aln tmp --search-mode 3`; * `convertalis` has learned to return SAM formatted output (preview); * Database can be compressed by applying [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) on each entry (`--compressed 1`); * Also added `compress` and `decompress` modules; * `rbh` workflow for reciprocal best hit searches added ; * `linclust` can now cluster nucleotide sequences on both forward and reverse strand; * Added `linsearch`, a lightning fast search for proteins and nucleotide sequences (preview; easy workflow variant `easy-linsearch` also added); * `createlinindex` computes an index for `linsearch`; * `taxonomy` uses `--orf-start-mode 1` to annotate more sequences ; * Added approx. 2bLCA to speed up computation, this is now the new default. The old mode can be turned on by `--lca-mode 2`; * `createdb` recognizes sequences containing Uracil as DNA sequences; * `createdb` is now faster through speeding up its shuffle operations ; * `view` module to view single entry in an

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: Changes since release 3-be8f6. ## New features; * Alternative alignments in search (`--alt-ali`). Find alignments by masking out previously found regions in the target sequence.; * Added `map` workflow for fast near-exact mapping of reads; * Added `easy-linclust` workflow, that works on FASTA files; * Sequence lengths longer than 32k are now supported (default sequence length limit is now 65535); * `createdb` shuffles the order of entries by default (`--dont-shuffle` to disable), useful for database splits, where one split could take much longer than others; * `linclust` now supports MPI; * `linclust` adds one hash for the whole sequence, to improve extract sequence matching; * New sequence identity computation modes, where the normalization happens on the query or target length instead of alignment length; * New `--cov-mode` that computes the coverage only based on sequence lengths (`--cov-mode 3`); * `search`/`cluster`/`linclust` workflows have learned `--alignment-mode 4` for faster ungapped alignments; * Translated `search` sorts now results by E-value and aggregates all ORFs under the corresponding contig identifier; * `prefiltering` can now sort hits with score > 255 correctly; * `convertalis` now works with profiles; * Added generalized database transposition tool `swapdb` (`swapresults` only makes sense for prefiltering/alignment results). ## Performance; * Speedup `extractorf` with vectorization; * Many performance improvements to reduce overhead for web server mode; * `createtsv` writes output in parallel; * Avoid many unnecessary memory allocations in various modules. ## Bug fixes; * `covertmsa` does now correctly parses STOCKHOLM files without accession keys; * In `search` when using splits less than `--max-seqs` sequences would be the limit, now correctly computes the limit (max-seqs/Splits + 4*sqrt(max_seqs/Splits)); * Fix bug in MsaFilter where wrong sequences would be filtered; * `swapresults` will add an empty entry if a target entry has no correspon
