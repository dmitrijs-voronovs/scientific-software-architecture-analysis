We follow the [ColPrac guide](https://github.com/SciML/ColPrac) for collaborative; practices. We ask that new contributors read that guide before submitting a pull request. ## Creating issues. The simplest way to contribute to Oceananigans is to create or comment on issues and discussions. The most useful bug reports:. * Provide an explicit code snippet -- not just a link -- that reproduces the bug in the latest tagged version of Oceananigans. This is sometimes called the [""minimal working example""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example). Reducing bug-producing code to a minimal example can dramatically decrease the time it takes to resolve an issue. * Paste the _entire_ error received when running the code snippet, even if it's unbelievably long. * Use triple backticks (```` ``` ````) to enclose code snippets, and other [markdown formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to make your issue easy and quick to read. * Report the Oceananigans version, Julia version, machine (especially if using a GPU) and any other possibly useful details of the computational environment in which the bug was created. Discussions are recommended for asking questions about (for example) the user interface, implementation details, science, and life in general. ## But I want to _code_!. * New users help write Oceananigans code and documentation by [forking the Oceanan

The most useful bug reports:. * Provide an explicit code snippet -- not just a link -- that reproduces the bug in the latest tagged version of Oceananigans. This is sometimes called the [""minimal working example""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example). Reducing bug-producing code to a minimal example can dramatically decrease the time it takes to resolve an issue. * Paste the _entire_ error received when running the code snippet, even if it's unbelievably long. * Use triple backticks (e.g., ````` ```some_code; and_some_more_code;``` `````) to enclose code snippets, and other [markdown formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to make your issue easy and quick to read. * Report the Oceananigans version, Julia version, machine (especially if using a GPU) and any other possibly useful details of the computational environment in which the bug was created. Discussions are recommended for asking questions about (for example) the user interface, implementation details, science, and life in general. ## But I want to _code_!. * New users help write Oceananigans code and documentation by [forking the Oceananigans repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/workin

However, it is generally a good idea to at least investigate this aspect in; your code as the benefits can potentially be significant. ## GPU simulation tips. Running on GPUs can be very different from running on CPUs. Oceananigans makes most of the necessary; changes in the background, so that for very simple simulations changing between CPUs and GPUs is; just a matter of changing the `architecture` argument in the model from `CPU()` to `GPU()`. However,; for more complex simulations some care needs to be taken on the part of the user. While knowledge of; GPU computing (and Julia) is again desirable, an inexperienced user can also achieve high efficiency; in GPU simulations by following a few simple principles. ### Global variables that need to be used in GPU computations need to be defined as constants or passed as parameters. Any global variable that needs to be accessed by the GPU needs to be a constant or the simulation; will crash. This includes any variables that are referenced as global variables in functions; used for forcing of boundary conditions. For example,. ```julia; T₀ = 20 # ᵒC; surface_temperature(x, y, t) = T₀ * sin(2π / 86400 * t); T_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(bottom = GradientBoundaryCondition(surface_temperature)); ```. will throw an error if run on the GPU (and will run more slowly than it should on the CPU).; Replacing the first line above with. ```julia; const T₀ = 20 # ᵒC; ```. fixes the issue by indicating to the compiler that `T₀` will not change. Note that the _literal_ `2π / 86400` is not an issue -- it's only the; _variable_ `T₀` that must be declared `const`. Alternatively, we can pass the variable as a parameter to `GradientBoundaryCondition`. To do that; we need to pass a named tuple as `parameter` keyword argument:. ```julia; T₀ = 20 # ᵒC; surface_temperature(x, y, t, p) = p.T₀ * sin(2π / 86400 * t); T_bcs = FieldBoundaryCondi",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/src/simulation_tips.md,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/v0.93.2/docs/src/simulation_tips.md,"The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access.

The notable and continuous decrease in efficiencies for the strong scaling nonhydrostatic model is likely caused by the `256^3` grid not sufficiently saturating 32 threads running on 32 CPUs. At the time this benchmark was produced, multithreading for both nonhydrostatic and shallow water models is still an active area of improvement. Please use the appropriate scripts found in [`benchmarks`](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/main/benchmark) to obtain more recent and hopefully ameliorated benchmark results. ```; Oceananigans v0.58.9; Julia Version 1.6.1; Commit 6aaedecc44 (2021-04-23 05:59 UTC); Platform Info:; OS: Linux (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu); CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz; WORD_SIZE: 64; LIBM: libopenlibm; LLVM: libLLVM-11.0.1 (ORCJIT, broadwell); Environment:; EBVERSIONJULIA = 1.6.1; JULIA_DEPOT_PATH = :; EBROOTJULIA = /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/avx2/Core/julia/1.6.1; EBDEVELJULIA = /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/avx2/Core/julia/1.6.1/easybuild/avx2-Core-julia-1.6.1-easybuild-devel; JULIA_LOAD_PATH =

In 3D, variables like vorticity lie at the same vertical; levels as the cell-centered variables and so they really lie at the cell edges. ![Schematic of control volumes](../numerical_implementation/assets/staggered_grid.png); *A schematic of `Oceananigans.jl` finite volumes for a two-dimensional staggered grid in ``(x, z)``.; Tracers ``c`` and pressure ``p`` are defined at the center of the control volume. The ``u`` control volumes are ; centered on the left and right edges of the pressure control volume while the ``w`` control volumes are centered ; on the top and bottom edges of the pressure control volumes. The indexing convention places the ``i^{\rm{th}}`` ; ``u``-node on cell ``x``-faces to the left of the ``i`` tracer point at cell centers.*. This staggered arrangement of variables is more complicated than the collocated grid arrangement but is greatly; beneficial as it avoids the odd-even decoupling between the pressure and velocity if they are stored at the same; positions. §6.1 of [Patankar80](@citet) discusses this problem in the presence of a zigzag pressure field: on a 1D; collocated grid the velocity at the point ``i`` is influenced by the pressure at points ``i-1`` and ``i+1``, and a zigzag; pressure field will be felt as a uniform pressure, which is obviously wrong and would reduce the accuracy of the; solution. The pressure is effectively taken from a coarser grid than what is actually used. The basic problem is that; the momentum equations will use the pressure difference between two alternate points when it should be using two; adjacent points. From the viewpoint of linear algebra, these spurious pressure modes correspond to solutions in the null space of the; pressure projection operator with eigenvalue zero and are thus indistinguishable from a uniform pressure field; [Sani81](@cite). The staggered grid was first introduced b

For example, a linear drag boundary condition; is implemented with. ```jldoctest; julia> @inline linear_drag(x, y, t, u) = - 0.2 * u; linear_drag (generic function with 1 method). julia> u_bottom_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(linear_drag, field_dependencies=:u); FluxBoundaryCondition: ContinuousBoundaryFunction linear_drag at (Nothing, Nothing, Nothing); ```. `field_dependencies` specifies the name of the dependent fields either with a `Symbol` or `Tuple` of `Symbol`s. ### 6. 'Field-dependent' boundary conditions with parameters. When boundary conditions depends on fields _and_ parameters, their functions take the form. ```jldoctest; julia> @inline quadratic_drag(x, y, t, u, v, drag_coeff) = - drag_coeff * u * sqrt(u^2 + v^2); quadratic_drag (generic function with 1 method). julia> u_bottom_bc = FluxBoundaryCondition(quadratic_dra

XC = [xC[i] for i in 1:Nx, j in 1:Ny]; YF = [yF[j] for i in 1:Nx, j in 1:Ny]. h(model) = @. model.clock.time * sin(XC) * cos(YF) # x-y slice output (2D array). outputs = Dict(""scalar"" => f, ""profile"" => g, ""slice"" => h). dims = Dict(""scalar"" => (), ""profile"" => (""zC"",), ""slice"" => (""xC"", ""yC"")). output_attributes = Dict(; ""scalar"" => Dict(""longname"" => ""Some scalar"", ""units"" => ""bananas""),; ""profile"" => Dict(""longname"" => ""Some vertical profile"", ""units"" => ""watermelons""),; ""slice"" => Dict(""longname"" => ""Some slice"", ""units"" => ""mushrooms""); ). global_attributes = Dict(""location"" => ""Bay of Fundy"", ""onions"" => 7). simulation.output_writers[:things] =; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, outputs,; schedule=IterationInterval(1), filename=""things.nc"", dimensions=dims, verbose=true,; global_attributes=global_attributes, output_attributes=output_attributes); ```. `NetCDFOutputWriter` can also be configured for `outputs` that are interpolated or regridded; to a different grid than `model.grid`. To use this functionality, include the keyword argument; `grid = output_grid`. ```@example; using Oceananigans; using Oceananigans.Fields: interpolate!. grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(1, 1, 8), extent=(1, 1, 1));; model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid). coarse_grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(grid.Nx, grid.Ny, grid.Nz÷2), extent=(grid.Lx, grid.Ly, grid.Lz)); coarse_u = Field{Face, Center, Center}(coarse_grid). interpolate_u(model) = interpolate!(coarse_u, model.velocities.u); outputs = (; u = interpolate_u). output_writer = NetCDFOutputWriter(model, outputs;; grid = coarse_grid,; filename = ""coarse_u.nc"",; schedule = IterationInterval(1)); ```.

Availability,avail,available,". To explain how flux boundary conditions are imposed ; in `Oceananigans.jl`, we note that the average of the tracer conservation equation over a finite ; volume yields; ```math; \begin{equation}; \label{eq:dc/dt}; \partial_t c_{i, j, k} = - \frac{1}{V_{i, j, k}} \oint_{\partial \Omega_{i, j, k}} (\boldsymbol{v} c + \boldsymbol{q}_c) ; \boldsymbol{\cdot} \hat{\boldsymbol{n}} \, \mathrm{d} S; + \frac{1}{V_{i, j, k}} \int_{V_{i, j, k}} F_c \, \mathrm{d} V \, ,; \end{equation}; ```; where the surface integral over ``\partial \Omega_{i, j, k}`` averages the flux of ``c`` across ; the six faces of the finite volume. The right-hand-side of \eqref{eq:dc/dt} above is denoted as ; ``G_c |_{i, j, k}``. An external boundary of a finite volume is associated with a no-penetration condition such that; ``\hat{\boldsymbol{n}} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{v} \, |_{\partial \Omega_b} = 0``, where ; ``\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}`` is the vector normal to ``\partial \Omega_b``. Furthermore, the closures ; currently available in `Oceananigans.jl` have the property that ``\boldsymbol{q}_c \propto \boldsymbol{\nabla} c``.; Thus setting ``\hat{\boldsymbol{n}} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} c \, |_{\partial \Omega_b} = 0`` ; on the external boundary implies that the total flux of ``c`` across the external boundary is; ```math; \begin{equation}; \hat{\boldsymbol{n}} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \left ( \boldsymbol{v} c + \boldsymbol{q}_c \right ) |_{\partial \Omega_b} = 0 \, .; \end{equation}; ```; `Oceananigans.jl` exploits this fact to define algorithm that prescribe fluxes across external ; boundaries ``\partial \Omega_b``:. 1. Impose a constant gradient ``\hat{\boldsymbol{n}} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} c ; \, |_{\partial \Omega_b} = 0`` across external boundaries via using halo points (similar ; to \eqref{eq:gradient-bc}), which ensures that the evaluation of ``G_c`` in boundary-adjacent; cells does not include fluxes across the external boundary, and;; 2.

Content: . To explain how flux boundary conditions are imposed ; in `Oceananigans.jl`, we note that the average of the tracer conservation equation over a finite ; volume yields; ```math; \begin{equation}; \label{eq:dc/dt}; \partial_t c_{i, j, k} = - \frac{1}{V_{i, j, k}} \oint_{\partial \Omega_{i, j, k}} (\boldsymbol{v} c + \boldsymbol{q}_c) ; \boldsymbol{\cdot} \hat{\boldsymbol{n}} \, \mathrm{d} S; + \frac{1}{V_{i, j, k}} \int_{V_{i, j, k}} F_c \, \mathrm{d} V \, ,; \end{equation}; ```; where the surface integral over ``\partial \Omega_{i, j, k}`` averages the flux of ``c`` across ; the six faces of the finite volume. The right-hand-side of \eqref{eq:dc/dt} above is denoted as ; ``G_c |_{i, j, k}``. An external boundary of a finite volume is associated with a no-penetration condition such that; ``\hat{\boldsymbol{n}} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{v} \, |_{\partial \Omega_b} = 0``, where ; ``\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}`` is the vector normal to ``\partial \Omega_b``. Furthermore, the closures ; currently available in `Oceananigans.jl` have the property that ``\boldsymbol{q}_c \propto \boldsymbol{\nabla} c``.; Thus setting ``\hat{\boldsymbol{n}} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} c \, |_{\partial \Omega_b} = 0`` ; on the external boundary implies that the total flux of ``c`` across the external boundary is; ```math; \begin{equation}; \hat{\boldsymbol{n}} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \left ( \boldsymbol{v} c + \boldsymbol{q}_c \right ) |_{\partial \Omega_b} = 0 \, .; \end{equation}; ```; `Oceananigans.jl` exploits this fact to define algorithm that prescribe fluxes across external ; boundaries ``\partial \Omega_b``:. 1. Impose a constant gradient ``\hat{\boldsymbol{n}} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} c ; \, |_{\partial \Omega_b} = 0`` across external boundaries via using halo points (similar ; to \eqref{eq:gradient-bc}), which ensures that the evaluation of ``G_c`` in boundary-adjacent; cells does not include fluxes across the external boundary, and;; 2.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: herefore, are not present in the resolved velocity field ``\boldsymbol{v}``, and only the ; steady, averaged effect of surface waves that manifests over several or more wave oscillations ; are modeled. When surface waves are included, the resolved velocity field ``\boldsymbol{v}`` is the ; Lagrangian-mean velocity field. The Lagrangian-mean velocity field at a particular location ; ``(x, y, z)`` is average velocity of a fluid particle whose average position is ``(x, y, z)`` ; at time ``t``. The average position of a fluid particle ``\boldsymbol{\xi}(t) = (\xi, \eta, \zeta)`` ; is thus governed by; ```math; \partial_t \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{v}(\boldsymbol{\xi}, t) \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\xi} = \boldsymbol{v}(\boldsymbol{\xi}, t) \, ,; ```; which is the same relationship that holds when surface waves are not present and ``\boldsymbol{v}`` ; ceases to be an averaged velocity field. The simplicity of the governing equations for Lagrangian-mean ; momentum is the main reason we use a Lagrangian-mean formulation in Oceananigans.jl, rather ; than an Eulerian-mean formulation: for example, the tracer conservation equation is unchanged ; by the inclusion of surface wave effects. Moreover, because the effect of surface waves manifests ; either as a bulk forcing of Lagrangian-mean momentum or as a modification to the effective background ; rotation rate of the interior fluid similar to any bulk forcing or Coriolis force, we do not ; explicitly include the effects of surface waves in turbulence closures that model the effects ; of subgrid turbulence. More specifically, the effect of steady surface waves does not effect ; the conservation of Lagrangian-mean turbulent kinetic energy. The Lagrangian-mean velocity field ``\boldsymbol{v}`` contrasts with the Eulerian-mean velocity ; field ``\boldsymbol{v}^E``, which is the fluid velocity averaged at the fixed Eulerian position ; ``(x, y, z)``.
