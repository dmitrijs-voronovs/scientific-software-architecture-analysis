Content: Hi @m-albert,. > While in the previous example the boundary is simply very smooth, here it seems to be slightly off. Hard to see why it should deviate so much for the images you show, which should be rather easy to segment...would have too look further into it (maybe cells are too large, gridsize too small etc) . > This might be important when dealing with small objects. Not sure decreasing the step size will help with my boundaries but I'll retrain and give it a try, potentially being off at the boundaries could confuse the distance predictions. Thanks (and @GFleishman too) for bringing that up! Indeed the stardist calculations are a bit rough for small objects and we never bothered to refine them correctly. Inspired by this thread I took another look at them: Instead of decreasing the stepsize (which would probably be too slow) one can [directly compute the ""overshoot"" distance after the label switches](https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist/blob/dev/stardist/lib/stardist2d.cpp#L74). That way, distances for small objects should be now more correct. I've put it in the `dev` branch, so you can try it yourself:. `pip install git+https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist.git@dev`.

Energy Efficiency,consumption,consumption,"Hi Greg, . thanks a lot for this contribution - it already looks very promising! . > I evaluated NMS time over a wide number of polygon candidates. Here are the results (note the log_10 scale on the vertical axis):. Thats a nice speed up! The 6Mio candidates are for the whole stack, I assume? So using `predict_big` doesn't have any effect on the prediction time?.

Availability,down,down,"Hi @maweigert,. Right now I'm working on a different strategy from the software standpoint that will solve the extra time cost for using Max and the extra memory from having to store the larger lists of neighbors (potential suppression candidates). My first implementation in the PR was a good demonstration of kdtree, but definitely suboptimal w.r.t. what can be done with the Python C-API, which I'm learning on the fly so things have gone through various stages of kludge. The idea now is that I can call the sklearn kdtree object, and it's query_radius method, from within the C++ code itself - enabling a separate query for each polygon candidate just before the inner loop of NMS begins. That way, points which are ""suppressed early"" will never be queried against the tree - reducing total query time even if the distance threshold is large. The second benefit is that the code now only has to store one neighbor list at a time, thus reducing the total RAM used. This is definitely the best way to built it _algorithmically_ but I still don't have the Python C-API down perfectly so implementing this today has been tricky. I also implemented what I mentioned before - applying the probability threshold for each tile separately during prediction. For the whole image, it cut max RAM down from ~400GB to ~50GB, and that was including the neighbors list from kdtree. So, if I can get the tile based threshold combined with the embedded python approach to the kdtree, I think I can get the whole zebrafish image segmented in like 10-15 minutes for something like 30GB RAM. Of course, the tile based prob threshold breaks a bunch of stuff, so I'll leave it to you guys to decide if you want to move in that direction generally or to just have my commit somewhere accessible on the repo so if others run into RAM issues there's some path to cutting it down without changing so many internal dependencies between functions.

I also implemented what I mentioned before - applying the probability threshold for each tile separately during prediction. For the whole image, it cut max RAM down from ~400GB to ~50GB, and that was including the neighbors list from kdtree. So, if I can get the tile based threshold combined with the embedded python approach to the kdtree, I think I can get the whole zebrafish image segmented in like 10-15 minutes for something like 30GB RAM. Of course, the tile based prob threshold breaks a bunch of stuff, so I'll leave it to you guys to decide if you want to move in that direction generally or to just have my commit somewhere accessible on the repo so if others run into RAM issues there's some path to cutting it down without changing so many internal dependencies between functions. This is all WIP but I'm hoping to finish it soon. Thanks,; Greg

Usability,learn,learning,"Hi @maweigert,. Right now I'm working on a different strategy from the software standpoint that will solve the extra time cost for using Max and the extra memory from having to store the larger lists of neighbors (potential suppression candidates). My first implementation in the PR was a good demonstration of kdtree, but definitely suboptimal w.r.t. what can be done with the Python C-API, which I'm learning on the fly so things have gone through various stages of kludge. The idea now is that I can call the sklearn kdtree object, and it's query_radius method, from within the C++ code itself - enabling a separate query for each polygon candidate just before the inner loop of NMS begins. That way, points which are ""suppressed early"" will never be queried against the tree - reducing total query time even if the distance threshold is large.

I've been trying `keras.utils.Sequence` as suggested by @maweigert, my idea is to simply replace a list of numpy arrays with a Sequence class that loads images on the fly. ```; from tensorflow.keras.utils import Sequence; from tifffile import imread. class DataLoader(Sequence):; ; def __init__(self, path_list, mode):; self.x, self.mode = path_list, mode; ; #retro compatibility with numpy; self.ndim=3; if mode == ""Y"":; self.dtype = np.int; else:; self.dtype = np.float; ; def __len__(self):; return len(self.x). def __getitem__(self, idx):; ; filename = self.x[idx]; if self.mode == ""X"":; return imread(filename) / 255; else:; return imread(filename); ```. I'm actually able to launch a training with batch size of 1 without specifying anisotropy and things seem to run ok (note that I had to add `dtype` and `ndim` to make things work and that I have some problems in my pipeline as explained bellow). However some part of my training pipeline are broken:. - when running this to compute anisotropy `extents = calculate_extents(Y)` I first get this warning; ```_asarray.py (83): Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated. If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray```; and after a few seconds of computation the code fails with this error message :; ```; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------; ValueError Traceback (most recent call last); <ipython-input-14-36ac39a79e87> in <module>; ----> 1 extents = calculate_extents(Y); 2 anisotropy = tuple(np.max(extents) / extents); 3 print('empirical anisotropy of labeled objects = %s' % str(anisotropy)). /work/.cache/poetry/kc-segmentation-DJpFP61h-py3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/stardist/utils.py in calculate_extents(lbl, func); 165 n in

Content: ong as it fits in my GPU or should I do something smarter?; - try to make bigger train_patch_size : I'm a bit uncomfortable setting batch_size lower than 4 (or even 8) to be honest, do you perform gradient accumulation under the hood? Maybe I'm just freaking out for nothing but don't you feel that a batch_size of 2 is a bit too small to get a nice gradient descent?. Also I wanted to ask you about something else. ; At the moment I don't have nice labels that have been curated by humans (I might find some time to do this but later), but I have good enough binary masks that allows me to train algorithms like 3DUnets.; My problem is that some cells are close to each other, so my initial labels are not very good at differientiating adjacent cells (which creates big objects that don't look like cells at all) and same goes with the resulting UNet segmentation, that's why I decided to switch to StarDist3D.; First results from StarDist seem already much better at creating nice round cells, but in order to train StarDist I simply separated my binary mask using connex component : so my ground truth for StarDist never really shows adjacent cells (as they are merged into one same label).; Because of this I don't really trust the automated nms_thresh search function (labels are wrong so it's going to be hard for the search). So I played a bit with the nms_thresh to visually inspect the results but I'd like to understand better what 0.4 or 0.05 means for example. Does 0.4 means that I would tolerate that 40% of the volume of two cells (or a proxy of the volume) are actually overlapping? In terms of physics and biology, I don't expect my cells to be able to overlap at all, they can touch each other but that's it. Does this physics rule mean that setting nms_thresh to 0 makes sense? Or does the nms_thresh represents something completely different? ( I tried to have a look at the source code but I can't read C++!). Hope my questions make sense. Thanks again for your help,. Best,; Seb

Just the fact that there was a variable `use_gpu` set to `False` led me to wrong conclusions. Perhaps a more explicit naming can help to avoid confusions like this in the future, something like `use_gpu_for_data_gen`. > No, this is intentional. The and gputools_available() part acts as a [""guard""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(computer_science)) to always disable this flag when gputools is not installed. I see, so it is up to the user to actively change it if they want to use it for data generation. Thanks, I believe things are clear for me now.

Content: After many tries, best time I can get is 75 seconds (from 97 seconds in my very first message) with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=40`.; What remains concerning is that in this case, I get ; ```python; NMS: Suppressed polyhedra:; NMS: # inner: 191728 / 358813 (53.43 %); NMS: # kernel: 153518 / 358813 (42.78 %); NMS: # render: 6041 / 358813 (1.68 %); NMS: # total: 351287 / 358813 (97.90 %); NMS: # keeping 7526 / 358813 polyhedra (2.10 %); ```; but switching `gravity` off (still with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=40`), I get 85 seconds and almost no `inner` calls (as expected); ```python; NMS: # inner: 1683 / 358813 (0.47 %); NMS: # kernel: 343563 / 358813 (95.75 %); NMS: # render: 6041 / 358813 (1.68 %); NMS: # total: 351287 / 358813 (97.90 %); NMS: # keeping 7526 / 358813 polyhedra (2.10 %); ```; so the difference between `gravity` on and off is small. `inner` calls could simply be very long for my machine for whatever reasons...; I'll gladly take the 20% improvement in time though, thank you very much! :)

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
