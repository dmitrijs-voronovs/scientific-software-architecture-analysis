It's an open, collaborative project allowing anyone; to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling,; chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas. For ; installation instructions, tutorials and examples, please visit the; `Open Babel website`_. This package provides two Python modules that can be used to access the; functionality of the Open Babel toolkit:. - The `openbabel`_ module: A wrapper that is automatically generated using ; the SWIG package and provides access to almost all of the Open Babel ; interfaces via Python, including the base classes OBMol, OBAtom, OBBond, ; and OBResidue, as well as the conversion framework OBConversion. - The `pybel`_ module: A lightweight wrapper around the classes and methods ; in the openbabel module. Pybel provides more convenient and Pythonic ways; to access the Open Babel toolkit.; ; For detailed installation instructions, API documentation and further information ; on the Python bindings, see the `Python pages on the Open Babel website`_. Dependencies; ------------. - Python 2.4 or a more recent version.; - Open Babel 3 or a more recent version. Installation; ------------. **Option 1**: Use `pip`_. ::. pip install openbabel. **Option 2**: Download the latest release and install yourself. ::. tar -xzvf openbabel-3-1-0.tar.gz; cd openbabel-openbabel-3-1-0; python setup.py install; ; **Option 3**: While building Open Babel itself. ::. cd openbabel; mkdir ob-build; cd ob-build; cmake -DRUN_SWIG=ON -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON ..; make install.

Pybel provides more convenient and Pythonic ways; to access the Open Babel toolkit.; ; For detailed installation instructions, API documentation and further information ; on the Python bindings, see the `Python pages on the Open Babel website`_.

Content:  two molecules using a quaternion fit. The atoms used to fit; the two molecules are defined by the SMARTS pattern given by the user. It; is useful to align congeneric series of molecules on a common structural; scaffold for 3D-QSAR studies. It can also be useful for displaying the; results of conformational generation. Any molecules matching the supplied SMARTS pattern will be rotated and; translated to provide the smallest possible RMSD between the matching; regions. If a molecule does not match the SMARTS pattern, it will be output; with no transformation. Examples. Align all the molecules in ‘testmv.sdf’ on a single molecule of; ‘testref.sdf’ by superimposing them on its N-methylpiperidyl portion (and outputting a new SD file to the standard output):. obfit '[nh]1c2c(=O)n(C)c(=O)n(C)c2cc1' testref.sdf testmv.sdf.

Deployability,release,release,". Open Babel: Migration from 1.x to 2.0. Migration from Open Babel 1.x; (a.k.a. What's New for Developers in Open Babel 2.0); $Date$; General:; Many things have changed internally in the new Open Babel 2.0; release, including a variety of new classes, methods, and; algorithms. For a full list of what's new, see the Release Notes and Change Log.; This document aims to outline major changes in the Open Babel; library which differ from previous versions. In general, major version numbers of Open Babel indicate major changes to the library which will break backwards-compatibility in at least some areas. For example 1.x to 2.x represents changes that are backwards-incompatible as well as several new interfaces. Changes between 2.0 and 2.1 will add but not break existing code; There are four main areas of updates:. OBFileFormat vs. OBConversion; Iterator Classes; Error Handling; Generic Data. OBFileFormat vs. OBConversion; By far the largest change between Open Babel 1.x and 2.0 is the; introduction of the OBConversion and OBFormat classes to handle; reading and writing chemical data, replacing the OBFileFormat; class. There are several main advantages to these new classes. Dynamic loading and unloading of file formats. This means that to write a new format, only one file (with the; format code) is needed. No other code changes are required.; In Open Babel 1.x, in addition to the file format code, 2 code; files, 2 header files, and extable.txt needed to be changed.

The All Files will indeed display all files and the conversion processes are unaffected.; Other features; Most of the interface parameters, such as the selected format and the window size and position are remembered between sessions.; Using the View menu, the input and output text boxes can be set not to wrap the text. At present you have to restart the program for this to take effect.; The message box at the top of the output text window receives program output on error and audit logging, and some progress reports. It can be expanded by dragging down the divider between the windows.; Example files; There are three chemical files in the executable folder to try out:; serotonin.mol which is has 3D atom coordinates;; oxamide.cml which is 2D and has a large number of properties that will be seen when converting to sdf.; FourSmallMols.cml which (unsurprisingly) contains four molecules with no atom coordinates and can be used to illustrate the handling of multiple molecules. Setting the output format to smi (which is easy to see), you can convert only the second and third molecules by entering 2 and 3 in the appropriate option boxes. Or convert only molecules with C-O single bonds by entering CO in the SMARTS option box. Please report bugs or suggestions for improvement to the OpenBabel website.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as an accurate match; if not, mark it as a false positive.
4. Output only the JSON object in response, without any additional explanation.
5. Ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Escape any special characters or inner quotes in strings to ensure compatibility with JSON parsers. Within JSON strings use \"" to escape double quotes.
