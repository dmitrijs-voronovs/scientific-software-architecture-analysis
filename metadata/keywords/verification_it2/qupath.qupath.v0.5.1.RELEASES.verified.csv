Content: This release fixes a lot of bugs (especially related to Windows and Mac compatibility when importing text data), as well as adding many improvements - some small, some bigger. Some of the more noticeable changes:; 1. The TMA dearrayer gives more understandable results, and labelling TMA grids is easier.; 2. The TMA data viewer has been largely redesigned, to better display (exported) data across large Tissue Microarray studies.; 3. A new 'File -> Revert' command makes it easy to return to the last saved version of analysis. It's not as good as a comprehensive 'undo' system... but it's something.; 4. A new 'Add intensity features (experimental)' command helps with making various kinds of intensity measurements, across different resolutions and different kinds of objects.; 5.
