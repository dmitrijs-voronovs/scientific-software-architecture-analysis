For the prefilter (main module for normal sequences searches) you can specify an appropriate `--split` value, that will then reduce the required memory to (I think there is an error in the user guide, have to double check, but this should be the correct formula):. ```; (7 byte * N * L) / #splits + 8 byte * 21^k; ```. We have two more very memory intense modules:`swapresults` and `kmermatcher`. These are very important for profile searches and linclust. Their splitting logic is however not exposed to the command line interface yet. The clustering module also can use a lot of memory, but if you stay with the default cascaded clustering that should not become an issue. A hack to limit how much memory `swapresults`, `kmermatcher` and `prefilter` will use, would be to manually edit `size_t Util::getTotalSystemMemory()` in `commons/Util.cpp`. We will discuss what we can do about this limiting memory issue internally and get back to you.

MMseqs Version: 	7-4e23d; Use ffindex header	false; Verbosity 	3. Could not open data file pbp.found_with_profile.ALIGNEDREGIONS!; ```. But I realised maybe I did everything wrong. . What I want, actually, is the MSA for each cluster with only aligned regions. ; Also, I want the MSA of aligned regions from a search result. The deal is: I have 501 queries single domain, I would to use this against a 17M sequences DB, since the matches probably have at least 1 region contains the same domain as the query, I would like the MSA or even a sequence DB itself contain **only the regions of the match**. ; Extracting only the region of the matches allow me to infer more accurate alignments and phylogeny. Also allow me build specifics models. . Could you provide me a simple workflow to this task?. Thanks in advance.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: Your initial idea is sound. The only problem is that `extractalignedregion` does not really support it since it was built for one very specific purpose and should be generalized. I started working on that though I don't quite have time to finish it up. I have an idea for a hack though:; ```; mmseqs prefixid aln aln.tsv --tsv; awk '{ $1 = NR++; print $0; }' aln.tsv > aln_new.tsv; mmseqs tsv2db aln_new.tsv aln_new --output-dbtype 5; mmseqs extractalignedregion query target aln_new target_new --threads 1; awk '{ print $2; }' aln.tsv > target_ids.tsv; mmseqs createsubdb target_ids.tsv target_h target_new_h; sort -k2,2 target_new_h.index | awk '{ $1 = NR++; print $0; }' > target_new_h.index_new; mv -f target_new_h.index_new target_new_h.index; mmseqs cluster target_new clu tmp; ```; I wrote this down without testing, but this should create a valid domain sequence database from the alignment result.

Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: Thanks for the suggestion. I'll do that for future runs to avoid the huge logfiles. Re: my original problem, I want to mention that I am using a Perl script (which parallel::forkmanager) to fork separate jobs for each sample in my list and then run each sample separately. I tried running mmseqs search with ""--threads 10"" using this same script, but I noticed that the intermediate steps in the command (extractorfs, align etc) all just used one process per sample. I am still trying to figure out if it is because of the parallel script or something to do with mmseqs itself. If I run the same search command on the terminal with ""--threads 10"" it goes fast. ________________________________; From: Martin Steinegger <notifications@github.com>; Sent: Thursday, July 11, 2019 12:55:59 PM; To: soedinglab/MMseqs2; Cc: Dhwani Desai; Mention; Subject: Re: [soedinglab/MMseqs2] Speed up mmseqs for large database and multiple large query sets by loading target into memory (#214). @milot-mirdita<https://github.com/milot-mirdita> noticed that the interactive progress bar could be a problem, in your case it produced at 13GB output.

Security,access,access,"@milot-mirdita Hi Milot, how is it going with this topic of global alignment? . My workflow for protein clustering like below:; 1. blastp for local alignment, find similar sequence pairs;; 2. needle for global alignment access similarity for blastp pairs;; 3. mcl to cluster the needle result.

Content: @liuxianghui thank you for asking this question! . ```; cd-hit-est -i $CLUSTERS.IN -c 0.95 -T $MC_CPU -M 0 -G 0 -aS 0.9 -g 1 -r 1 -d 0 -o $CLUSTERS.OUT > $CLUSTERS.log; ```. CD-HIT computes in default global sequence identity, while MMseqs2 computes local. Therefore it is not possible to mimic exactly the same behaviour. But since you turn of the the global sequence identity computation, you can get fairly close to CD-HIT's criteria. Here is my suggested parameter mapping. ```; -c 0.95 -> --min-seq-id 0.95 ; -T $MC_CPU -> --threads $MC_CPU; -G 0 -> MMseqs2 uses local alignments is the default, there is no way to make alignments global; -aS 0.9 -> --cov-mode 1 -c 0.9; -g 1 -> it is not possible with MMseqs2 using greedy incremental clustering (needed for --cov-mode 1). However, setcover assigns sequence to the best matching representative in default. ; -r 1 -> MMseqs2 in default considers forward and reverse strand; ```. Final command: . ```; mmseqs easy-cluster in.fa clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.95 --cov-mode 1 -c 0.9 --threads $MC_CPU; ```. I have also added a guide how parameters of CD-HIT and MMseqs2 are related in the documentation https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/wiki#how-do-parameters-of-cd-hit-relate-to-mmseqs2

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: You are running a very old version of MMseqs2. Please update to the latest version. Especially cluster updating had multiple severe issues before the latest release. It was also spending 35h in the very simple module `result2repseq`. I think I fixed the performance issue in the latest commit cc7d7da30ec779d6a2e886438f8295f59e2192f1. You'll find statically compiled binaries here in about one hour: https://mmseqs.com/latest. Cluster updating also doesn't interact very nicely with the `easy-` workflows yet.

Availability,reliab,reliable,"TL; DR: Enabling building against shared system libraries gives better modularity and a better end-user experience. The way that the Debian patch works is that on distros such as Debian (and Fedora and Gentoo) the system zstd library can optionally be built/packaged/installed both static and shared. Packages that can be built shared get built shared and will get marked for updating when the shared library updates to an incompatible version. Packages like MMseqs that will only build static require the static package/flag and should, in principle, get updated any time the static library gets updated. The latter mechanism is not as reliable and requires more rebuilds, which is why distros prefer that executables can be built with shared libraries. This request I'm making to you now is part of the acceptance QC for that the distro gateway person will check off. If upstream (you) says that building shared is a WONTFIX, then I'll probably just put up my hands and move on. I understand your point about xxhash being pinned to a tested version. But it's a better practice to have the package pinned to a specific, internal version by default, but enable packagers to use the system version at their own risk. Why? Because you can't test and optimize the library and compiler flags for all the architectures out there and also because fixes and optimizations show up all the time. A highly-optimized distro such as Clear Linux may have optimizations and bug fixes that neither you nor a packager like me has access to at your release time. This is especially true for unusual architectures (e.g., AVX512) and for common-but-new architectures (e.g., Zen3 or M1), and especially for widely-used libraries like those for hashing and compression that make heavy use of SIMD optimizations. . Putting on my computational biologist hat for a moment, when one is doing a long-running project where reproducibility is key, I'll put the binaries in a container with all dependencies pinned.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: TL; DR: Enabling building against shared system libraries gives better modularity and a better end-user experience. The way that the Debian patch works is that on distros such as Debian (and Fedora and Gentoo) the system zstd library can optionally be built/packaged/installed both static and shared. Packages that can be built shared get built shared and will get marked for updating when the shared library updates to an incompatible version. Packages like MMseqs that will only build static require the static package/flag and should, in principle, get updated any time the static library gets updated. The latter mechanism is not as reliable and requires more rebuilds, which is why distros prefer that executables can be built with shared libraries. This request I'm making to you now is part of the acceptance QC for that the distro gateway person will check off. If upstream (you) says that building shared is a WONTFIX, then I'll probably just put up my hands and move on. I understand your point about xxhash being pinned to a tested version. But it's a better practice to have the package pinned to a specific, internal version by default, but enable packagers to use the system version at their own risk. Why? Because you can't test and optimize the library and compiler flags for all the architectures out there and also because fixes and optimizations show up all the time. A highly-optimized distro such as Clear Linux may have optimizations and bug fixes that neither you nor a packager like me has access to at your release time. This is especially true for unusual architectures (e.g., AVX512) and for common-but-new architectures (e.g., Zen3 or M1), and especially for widely-used libraries like those for hashing and compression that make heavy use of SIMD optimizations. .

Security,validat,validating,"Hi Ann,. Thank you for suggesting that. I know that using --cov-mode 3 paired with -c 0.99 is quite strict. When we relaxed it, we were finding 'false positive' clusters, where the cluster head/representatives (the largest sequence in the cluster) had novel enough genetic information in it, that we would have preferred it to be it's own cluster (with a solitary member). That being said, in my grid search, I have only explored varying -c values with a constant --cov-mode 3. The sequence pairs that I am finding that should be clustered together (and aren't) have nearly identical lengths (+-1) with a few mismatches (<10). It is my understanding that those should have been clustered regardless of the value of --cov-mode, even with the stringent -c 0.99. To give you another example, even when I use a very lenient clustering criterion (please note the values of min-seq-id, -c) - ; --kmer-per-seq-scale 0 --min-seq-id 0.80 --cov-mode 3 -c 0.80 --cluster-mode 1 --spaced-kmer-mode 0 -k 10 --threads 16 --adjust-kmer-len 0 --ignore-multi-kmer 0.

Although now, I find very few such pairs (8 / 1378 all-v-all alignment of representative sequences with a levenshtein distance of < 10). I understand these could be edge cases, but I find them interesting, and I want to learn what linclust is doing by focussing on these 8 alone. (Making a long post even longer!)
