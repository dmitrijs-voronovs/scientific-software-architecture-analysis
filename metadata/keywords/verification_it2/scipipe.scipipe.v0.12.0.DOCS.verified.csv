Usability,usab,usable,"scipipe"">First production workflow run with SciPipe</a. ## Introduction. <img src=""docs/images/fbp_factory.png"" align=""right"">. SciPipe is a library for writing [Scientific; Workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_workflow_system), sometimes; also called ""pipelines"", in the [Go programming language](http://golang.org). When you need to run many commandline programs that depend on each other in; complex ways, SciPipe helps by making the process of running these programs; flexible, robust and reproducible. SciPipe also lets you restart an interrupted; run without over-writing already produced output and produces an audit report; of what was run, among many other things. SciPipe is built on the proven principles of [Flow-Based Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming); (FBP) to achieve maximum flexibility, productivity and agility when designing; workflows. Compared to plain dataflow, FBP provides the benefits that; processes are fully self-contained, so that a library of re-usable components; can be created, and plugged into new workflows ad-hoc. Similar to other FBP systems, SciPipe workflows can be likened to a network of; assembly lines in a factory, where items (files) are flowing through a network; of conveyor belts, stopping at different independently running stations; (processes) for processing, as depicted in the picture above. SciPipe was initially created for problems in bioinformatics and; cheminformatics, but works equally well for any problem involving pipelines of; commandline applications. **Project status:** SciPipe pretty stable now, and only very minor API changes; might still occur. We have successfully used SciPipe in a handful of both real; and experimental projects, and it has had occasional use outside the research; group as well. ## Known limitations. - There are still a number of missing good-to-have features for workflow; design.

Content: scipipe"">First production workflow run with SciPipe</a. ## Introduction. <img src=""docs/images/fbp_factory.png"" align=""right"">. SciPipe is a library for writing [Scientific; Workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_workflow_system), sometimes; also called ""pipelines"", in the [Go programming language](http://golang.org). When you need to run many commandline programs that depend on each other in; complex ways, SciPipe helps by making the process of running these programs; flexible, robust and reproducible. SciPipe also lets you restart an interrupted; run without over-writing already produced output and produces an audit report; of what was run, among many other things. SciPipe is built on the proven principles of [Flow-Based Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming); (FBP) to achieve maximum flexibility, productivity and agility when designing; workflows. Compared to plain dataflow, FBP provides the benefits that; processes are fully self-contained, so that a library of re-usable components; can be created, and plugged into new workflows ad-hoc. Similar to other FBP systems, SciPipe workflows can be likened to a network of; assembly lines in a factory, where items (files) are flowing through a network; of conveyor belts, stopping at different independently running stations; (processes) for processing, as depicted in the picture above. SciPipe was initially created for problems in bioinformatics and; cheminformatics, but works equally well for any problem involving pipelines of; commandline applications. **Project status:** SciPipe pretty stable now, and only very minor API changes; might still occur. We have successfully used SciPipe in a handful of both real; and experimental projects, and it has had occasional use outside the research; group as well. ## Known limitations. - There are still a number of missing good-to-have features for workflow; design. See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/issues); for detai

Performance,concurren,concurrent,"tions. - There are still a number of missing good-to-have features for workflow; design. See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/issues); for details.; - There is not (yet) support for the [Common Workflow Language](http://common-workflow-language.github.io). ## Installing. For full installation instructions, see the [intallation page](/install).; For quick getting started steps, you can do:. 1. [Download](https://golang.org/dl/) and [install](https://golang.org/doc/install) Go; 2. Run the following command, to install the scipipe Go library (don't miss the; trailing dots!), and create a Go module for your script:. ```bash; go install github.com/scipipe/scipipe/...@latest; go mod init myfirstworkflow-module; ```. ## Hello World example. Let's look at an example workflow to get a feel for what writing workflows in; SciPipe looks like:. ```go; package main. import (; // Import SciPipe, aliased to sp; sp ""github.com/scipipe/scipipe""; ). func main() {; // Init workflow and max concurrent tasks; wf := sp.NewWorkflow(""hello_world"", 4). // Initialize processes, and file extensions; hello := wf.NewProc(""hello"", ""echo 'Hello ' > {o:out|.txt}""); world := wf.NewProc(""world"", ""echo $(cat {i:in}) World > {o:out|.txt}""). // Define data flow; world.In(""in"").From(hello.Out(""out"")). // Run workflow; wf.Run(); }; ```.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: tions. - There are still a number of missing good-to-have features for workflow; design. See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/issues); for details.; - There is not (yet) support for the [Common Workflow Language](http://common-workflow-language.github.io). ## Installing. For full installation instructions, see the [intallation page](/install).; For quick getting started steps, you can do:. 1. [Download](https://golang.org/dl/) and [install](https://golang.org/doc/install) Go; 2. Run the following command, to install the scipipe Go library (don't miss the; trailing dots!), and create a Go module for your script:. ```bash; go install github.com/scipipe/scipipe/...@latest; go mod init myfirstworkflow-module; ```. ## Hello World example. Let's look at an example workflow to get a feel for what writing workflows in; SciPipe looks like:. ```go; package main. import (; // Import SciPipe, aliased to sp; sp ""github.com/scipipe/scipipe""; ). func main() {; // Init workflow and max concurrent tasks; wf := sp.NewWorkflow(""hello_world"", 4). // Initialize processes, and file extensions; hello := wf.NewProc(""hello"", ""echo 'Hello ' > {o:out|.txt}""); world := wf.NewProc(""world"", ""echo $(cat {i:in}) World > {o:out|.txt}""). // Define data flow; world.In(""in"").From(hello.Out(""out"")). // Run workflow; wf.Run(); }; ```. To create a file with a similar simple example, you can run:. ```; scipipe new hello_world.go; ```. ## Running the example. Let's put the code in a file named `hello_world.go` and run it. First you need to make sure that the dependencies (SciPipe in this case) is; installed in your local Go module. This you can do with:. ```bash; go mod tidy; ```. Then you can go ahead and run the workflow:. ```bash; $ go run hello_world.go; AUDIT 2018/07/17 21:42:26 | workflow:hello_world | Starting workflow (Writing log to log/scipipe-20180717-214226-hello_world.log); AUDIT 2018/07/17 21:42:26 | hello | Executing: echo 'Hello ' > hello.out.txt; AUDIT 2018/07/17 21:4

Availability,echo,echo," ID in a generic port map, like the `In()` and `Out()` methods on; `Process` processes. This is so that the methods can show up in the; auto-completion / intellisense function in code editors removing the need to; look up the name of the ports manually in the library code all the time. ## How to create re-usable components in SciPipe.

Content: # DNA Reverse complement example. A simple example workflow implemented with SciPipe. The workflow computes the; reverse base complement of a string of DNA, using standard UNIX tools. ## Detailed explanation of the code. See the revcomplement.go file for the source code, or here below:. ```go; package main. import (; 	""github.com/scipipe/scipipe""; ). const dna = ""AAAGCCCGTGGGGGACCTGTTC"". func main() {; 	// Initialize workflow, using max 4 CPU cores; 	wf := scipipe.NewWorkflow(""DNA Base Complement Workflow"", 4). 	// Initialize processes based on shell commands:. 	// makeDNA writes a DNA string to a file; 	makeDNA := wf.NewProc(""Make DNA"", ""echo ""+dna+"" > {o:dna}""); 	makeDNA.SetOut(""dna"", ""dna.txt""). 	// complmt computes the base complement of a DNA string; 	complmt := wf.NewProc(""Base Complement"", ""cat {i:in} | tr ATCG TAGC > {o:compl}""); 	complmt.SetOut(""compl"", ""{i:in|%.txt}.compl.txt""). 	// reverse reverses the input DNA string; 	reverse := wf.NewProc(""Reverse"", ""cat {i:in} | rev > {o:rev}""); 	reverse.SetOut(""rev"", ""{i:in|%.txt}.rev.txt""). 	// Connect data dependencies between out- and in-ports; 	complmt.In(""in"").From(makeDNA.Out(""dna"")); 	reverse.In(""in"").From(complmt.Out(""compl"")). 	// Run the workflow; 	wf.Run(); }; ```. On line 4, the SciPipe library is imported, to be later accessed as scipipe. On; line 7, a short string of DNA is defined. On line 9-33, the full workflow is; implemented in the program’s main() function, meaning that it will be executed; when the resulting program is executed. On line 11, a new workflow object (or; “struct” in Go terms) is initiated with a name and the maximum number of cores; to use. On lines 15-25, the workflow components, or processes, are initiated,; each with a name and a shell command pattern. Input file names are defined with; a placeholder on the form {i:INPORTNAME} and outputs on the form; {o:OUTPORTNAME}. The port-name will be used later to access the corresponding; ports for setting up data dependencies. On line 16,
