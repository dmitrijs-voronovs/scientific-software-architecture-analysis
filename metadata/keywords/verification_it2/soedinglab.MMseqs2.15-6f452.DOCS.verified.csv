For example, to download and search against a database containing the Swiss-Prot reference proteins run: . mmseqs databases UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot swissprot tmp; mmseqs easy-search examples/QUERY.fasta swissprot alnRes.m8 tmp; ; The speed and sensitivity of the `search` can be adjusted with `-s` parameter and should be adapted based on your use case (see [setting sensitivity -s parameter](https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki#set-sensitivity--s-parameter)). A very fast search would use a sensitivity of `-s 1.0`, while a very sensitive search would use a sensitivity of up to `-s 7.0`. A detailed guide how to speed up searches is [here](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/wiki#how-to-control-the-speed-of-the-search). The output can be customized with the `--format-output` option e.g. `--format-output ""query,target,qaln,taln""` returns the query and target accession and the pairwise alignments in tab separated format. You can choose many different [output columns](https://github.com/soedinglab/mmseqs2/wiki#custom-alignment-format-with-convertalis). :exclamation: `easy-search` in default computes the sequence identity by dividing the number of identical residues by the alignment length (`numIdentical/alnLen`). However, `search` [estimates](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/wiki#how-does-mmseqs2-compute-the-sequence-identity) the identity in default. To output real sequence identity use `--alignment-mode 3` or `-a`. ### Taxonomy; The `easy-taxonomy` workflow can be used to assign sequences taxonomical labels. It performs a search against a sequence database with taxonomy information (seqTaxDb), chooses the most representative sets of aligned target sequences according to different strategies (according to `--lca-mode`) and computes the lowest common ancestor among those. mmseqs createdb examples/DB.fasta targetDB; mmseqs createtax

For example, the expression `""sin x + 1/4""`; parses as:. ![example syntax tree](doc/e1.png?raw=true). `te_compile()` also automatically prunes constant branches. In this example,; the compiled expression returned by `te_compile()` would become:. ![example syntax tree](doc/e2.png?raw=true). `te_eval()` will automatically load in any variables by their pointer, and then evaluate; and return the result of the expression. `te_free()` should always be called when you're done with the compiled expression. ## Speed. TinyExpr is pretty fast compared to C when the expression is short, when the; expression does hard calculations (e.g. exponentiation), and when some of the; work can be simplified by `te_compile()`. TinyExpr is slow compared to C when the; expression is long and involves only basic arithmetic. Here is some example performance numbers taken from the included; **benchmark.c** program:. | Expression | te_eval time | native C time | slowdown |; | :------------- |-------------:| -----:|----:|; | sqrt(a^1.5+a^2.5) | 15,641 ms | 14,478 ms | 8% slower |; | a+5 | 765 ms | 563 ms | 36% slower |; | a+(5*2) | 765 ms | 563 ms | 36% slower |; | (a+5)*2 | 1422 ms | 563 ms | 153% slower |; | (1/(a+1)+2/(a+2)+3/(a+3)) | 5,516 ms | 1,266 ms | 336% slower |. ## Grammar.

This problem is common to all compression algorithms, and reason is, compression algorithms learn from past data how to compress future data. But at the beginning of a new data set, there is no ""past"" to build upon. To solve this situation, Zstd offers a __training mode__, which can be used to tune the algorithm for a selected type of data.; Training Zstandard is achieved by providing it with a few samples (one file per sample). The result of this training is stored in a file called ""dictionary"", which must be loaded before compression and decompression.; Using this dictionary, the compression ratio achievable on small data improves dramatically.

The data can be produced or consumed,; even for an arbitrarily long sequentially presented input data stream,; using only an a priori bounded amount of intermediate storage,; and hence can be used in data communications.; The format uses the Zstandard compression method,; and optional [xxHash-64 checksum method](http://www.xxhash.org),; for detection of data corruption. The data format defined by this specification; does not attempt to allow random access to compressed data. Unless otherwise indicated below,; a compliant compressor must produce data sets; that conform to the specifications presented here.; It doesn’t need to support all options though. A compliant decompressor must be able to decompress; at least one working set of parameters; that conforms to the specifications presented here.; It may also ignore informative fields, such as checksum.; Whenever it does not support a parameter defined in the compressed stream,; it must produce a non-ambiguous error code and associated error message; explaining which parameter is unsupported. This specification is intended for use by implementers of software; to compress data into Zstandard format and/or decompress data from Zstandard format.; The Zstandard format is supported by an open source reference implementation,; written in portable C, and available at : https://github.com/facebook/zstd . ### Overall conventions; In this document:; - square brackets i.e. `[` and `]` are used to indicate optional fields or parameters.; - the naming convention for identifiers is `Mixed_Case_With_Underscores`. ### Definitions; Content compressed by Zstandard is transformed into a Zstandard __frame__.; Multiple frames can be appended into a single file or stream.; A frame is completely independent, has a defined beginning and end,; and a set of parameters which tells the decoder how to decompress it.

Content: le : `make zstd HAVE_LZMA=0`; It's also possible to force compilation with lzma support, using `HAVE_LZMA=1`.; In which case, linking stage will fail if `lzma` library cannot be found.; This is useful to prevent silent feature disabling. - __HAVE_LZ4__ : `zstd` can compress and decompress files in `.lz4` formats.; This is ordered through commands `--format=lz4`.; Alternatively, symlinks named `lz4`, or `unlz4` will mimic intended behavior.; `.lz4` support is automatically enabled when `lz4` library is detected at build time.; It's possible to disable `.lz4` support, by setting `HAVE_LZ4=0` .; Example : `make zstd HAVE_LZ4=0`; It's also possible to force compilation with lz4 support, using `HAVE_LZ4=1`.; In which case, linking stage will fail if `lz4` library cannot be found.; This is useful to prevent silent feature disabling. - __BACKTRACE__ : `zstd` can display a stack backtrace when execution; generates a runtime exception. By default, this feature may be; degraded/disabled on some platforms unless additional compiler directives are; applied. When triaging a runtime issue, enabling this feature can provide; more context to determine the location of the fault.; Example : `make zstd BACKTRACE=1`. #### Aggregation of parameters; CLI supports aggregation of parameters i.e. `-b1`, `-e18`, and `-i1` can be joined into `-b1e18i1`. #### Symlink shortcuts; It's possible to invoke `zstd` through a symlink.; When the name of the symlink has a specific value, it triggers an associated behavior.; - `zstdmt` : compress using all cores available on local system.; - `zcat` : will decompress and output target file using any of the supported formats. `gzcat` and `zstdcat` are also equivalent.; - `gzip` : if zlib support is enabled, will mimic `gzip` by compressing file using `.gz` format, removing source file by default (use `--keep` to preserve). If zlib is not supported, triggers an error.; - `xz` : if lzma support is enabled, will mimic `xz` by compressing file using `.xz` forma

Content: zstd(1) -- zstd, zstdmt, unzstd, zstdcat - Compress or decompress .zst files; ============================================================================. SYNOPSIS; --------. `zstd` [*OPTIONS*] [-|_INPUT-FILE_] [-o _OUTPUT-FILE_]. `zstdmt` is equivalent to `zstd -T0`. `unzstd` is equivalent to `zstd -d`. `zstdcat` is equivalent to `zstd -dcf`. DESCRIPTION; -----------; `zstd` is a fast lossless compression algorithm and data compression tool,; with command line syntax similar to `gzip (1)` and `xz (1)`.; It is based on the **LZ77** family, with further FSE & huff0 entropy stages.; `zstd` offers highly configurable compression speed,; with fast modes at > 200 MB/s per core,; and strong modes nearing lzma compression ratios.; It also features a very fast decoder, with speeds > 500 MB/s per core. `zstd` command line syntax is generally similar to gzip,; but features the following differences :. - Source files are preserved by default.; It's possible to remove them automatically by using the `--rm` command.; - When compressing a single file, `zstd` displays progress notifications; and result summary by default.; Use `-q` to turn them off.; - `zstd` does not accept input from console,; but it properly accepts `stdin` when it's not the console.; - `zstd` displays a short help page when command line is an error.; Use `-q` to turn it off. `zstd` compresses or decompresses each _file_ according to the selected; operation mode.; If no _files_ are given or _file_ is `-`, `zstd` reads from standard input; and writes the processed data to standard output.; `zstd` will refuse to write compressed data to standard output; if it is a terminal : it will display an error message and skip the _file_.; Similarly, `zstd` will refuse to read compressed data from standard input; if it is a terminal. Unless `--stdout` or `-o` is specified, _files_ are written to a new file; whose name is derived from the source _file_ name:. * When compressing, the suffix `.zst` is appended to the source fi

Integrability,wrap,wrapper,"Zstandard wrapper for zlib; ================================. The main objective of creating a zstd wrapper for [zlib](http://zlib.net/) is to allow a quick and smooth transition to zstd for projects already using zlib. #### Required files. To build the zstd wrapper for zlib the following files are required:; - zlib.h; - a static or dynamic zlib library; - zlibWrapper/zstd_zlibwrapper.h; - zlibWrapper/zstd_zlibwrapper.c; - zlibWrapper/gz*.c files (gzclose.c, gzlib.c, gzread.c, gzwrite.c); - zlibWrapper/gz*.h files (gzcompatibility.h, gzguts.h); - a static or dynamic zstd library. The first two files are required by all projects using zlib and they are not included with the zstd distribution.; The further files are supplied with the zstd distribution. #### Embedding the zstd wrapper within your project. Let's assume that your project that uses zlib is compiled with:; ```gcc project.o -lz```. To compile the zstd wrapper with your project you have to do the following:; - change all references with `#include ""zlib.h""` to `#include ""zstd_zlibwrapper.h""`; - compile your project with `zstd_zlibwrapper.c`, `gz*.c` and a static or dynamic zstd library. The linking should be changed to:; ```gcc project.o zstd_zlibwrapper.o gz*.c -lz -lzstd```. #### Enabling zstd compression within your project. After embedding the zstd wrapper within your project the zstd library is turned off by default.; Your project should work as before with zlib. There are two options to enable zstd compression:; - compilation with `-DZWRAP_USE_ZSTD=1` (or using `#define ZWRAP_USE_ZSTD 1` before `#include ""zstd_zlibwrapper.h""`); - using the `void ZWRAP_useZSTDcompression(int turn_on)` function (declared in `#include ""zstd_zlibwrapper.h""`).

There are two options to enable zstd compression:; - compilation with `-DZWRAP_USE_ZSTD=1` (or using `#define ZWRAP_USE_ZSTD 1` before `#include ""zstd_zlibwrapper.h""`); - using the `void ZWRAP_useZSTDcompression(int turn_on)` function (declared in `#include ""zstd_zlibwrapper.h""`). During decompression zlib and zstd streams are automatically detected and decompressed using a proper library.; This behavior can be changed using `ZWRAP_setDecompressionType(ZWRAP_FORCE_ZLIB)` what will make zlib decompression slightly faster. #### Example; We have take the file `test/example.c` from [the zlib library distribution](http://zlib.net/) and copied it to [zlibWrapper/examples/example.c](examples/example.c).; After compilation and execution it shows the following results: ; ```; zlib version 1.2.8 = 0x1280, compile flags = 0x65; uncompress(): hello, hello!; gzread(): hello, hello!; gzgets() after gzseek: hello!; inflate(): hello, hello!; large_inflate(): OK; after inflateSync(): hello, hello!; inflate with dictionary: hello, hello!; ```; Then we have changed `#include ""zlib.h""` to `#include ""zstd_zlibwrapper.h""`, compiled the [example.c](examples/example.c) file; with `-DZWRAP_USE_ZSTD=1` and linked with additional `zstd_zlibwrapper.o gz*.c -lzstd`.; We were forced to turn off the following functions: `test_flush`, `test_sync`

Availability,avail,available,"### Summary. `adapt` is a new compression tool targeted at optimizing performance across network connections and pipelines. The tool is aimed at sensing network speeds and adapting compression level based on network or pipe speeds.; In situations where the compression level does not appropriately match the network/pipe speed, compression may be bottlenecking the entire pipeline or the files may not be compressed as much as they potentially could be, therefore losing efficiency. It also becomes quite impractical to manually measure and set an optimalcompression level (which could potentially change over time). . ### Using `adapt`. In order to build and use the tool, you can simply run `make adapt` in the `adaptive-compression` directory under `contrib`. This will generate an executable available for use. Another possible method of installation is running `make install`, which will create and install the binary as the command `zstd-adaptive`. Similar to many other compression utilities, `zstd-adaptive` can be invoked by using the following format:. `zstd-adaptive [options] [file(s)]`. Supported options for the above format are described below. . `zstd-adaptive` also supports reading from `stdin` and writing to `stdout`, which is potentially more useful. By default, if no files are given, `zstd-adaptive` reads from and writes to standard I/O. Therefore, you can simply insert it within a pipeline like so:. `cat FILE | zstd-adaptive | ssh ""cat - > tmp.zst""`. If a file is provided, it is also possible to force writing to stdout using the `-c` flag like so:. `zstd-adaptive -c FILE | ssh ""cat - > tmp.zst""`. Several options described below can be used to control the behavior of `zstd-adaptive`. More specifically, using the `-l#` and `-u#` flags will will set upper and lower bounds so that the compression level will always be within that range.

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: ### Summary. `adapt` is a new compression tool targeted at optimizing performance across network connections and pipelines. The tool is aimed at sensing network speeds and adapting compression level based on network or pipe speeds.; In situations where the compression level does not appropriately match the network/pipe speed, compression may be bottlenecking the entire pipeline or the files may not be compressed as much as they potentially could be, therefore losing efficiency. It also becomes quite impractical to manually measure and set an optimalcompression level (which could potentially change over time). . ### Using `adapt`. In order to build and use the tool, you can simply run `make adapt` in the `adaptive-compression` directory under `contrib`. This will generate an executable available for use. Another possible method of installation is running `make install`, which will create and install the binary as the command `zstd-adaptive`. Similar to many other compression utilities, `zstd-adaptive` can be invoked by using the following format:. `zstd-adaptive [options] [file(s)]`. Supported options for the above format are described below. . `zstd-adaptive` also supports reading from `stdin` and writing to `stdout`, which is potentially more useful. By default, if no files are given, `zstd-adaptive` reads from and writes to standard I/O. Therefore, you can simply insert it within a pipeline like so:. `cat FILE | zstd-adaptive | ssh ""cat - > tmp.zst""`. If a file is provided, it is also possible to force writing to stdout using the `-c` flag like so:. `zstd-adaptive -c FILE | ssh ""cat - > tmp.zst""`. Several options described below can be used to control the behavior of `zstd-adaptive`. More specifically, using the `-l#` and `-u#` flags will will set upper and lower bounds so that the compression level will always be within that range. The `-i#` flag can also be used to change the initial compression level. If an initial compression level is not provided, the initial

Moreover:; - `ZSTDLIB_API` is removed to improve readability; - `typedef` are detected and included even if uncommented; - comments of type `/**<` and `/*!<` are detected and only function declaration is highlighted (bold). #### Usage. The program requires 3 parameters:; ```; gen_html [zstd_version] [input_file] [output_html]; ```. To compile program and generate zstd manual we have used: ; ```; make; ./gen_html.exe 1.1.1 ../../lib/zstd.h zstd_manual.html; ```;

There are four pieces, the `xxhash` kernel module, the `zstd_compress` and `zstd_decompress` kernel modules, the BtrFS patch, and the SquashFS patch.; The patches are based off of the linux kernel master branch. ## xxHash kernel module. * The patch is located in `xxhash.diff`.; * The header is in `include/linux/xxhash.h`.; * The source is in `lib/xxhash.c`.; * `test/XXHashUserLandTest.cpp` contains tests for the patch in userland by mocking the kernel headers.; I tested the tests by commenting a line of of each branch in `xxhash.c` one line at a time, and made sure the tests failed.; It can be run with the following commands:; ```; cd test && make googletest && make XXHashUserLandTest && ./XXHashUserLandTest; ```; * I also benchmarked the `xxhash` module against upstream xxHash, and made sure that they ran at the same speed. ## Zstd Kernel modules. * The (large) patch is located in `zstd.diff`, which depends on `xxhash.diff`.; * The header is in `include/linux/zstd.h`.; * It is split up into `zstd_compress` and `zstd_decompress`, which can be loaded independently.; * Source files are in `lib/zstd/`.; * `lib/Kconfig` and `lib/Makefile` need to be modified by applying `lib/Kconfig.diff` and `lib/Makefile.diff` respectively.; These changes are also included in the `zstd.diff`.; * `test/UserlandTest.cpp` contains tests for the patch in userland by mocking the kernel headers.; It can be run with the following commands:; ```; cd test && make googletest && make UserlandTest && ./UserlandTest; ```. ## BtrFS. * The patch is located in `btrfs.diff`.; * Additionally `fs/btrfs/zstd.c` is provided as a source for convenience.; * The patch seems to be working, it doesn't crash the kernel, and compresses at speeds and ratios that are expected.; It could still use some more testing for fringe features, like printing options. ### Benchmarks. Benchmarks run on a Ubuntu 14.04 with 2 cores and 4 GiB of RAM.; The VM is running on a Macbook Pro with a 3.1 GHz Intel C

Availability,down,down,"createpool() to a fraction of the number of; threads which would normally be in a pool at once. This will reduce; bloating at the cost of an increase in lock contention. If allocated size; is less than THREADCACHEMAX, locking is avoided 90-99% of the time and; if most of your allocations are below this value, you can safely set; MAXTHREADSINPOOL to one. You will suffer memory leakage unless you call neddisablethreadcache(); per pool for every thread which exits. This is because nedalloc cannot; portably know when a thread exits and thus when its thread cache can; be returned for use by other code. Don't forget pool zero, the system pool. For C++ type allocation patterns (where the same sizes of memory are; regularly allocated and deallocated as objects are created and destroyed),; the threadcache always benefits performance. If however your allocation; patterns are different, searching the threadcache may significantly slow; down your code - as a rule of thumb, if cache utilisation is below 80%; (see the source for neddisablethreadcache() for how to enable debug; printing in release mode) then you should disable the thread cache for; that thread. You can compile out the threadcache code by setting; THREADCACHEMAX to zero. Speed comparisons:; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=; See Benchmarks.xls for details. The enclosed test.c can do two things: it can be a torture test or a speed; test. The speed test is designed to be a representative synthetic; memory allocator test. It works by randomly mixing allocations with frees; with half of the allocation sizes being a two power multiple less than; 512 bytes (to mimic C++ stack instantiated objects) and the other half; being a simple random value less than 16Kb.
