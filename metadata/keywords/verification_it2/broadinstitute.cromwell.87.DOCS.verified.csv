The `IX_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY_WS` index is removed from `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`. The index had low cardinality and workflow pickup is faster without it. Migration time depends on workflow store size, but should be very fast for most installations. Terminal workflows are removed from the workflow store, so only running workflows contribute to the cost. ### Bug fixes. #### Improved `size()` function performance on arrays. Resolved a hotspot in Cromwell to make the `size()` engine function perform much faster on file arrays.

Cromwell is an open-source Workflow Management System for bioinformatics. Licensing is [BSD 3-Clause](LICENSE.txt). The [Cromwell documentation has a dedicated site](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable). First time to Cromwell? Get started with [Tutorials](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/FiveMinuteIntro/). ### Community. Thinking about contributing to Cromwell? Get started by reading our [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). Cromwell has a growing ecosystem of community-backed projects to make your experience even better! Check out our [Ecosystem](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Ecosystem/) page to learn more. Talk to us:; - [Join the Cromwell Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/cromwellhq/shared_invite/zt-dxmmrtye-JHxwKE53rfKE_ZWdOHIB4g) to discuss the Cromwell workflow engine.; - [Join the OpenWDL Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/openwdl/shared_invite/zt-ctmj4mhf-cFBNxIiZYs6SY9HgM9UAVw) to discuss the evolution of the WDL language itself.; - More information about WDL is available in [that project's repository](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl). . ### Capabilities and roadmap. Many users today run their WDL workflows in [Terra](https://app.terra.bio/), a managed cloud bioinformatics platform with built-in WDL support provided by Cromwell. See [here](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360036379771-Get-started-running-workflows) for a quick-start guide. Users with specialized needs who wish to install and maintain their own Cromwell instances can [download](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases) a JAR or Docker image. The development team accepts reproducible bug reports from self-managed instances, but cannot feasibly provide direct support. [Cromwell's backends](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Backends/) receive dev

Availability,failure,failures,"s, simply edit the following values in your configuration file:. ```; webservice {; port = 9000; interface = 0.0.0.0; }; ```. The above configuration will use port `9000`. Cromwell uses `akka-http` to serve requests. For more advanced configuration settings, refer to the [akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/configuration.html) documentation. For example, to increase the request timeout to 30 seconds you can add this stanza to your configuration file:. ```; akka.http.server.request-timeout = 30s; ```. ### I/O. **I/O Throttling**. Certain [backends](backends/Backends) impose I/O limits. For example the Pipelines API imposes a quota on the number of queries that can be made per second. You can effectively control and throttle the number of requests and resources allocated to those operations in the `system.io` configuration:. ```; system.io {; number-of-requests = 100000; per = 100 seconds; }; ```. **I/O Resilience**. I/O operations can fail for a number of reason from network failures to server errors. Some of those errors are not fatal and can be retried. Cromwell will retry I/O operations on such retryable errors, for a limited number of times before giving up and failing. This number (more precisely the number of attempts that will be made) can be set using the following configuration option:. ```; system.io {; number-of-attempts = 5; }; ```. ### Workflows. **Max Concurrent Workflows**. Cromwell has a configurable cap on the number of workflows running at a time. You can adjust the limit from the default `5000` by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-concurrent-workflows = 5000; ```. **New Workflow Poll Rate**.

Content: s, simply edit the following values in your configuration file:. ```; webservice {; port = 9000; interface = 0.0.0.0; }; ```. The above configuration will use port `9000`. Cromwell uses `akka-http` to serve requests. For more advanced configuration settings, refer to the [akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/configuration.html) documentation.

Certain [backends](backends/Backends) impose I/O limits. For example the Pipelines API imposes a quota on the number of queries that can be made per second. You can effectively control and throttle the number of requests and resources allocated to those operations in the `system.io` configuration:. ```; system.io {; number-of-requests = 100000; per = 100 seconds; }; ```. **I/O Resilience**. I/O operations can fail for a number of reason from network failures to server errors. Some of those errors are not fatal and can be retried. Cromwell will retry I/O operations on such retryable errors, for a limited number of times before giving up and failing. This number (more precisely the number of attempts that will be made) can be set using the following configuration option:. ```; system.io {; number-of-attempts = 5; }; ```. ### Workflows. **Max Concurrent Workflows**. Cromwell has a configurable cap on the number of workflows running at a time. You can adjust the limit from the default `5000` by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-concurrent-workflows = 5000; ```. **New Workflow Poll Rate**. Cromwell will look for new workflows to start on a regular interval, configured as a number of seconds.

In other cases, import paths are relative to the file you are currently importing from, for example:. >If there exists a `my/wdl/sub/directory/imports/importing_an_import.wdl`, `my/wdl/sub/directory/example.wdl` could import it relatively like so:; >```wdl; >import ""imports/importing_an_import.wdl"" as file_import3; >```.

While a workflow is running, Cromwell generates a log file specifically for the workflow. After the workflow completes, to clear up local disk space, Cromwell deletes the local copy of this log file. See the [Configuration](Configuring#workflow-log-directory) section on logs for more information on preventing cromwell from deleting each workflow log. Before Cromwell deletes the files and before the workflow completes, you can configure Cromwell to copy the workflow; logs to various locations. Normally, you'll want to copy the log to a remote bucket or directory. To specify the remote; directory to copy the logs to, use the separate [Workflow Option](wf_options/Overview#output-copying); `final_workflow_log_dir`. ## Call Logs. As each call in a workflow runs, it generates output to the standard output and standard error. This output is stored per call in call log files. Additionally, depending on the backend, specific per call backand logs may be generated. All of these call logs may be copied at the end of a workflow to a remote directory. Configure this directory by setting the [Workflow Option](wf_options/Overview#output-copy

There are four different; authentication schemes that might be used:. * `application_default` (default, recommended) - Use [application default](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) credentials.; * `service_account` - Use a specific service account and key file (in PEM format) to authenticate.; * `user_account` - Authenticate as a user.; * `user_service_account` - Authenticate each individual workflow using service account credentials supplied in the workflow options. The `auths` block in the `google` stanza defines the authentication schemes within a Cromwell deployment:. ```hocon; google {; application-name = ""cromwell""; auths = [; {; name = ""application-default""; scheme = ""application_default""; },; {; name = ""service-accoun

Before reading futher in this section please see the; [Getting started on Google Pipelines API](../tutorials/PipelinesApi101) for instructions common to all authentication modes; and detailed instructions for the application default authentication scheme in particular.; The instructions below assume you have created a Google Cloud Storage bucket and a Google project enabled for the appropriate APIs. **Configuring Authentication**. The `google` stanza in the Cromwell configuration file defines how to authenticate to Google. There are four different; authentication schemes that might be used:. * `application_default` (default, recommended) - Use [application default](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) credentials.; * `service_account` - Use a specific service account and key file (in PEM format) to authenticate.; * `user_account` - Authenticate as a user.; * `user_service_account` - Authenticate each individual workflow using service account credentials supplied in the workflow options.

Quality Attribute: Security
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.
Content: Cromwell provides a generic way to configure a backend relying on most High Performance Computing (HPC) frameworks, and with access to a shared filesystem. The two main features that are needed for this backend to be used are a way to submit a job to the compute cluster and to get its status through the command line.; You can find example configurations for a variety of those backends here:. * [SGE](SGE); * [LSF](LSF); * [SLURM](SLURM); * [HTCondor](HTcondor). ## FileSystems. ### Shared FileSystem; HPC backends rely on being able to access and use a shared filesystem to store workflow results. Cromwell is configured with a root execution directory which is set in the configuration file under `backend.providers.<backend_name>.config.root`. This is called the `cromwell_root` and it is set to `./cromwell-executions` by default. Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the current working directory of the Cromwell process. When Cromwell runs a workflow, it first creates a directory `<cromwell_root>/<workflow_uuid>`. This is called the `workflow_root` and it is the root directory for all activity in this workflow. Each `call` has its own subdirectory located at `<workflow_root>/call-<call_name>`. This is the `<call_dir>`.; Any input files to a call need to be localized into the `<call_dir>/inputs` directory. There are different localization strategies that Cromwell will try until one works:. * `hard-link` - This will create a hard link to the file; * `soft-link` - Create a symbolic link to the file. This strategy is not enabled by default for tasks which specify a ; Docker image and will be ignored.; * `copy` - Make a copy the file; * `cached-copy` An experimental feature. This copies files to a file cache in ; `<workflow_root>/cached-inputs` and then hard links them in the `<call_dir>/inputs` directory. . `cached-copy` is intended for a shared filesystem that runs on multiple physical disks, where docker containers are used. ; Hard-links don't work between different

In this example the two directories `/mnt/one` and and `/mnt/two` will also be available within containers at their; original paths outside the container. So soft links pointing to paths under those directories will resolve during the; job execution. Note that if a user runs a workflow using an input file `/mnt/three/path/to/file` the job will fail; during execution as `/mnt/three` was not present inside the running container. ### Additional FileSystems. HPC backends (as well as the Local backend) can be configured to be able to interact with other type of filesystems, where the input files can be located for example.; Currently the only other filesystem supported is Google Cloud Storage (GCS). See the [Google section](Google) of the documentation for information on how to configure GCS in Cromwell.; Once you have a google authentication configured, you can simply add a `gcs` stanza in your configuration file to enable GCS:. ```; backend.providers.MyHPCBackend {; filesystems {; gcs {; # A reference to a potentially different auth for manipulating files via engine functions.; auth = ""application-default""; }; }; }; ```. ### Exit code timeout. If the cluster forcefully kills a job, it is unable to write its exit code anymore.; To address this the option `exit-code-timeout-seconds` can be used.; Cromwell will check the aliveness of the job with the `check-alive` script, every `exit-code-timeout-seconds` (polling).; When a job is no longer alive and another `exit-code-timeout-seconds` seconds have passed without an RC file being made, Cromwell can mark the job as failed.; If retries are enabled the job is submitted again.; This option will enable polling with the `check-alive` option, this could cause high load on whatever system `check-alive` calls.

If a previously run job is found in the cache, Cromwell will use the results of the previous job instead of re-running it. Cromwell's call cache is maintained in its database. In order for call caching to be used on any previously run jobs,; it is best to configure Cromwell to [point to a MySQL database](../Configuring.md#database) instead of the default; in-memory database. This way any invocation of Cromwell (either with `run` or `server` subcommands) will be able to; utilize results from all calls that are in that database. **Configuring Call Caching**. *Call Caching is disabled by default.* Call Caching can be enabled in your Cromwell; [Configuration](../Configuring.md#call-caching) and the behavior can be modified via; [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview.md). If you are adding Workflow options, do not set; [`read_from_cache` or `write_to_cache`](../wf_options/Overview.md#call-caching-options) = false, as it will impact the; following process. Once enabled, Cromwell by default will search the call cache for every `call` statement invocation. * If there was no cache hit, the `call` will be executed as normal. Once finished it will add itself to the cache.; * If there was a cache hit, outputs are either **copied from the original cached job to the new job's output directory**; or **referenced from the original cached job** depending on the Cromwell; [Configuration](../Configuring.md#call-caching) settings. > **Note:** If call caching is enabled, be careful not to change the contents of the output directory for any previously run job. Doing so might cause cache hits in Cromwell to copy over modified data and Cromwell currently does not check that the contents of the output directory changed. Additiona

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: at its disposal. WDL workflows allow scattered tasks to be; run a huge number of times with very simple syntax.; This makes it easy for a very small number of workflows to hog all of the resources of Cromwell, forcing all other ; workflows (even a simple 'hello_world') to wait in line behind them. ; Sometimes that's exactly what you want, but often you would like Cromwell to remain responsive to new users' small ; workflows even while continuing to process production workflows from established users. Cromwell 35 provides new ways of stopping one workflow or group of workflows from locking out everyone else by ; introducing hog factors, hog groups and hog limits. This page describes what they are and how they work. ## Concepts. ### Hog Group . The Hog Group is a way of grouping workflow from different submissions together to restrain their overall resource ; usage as a whole. - Every top-level workflow is assigned to a hog group when Cromwell receives it. ; + Exactly how this happens is [configurable](#configuration).; - Every sub-workflow or call started by a workflow is associated with the same hog group as its parent workflow.; - Multiple top-level workflows can be assigned to the same hog group to allow them to be grouped together. Thus:. - Every workflow is assigned to a hog group when submitted.; - Every hog group may have many workflows assigned to it. ### Hog Factor. The hog factor is an integer greater than or equal to 1. It represents a trade-off between: . - Fully utilizing all resources available to Cromwell to complete jobs, for as long as there are jobs to be processed.; - Reserving resources for requests from other hog groups - even if we have jobs waiting to run that could be using them. Here are a few mental models which might be helpful to thinking about the hog factor:. - A hog factor of 2 means that ""2 greedy users would be able to hog the entire resources of Cromwell"" ; - A hog factor of 100 means ""any 1 group is only ever allowed to use 1/100th

A Hog Limit is how much of a given resource a hog group is allowed use.

Content: ell are a way to group together workflows that are related or associated to each other.; For example, if you ran workflows to analyze data from a diabetes study, you can assign the label `project:diabetes-cohort`. . **Custom Labels JSON**. In order to assign labels to a workflow, the first step is to create a JSON file with key-value pairs that define a label. For the example above, the labels JSON should look like:. ```; {; ""project"":""diabetes-cohort""; }; ```. When choosing key-value pairs, it's important to make sure you're adhering to Cromwell supported label syntax below. . There are two ways to add labels to a workflow: ; 1. Upon workflow submission set the `labels` parameter of the Submit endpoint, or ; 2. Setting the `-l` argument when running in [Command Line](/CommandLine) mode. Labels can be added to existing workflows by using the `/labels` patch endpoint. After adding labels to your workflows, you can take advantage of the `/query` endpoint to filter tagged workflows. The Google backend supports labelling cloud resources and you can learn more about that [here](backends/Google#google-labels). #### Label Format. When labels are supplied to Cromwell, it will fail any request containing invalid label strings. Below are the requirements for a valid label key/value pair in Cromwell:. * Label keys may not be empty but label values may be empty.; * Label key and values have a max char limit of 255. For [default labels](backends/Google#google-labels) applied by the Google backend, Cromwell will modify workflow/task/call names to fit the schema, according to the following rules:. * Any capital letters are converted to lowercase.; * Any character which is not one of `[a-z]`, `[0-9]` or `-` will be replaced with `-`.; * If the start character does not match `[a-z]` then prefix with `x--`; * If the final character does not match `[a-z0-9]` then suffix with `--x`; * If the string is too long, only take the first 30 and last 30 characters and add `---` between them.;

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: f work to do (tasks) as well as the; dependencies and code flow between them. When it comes to actually executing the specific task, Cromwell delegates that; work to a “backend”. A backend is therefore responsible for the actual execution of a single task on some underlying; computing platform, such as Google Cloud Platform, AWS, TES, Local, etc. Backends are implemented as a software layer; between the Cromwell engine and that underlying platform. The underlying platform services requests for a job to run while the backend shim provides the interface layer between; Cromwell and the platform. In general, the more sophisticated the platform the thinner the shim needs to be and vice; versa. A job from Cromwell’s perspective is a collection of the following information:. * A unix command line to run; * A mapping of where its input files currently live to where the command line expects them to be; * A mapping of where the command line will write its outputs to where they should eventually wind up; * An optional Docker image which if supplied will be the environment in which the command will be run; * A collection of arbitrary key/value pairs which can be used by the execution platform to tune the request, e.g. amount; of memory or the number of CPUs. The Docker image is not required for a backend but is highly recommended. The bioinformatics workflow field is rapidly; moving towards a Docker model so one will find better support for their backend if it is built around using Docker; containers. The input/output file mappings will depend on the needs of the platform. In the simplest example these values would be; identical, living on a shared filesystem.

Quality Attribute: Modifiability
Attribute Description: The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments. This attribute involves assessing the time, cost, and impact of changes, considering factors like coupling, cohesion, and the scope of modifications.
Content: Most users should not need to build Cromwell and can use pre-built Cromwell [releases](Getting). If for some reason you require a non-release version of Cromwell or are developing new Cromwell; features or fixes, the following are required to build Cromwell from source:. * [Scala 2.13](http://www.scala-lang.org/); * [SBT 1.x](https://www.scala-sbt.org/); * [AdoptOpenJDK 11 HotSpot](https://adoptopenjdk.net/); * [Git](https://git-scm.com/). First start by cloning the Cromwell repository from GitHub:. ```bash; $ git clone git@github.com:broadinstitute/cromwell.git; ```. Next change into the `cromwell` directory:. ```bash; $ cd cromwell; ```. If you require a specific version of Cromwell as a starting point, do the appropriate `git checkout` now. . Finally build the Cromwell jar:. ```bash; $ sbt assembly; ```. `sbt assembly` will build the runnable Cromwell JAR in `server/target/scala-2.13/` with a name like `cromwell-<VERSION>.jar`. It will also build a runnable Womtool JAR in `womtool/target/scala-2.13/` with a name like `womtool-<VERSION>.jar`. ## Docker. The following Docker build configurations are supported.

Deployability,configurat,configuration,"g additional measures to protect your Cromwell server, this can leave your Cromwell server and therefore all information stored by and accessible by your Cromwell server vulnerable to anyone who is able to access the server. For instance, an unprotected Cromwell server running against the [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google) would leave you vulnerable to outside users running workflows that will cost you money, and potentially access the data files you use within your workflows!. The simplest way to restrict access is by putting an authenticating proxy server in between users and the Cromwell server: . 1. Configure a firewall rule on the Cromwell server host to deny access to the webservice port (e.g. 8000) from all addresses except a secure proxy host. ; 2. Configure `<YourFavoriteWebProxy>` on the proxy host with `<YourFavoriteAuthMechanism>`, to proxy authenticated traffic from the world to the Cromwell server. Using Apache `httpd` web server for example with basic `htpassword` file-based authentication, the configuration might look something like:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```. Users now hit `http://my.proxy.org/cromwell` with authenticated requests, and they're forwarded to port 8000 on the Cromwell server host. . **Multiple Servers on one Host**. The above scheme extends easily to multiple Cromwell instances, for use by different groups within an organization, for example. If multiple instances are running on the same host, then each instance should be run as its own dedicated user (such as service account when using a [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google)), e.g. `cromwell1`, `cromwell2` etc so that processes running under one Cromwell instance cannot access the files of another.

Configure a firewall rule on the Cromwell server host to deny access to the webservice port (e.g. 8000) from all addresses except a secure proxy host. ; 2. Configure `<YourFavoriteWebProxy>` on the proxy host with `<YourFavoriteAuthMechanism>`, to proxy authenticated traffic from the world to the Cromwell server. Using Apache `httpd` web server for example with basic `htpassword` file-based authentication, the configuration might look something like:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```. Users now hit `http://my.proxy.org/cromwell` with authenticated requests, and they're forwarded to port 8000 on the Cromwell server host. . **Multiple Servers on one Host**. The above scheme extends easily to multiple Cromwell instances, for use by different groups within an organization, for example. If multiple instances are running on the same host, then each instance should be run as its own dedicated user (such as service account when using a [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google)), e.g. `cromwell1`, `cromwell2` etc so that processes running under one Cromwell instance cannot access the files of another.

Content: In order to run a workflow, Cromwell uses the backends available to it to create jobs and monitor them until they are complete. When no new jobs can start and all jobs have finished (Success, Failure, Aborted), the workflow terminates. In an ideal situation, all jobs succeed and the workflow succeeds.; Unfortunately things don't always go as planned. Here is what to expect from Cromwell when things go off the rails. ## Failure Modes. Cromwell supports two failure modes, which specify how Cromwell behaves when a job fails during the execution of a workflow. * `NoNewCalls` **(default)** ; 	* Cromwell does not start any new call as soon as a job fails. Cromwell will still monitor the rest of the jobs until they complete (successfully or not). ; * `ContinueWhilePossible` ; 	* Cromwell attempts to run as many jobs as possible until no more can be started. When all running jobs are complete, the workflow fails. The failure mode can be set in the [Configuration](../Configuring/) or [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview#workflow-failure). _For example:_. ![](ABdependency.png). This simple diagram represents 4 jobs:. * Job A and Job B are independent; ; * Job A1 depends on A; ; * Job B1 depends on B. Let's look at the case where A and B are both running, and for some reason B fails (shaded red). **`NoNewCalls`** ; If the failure mode is `NoNewCalls` Cromwell waits for A to complete (shaded green). Regardless of whether A is successful or not, Cromwell then fails the workflow, without starting A1 or B1 (shaded grey). ![](NNC_B_fail.png). **`ContinueWhilePossible`** ; If the failure mode is `ContinueWhilePossible` and A succeeds (green), then Cromwell starts A1 (green) and waits for it to complete. At this point all jobs that can run have completed. B1 (grey) cannot run since B failed (red), therefore Cromwell fails the workflow without starting B1. ![](CWP_B_fail.png). ### Retryable failures.

This section explains what that entails. When aborting a workflow, either through the `/abort` endpoint or by terminating the [Cromwell run process](../Modes) (if [configured](../Configuring#abort) to do so), Cromwell does the following:. 1. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborting`,; 2. Does not start any new jobs,; 3. Asks every running job to abort,; 4. Waits for all running jobs to complete,; 5. Finalizes the workflow,; 6. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborted`. The action of aborting a job is backend specific. Cromwell can only ask a backend to abort a job and wait for the backend to notify it when it is aborted. . For example, if you are running Cromwell on the Google backend and abort a job, Google will send an abort request to the Google Pipelines API. When Pipelines API indicates that the status of the job is aborted, Cromwell will mark it as such.; Remember that abort action is entirely dependent on the backend. In this particular case, Pipelines API does not guarantee the success of an abort request (see [Pipelines API documentation on abort](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/reference/rest/v1alpha2/operations/cancel)).",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,"The ease with which the system can be adapted by adding, removing, or modifying features, or adjusting to new environments.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: they are complete. When no new jobs can start and all jobs have finished (Success, Failure, Aborted), the workflow terminates. In an ideal situation, all jobs succeed and the workflow succeeds.; Unfortunately things don't always go as planned. Here is what to expect from Cromwell when things go off the rails. ## Failure Modes. Cromwell supports two failure modes, which specify how Cromwell behaves when a job fails during the execution of a workflow. * `NoNewCalls` **(default)** ; 	* Cromwell does not start any new call as soon as a job fails. Cromwell will still monitor the rest of the jobs until they complete (successfully or not). ; * `ContinueWhilePossible` ; 	* Cromwell attempts to run as many jobs as possible until no more can be started. When all running jobs are complete, the workflow fails. The failure mode can be set in the [Configuration](../Configuring/) or [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview#workflow-failure). _For example:_. ![](ABdependency.png). This simple diagram represents 4 jobs:. * Job A and Job B are independent; ; * Job A1 depends on A; ; * Job B1 depends on B. Let's look at the case where A and B are both running, and for some reason B fails (shaded red). **`NoNewCalls`** ; If the failure mode is `NoNewCalls` Cromwell waits for A to complete (shaded green). Regardless of whether A is successful or not, Cromwell then fails the workflow, without starting A1 or B1 (shaded grey). ![](NNC_B_fail.png). **`ContinueWhilePossible`** ; If the failure mode is `ContinueWhilePossible` and A succeeds (green), then Cromwell starts A1 (green) and waits for it to complete. At this point all jobs that can run have completed. B1 (grey) cannot run since B failed (red), therefore Cromwell fails the workflow without starting B1. ![](CWP_B_fail.png). ### Retryable failures. Retryable failures are **not** failures that can trigger a workflow failure. An example of a retryable failure is when a [preemptible VM](../RuntimeAttributes/#preemptible) is preempted. .

It allows the user to save intermediates of a task at regularly scheduled checkpoints. After an interruption, the task can be restarted from the last saved checkpoint, thereby avoiding having to re-run the entire computation again. ### Description. Specifying a `checkpointFile` value in a task's `runtime` section designates a checkpoint file which will periodically be; copied to cloud storage every 10 minutes. This checkpoint file will then be restored automatically on subsequent attempts if the job is interrupted. Once the final output has been successfully generated, the checkpoint file will be deleted.

Since the checkpoint file is deleted after successful completion of the task, no further charges will accrue after completion. However, if the task is aborted or otherwise stopped externally, ie through interruption of Cromwell's operation, the checkpoint file will NOT be deleted and storage charges will continue to accrue indefinitely, or until the file is deleted manually. . ### Effect on Call Caching.

Content: # The 'Checkpoint File' Optimization. ## Overview. Available in Cromwell 55 and higher. This optimization provides a way to mitigate the problem of long-running tasks getting preempted partway through execution. It allows the user to save intermediates of a task at regularly scheduled checkpoints. After an interruption, the task can be restarted from the last saved checkpoint, thereby avoiding having to re-run the entire computation again. ### Description. Specifying a `checkpointFile` value in a task's `runtime` section designates a checkpoint file which will periodically be; copied to cloud storage every 10 minutes. This checkpoint file will then be restored automatically on subsequent attempts if the job is interrupted. Once the final output has been successfully generated, the checkpoint file will be deleted. To use this feature effectively, the WDL task must be written intentionally to use the checkpoint file. See example below. . ### Effects on cloud charges. Charges will accrue from storing the checkpoint file during the running of the task, and additional charges may apply to the transfer between the VM and the cloud storage bucket depending on their locations. These costs should be minor, especially balanced against the performance and cost benefits of being able to restore from the checkpoint when a worker VM gets preempted. Since the checkpoint file is deleted after successful completion of the task, no further charges will accrue after completion. However, if the task is aborted or otherwise stopped externally, ie through interruption of Cromwell's operation, the checkpoint file will NOT be deleted and storage charges will continue to accrue indefinitely, or until the file is deleted manually. . ### Effect on Call Caching. The presence or absence of the `checkpointFile` attribute is not considered when determining whether to call cache. . ### Example. The following WDL demonstrates the use of the `checkpointFile` optimization. It has a command that is che

Google Cloud Batch is a fully managed service that lets you schedule, queue, and execute batch processing workloads on Google Cloud resources. ; Batch provisions resources and manages capacity on your behalf, allowing your batch workloads to run at scale. ### Setting up Batch. #### Permissions:. ### Prerequisites. This tutorial page relies on completing the previous tutorial:. * [Downloading Prerequisites](FiveMinuteIntro.md). ### Goals. At the end of this tutorial you'll have run your first workflow against the Google Batch API. ### Let's get started!. **Configuring a Google Project**. Install the <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads"" target=""_blank"">Google Cloud SDK</a>.; Create a <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects"" target=""_blank"">Google Cloud Project</a> and give it a project id (e.g. sample-project).

This tutorial page relies on completing the previous tutorials:. * [Five Minute Introduction](FiveMinuteIntro.md). ### Goals. At the end of this tutorial you'll have set up a configuration file for Cromwell and used it to modify Cromwell's behavior. ### Let's get started. #### Customizing Cromwell with Configuration Files. When Cromwell runs, it contains a large number of default options useful for getting started. For example, by default Cromwell doesn't require an external database while running all workflow jobs on your local machine. Soon you may want to start storing the results of your Cromwell runs in an external MySQL database. Or, you may want to run jobs on your organizations compute farm, or even run jobs in the cloud via the Pipelines API. All of these changes to the defaults will be done by setting configuration values. When you have many configuration settings you would like to set, you specify them in a custom configuration file. See the [configuration](../Configuring) page for more specific information on the configuration file, and for links to the example configuration file. #### Configuration file syntax. Cromwell configuration files are written in a syntax called HOCON. See the [HOCON documentation](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation) for more information on all the ways one can create a valid configuration file. #### Creating your first configuration file. To get started customizing Cromwell via a configuration file, create a new empty text file, say `your.conf`. Then add this include at the top:. ```hocon; include required(classpath(""application"")); ```. The default Cromwell configuration values are set via Cromwell's `application.conf`.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a popular container technology that is natively supported by Cromwell and WDL. #### Docker on a Local Backend. On a single machine (laptop or server), no extra configuration is needed to allow docker to run, provided Docker is installed. You can install Docker for Linux, Mac or Windows from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community). #### Docker on Cloud. It is strongly advised that you provide a Docker image to tasks that will run on Cloud backends, and in fact most Cloud providers require it. It might be possible to use an alternative container engine, but this is not recommended if Docker is supported. #### Docker on HPC. Docker can allow running users to gain superuser privileges, called the [Docker daemon attack surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface). In HPC and multi-user environments, Docker recommends that ""only trusted users should be allowed to control your Docker Daemon"". For this reason, this tutorial will also explore other technologies that support the reproducibility and simplicity of running a workflow that use docker containers; Singularity and udocker. ___. ### Singularity. Singularity is a container technology designed for use on HPC systems in particular, while ensuring an appropriate level of security that Docker cannot provide. #### Installation; Before you can configure Cromwell on your HPC system, you will have to install Singularity, which is documented [here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html#installation).; In order to gain access to the full set of features in Singularity, it is strongly recommended that Singularity is installed by root, with the `setuid",MatchSource.DOCS,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,"The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access.

You can install Docker for Linux, Mac or Windows from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community). #### Docker on Cloud. It is strongly advised that you provide a Docker image to tasks that will run on Cloud backends, and in fact most Cloud providers require it. It might be possible to use an alternative container engine, but this is not recommended if Docker is supported. #### Docker on HPC. Docker can allow running users to gain superuser privileges, called the [Docker daemon attack surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface). In HPC and multi-user environments, Docker recommends that ""only trusted users should be allowed to control your Docker Daemon"". For this reason, this tutorial will also explore other technologies that support the reproducibility and simplicity of running a workflow that use docker containers; Singularity and udocker. ___. ### Singularity. Singularity is a container technology designed for use on HPC systems in particular, while ensuring an appropriate level of security that Docker cannot provide. #### Installation; Before you can configure Cromwell on your HPC system, you will have to install Singularity, which is documented [here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html#installation).; In order to gain access to the full set of features in Singularity, it is strongly recommended that Singularity is installed by root, with the `setuid

Once Singularity is installed, you'll need to modify the `config` block inside `backend.providers` in your Cromwell configuration. In particular, this block contains a key called `submit-docker`, which will contain a script that is run whenever a job needs to run that uses a Docker image. If the job does not specify a Docker image, the regular `submit` block will be used. As the configuration will require more knowledge about your execution environment, see the local and job scheduler sections below for example configurations. ##### Local environments.

However, it's possible that when submitting jobs to your HPC cluster you want to specify the units in gigabytes. To specify the memory units that the submit command should use, append the units to the memory runtime attribute. For example:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Float? memory_gb; # ...; """"""; }; ```. Now, no matter what unit of memory is used within the task, the value will be converted into gigabytes before it is passed to your submit command. **custom attributes**. You can also declare other runtime attributes that a WDL task may use. For example, suppose you would like to allow the WDL to specify an sge queue in a task, like:. ```wdl; task hello {; command { echo hello }; runtime { sqe_queue: ""short"" }; }; ```. You declare your runtime attribute in your config by adding any other custom value to the `runtime-attributes` section:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """""";

Quality Attribute: Security
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.
Content: for your HPC tasks. In the config section for your backend, you can define the different [runtime attributes](../RuntimeAttributes) that your HPC tasks will support. Any runtime attribute configured here will be read from the WDL tasks, and then passed into the command line used to submit jobs to the HPC cluster. All runtime attributes must be defined in a single multi-line block. The syntax of this block is the same as defining the inputs for a WDL task. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; }; ```.

In step 1, the workflow has just started and the ExecutionStore is created in its initial; state. The Value Store doesn't track statuses and so begins empty: `{ }`. In steps 2-4, the Execution Store tracks the `single_task` job as the engine is executing it. As the Execution Store is updated to indicate task completion is step 5, the Value Store is also updated to; include the output value of the task:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello""; }; ```. By step 6, Cromwell can use the fact that the task is complete to decide that the output node is ready to be; evaluated. And the input to the output expression is available for lookup in the Value Store. In step 7, all workflow nodes have run and the workflow is complete. The Value Store is updated once again to; additionally contain the output node value:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello"",; ""string_out"": ""hello""; }; ``` .

Remember; that one day you might need to support this code!. ### Reviewing the Concept. Ask the questions:; ; - Will Cromwell be a better product with this change adopted. ; - Will it be better enough to warrant the time necessary to review the PR; - Note: The answer to this is almost always a yes if the first answer was yes; - However, overly long, opaque, or ""risky"" changes might benefit from requests to break the PR up and merge/review things in stages. ; ; ### Review the changes in the PR. - For PRs changing ""supported"" features, treat it like any other PR coming from within the team.; - Remember: we will have to support these changes in the future. Possibly forever!; - For PRs only making changes to features we don't officially support - be generous.

If you're the lucky ""Release Rotation Engineer"" this time, you should do the following four things:. 1. Create a Jira ticket for the release (look at previous release tickets if you're not sure how).; 1. Check that Cromwell's [nightly integration](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/actions?query=event%3Aschedule) testing is passing.; 1. [Run the publish script to create a new version of Cromwell](#how-to-publish-a-new-cromwell-version); 1. [Run through the ""How to Deploy Cromwell in CaaS prod"" process](#how-to-deploy-cromwell-in-caas-staging-and-caas-prod). ### How to publish a new Cromwell version. #### Announce your intentions. Post a message in `#dsp-workflows-private` letting people know that a publish is imminent in case there are PRs they want to get; wrapped up and merged to `develop` to go out in the forthcoming version of Cromwell. #### Get a Github token.
