Content: **SU2 version 7.2.0** introduces exciting new features and improvements (it differs from 7.1.1 by almost **1000 commits!**); We made a pause from the monthly maintenance-release cycle to integrate those features as best as possible, they include:; - Unsteady discrete adjoints for multizone problems (e.g. FSI and CHT).; - Hybrid parallelization (MPI + OpenMP) of discrete adjoint solvers.; - New boundary conditions and important corrections to RANS wall functions and transition models.; - Usability improvements, such as speeding up the NEMO preprocessing for large problems, restarting from results on non-matching grids, suggestions for incorrect config options, etc.; - Numerous fixes based on feedback from the SU2 community.; ; As with 7.1.0, we used this version to deprecate some more options leftover from 7.0.0, and to revise others in preparation for new features to come. ## :rocket: Features. - NEMO - Improvements on the Preprocessing phase and inclusion of Chapmann-Enskog for Mutation++ @fmpmorgado (#1343); - Hybrid Parallel AD (Part 3/?) @jblueh (#1294); - Heat Transfer boundary condition @oleburghardt (#1226); - Feature libROM for reduced-order modeling @jtlau (#1310); - Fix SA and SST wall functions @bigfooted (#1204); - CFVMOutput & Streamwise+spanwise periodic @TobiKattmann (#1290); - Hybrid Parallel AD (Part 2/?) @pcarruscag (#1284); - Discrete adjoint for dynamic FSI using multizone driver @cvencro (#1260); - Interpolate restart file when it does not match the mesh @pcarruscag (#1277); - ""Did you mean...?"" (make config errors more helpful) @pcarruscag (#1269); - Multigrid output @pcarruscag (#1266); - Fix dissipation in transition model and update inlet profile (initial profile from config) @bigfooted (#1268); - Hybrid Parallel AD (Part 1/?) @jblueh (#1214); - Linear solver changes to support hybrid parallel AD @pcarruscag (#1228); - Fixed values for turbulence quantities in upstream half-plane @maxaehle (#1236); - Velocity transfer at fluid-structure inter
