Type: array; Default: No Default. GDMA_MULTIPOLE_UNITS¶. Whether to print DMA results in atomic units or SI. Type: string; Possible Values: AU; Default: AU SI. GDMA_RADIUS¶. The radii to be used, overriding the defaults. Specified as an array [ n1, r1, n2, r2, … ] where n1,n2,n3… are atom type strings and r1,r2,r3 are radii in Angstrom. Type: array; Default: No Default. GDMA_SWITCH¶. The value to switch between the older standard DMA and the new grid-based approach. Pairs of primitives whose exponents sum is above this value will be treated using standard DMA. Set to 0 to force all pairs to be treated with standard DMA. Type: double; Default: 4.0. How to configure gdma for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, GDMA is a library that provides additional; quantum chemical capabilities (multipole analysis).; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) gdma; Upstream Dependencies — gdma \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran. CMake Variables. ENABLE_gdma — CMake variable toggling whether Psi4 builds with gdma; CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For gdma, set to an installation directory containing include/GDMA/GDMA_MANGLE.h; gdma_DIR — CMake variable to specify where pre-built gdma can be found. Set to installation directory containing share/cmake/gdma/gdmaConfig.cmake; CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_gdma — CMake variable to force internal build of gdma instead of detecting pre-built; CMAKE_INSIST_FIND_PACKAGE_gdma — CMake variable to force detecting pre-built gdma and not falling back on internal build. Examples. Build bundled. >>> cmake -DENABLE_gdma=ON. Build without gdma. >>> cmake. Link agai

Overview¶; PSI4 provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods using; state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms. Several parts of; the code feature shared-memory parallelization to run efficiently on; multi-core machines (see Sec. Threading).; An advanced parser written in Python allows the user; input to have a very simple style for routine computations, but it can also; automate very complex tasks with ease.; PSI4 is, in many ways, a whole new package compared to Psi3.; While some libraries and modules remain the same, the majority of the code has; been rewritten from scratch based on a powerful set of new libraries written; in C++. A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available.

A totally new Python front-end makes PSI4 incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in PSI4, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; PSI4, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; PSI4 also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Orbital-optimized versions of; perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods, and their analytic gradients,; have also been added. Through external libraries, PSI4 gains access to implicit; solvent (PCM) capabilities, density-matrix renormalization group CI, effective; fragment potentials, Grimme dispersion corrections, and high-order; coupled-cluster theory.; In this section, we provide an overview of some of the features of; PSI4 along with the prerequisite steps for running calculations.; Sec. Tutorial provides a brief tutorial to help new users; get started. Section Psithon offers further details into the; structure of PSI4 inp

Quality Attribute: Performance
Attribute Description: The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively. Performance focuses on reducing blocked time from resource contention and optimizing resource utilization under varying load conditions.
Content: licity specifications are encoded in the fragment file; and so are not read from input.; Any combination of EFP and QM fragments can be placed in a molecule; even; the oddity below is legitimate. Note that symmetry and reorientation are; automatically turned off when EFP fragments are present (symmetry c1; and no_com and no_reorient are implied).; molecule qmefp {; efp nh3 0.0 0.0 5.0 5 2 8; --; C 0.0 0.0 0.0; O 0.0 1.5 0.0; O 0.0 -1.5 0.0; --; efp h2o 5.0 0.0 0.0 5 2 8; --; He -3.0 4.0 4.0; He -4.0 5.0 4.0; --; efp ch3oh; 1.275 -2.447 -4.673; 0.709 -3.191 -3.592; 2.213 -1.978 -4.343; }. Running EFP¶; EFP can be invoked in similar fashion as other theories provided in PSI4.; For example, if you want to obtain the EFP interaction energy for benzene and two waters,; simply provide the following:; molecule {; efp c6h6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; --; efp h2o 4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; --; efp h2o -4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; }. energy('efp'). This computation involves purely EFP/EFP fragment interactions and is; performed entirely by the LIBEFP library. PSI4 can also handle mixed; systems of quantum mechanical (QM) and EFP fragments through the native; SCF code augmented by calls to the LIBEFP library. For; example, turning one of the waters in the example above into a QM; fragment is shown below.; molecule {; efp c6h6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; --; O 4.0 0.0 0.0; H 4.7 0.7 0.0; H 3.3 -0.7 0.0; --; efp h2o -4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; }. set basis 6-31g; energy('scf'). Whenever an EFP fragment is present in the active molecule, the SCF energy; will include EFP contributions. Warning; Although the EFP geometry is specified alongside the QM; geometry in a molecule name {...} block, internally the handling; of EFP is not so clean. In straightforward input files that involve; any number of [molecule block, energy/opt/etc, clean()] portions,; there should be no problem; the energy/opt computation will always; be run on the molecule defined in the preceding block.

Quality Attribute: Safety
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to avoid states that could lead to harm or damage. Safety encompasses detection and handling of errors (e.g., omissions, timing, incorrect values) to prevent hazardous outcomes or mitigate potential damage.
Content:  field. This matches the current setting in conda_build_config.yaml; For prereleases, ""channel_tag"": ""/label/dev"", while for (post)releases, it should be the empty string; Leave this file set to a “rc” with Git, as that has more details. For (post)releases (not prereleases), copy cookiecutter.json to cookiecutter.json-vXXX; Edit cookiecutter/{{.../construct.yaml for templating. This is rarely needed; If it’s been a while or you need the space, clear out ~/.conda/constructor, where the downloaded packages are cached; Note that installers get written to build/ and this gets regenerated each time. Clear out between runs.; python run.py; [Outdated] Watch out for py_ in buildstring as this means a noarch package has been pulled. It must be eliminated. Constructors can’t handle “noarch” packages and will fail at runtime. If see a “noarch” package, must find the recipe and rebuild for all OS & Python combinations. Then run constructor again.; [Replacement] After adding a post_install to reposition the noarch packages, they are safe to include.; If fetching times out, may have to run run.py several times.

Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: rill, and Matthew L. Leininger; Section author: Daniel G. A. Smith and C. David Sherrill; Module: Keywords, PSI Variables, DETCI; As the cost of Full CI scales exponentially with respect to the number of; active orbitals it is often advantageous to neglect orbitals that do not; exhibit strong correlation. These orbitals are variationally optimized; simultaneously with the CI coefficients and known as Multi-Configurational; Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF). The most commonly used MCSCF procedure is the; complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) approach [Roos:1980],; which includes all possible determinants (with the proper symmetry) that can be; formed by distributing a set of active electrons among a set of active; orbitals. The MCSCF module performs CASSCF optimization of molecular orbitals; via a two-step procedure in which the CI coefficients and orbitals are; optimized in an alternating manner. The program uses a fairly simple; approximate orbital Hessian [Chaban:1997:88] and a Newton-Raphson update,; accelerated by Pulay’s DIIS procedure [Pulay:1980]. We have also implemented; the RASSCF method [Malmqvist:1990:RASSCF], which is another kind of MCSCF; which is typically less complete (and less expensive) than CASSCF.; Inactive orbitals in the MCSCF may be specified by the; RESTRICTED_DOCC and RESTRICTED_UOCC keywords. These; orbitals will remain doubly-occupied or doubly-unoccupied, respectively, in the; MCSCF wavefunction. However, the form of these orbitals will be optimized in; the MCSCF procedure. It is also possible to literally freeze inactive orbitals; in their original (SCF) form using the FROZEN_DOCC and; FROZEN_UOCC keywords. This is not normally what one wishes to do in; an MCSCF computation (e.g., it complicates the computation of gradients), but; it can make the computations faster and is helpful in some circumstances where; unphysical mixing of inactive and active occupied orbitals might occur.; Presently, it is not possible to mix the use

Availability,error,errors,"onality can be found here. In addition,; numerous example of hybrid NumPy and Psi4 can be found at the Psi4Numpy; project. Currently only the Matrix; and Vector objects support NumPy interfacing. Let us begin with a simple; conversion from these objects to a NumPy array:; >>> import psi4; >>> import numpy as np. # Build the Psi4 data objects; >>> mat = psi4.core.Matrix(3, 3); >>> vec = psi4.core.Vector(3). # Convert to a NumPy array; >>> numpy_mat = np.array(mat); >>> numpy_vec = np.array(vec). Here the data is copied into new NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays can be converted; back to PSI4 objects using the from_array interface:; >>> new_mat = psi4.core.Matrix.from_array(mat); >>> new_vec = psi4.core.Vector.from_array(vec). NumPy Views¶; Copying the data between NumPy and Psi4 objects can lead to excessive data; movement and convoluted code. Here we introduce the idea of “Views” where the; same data can be viewed by multiple objects. However, this can lead to very; subtle errors if used incorrectly and care needs to be taken when using these; views. Views can be created in two ways:; >>> numpy_mat_view = np.asarray(mat). # Access the NumPy object and set all values to 1 through broadcasting; >>> numpy_mat_view[:] = 1. >>> print(np.array(mat)); [[ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]]. Secondly, these objects have a .np attribute for easy access to the underlying data:; >>> mat.np[:] = 1. this operation is identical to the above. PSI4 Data Objects with Irreps¶; PSI4 data objects natively support multiple irreducible representations; which is quite useful for Quantum Chemistry. However, this is not fundamental; to NumPy and some work around are required to natively support these; operations. Take the following irreped Matrix:; >>> dim = psi4.core.Dimension.from_list([1, 2, 3]); >>> irreped_mat = psi4.core.Matrix(""New Matrix"", dim, dim). # Create a list of Psi4 arrays; >>> list_of_arrays = irreped_mat.to_array(). # Or, use the .nph irreped accessor; >>> irreped_mat.nph[0][:] ",MatchSource.WIKI,psi4manual/1.5.0/numpy-1.html,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://psicode.org,https://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.5.0/numpy-1.html,"The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery.

Content: onality can be found here. In addition,; numerous example of hybrid NumPy and Psi4 can be found at the Psi4Numpy; project. Currently only the Matrix; and Vector objects support NumPy interfacing. Let us begin with a simple; conversion from these objects to a NumPy array:; >>> import psi4; >>> import numpy as np. # Build the Psi4 data objects; >>> mat = psi4.core.Matrix(3, 3); >>> vec = psi4.core.Vector(3). # Convert to a NumPy array; >>> numpy_mat = np.array(mat); >>> numpy_vec = np.array(vec). Here the data is copied into new NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays can be converted; back to PSI4 objects using the from_array interface:; >>> new_mat = psi4.core.Matrix.from_array(mat); >>> new_vec = psi4.core.Vector.from_array(vec). NumPy Views¶; Copying the data between NumPy and Psi4 objects can lead to excessive data; movement and convoluted code. Here we introduce the idea of “Views” where the; same data can be viewed by multiple objects. However, this can lead to very; subtle errors if used incorrectly and care needs to be taken when using these; views. Views can be created in two ways:; >>> numpy_mat_view = np.asarray(mat). # Access the NumPy object and set all values to 1 through broadcasting; >>> numpy_mat_view[:] = 1. >>> print(np.array(mat)); [[ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]]. Secondly, these objects have a .np attribute for easy access to the underlying data:; >>> mat.np[:] = 1. this operation is identical to the above. PSI4 Data Objects with Irreps¶; PSI4 data objects natively support multiple irreducible representations; which is quite useful for Quantum Chemistry. However, this is not fundamental; to NumPy and some work around are required to natively support these; operations. Take the following irreped Matrix:; >>> dim = psi4.core.Dimension.from_list([1, 2, 3]); >>> irreped_mat = psi4.core.Matrix(""New Matrix"", dim, dim). # Create a list of Psi4 arrays; >>> list_of_arrays = irreped_mat.to_array(). # Or, use the .nph irreped accessor; >>> irreped_mat.nph[0][:]

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: onality can be found here. In addition,; numerous example of hybrid NumPy and Psi4 can be found at the Psi4Numpy; project. Currently only the Matrix; and Vector objects support NumPy interfacing. Let us begin with a simple; conversion from these objects to a NumPy array:; >>> import psi4; >>> import numpy as np. # Build the Psi4 data objects; >>> mat = psi4.core.Matrix(3, 3); >>> vec = psi4.core.Vector(3). # Convert to a NumPy array; >>> numpy_mat = np.array(mat); >>> numpy_vec = np.array(vec). Here the data is copied into new NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays can be converted; back to PSI4 objects using the from_array interface:; >>> new_mat = psi4.core.Matrix.from_array(mat); >>> new_vec = psi4.core.Vector.from_array(vec). NumPy Views¶; Copying the data between NumPy and Psi4 objects can lead to excessive data; movement and convoluted code. Here we introduce the idea of “Views” where the; same data can be viewed by multiple objects. However, this can lead to very; subtle errors if used incorrectly and care needs to be taken when using these; views. Views can be created in two ways:; >>> numpy_mat_view = np.asarray(mat). # Access the NumPy object and set all values to 1 through broadcasting; >>> numpy_mat_view[:] = 1. >>> print(np.array(mat)); [[ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]; [ 1. 1. 1.]]. Secondly, these objects have a .np attribute for easy access to the underlying data:; >>> mat.np[:] = 1. this operation is identical to the above. PSI4 Data Objects with Irreps¶; PSI4 data objects natively support multiple irreducible representations; which is quite useful for Quantum Chemistry. However, this is not fundamental; to NumPy and some work around are required to natively support these; operations. Take the following irreped Matrix:; >>> dim = psi4.core.Dimension.from_list([1, 2, 3]); >>> irreped_mat = psi4.core.Matrix(""New Matrix"", dim, dim). # Create a list of Psi4 arrays; >>> list_of_arrays = irreped_mat.to_array(). # Or, use the .nph irreped accessor; >>> irreped_mat.nph[0][:]

Introduction¶; Orbital-optimized methods have several advantages over their non-optimized counterparts.; Once the orbitals are optimized, the wave function will obey the Hellmann–Feynman theorem; for orbital rotation parameters. Therefore, there is no need for orbital response terms; in the evaluation of analytic gradients. In other words, it is unnecessary to solve the; first order coupled-perturbed CC and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) equations.; Further, computation of one-electron properties is easier because there are no response contributions to the particle; density matrices (PDMs). Moreover, active space approximations can be readily incorporated into the CC methods; [Krylov:2000:vod]. Additionally, orbital-optimized coupled-cluster avoids spurious second-order; poles in its response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge invariant [Pedersen:1999:od].; Another advantage is that the orbital-optimized methods do not suffer from artifactual symmetry-breaking; instabilities [Crawford:1997:instability], [Sherrill:1998:od], [Bozkaya:2011:omp2], and [Bozkaya:2011:omp3].; Furthermore, Kurlancheek and Head-Gordon [Kurlancek:2009] demonstrated that first order properties such as; forces or dipole moments are discontinuous along nuclear coordinates when such a symmetry breaking occurs.; They also observed that although the energy appears well behaved, the MP2 method can have natural occupation; numbers greater than 2 or less than 0, hence may violate the N-representability condition. They further; discussed that the orbital response equations generally have a singularity problem at the unrestriction point; where spin-restricted orbitals become unstable to unrestriction. This singularity yields to extremely large or; small eigenvalues of the one-particl

The requested properties will be; written out in the same order as the grid point specification in grid.dat; see; the above table for the format and file name of the output.; The grid may be generated in the input file using standard Python loops. By; capturing the wavefunction used to evaluate the one-electron properties, the; values at each grid point may be captured as Python arrays in the input file:; E, wfn = prop('scf', properties=[""GRID_ESP"", ""GRID_FIELD""], return_wfn=True); Vvals = wfn.oeprop.Vvals(); Exvals = wfn.oeprop.Exvals(); Eyvals = wfn.oeprop.Eyvals(); Ezvals = wfn.oeprop.Ezvals(). In this example, the Vvals array contains the electrostatic potential at each; grid point, in the order that the grid was specified, while the Exvals,; Eyvals and Ezvals arrays contain the x, y and z components of the; electric field, respectively; all of these arrays can be iterated and; manipulated using standard Python syntax. For a complete demonstration of this; utility, see the props4 test case. Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder¶; The Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) method is one of many procedures; that partitions a molecular one-particle density matrix into atomic electron densities.; Running MBIS in PSI4 will calculate atomic valence charge widths, volume ratios,; atomic charges, as well as dipoles, quadrupoles, and octupoles.; Additionally, all expectation values of radial moments of n-th order (\(<r^n>\)); are computed up to fourth order. Higher moments can be computed by specifying MAX_RADIAL_MOMENT.; The volume ratios are computed as the ratio between the volume of the atomic density; (\(<r^3>\)) and the volume of the free atom computed using the same level; of theory, but with a potentially unrestricted reference.; The allowed number of iterations and convergence criteria for the stockholder; algorithm is controlled by MBIS_MAXITER and MBIS_D_CONVERGENCE.

Programming with the Core Libraries; LibOptions: globals, locals, has_changed and all that. LibOptions: globals, locals, has_changed and all that¶; To simplify parsing of options and handling of defaults, the Options class; was created. It functions in the following way:. Each module (or plugin) declares which options it will look for in the; input: their name, type (string, int, double, array, etc.), and any; default value they take.; The input is parsed for these options, and defaults are assigned for; those keywords not specified by the user.; The c-side module or plugin can then query the Options object for the; values associated with each keyword.; The options will also be accessible py-side to the procedures that drive; the modules.

Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: ted. Optimize a geometry using default methods (RFO step):; optimize('scf'). Optimize using Newton-Raphson steps instead of RFO steps:; set step_type nr; optimize('scf'). Optimize using energy points instead of gradients:; optimize('scf', dertype='energy'). Optimize while limiting the initial step size to 0.1 au:; set intrafrag_step_limit 0.1; optimize('scf'). Optimize while always limiting the step size to 0.1 au:. set {; intrafrag_step_limit 0.1; intrafrag_step_limit_min 0.1; intrafrag_step_limit_max 0.1; }. optimize('scf'). Optimize while calculating the Hessian at every step:. set full_hess_every 1; optimize('scf'). Hessian¶; If Cartesian second derivatives are available, optking can read them; and transform them into internal coordinates to make an initial Hessian in; internal coordinates. Otherwise, several empirical Hessians are available,; including those of Schlegel [Schlegel:1984:333] and Fischer and Almlof; [Fischer:1992:9770].; Either of these or a simple diagonal Hessian may be selected using the; INTRAFRAG_HESS keyword.; All the common Hessian update schemes are available. For formulas, see; Schlegel [Schlegel:1987:AIMQC] and Bofill [Bofill:1994:1].; The Hessian may be computed during an optimization using the; FULL_HESS_EVERY keyword. Transition States, Reaction Paths, and Constrained Optimizations¶. Calculate a starting Hessian and optimize the “transition state” of; linear water (note that without a reasonable starting geometry and; Hessian, such a straightforward search often fails):; molecule h2o {; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 160.0; }. set {; basis dz; full_hess_every 0; opt_type ts; }. optimize('scf'). At a transition state (planar HOOH), compute the second derivative, and; then follow the intrinsic reaction path to the minimum:; molecule hooh {; symmetry c1; H; O 1 0.946347; O 2 1.397780 1 107.243777; H 3 0.946347 2 107.243777 1 0.0; }. set {; basis dzp; opt_type irc; geom_maxiter 50; }. frequencies('scf'); optimize('scf').

How to configure PCMSolver for building Psi4¶; Role and Dependencies. Role — In PSI4, PCMSolver is a library that provides additional; quantum chemical capabilities (solvation modeling).; Downstream Dependencies — PSI4 (\(\Leftarrow\) optional) PCMSolver; Upstream Dependencies — PCMSolver \(\Leftarrow\) Fortran, zlib. CMake Variables. ENABLE_PCMSolver — CMake variable toggling whether Psi4 builds with PCMSolver; CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH — CMake list variable to specify where pre-built dependencies can be found. For PCMSolver, set to an installation directory containing include/PCMSolver/pcms

Psi4FockCI: A General Fock-Space CI For Spin-Flip And IP/EA¶; Code author: Shannon E. Houck; Section author: Shannon E. Houck. This plugin is an implementation of the RAS-nSF-IP/EA approach detailed; in the paper by Houck et. al. [Houck:2019:2278].; This approach handles systems with both spin and spatial degeneracies; by combining the spin-flip (SF) [Krylov:2001:522]; and ionization potential/electron affinity (IP/EA) [Nooijen:1995:3629]; approaches.; The Psi4FockCI plugin allows one to perform spin-flip (SF), ionization; potential (IP), and electron affinity (EA) calculations, as well as; combined RAS-SF-IP/EA calculations, through the DETCI (CI: Configuration Interaction) module. Installation¶. Download the plugin from the GitHub repository:; >>> git clone https://github.com/shannonhouck/psi4fockci.git. Once downloaded, the plugin can be installed as follows:; >>> cd {top-level-psi4fockci-directory}; >>> python -m pip install . Sample Input¶; To run a CAS-nSF-IP/EA calculation, start with a molecule with the; correct charge and multiplicity for the reference state (i.e. some; state well-represented by a single reference). Then, run an energy; calculation, passing in the charge and multiplicity of the; desired state; the number of spin-flips and IP/EA will be automatically; determined based on this input. If additional excitations outside of the; RAS II space are desired, one can set the level of external; excitations using the conf_space keyword.; A sample input file for a RAS(h)-2SF-IP calculation is shown below:; molecule {; 0 7; N 0.0 0.0 0.0; N 0.0 0.0 1.3; symmetry c1; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. energy('psi4fockci', new_charge=1, new_multiplicity=1, conf_space=""h""). Note that for calculations involving IP/EA, inclusion of hole (for IP) and; particle (for EA) excitations is strongly recommended.

An example of the former problem is a Cholesky; Decomposition: you expect to get back a lower triangular matrix L such; that L L^T = A, but this is returned in column-major order, so the actual; recovery of the matrix A with the row-major BLAS wrappers effectively; involves L^T L = A. On of the biggest consequences is in linear equations:; The input/output forcing/solution vector must be explicitly formed in; column-major indexing (each vector is placed in a C++ row, with its; entries along the C++ column). This is visualized in C++ as the transpose; of the forcing/solution vector. All routines are declared in qt.h. Each; routine is prefixed with a C_, followed by the standard Fortran name of; the routine, in capital letters. Input parameters of single primitives; (int, double, unsigned long int, char, …) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous memory; (as provided by block_matrix, for example), and are passed by providing a; pointer to the first double or int element of the data (this is array[0]; if array is double**). All routines return an int INFO with error and;
