Content: sually just a single jar file); * Changes to the core can cause compatibility complications; * It's usually easiest to create a new extension by modifying an existing one; * See https://github.com/qupath for examples (with `qupath-extension` in the repo name); * Pay attention to any [licensing considerations for your extension](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLAndPlugins). ## Coding in QuPath. ### Versioning. * QuPath uses semantic versioning, but hasn't yet reached 1.x.x; * See https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/intro/versions.html; * The API shouldn't change significantly for any 0.x.X release; * API changes are permitted for 0.X.x releases; * But be cautious! Changes frequently break scripts... and thereby annoy users; * It's preferable to break a script completely rather than subtly change its behavior (since no results flag a problem, while wrong results can slip through unnoticed). ### Code style. * The best guide is usually to ensure new code looks much like the existing code; * Use standard Java conventions, e.g. `CamelCase` with a capital letter at the start of a class name and small letter for variable or method; * [checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org) is used to enforce some style rules; * These are currently fairly minimal... but might increase over time; * The 'correct' [modifier order](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_modifier.html#ModifierOrder) should be used; * Test source files should be named with `Test` at the beginning, e.g. `TestSomeClass.java`; * Aim to make the API stable and maintainable; * Add `public` and `protected` methods and fields with caution - prefer `private` where possible; * Always use `@override` when overriding a method; * Use full import lists at the top of each class, not starred imports for all classes in a package. ### Javadoc. * Docs are currently at https://qupath.github.io/javadoc/docs/; * This currently includes all QuPath jars together for ease of search & cross-referencing; * When QuPat
